Pertinent Results:
OSH Studies:
.
[**2103-2-5**] Chest CT:
1. RUL mass extending from the hilum to the chest wall, most
likely malignancy, malignant LAD with poss postobstructive PNA
2. Peripheral ill-defined nodules likely due to metastatic
disease, but could potentially be granulomatous/infecious.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Prior L pneumonectomy. Loculated L pleural effusion. Left
sided calcific pleural thickening.
5. Hypodense lesion in the liver maybe due to metastatic
disease. Small intra-abdominal paraaortic nodule of
indeterminate signifance.
.
[**2-5**] CT abd/pelvis: No urolithiasis or obstructive uropathy. L
renal cyst.

.
[**2103-2-8**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: No sign of an enhancing intracranial mass to
indicate the presence of a parechymal metastatic disease.
.
[**2103-2-9**] Biopsy Pathology: Combined invasive carcinoma with a
squamous component and an undifferentiated component with marked
cell size variation. Immunohistochemical studies have been
performed.  The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin
cocktail (squamous component greater than undifferentiated
component) and synaptophysin (undifferentiated component) and
negative for LCA and chromogranin.  TTF-1 is equivocal.  The
synaptophysin positivity suggests the presence of neuroendocrine
differentiation within the tumor. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the tumor is compatible with a lung primary.
.
[**2103-2-17**] CXR: New right upper lobe opacity which likely
represents pneumonia. A followup after clinical resolution is
recommended as this could be post-obstructive in nature.
.
[**2103-2-17**] Head CT: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
significant change allowing for differences in technique.

Brief Hospital Course:
67y/o M with h/o NSCLC s/p L pneumonectomy, admitted for workup
and treatment of a fnew right lung mass.
.
# Lung cancer - The patient was found to have a new right lung
mass, which was revealed to have small cell and non small cell
features on pathology.  The patient underwent a bronchoscopy by
interventional pulmonology to obtain the tissue diagnosis.  A
bone scan revealed diffuse osseous mets.  MRI was negative for
brain mets.  Chemotherapy (etoposide and carboplatin) was
initiated during this hospital course.  Neupogen was started 24h
after chemotherapy.  Further treatment is to be determined by
the patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], on followup as an
outpatient.
.
# mental status changes/hypotension - The patient had an episode
of acute mental status changes, unresponsiveness, and
hypotension which was likely multifactorial in etiology.  It was
likely partly due to medications (narcotic pain medications
among them) as well as a possible contribution of infection
(pneumonia as described below). There was no intracranial
hemorrhage by CT scan, no brain mets by recent MRI. Electrolytes
were within normal limits. The patient was found to be
hypercarbic, though it was difficult to say whether this is a
cause or result of MS changes. He was alert and oriented shortly
after arrival in the ICU.  Some of his pain medications were
then discontinued, and narcotics were used with caution for his
pain.  His antihypertensives were initally held, then restarted
once his blood pressure recovered.
.
# Hypercarbic resp failure: The patient had an elevated CO2 on
blood gas in association with the altered mental status and
hypotension described above.  This was likely secondary to
medication effect, with the respiratory failure being secondary
to sedation.  This improved as the patient became more awake.
.
# Pneumonia - The patient had a new RUL infiltrate on chest
xray, likely a postobstructive vs. aspiration pneumonia.  As he
was also hypotensive at the time (see above) vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and flagyl were all started.  Vanco was then
discontinued, and treatment with levo/flagyl was continued, with
a planned course of 10 days.
.
# abdominal pain - The patient presented with abdominal pain of
unclear etiology, and had a negative CT abd/pelvis at an outside
hospital. Possible etiologies included metastatic disease,
hypercalcemia, constipation, or a combination of these.  He was
given bowel regimen for constipation, treatment for
hypercalcemia as below, and pain medications.  He ultimately had
good control of his pain, as well as resolution of his
constipation.
.
# hypercalcemia - Calcium was 11.2 on admission, likely related
to the patient's malignancy.  This improved somewhat with
hydration and lasix, but remained above normal.  The patient
received a dose of pamidronate on [**2103-2-9**], after which the
calcium level remained normal.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit drifted downward slowly, and reached a
nadir of [**2109-3-1**] (this in the setting of IV
hydration). Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease (ferritin >[**2097**]). Stools were guaiac negative.  Some of
the decrease in hematocrit may also have been related to
chemotherapy.  The patient received a total of 3 units of PRBC
during the hospital course, after which his hct remained stable.

.
# DM: We continued metformin per home regimen, but discontinued
glipizide when blood glucose levels became too low.  We checked
QID fingersticks and covered with insulin sliding scale.  The
patient was on [**First Name
