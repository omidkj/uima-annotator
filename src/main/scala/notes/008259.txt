Cortisone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia and hypoxia from outside hospital

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 year old woman with sub acute pulmonary process who
was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with hypoxia and Afib with
RVR.  She presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-13**] with 2 weeks of cough and
hemoptysis but subtherapeutic on coumadin. Chest x-rays showed
bilateral upper lobe opacities and despite being afebrile she
was started on ceftr/azithro then transitioned to levo/oxac for
presummed pna. She had no improvement and on [**5-22**] underwent
VATS. She was seen by ID at [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-24**] who felt this was
less likely an infectious process. ABG was 7.28/69/84/32 94% on
4LNC.
.
VATS on [**5-22**] at [**Hospital1 **] showed pan-pneumonia and acute
fibroblasts, likely diagnosis of BOOP. Per medical reports and
family patient has had subacute respiratory process since
1/[**2175**]. She had progressive DOE with decrease in functional
status at home. On all accounts she denied accompanying symptoms
such as cough, fever, chills. She was hospitalized on [**4-12**] at
[**Hospital1 **] with transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-5-25**] for afib with RVR, but
was also treated with cef/azithro/prednisone without improvement
during her [**Hospital1 **] course. At [**Hospital1 **] pt had a high res chest CT which
showed nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and bilateral
ground-glass opacities in the dependent portions. She was not
discharged on Coumadin as both patient and family refused.

CXR [**5-25**]
- Airspace disease in right upper lobe consistent with
consolidation.
- Diffuse increase in interstitial lung markings, which may be
due to
underlying fibrotic change
- Left retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis/
consolidation.
.
Chest CT [**2176-5-25**]
Increase over 5 weeks in multifocal pulmonary consolidation and
peribronchial infiltration, upper lobe predominance, bilateral
pleural effusion and mediastinal adenopathy. Simple explanations
such as severe atypical pneumonia and congestive heart failure
can account for all findings, but given the history of
progressive respiratory compromise over six months, more unusual
such conditions such as DIP, COP, and CEP and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma should be entertained.
.
VATS pathology from OSH [**5-22**]:
Active interstitial fibrosing process, occuring in background of
mild-mod chronic inflammation and patchy areas of organizing
intra-alveolar material s/of hyaline membranes. c/w
acute/subacute organizing interstitial fibrosing pneumonitis. no
granulomas/giant cells. AFB and fungal neg. no malignancy.
.
CT Head [**2176-5-25**]
No acute IC hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  79 F with subacute respiratory process
since [**11/2175**] with progressive DOE and hypoxia.
.
# BOOP: Patient had hypoxia to 70s at OSH. VATS done with
acute/subacute pneumonitis. Patient has a distant but
significant smoking history and was on COPD regimen at home,
PFTs obstructive without vasodilator response. ABG shows
subacute/chronic co2 retention based on pH. ANCA, ACE, IGE
negative. [**Doctor First Name **] + at 1:80 and 1:40 diffuse. ESR and CRP elevated.
Patient has had several courses of both abx and steroids in the
last few months with no improvement. Not likely CAP, less likely
OI from steroids (aspergil, PCP). Patient with mostly negative
panel from prior (except [**Doctor First Name **] and ESR).  She was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**5-25**]. In the MICU, she was on venturi mask and
was intially on IV steroids then transitioned to PO steroids.
Her hypoxemia improved marginally. She was transferred to the
floor for further work up and management.  Review of the OSH
pathology slides with [**Hospital1 18**] pathologists lead to the new
diagnosis of BOOP.  It is unclear if anything triggered this
process (infection or drug effect).  She was continued on high
dose (Prednisone 60 mg daily) steroids and will be discharged on
this dose.  Pulmonary followed her here and will see her for
outpatient followup.  Also seen on review of the pathology
slides were microthrombi within the pulmonary vasculature.
Extensive discussion was had with the patient and her family
regarding this feature of the pathology regarding restart of
Coumadin, which was recommended given her AFib and this new
information.  At this time the patient and family do not wish
her to be on Coumadin at this time.  The risks and benefits of
Coumadin therapy were discussed and the family felt that the
risks outweighed the benefits at this time.  While on the floor,
pt had episodes of desaturation to the 60-70's which responded
to nebs and oxygen.
.
# Afib: She was rate control with diltiazem drip in the MICU;
following transfer to the floor oral diltiazem was progressively
increased for improved rate control.  Her heart rate was in the
90's - 110 range.  Anticoagulation with Coumadin was initially
held in light of hemoptysis; see above for further discussion of
Coumadin use in this patient.  Pt is currently rate controlled
on Diltiazem and low dose metoprolol.
.
# Anxiety: Patient on prn xanax at home.  This was initially
held for concerns of altered mental status.  She was restarted
on a PRN basis as she improved.
.
# Steroid therapy: She was placed on an insulin sliding scale
with reasonable control of glucose.  A small dose of glargine
insulin was also added.  The patient has no history of DM.
Also, given high dose steroids, she was placed on a PPI, calcium
and vitamin D, and Bactrim three times weekly for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
#Hyperkalemia:  likely nutritional, potassium has been high, has
been getting kayexalate.  Potassium was trending down during
discharge.  Continue Kayexalate at rehab until level is 4.5,
continue to check potassium daily.  Nutrition recommeded low
