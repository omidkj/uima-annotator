Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stress MIBI [**2100-11-23**]:
1. Predominantly fixed perfusion defect in the LAD territory.
2. Global hypokinesis, apical akinesis. LVEF 32%.


History of Present Illness:
62 y/o woman with known coronary disease s/p PCI in [**2088**] @ [**Hospital1 2025**],
chronic renal failure [**3-6**] congenital ureteral implantation
problem, also with antipphospholipid antibody syndrome, on
coumadin, transfered to the CCU after presenting to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain.
.
She reports waking up from sleep with a "hot cramp" in her upper
back and neck, which radiated to her chest. This pain was
similar to pain she had with a previous heart attack. She went
downstairs and took a nitroglycerine tablet, which did not
relieve her pain. The pain radiated down her arm and jaw and she
came to the ED @ [**Hospital3 **].
.
Her vital signs on presentation were 133/67 HR:96  rr:20 and
sating 99% on 2LNC. Her EKG showed sinus @ 70BPM, nl axis, nl
intervals, ST elevation in V3 and inverted T-waves throughout
the precordium. She was chest pain free soon after arriving to
the [**Hospital3 **] ED with what appears to be administration of IV
ativan only. Initial labs showed troponin I of 0.04 to 0.94, CK
903 to 103, CK-MB 4.5 to 12.2. This is what prompted her
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Of note, she has been under extreme stress. Her house burned
down 3 months ago, and she has been living in a trailer on her
charred property. She contines to work @ Ratheon, and recently
purchasing a new home. Also, she witnessed her good friends
husband dying an uncomfortable death of emphysema at home while
on hospice the evening prior to her presentation to [**Hospital3 **].

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for rare angina with
exertion, especially in the cold weather which is relieved by
cessation of activity. She denies dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On other review of systems, she denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain.


Past Medical History:
# CAD: 2 previous MI in early 90s. Cardiac cath at that time
repordedly without intervenable disease. She did have a third
"episode" in [**2088**] and had placement of 2 stents @ [**Hospital1 2025**] to a long
proximal LAD lesion repordely extending from the takoff of
vessel fromt he left main to the branching of the first
diagonal. She also thinks she underwent a subsequent which
showed patent stents.
# Chronic Renal Failure secondary to congenital ureteral
anaomaly. Assuming this has caused chronic reflux destructive
nephropathy. Followed by urology and nephrology, gets yearly
stent exchanges (?to prevent reflux vs. obstruction) and has
considered transitioning to peritoneal dialysis.  Creatinine has
chornically been in mid 2s, but has risin thoughout [**2100**] to her
current level 4 to 4.5.
# Dyslipidemia
# Hypertension
# Recent social stressors


Social History:
-Tobacco history: quit smoking after first MI, had 35 years of
[**2-2**].5ppd
-ETOH: rarely
-Illicit drugs: none
Previously married x 2, has three kids from first marriage.
Currently in long term relationship x 20 years with male
partner.
Continues to work assembling radar for ratheon.

TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  8.25 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  73



INTERPRETATION: 62 yo woman (h/o CAD and s/p PCI;
antiphosphlipid
syndrome and severe CRF) was referred post-NSTEMI to evaluate
for
myocardium at risk that may lead to cardiac catheterization. The
patient
completed 8.25 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol; ~ 4.5 METS.
Although the
procedure was going to be stopped due to submaximal endpoints
attained,
exercise was terminated secondary to a hypotensive blood
pressure
response during exercise. The patient reported shortness of
breath and
mild lightheadedness with the drop in blood pressure, however
denied any
chest, back, neck or arm discomforts. Early post-exercise, the
symptoms
resolved with an increase in blood pressure noted. In the
presence of
the anterolateral ST-T wave changes at baseline, the ECG is
difficult to
interpret during exercise. The rhythm was sinus with occasional
aea
noted during exercise; occasional isolated APDs, rare atrial
couplets.
In addition, isolated multiformed VPDs were noted in exercise.
As noted,
a symptomatic hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise
was noted.

IMPRESSION: Test terminated secondary to symptomatic hypotensive
blood
pressure response to exercise. No typical anginal symptoms with
an
uninterpretable ECG. Occasional multiformed VPDs noted during
the
procedure. Nuclear report sent separately.
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m tetrofosmin.
Tracer was injected approximately 30 minutes prior to obtaining
the resting images.
At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of
Tc-99m
tetrofosmin was administered IV. Stress images were obtained
approximately 15 minutes following tracer injection.
Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is increassed.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal moderate to severe
predominantly
fixed distal anterior wall and apical decreased t
