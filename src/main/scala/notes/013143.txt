History of Present Illness:
47 year old Vietnamese speaking male with complex medical
history, including aortic surgery. He is being evaluated for
kidney transplant but due to issues with aorta and current
valvular abnormalities, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], he is not a candidate.
He presents for cardiac cath for preoperative workup for his
upcoming extensive cardiovascular surgery scheduled on [**2193-1-10**].

Past Medical History:
1. Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, status post stent
grafting with type 1 endoleak.
2. Mild to moderate aortic insufficiency.
3. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
4. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
5. Embolized stent to the right pulmonary artery.
6. Chronic renal failure (on hemodialysis).
7. History of retrograde type A aortic dissection after stent
grafting procedure requiring interposition Dacron tube graft
from the sinotubular junction to the distal ascending aorta.
8. Atrial fibrillation.
9. Right groin fistula
10.Subclavian stenosis s/p stenting (stent has migrated to right
main pulmonary artery)
11.Hypertension

Pertinent Results:
[**2193-1-21**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Stenosis involving the distal
subclavian vein at its junction with the right internal jugular
vein. This may account for the patient's right arm swelling;
however the appearence is unchanged from the prior CT studies
[**2192-12-31**] and [**2192-10-26**]. An existing right internal
jugular vein catheter may be contributing to the reduced flow in
the right subclavian vein. 2. Distended right upper extremity
veins secondary to th AV fistual. Full evaluation of the AV
fistula graft with Doppler ultrasound would be of benefit.
3. Extensive reconstructive cardiac surgery as described with
patency of the major arterial branches.
4. Persistent endoleak identified at the level of the aortic
arch.
5. Mild splenomegaly.
6. Small subcutaneous fluid collection in the anterior neck as
described.
7. Large right sided pleural effusion.
.
[**2193-1-14**] RUQ Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: The gallbladder is not
significantly distended, and while there is gallbladder wall
thickening up to 8 mm and evidence of sludge/stones filling the
gallbladder, these findings are likely attributable to the
patient's congestive hepatopathy, ascites, and hypoalbuminic
state which all contribute to the gallbladder wall thickening.
However, acute cholecystitis, while unlikely due to the
relatively small [**Name (NI) **] size, cannot be completely excluded.
.
[**2193-1-10**] Intra-op TEE: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). The
inferoseptal wall appears dyskinetic. The remaining segments
appear hypokinetic. The appearance of the ascending aorta is
consistent with a normal tube graft. There are few complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. An echogenic
structure and artifact is noted in the distal aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
to moderate ([**11-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There is a echogenic structure in the Pulmonary
artery. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at the
time of the study.
