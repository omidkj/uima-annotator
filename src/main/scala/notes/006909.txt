   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT  [**2100-7-11**] 8:56 PM

CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT

Reason: please do non-con of L knee

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with comminuted distal L femur fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please do non-con of L knee
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT LOWER EXTREMITY

CLINICAL HISTORY: Comminuted femur fracture.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images are obtained through the distal third
of the femur, through the knee and proximal tibia. Coronal and
sagittal reconstructions were performed.

COMPARISON FILMS: Plain radiographs [**2100-7-11**].

FINDINGS:

There is a very severely comminuted distal supracondylar femoral
shaft fracture. The largest distal fracture fragment is
displaced approximately 2.5-3 cm medially and posteriorly. The
fracture does not extend to the articular surface. There are no
additional fractures, specifically the proximal tibia/tibial
plateau and proximal fibula are intact. There are innumerable
small fracture fragments. Some of the smaller fracture fragments
extend up through a superficial soft tissue defect just anterior
to the superior aspect of the patella. There is a large amount
of hemorrhage within the surrounding soft tissues. There are
some small pockets of air in the surrounding soft tissues. A
small knee effusion is present. There is no fat fluid level.
Advanced osteoarthritic changes are present at the knee with
large osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and small subchondral
cysts. The degenerative changes predominate along the medial
femoral tibial joint compartment where there is severe joint
compartment loss. No proximal tibial fracture is detected.

IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly comminuted and displaced extra-articular
supracondylar distal femoral shaft fracture.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 15773**]

ASSISTANT:  None.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Comminuted intraarticular grade II
open left supracondylar femur fracture/intercondylar femur
fracture.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Comminuted intraarticular grade II
open left supracondylar femur fracture/intercondylar femur
fracture.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Irrigation and debridement of
comminuted intraarticular grade II open left supracondylar
femur fracture/intercondylar femur fracture.

ANESTHESIA:  General.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

INDICATIONS:  This is a 52-year-old woman who transferred
from an outside hospital with the above injury when she fell
earlier today. She presented to our hospital approximately 4
hours after the injury. She received plain films and CT scan
here which shows an intraarticular intercondylar fracture
that extends with extensive comminution into the
supracondylar metadiaphyseal region. She had 2 lacerations
anterior directly, several inches proximal to the superior
pole of the patella. These had been sutured closed at the
outside hospital and were opened up here.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and given general endotracheal anesthesia. She
was given 2 grams of Ancef and gentamicin as well. Her
tetanus status was up-to-date in terms of toxoid. The
patient's leg was elevated in an extremity holder. She was
prepped with Hibiclens scrub followed by isopropyl alcohol
because of an allergy to Betadine by report. Following this,
she was sterilely draped. We opened up the 2 lacerations,
extending them with sharp dissection from approximately 2 cm
each in length to about 4 cm. Probing deep demonstrated that
these 2 lacerations were in continuity in the subcutaneous
fat in this morbidly obese patient. Each of the lacerations
probed deep down into the intraarticular and supracondylar
portion of the fracture which was easily palpable. We then
utilized 9000 cc of pulsatile bacitracin fluid to evacuate
the area. A Penrose drain was placed, and the wounds were
left completely open with large compressive and absorptive
dressing applied over followed by a knee immobilizer.

The patient will be put on the schedule for surgery with the
next 24-48 hours for open reduction and internal fixation.
She will be maintained on antibiotics in the interim and will
have compression boots bilaterally but no medical
anticoagulation until after her procedure is completed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left open femur fracture, distal.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left open femur fracture, distal.

PROCEDURE:
1.  Irrigation and debridement of the femur fracture.
2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal femur
    fracture with 9 hole [**Last Name (un) 101**] plate.

INDICATIONS:  This is the 5th procedure for Mrs. [**Known lastname **] who
was admitted with an open femur fracture. She was initially
taken to the operating room by the surgeon on call for
initial debridement.  She was kept intubated until my arrival
for surgical fixation.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room after prepping and draping the left lower
extremity.  I extending the initial wounds,  connecting them
into a Z type wound in order to access the distal lateral
aspect of the femur. It was obvious that the fracture had
penetrated to the quadriceps and there was a partial
quadriceps tendon tear which I repaired at the end of my
debridement. The wound was aggressively debrided of all
necrotic appearing tissue which was min
