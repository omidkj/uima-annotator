CXR [**2178-11-7**]:
There is poor visualization of the lines and tubes due to body
habitus and technique of the exam. An endotracheal tube is
present, with the tip terminating in the region of the superior
aspect of the clavicles with the neck in apparently flexed
position. Nasogastric tube and right subclavian vascular
catheters are present, but their tips are not well visualized
due to the factors listed above. The heart is mildly enlarged
and there is upper zone vascular redistribution as well as
widening of the vascular pedicle. This is associated with
diffuse perihilar haziness. More confluent opacities are seen at
the lung bases, right greater than left.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube is slightly proximal in location
particularly given flexed position of the patient's neck. This
could be advanced several centimeters from more optimal
placement as communicated to the clinical service caring for the
patient.
2. Findings consistent with volume overload or congestive heart
failure.
3. Asymmetrical basilar consolidation raises concern for
underlying pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2178-11-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip slightly proximal and could be advanced
1-2 cm for more optimal placement.
2. Persistent perihilar edema.
3. Slight improvement in more confluent basilar opacities, which
may reflect dependent edema or other superimposed process such
as aspiration or pneumonia.
.
RUQ US [**2178-11-8**]:
LIMITED RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The study was limited
secondary to the patient's large body habitus and inability to
turn sideways. The gallbladder wall was not distended, and
demonstrated no intraluminal stones or material. There was no
gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. There is no
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The liver demonstrated no focal
mass lesions. The common bile duct and pancreas were obscured by
overlying bowel gas, and were not completely visualized.
IMPRESSION: The gallbladder was normal in appearance, without
any associated intrahepatic ductal dilatation. There is limited
evaluation of the CBD secondary to overlying bowel gas. The
results were discussed with the covering house staff immediately
after the study was performed.
.
CTA Chest [**2178-11-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with a small pulmonary embolism to the
artery to the right lower lobe given limitations of this study.
2. Bilateral dependent consolidations.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities and thickened interlobular
septae consistent with pulmonary edema or ARDS.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
Echo [**2178-11-10**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
EKG [**2178-11-12**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse non-specific ST-T
wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing tachycardia is
new.
.
CXR [**2178-11-17**]:
Right lower lobe atelectasis is minimally improved but still
severe. Asymmetric interstitial pulmonary edema, favoring the
left lung is unchanged. The heart is top normal size. There is
no appreciable pleural effusion. Left PIC catheter tip projects
over the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
.
CTA Chest [**2178-11-17**]:
1. No new areas of embolism identified. Persistent small
pulmonary embolism to the artery to the right lower lobe.
2. Bilateral dependent consolidations, which are slightly
improved compared to the prior study, particularly in the right
lower lobe.
3. Unchanged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
4. Retained secretions in the trachea.
4. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
KUB [**2178-11-20**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2176-11-16**].
A single supine abdominal examination was obtained. There is no
evidence for dilated bowel or obstruction. No significant amount
of stool is identified.
.
CT Head [**2178-11-20**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, major
vascular territorial infarcts. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits. The ventricles are of
normal size.
