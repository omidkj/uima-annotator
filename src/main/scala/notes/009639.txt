Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male with history of Asthma, Gout, BPH, CRI with baseline
Cr 1.5-2 with recent hospitalization for epidural abcess and
bactremia [**1-17**] Pan-Sensitive Enterococcus who was admitted from
rehab for fevers and lethargy.
.
1. Fevers:  Patient was changed from Ampicillin/CTX to Vanc and
Aztreonam secondary to drug rash. Infectious disease was
consulted.  Neurosurgery was consulted, and MRI of L spine was
negative for epidural abscess. MRI showed ongoing discitis and
osteo.  Per ID recommendation, discitis/osteomyelitis is
presumed to be [**1-17**] Enterococcus at this time and patient is to
complete 6 week course of Daptomycin for Enterococcus bactermia
and osteomyelitis. Echo was negative for valvular vegetations
concerning for endocarditis.   Main concern is for recurrence of
epidural abscess.  CXR done on arrival to ICU showed increasing
RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA vs Aspiration Pneumonitis.
Patient was initially treated with Vancomycin and Aztreonam for
a 2 week course given recent history of enterococcal bacteremia.
 C diff was negative. Blood cultures, UA and urine cultures were
negative. CT torso was performed on [**10-26**] which was only
remarkable for pneumonia, not underlying abscess.
-Pati ID recommended Daptomycin for an additional 2 weeks for
enterococcal bacteremia/osteomyelitis (last day being [**11-14**]).
-Please check weekly CKs, CBC, LFTs, BUN, Cr while on Daptomycin
-Patient has follow up in Infectious disease clinic on [**11-16**]
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4170**]
.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: During admission, patient
decompensated from a respiratory standpoint becoming tachycardic
with increased work of breathing.  Right lower lobe
opacification seemed to have worsened. The patient was
emergently intubated on [**10-20**] after aspirating his medications.
He was continued on Vancomycin and Aztreonam for a 2 week
course. Clindamycin was added for 8 days to cover for anaerobes
that may have been associated with an aspiration event.  However
patient developed a maculopapular rash on [**10-30**]. On [**10-31**] Vanc
and Aztreonam were stopped, and patient was started on
Daptomycin (as above). Patient was successfully extubated on
[**11-1**].
.
3. Altered Mental status: Likely secondary to fevers and likely
infection.  CT Head done in ED showed no signs of acute
hemorrhage or infarction.  Patient was given Morphine 4mg IV x 3
