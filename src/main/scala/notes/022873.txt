Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: 65-year-old man with PICC.

COMPARISON: [**2139-8-10**].

FINDINGS: In comparison to prior examination, the Swan-Ganz
catheter has been
removed. A right-sided IJ is incompletely visualized and seen
terminating
likely in the internal jugular. Left-sided PICC line is new with
its tip 2 cm
from the distal SVC. However, this is difficult to visualize on
this patient.


The lung volumes are extremely low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is enlarged
and unchanged. Endotracheal tube has been removed. Bilateral
pleural
effusions are once again seen, along with bilateral atelectasis.
There is
worsening mild pulmonary edema.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

mins and total bypass time of 82 mins.  He was transferred to
the CVICU on Neo and Propofol and remained intubated overnight

diuresis that day.  POD#2 his epicardial pacing wires and chest
tubes were discontinued and he was transferred to the floor.He
has hx of PAF and had episodes of intermittent afib
