Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88752**] is a 29-year-old female with history of AML.  She
was in her usual state of health until about a month prior to
initial presentation, which was in [**Month (only) **] when she started to note
some increased bruising.  She then had developed some daily
fevers and felt more fatigued and then ultimately had a syncopal
episode.  She went to [**Hospital **] Hospital and then ultimately was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] and upon review of her peripheral
smear was found to have blasts.
She had a bone marrow biopsy on [**5-26**], which reveals AML-M2 with
approximately 23% blasts.  Her blast expressed HLA-DR, CD33,
CD117, CD11c subset M.  In terms of her presenting cytogenetics,
she did not have any abnormal cytogenetics and she was with FLT3
and NPM negative.  When she presented, she had a white count of
3.4, hemoglobin of 7.1, hematocrit of 18.9 and a platelet count
of 23,000 with approximately 60% circulating blasts.  She
proceeded with 7 and 3 (Cytarabine and Daunorubicin). On her
day 14 marrow, which was done on [**6-9**] unfortunately, it
revealed a hypocellular marrow with increased blasts, some
left-shifted myelopoiesis.  As a result of her persistent
disease, she proceeded with 5 and 2 regimen with daunorubicin
and cytarabine. Her treatment course was complicated by fever
and no clear source was identified.  There was question as to
whether it was related to her chemotherapy.  She ultimately was
discharged from the hospital on [**7-10**]. Had a bone marrow bx and
aspirate on [**7-14**] which did not reveal any morphologic or
cytogenetic evidence of disease.
.
[**2118-7-25**]: Cycle #1 high-dose ARA-C, complicated by fever, most
likely due to ARA-C as had similar symptoms during induction.
[**2118-8-10**] to [**2118-8-19**]: Hospitalized for neutropenic fever and
typhlitis.
[**2118-8-29**] to [**2118-9-5**]: Cycle #2 HIDAC.
[**2118-9-29**] to [**2118-10-4**]: Cycle #3 HIDAC.
[**2118-10-31**] to [**2118-11-5**]: Cycle #4 HIDAC.
.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Reveals an admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] around
[**2110**] which by her report was for 2 days for low blood counts,
admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital for gastroenteritis.

Social History:
Originally from [**Country 4194**], she has been in the US for 16 years.
Not currently working, but was previously a housekeeper.  She is
single, has an 8yo son, and they live with her twin sister
[**Doctor First Name 88753**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88754**]).  Parents remain in [**Country 4194**].  No
tobacco, alcohol or drugs.


Family History:
Mother--possible transfusion-dependent MDS.
Father--healthy.
No other major medical problems.

CXR [**2118-11-15**]
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-18**] through
[**9-1**]:
Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces.
.
CXR [**2118-11-17**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma, no pleural
effusions.
Normal size and shape of the mediastinal structures and the
cardiac
silhouette. No pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2118-11-19**]
Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The
interstitium appears slightly prominent throughout both lungs
but when
compared to multiple previous studies given differences in
technique, this is not likely significantly changed. No focal
airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. If the patient's symptoms persist,
followup imaging should be considered. No acute bony
abnormality.
.
CXR [**2118-11-19**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
inspiratory volume has decreased. In addition, there is a
relatively ill-defined bilateral pattern of parenchymal
opacities with air bronchograms and minimal bronchial cuffing.
Given the patient's clinical presentation, this change would be
consistent with pneumonia. Otherwise, there is no relevant
change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence
of pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the hilar and
mediastinal contours.

chest CT [**2118-11-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal lung consolidations and small nodular opacities
rapidly
appearing over few days and given the clinical history is
concerning for lung infection, likely bacterial. Fungal
infection though less likely, cannot be ruled out.
Alternatively, recent leukocytosis in immune challenged patient
as reflected from online medical records, may cause similar
appearance.
2. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.

ECHO [**2118-11-25**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with mild-moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis and mild right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic,
etc. - less suggestive of multivessel CAD, but cannot fully
exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-6-16**],
global biventricular systolic function is now depressed.
