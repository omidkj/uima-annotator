the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close observation for

Mr. [**Known lastname 32735**] had been in his usual state of health until
approximately 7 to 10 days prior to admission when he began
to have flu-like symptoms including fevers and myalgias.
During this time the patient took Advil one to two tablets

with some relief of symptoms.  He felt largely better until
four days prior to admission when he began to experience
nausea without vomiting with intermittent abdominal pain.

On the day prior to admission, the patient's co-workers noted
that the patient's skin and eyes had become jaundiced.  The
patient reported to his primary care physician on the morning
