Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of arterial line

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female who was transfered from [**Hospital1 **] in shock. The patient was reportly found unresponsive
this AM and brought to [**Hospital3 **].  She was intubated and
noted to have a rectal temperature of 104. Prior to intubation
there was questionable seizure activity with some myoclonic
jerking. Her CXR did not show an infiltrate and UA was
contaminated. There was concern for meningitis and she was given
decadron, CTX and Vanco. A CT-head was negative and a LP was
performed: gram stain negative, WBC 5, RBC 6, protein 47 and
glucose 107. Her lactate was 3.3.  Her troponin was elevated at
1.12 without ECG changes. She was started on norepinephrine for
blood pressure support and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED,  99.0 71 113/59 14 100%. Her levaphed was turned off
and she was hypotensive to the 80's, but improved after
restarting the pressor.  Her labs were remarkable for a WBC 13.7
(no bands), Hct 30.7, lactate 1.7 that increased to 3.1 on
repeat. A CXR and CT abd/pelvis did not show any acute process.
A UA showed [**7-6**] WBC and moderate bacteria. ECG showed no
ischemic changes and troponin 0.27.  She was given a total of 4L
IVF and levaphed was at 0.08 with MAPS in the 70's.  On transfer
she was on CMV, Tv: 400, PEEP 5, RR: 16, FiO2: 100% and ABG was
7.39/33/99/21.  She was sedated on fentanyl and versed and
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Radiology
.
CXR [**2187-2-3**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-31**] through 7:

Left lower lobe collapse which developed between [**1-31**] and 7
has not
cleared. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased since
[**2-2**].
Small left pleural effusion unchanged. The heart size normal.
.
CXR: [**2-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic process.
2. Right IJ catheter extends towards the midline and may be
intra-arterial
though patient rotation may also cause this appearance. Clinical
correlation
recommended.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2187-1-31**] 8:56 PM
CT LUNG BASES: The partially imaged lungs show left lower lobe
atelectasis.
The partially imaged heart shows mitral annular calcifications.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver is normal in shape
and size
though the heterogeneous mottled enhancement pattern suggests
congestion. The
spleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas are unremarkable.
The patient
has a PEG tube in place. There is a small amount of free fluid
in the abdomen.
The small and large bowel loops are unremarkable. No fluid
collections are
noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
bladder and
uterus are unremarkable. There is trace pelvic free fluid. No
pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures showed no
suspicious lytic
or blastic lesions or fractures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mottled enhancement of the liver may be secondary to
congestion in the
setting of cardiac disease. Please correlate clinically.
2. No acute findings in the abdomen/pelvis to account for
sepsis.

Cardiology
.
TTE [**2187-2-1**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal/borderline hyperdynamic (LVEF >55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In
the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or
hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with borderline
hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. Severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
(may be underestimated in the setting of severe tricuspid
regurgitation). Small left pleural effusion.
