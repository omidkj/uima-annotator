HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
lady with locally advanced non-small cell cancer that was
initially presented as superior vena cava syndrome more than
one year ago and recently diagnosed subsegmental PE who
initially presented to the Emergency Department on [**2175-5-16**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

She was subsequently found to have a large PE with a
tamponade physiology.  She had a pericardial window placed on
[**2175-5-18**] without any complications.  She had remained
hemodynamically stable since.  Her chronic anticoagulation
for a history of superior vena cava syndrome and PE was
initially reversed to enable the pericardial placement.
Postoperatively, the decision was made to re-initiate
anticoagulation given her hypercoagulable state, but the
therapeutic INR range was decreased to 1.5 to 2.  She was
also started on an intravenous heparin drip with a goal
partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 70 while her INR was
subtherapeutic.

She was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
East Oncology/Medicine Service as she was clinically stable.
While she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she also
had a barium swallowing study done to evaluate a questionable
small amount of air behind the esophagus on her admission
chest computed tomography.  The barium swallowing study was
normal.  Her stay int he Medical Intensive Care Unit was also
notable for episodes of psychosis which were attributable to
opioids side effects.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Non-small cell cancer diagnosed in [**2173-1-18**] after
the patient presented with superior vena cava syndrome.
Status post chemotherapy with carboplatin, Taxol, and
gemcitabine, and radiation therapy.

 9.  In [**2175-1-18**], pancreatic divisum with chronic
hyperamylasemia due to macroamylasemia.
10.  Status post sphincterectomy in [**2171**].
11.  Subsegmental PE diagnosed in [**2175-4-18**].
12.  Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of
40%).

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and SULFA (which cause a rash) and
CODEINE.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  (To the East Oncology/Medicine
Service)
 1.  Warfarin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 2.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 3.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day.
 4.  Fentanyl patch 50 mcg per hour transdermally q.72h.
 5.  Senna one tablet p.o. twice per day.
 6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
 7.  Ibuprofen 600 mg p.o. three times per day (with meals).
 8.  Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.
 9.  Zofran 2 mg to 4 mg intravenously q.4-6h. as needed.
10.  Seroquel 25 mg to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. as needed.
11.  Heparin drip (with a goal partial thromboplastin time of
60 to 70).
12.  Regular insulin sliding-scale.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on transfer to the East Oncology/Medicine Service revealed
temperature was 96.5, blood pressure was 114/64, heart rate
was 102, respiratory rate was 14, and oxygen saturation was
99% on 2 liters.  In general, a pleasant elderly woman
sitting up in bed, in no acute distress.  Head and neck
examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  The neck
was supple.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  Positive for rubs.
The lungs revealed bilateral basilar crackles.  The abdomen
was soft.  Normal active bowel sounds.  Diffusely tender
especially at the epigastric region where the window was
done.  The back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
No spinal tenderness.  Extremity examination revealed trace
edema but warm to touch.  Distal pulses were 2+.  Skin
revealed no rashes, and no lesions.  Neurologic examination
revealed awake, alert and oriented times three.  A nonfocal
examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
transfer to the Oncology/Medicine Service revealed white
blood cell count was 13.6, hematocrit was 25.5, and platelets
were 485.  Prothrombin time was 13.6, partial thromboplastin
time was 46.6, and INR was 1.2.  Sodium was 140, potassium
was 3.5, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 18, blood urea
nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was
142.  Calcium was 8.7, magnesium was 2.2, and phosphate was
3.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During her stay on the Oncology/Medicine
Service she remained hemodynamically stable.  She continued
to require ibuprofen, Tylenol, and occasional oxycodone for
her pain around the pericardial window site.

She was continued on anticoagulation without any
complications.  Her Coumadin dose was increased to 3 mg p.o.
q.h.s., and her INR reached the therapeutic range.  Her
hematocrit had slowly been trending down throughout her
hospital stay, which was thought most likely secondary to her
chronic disease.  She received 2 units of packed red blood
cells, and her hematocrit responded nicely to the
transfusion.

Since the patient complained of recurrent dysphagia, she went
for another esophageal dilatation.  The procedure itself was
not complicated.   However, in the Postanesthesia Care Unit
she acute respiratory decompensation with oxygen saturations
down to 70s on room air.  She was thought to have
methemoglobinemia with a methemoglobin level of up to 17, for
which she was treated with methylene blue.  However, after
methemoglobinemia was resolved with methylene blue she was
also noted to have acute mental status changes with the
inability to speak.  Since her mental status and neurologic
deficits resolved spontaneously, it was thought she had acute
metabolic encephalopathy due to analgesics which she received
perioperatively.  However, the Neurology Service recommended
a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal carcinomatosis.  The
decision was made not to pursue lumbar puncture since the
patient was not a candidate for intrathecal chemotherapy.
