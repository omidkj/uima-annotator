History of Present Illness:
53 yo W w/ DM1 (brittle on insulin pump), s/p LURT [**2106**]
(Baseline Cr 1.4-1.7), CAD (s/p multiple PCIs), [**Year (4 digits) 19874**] (EF 45%),
HTN/HL who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a left
proximal humerus fracture now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
respiratory distress, septic shock, and renal failure.

Patient initially went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2113-7-3**] after
trippering over a chair, falling, and sustaining a left proximal
humerus fracture without dislocation. Orthopedics saw and
advised conservative management and she was given dilaudid for
pain as well as a muscle relaxant (unknown type). At 5am on
[**2113-7-4**], patient noted to be lethargic with sats to 70s as well
as febrile to 103.1. She was given 1 dose of Narcan with little
change. Put on 100% NRB and trasfered to CCU where she was given
Ceftazidime and Vancomycin. ABG at time showed pO2 of 60%. Some
question if EKG changes inferiorly (reported as elevations).
Cardiology saw and thought not a cardiac cause. ECHO showed EF
40%. Cards thought she was developing ARDS. ID consulted and
recommended switching Ceftazidime to Zosyn for Asp PNA. Cr was
2.1 on admission and rose to 2.9 on [**7-4**]. Continued to be
hypotensive despite fluids (unsure how much) and was started on
phenylephrine gtt. Insulin pump (home med) was discontinued and
ISS started. [**Last Name (un) **] and bactrim were held. Pts [**Hospital1 18**] renal
transplant attending ([**Doctor Last Name **]) was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Immediately prior to transfer patient was intubated due to
concerns Re transfer saftey with pt still on NRB and concerns by
[**Hospital3 **] that she was developing ARDS. Pressures dropped
significantly after intubation with Rocuronium and Propofol and
had to go up on Phenylephrine. Patient was stable on ride over
and EMTs were able to go down on her pressor requirement. She
did well on the vent with relatively minimal sedation and
remained responsive to voice on ride over.

On arrival to the MICU, patient intubated and sedated, just got
propofol bolus. However, able to respond to voice and follow
simple commands. Reporting no pain. Seems to understand what I
am saying.

Review of systems: Unable to obtain as intubaed

IMAGING
[**2113-7-4**] CXR:
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  ET tube tip is low,
1.5 cm above the carina, can be withdraw couple of centimeters
for more standard position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach, but
the side hole is at the EG junction and should be advanced for
more standard position.  Right IJ catheter tip is at the
cavoatrial junction.  Left perihilar and lower lobe opacities
are worrisome for aspiration given the clinical concern.  There
is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.  If any,
there is a small left pleural effusion.

[**2113-7-5**] Head CT:
FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is
no significant abnormality of the extracalvarial soft tissues,
and no underlying skull fracture is seen.  There is no intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage, the midline structures are in the
midline and the ventricles and cisterns are normal in size and
configuration, with slight asymmetric prominence of all
components of the right lateral ventricle, likely
congenital/developmental.  There is mucosal thickening involving
scattered anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, which
appears more marked since the sinus CT of [**2113-2-14**].  The
remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, as well as the mastoid
air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial injury, and no
skull fracture.

[**2113-7-6**] Humerus XRay:
IMPRESSION:
Proximal left humerus comminuted fracture involving surgical
neck with mild subluxation posteriorly of distal fracture
fragment approximately two cortical widths with fracture line
extension also extending towards greater tuberosity.
Glenohumeral articulation is maintained.

[**2113-7-6**] Abdominal x-ray:
IMPRESSION:  Air within small and large bowel is nonspecific.
No evidence of obstruction.

[**2113-7-6**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of significantly abnormal background rhythms. At the beginning
of the
record, extremely frequent high voltage triphasic-appearing
waves admixed with a few m
