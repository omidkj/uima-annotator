Micros:
[**2178-12-14**] Pleural fluid and tissue: no growth

Procedure date Tissue received [**2178-12-14**] DIAGNOSIS: Chronic
fibrosing pleuritis.

CXR:
[**2178-12-24**]: Two chest tubes in the right.  There is a persistent
pneumothorax.
[**2178-12-23**]: The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Two chest tubes
remain in the right hemithorax although a third one has been
removed. There is a persistent moderate pneumothorax, much of
which is loculated in the right lower hemithorax.  Pleural
effusions are similar bilaterally with associated areas of
atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate right-sided pneumothorax
[**2178-12-22**]: FINDINGS: Since [**2178-12-21**] at 3:14pm, there is no
significant change. A persistent right moderate pneumothorax is
seen with multiple chest tubes in place. A small left pleural
effusion is stable. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and
hilar contours are unchanged.
[**2178-12-18**]: Slight interval decrease in size of right
mild-to-moderate pneumothorax since
[**2178-12-17**]: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date,
there is
increasing pneumothorax surrounding the left lung.
Opacifications of the left base are unchanged. Endotracheal tube
has been removed.
[**2178-12-15**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
reintubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 6.6 cm
above the
carina. The tube should be advanced by 2-3 cm as it is currently
located too high.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 51023**] was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2178-12-14**] where he underwent a right thoracotomy
with decortication for fibrothorax. The procedure was
complicated by multiple pleural tears with difficulty
oxygenating with significant tidal volume loss and postoperative
hypotension requiring transfer to the SICU intubated on
pressors.  On [**2178-12-15**] failed extubation requiring re-intubation
for respiratory failure. He developed rapid atrial fibrillation
hemodynamically unstable requiring amiodarone for rate control
after Lopressor and diltiazem were unresponsive.  He converted
to sinus rhythm weaned off pressors on [**2178-12-16**]. He remain
intubated and sedated until [**2178-12-17**] when we was successfully
extubated.  His respiratory status was monitored closely with
serial ABGs with pCO2 in the 70's baseline 50-55% hypercarbia
requiring BiPAP.  With aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, chest
PT his oxygen requirements improved on 3L nasal cannula with
oxygen saturations of 96-98%.  He was continued on his home CPAP
dose of 8 cmH20 AutoSet.  He remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred to the floor on [**2178-12-22**].

Respiratory: oxygen saturations of 92-95% on 2L nasal cannula.
CPAP at night 98%

Chest-tubes: anterior, posterior apical and basilar chest tubes
with persistent air leak was to suction immediately
postoperative them placed to water-seal.  The posterior apical
chest tube was removed on [**2178-11-22**].  The anterior and basilar
remained with a persistent air leak.  They were converted to
pneumostats on [**2178-12-24**] and will remain until seen by thoracic
surgery and the air leak has resolved.

Chest films: he was followed by serial chest films which showed
persistent moderate
pneumothorax, much of which is loculated in the right lower
hemithorax.   Bilateral Pleural effusions with associated areas
of atelectasis.

Cardiac: On [**2178-12-18**] he was converted to PO amiodarone 400 mg
tid titrated to [**Hospital1 **], home dose digoxin restarted he remained in
sinus rhythm 60's with no ectopy.  Blood pressure stable 94-138.
 His cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] followed him throughout his
hospital course and will follow him as an outpatient.

GI: [**2178-12-16**] Dobbhoff with tube feedings to goal were initiated.
Once extubated he was transition ed to PO's which he tolerated.
PPIs and a bowel regime were continued.

Renal: the Foley was removed he had good urine output. His renal
function remained within normal limits.  Electrolytes were
replete as needed. Keep K+ > 4.0 Mg > 2.0

Pain: Acute pain was consulted on [**2178-12-15**] for epidural
placement for better pain management.  This was removed on
[**2178-12-16**].  He converted to PO pain medication, Lidoderm patch
with good pain control.

Heme: [**2178-12-14**] he was transfused 2 unit PRBC and again 2 Units
on [**2178-12-16**] for HCT 26.  His HCT remained stable 26-30.  His
Warfarin was restarted on [**2178-12-23**] given 1 mg then increased to
2 mg daily.  INR GOAL 2.0 for Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
His cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] manages his warfarin dosing.

Prophylaxis: frequent reposition & SQ Heparin [**Hospital1 **].

Disposition: he as seen by physical therapy who recommended
short term rehab.  He was discharge to Pleasant [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**2178-12-24**].  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
