Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, Acute Renal Failure, Acute Liver Injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with metastatic lung cancer C1D12 palliative
navelbine presenting with altered mental status. He has had
severe pain issues related to a pathologic fracture of his left
humerus.  For this, he has been on chronic narcotics and NSAIDs.
He does not take the medication according to a schedule, he
takes them when he has pain. The notes indicate he has been
taking MS Contin and Dilaudid, but he reports taking oxycodone,
in addition to naproxen and ibuprofen.
.
Approximately one week ago, he developed fever and cough
consistent with an upper respiratory infeciton. He was
prescribed a 10 day course of levofloxacin and clinically
improved with resolved fever and improved cough.  He was seen in
the oncology clinic on [**12-1**] for chemotherapy and was clinically
well.  He was advised to decrease his warfarin dose at that
visit.
.
On the morning of presentation, he reported feeling acutely
confused. He was having visual hallucinations and was
"babbling." He was aware of his confusion.  EMS was called and
he was given Narcan for a report of pinpoint pupils, with
improvement. He was taken to an OSH for evaluation and was found
to have multiple laboratory abnormalities, including an INR of
12 (given 2 units FFP and vitamin K 10 mg) and a potassium of
6.4 (given bicarbonate, insulin/D50), ALT 1327, AST 4193, Cr
3.9, TB 0.9 and he was given levofloxacin 750.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. There was a report at the OSH that he was
taking his friend's Buspar because he was feeling anxious.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], VS were 97.8 96/70 83 24 100%.  His evaluation
revealed multiple laboratory abnormalities. He was given 2
liters NS and 1 gram vancomycin and 2 grams Cefepime.  He was
seen by Toxicology in the ED, who recommended empiric NAC for
possible tylenol overdose.  He was treated for hyperkalemia with
Insulin and kayexelate and admitted to the ICU.
.
Currently, he denies pain, fever, chills, headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or back pain.
He is feeling thirsty. He is constipated from the pain
medication. He thinks his thinking is improved from admission.
Denies current hallucinations.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1.  The patient presented with postobstructive pneumonia in
[**2131-9-26**].  Flexible bronchoscopy on [**2131-10-5**] showed a
mass in the left upper lobe bronchus extending into the main
bronchus.  Cytology from FNA was positive for squamous cell
carcinoma.
2.  Rigid bronchoscopy on [**2131-10-11**] including endoscopic
ultrasound, tumor debridement, and argon plasma coagulation to
open the upper airway.  Biopsy from transbronchial biopsies at
different levels of mediastinal hilar lymph nodes returned back
negative for malignant cells.
3.  PET CT on [**2131-11-1**] showed a large FDG avid left upper lobe
pulmonary mass encasing the left main bronchus FDG avid
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and FDG avidity in the left proximal
humerus concerning for metastatic disease.
4.  Brain MRI on [**2131-11-2**] - no evidence of intracranial
metastasis.
5.  MRI of the left humerus showed heterogeneous left humeral
intramedullary lesion suggestive of metastatic disease
6.  Admitted with PE on [**2131-12-2**], started on coumadin.
7.  XRT to the left upper lobe mass with a total dose of 40 Gy
given in 16 fractions.
Palliative XRT to the left humerus, total dose of 20 Gy given in
5 fractions.
8.  Carboplatin and Taxol started on [**2132-2-19**], received 4
cycles through [**2132-4-22**].
9.  Postobstructive pneumonia requiring hospital admission and
bronchoscopy on [**2132-7-14**].  Pathology from right lower lobe
endobronchial biopsy and left upper lobe biopsy showed squamous
cell carcinoma.
10. Second line chemotherapy with Docetaxel and NPI-2358 on
clinical trial 08-348 started [**2132-8-5**] x 4 cycles, stopped due to
disease progression on [**2132-11-4**].
11. 3rd line chemotherapy with gemcitabine started on [**2132-11-4**],
stopped on [**2133-9-29**] due to disease progression.

[**12-4**] CXR: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There is no
significant interval change from prior. Again seen is
opacification of the left hemithorax representing a combination
of moderate-sized left pleural effusion and left hilar mass. The
right lung is unchanged with a spiculated right upper lobe
nodule redemonstrated as well as subpleural reticular opacities.
Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are noted. Fracture of the
left proximal humerus proximally is seen with medial
displacement by approximately half-shaft width. The fracture is
through a pre-existing permeative lesion as seen on the prior
humerus radiographs.
IMPRESSION: Displaced pathologic fracture of the proximal left
humerus. Otherwise, no significant interval change compared to
prior.
.
[**12-5**] RUQ u/s: FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or
textural abnormalities. The main portal vein is patent with
appropriate hepatopetal flow. The left, middle, and right
hepatic veins are patent. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary dilatation, with the common bile duct measuring up to 4
mm. Note is made of a small amount of ascites demonstrated
around the liver, and also within the right lower and left lower
quadrants, new from prior examination. There is gallbladder wall
