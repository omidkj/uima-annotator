Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o female s/p ABO incompatible liver transplant with
splenectomy on [**2140-8-11**] followed by month long post op
hospitalization who now presents with shortness of breath.
A cardiac echo was obtained on admission showing an EF of > 65%,
however there is increased severity of mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation and estimated pulmonary artery pressures from the
study from of [**2140-7-12**]. Cardiology and Renal consults were
obtained) Chest xray showed worsening pulmonary edema and she
has worsening kidney function, and the patient received
hemodialysis. The patient received intermittent hemodialysis
until [**2140-9-28**].
The patient was also complaining of an increasing amount of
abdominal pain. An abdominal CT was obtained on [**9-7**] showing
increased size of subheaptic fluid collections; differential
includes biloma with possible hemorrhage, postoperative seroma
and pancreatic pseudocyst. CT guided drainage of the collection
returned 1200 cc of dark brown fluid which did not have any
organisms or growth on culture. The fluid was also tested for
amylase which came back at about [**Numeric Identifier 16351**], and she underwent an
[**Numeric Identifier **] which showed extravasation noted at the tail of the
pancreas consistent with pancreatic duct leak. A 7cm by 7FR
pancreatic pancreatic stent was placed. This should be removed
beginning of [**Month (only) 359**].
The patient was then noted to have drop in Hct, she was
transferred to the ICU and was taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy, drainage of intra-abdominal
fluid collections and hematoma, interposition iliac artery graft
from celiac axis to hepatic artery, Tru-Cut biopsy of the liver
for Intra-abdominal bleeding, fluid collection, pancreatic duct
leak, hematoma, bleeding from the
splenic artery/hepatic artery anastomosis.
She received 14 days of Linezolid due to enterococcus growing in
her peritoneal fluid. She was not febrile, however white count
increased to 26,000. This decreased once infection treated.
Another [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was performed on [**2140-9-26**] for persistently elevated
Alk Phos. The biliary stent was removed and a small amount of
sludge was removed by snare. During [**Date Range **],  Initial cholangiogram
appeared fairly normal and the anastamotic stricture was much
improved in appearance. However, on balloon occclusion
cholangiogram, evidence of contrast extravasation was noted from
small right intrahepatic branches. She underwent successful
placement of 9cm x 10Fr biliary stent to facilitate improved
biliary drainage.
On [**9-28**] her hct was noted to drop to 17%, and she was immediately
transferred back to the ICU for transfusion and EGD after
stooling large amounts of maroon stool. CT of the abdomen did
not reveal any issues with the Hepatic artery anastomosis,
however the study was limited by lack of contrast. An EGD was
performed showing mild esophagitis, but no blood in the stomach
or duodenum. She received 5 units of blood on [**9-28**] and then
another 2 the following day, and Hct was back to 30%. She
continued with the bloody/tarry stools, and another EGD was done
on [**9-30**] with still no evidence of bleeding in the upper GI
system. Coloscopy revealed diverticulosis of the transverse
colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon with erythema and
congestion in the whole colon compatible with portal colopathy.
There was blood in the whole colon
and Grade 2 external hemorrhoids. During that same time frame
she also had a tagged RBC scan which showed blood flow images
show normal major vascular flow. Dynamic blood pool images show
no gross abnormalities, there was no evidence of intra-abdominal
bleeding throughout the total imaging time of 132 minutes, and
no definite evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding was found.
Over the course of the next few days, the stooling became more
normal, she has revceievd 2 units of RBCs over the course of the
ensuing two weeks, and there has not been evidence of a
re-bleed.
The patient was fed via TPN while the GI bleed was ongoing. Once
symptoms had resolved and patient was tolerating feeds, a post
pyloric feeding tube placed during the upper GI was again
utilized. Tube feeds were altered to help with tolerance. Her
appetite remains very limited, and weight is 52.5 kg at time of
discharge, which is almost 30 kg lost since time of transplant.
Her renal function improved with creatinine around 1.5 and
approximately 1.5 liters of urine daily. The hemodialysis
catheter was removed.
All drains have been removed since time of surgery.
Immunosuppression was continued during hospitalization, Progral
dosing based on daily levels.
