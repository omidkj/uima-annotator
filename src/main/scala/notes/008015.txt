paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on warfarin, severe atopic
dermatitis, hypercholesterolemia, CKI, anemia who comes in today
with increase pain on his right flank area and 10 poin Hct drop
within the last 4 days on the setting of INR of 8.2 this week.
Pt was last admitted in early [**Month (only) **] for herpes zoster and acute
on chronic renal failure and he was found to have normocytic
anemia with + SPEP/ - UPEP. He had a 2nd admission in [**Month (only) **] for
acute on chronic renal failure which was thought to be related
to hypovolemia. His Hct was 23./Hgb 8.2 from Hct of upper 20s a
few days before.  He was
also transfused with 2 units PRBCs which he responded well. He
had heme eval and had a bone marrow biopsy on [**2143-5-24**] which
reported mild erythroid dyspoiesis suggesting the possibility of
an early evolving MDS. Cytogenetics and FISH for MDS were
negative. He states that since his last hospitalization he has
continued to feel fatigued and saw his hematologist this week on
Tues. On that day, he had blood work which showed a Hct of
29.9/10.1 on [**7-2**]. He states that he lifted a heavy gallon of
water with his right hand and he reached over a barrel earlier

that the pain on his right flank was unberrable and he came to
the ED for eval.

of his abd which showed right retroparitoneal hemorrhage
involving the right psoas muscle along with a 4.4 x 3.6 cm focal
hematoma adjacent in the right lower quadrant. His labs were
notable for Hct of  20.2 (from 29 earlier in the week)with
repeat of 19.2. Plalets of 305, WBC 12.3 (N:79.4 L:9.6 M:6.7
E:3.8 Bas:0.5), PT 48.8/INR 5.2/PTT: 43.4,  creatine is stable
at 1.9. He was given 10mg of Vit K,  2 units of FFP and was
typed and crossed. He was also given 4mg of morphine for pain
with some effect. His EKG- A-fib with RVR in the 110s, but no
other significant change. Surgery was consulted and recommended
close monitoring with medicine admission.

IMAGING:
CT ABD AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST.
IMPRESSION:
Retroperitoneal hemorrhage involving the right psoas muscle
tracking from the level of kidneys all the way down to the
pelvis in the right lower quadrant. there is additionally an
adjacent 4.4 x 3.6 cm focal hematoma. Evaluation for active
extravasation is not possible due to lack of intravenous
contrast.






Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 73 yo male w/ pmh signficant for HTN, normocytic
anemia w/ BM bx on [**5-24**], A-fib on coumadin with
supratherapeutic INR of 8 this week who presents with right
flank pain and 10 point Hct drop who is found to have
retro-peritoneal bleed and is HD stable.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Retroperitoneal bleed: Patient presented with flank pain and
acute drop in hematocrit and was found to have large
retroperitoneal bleed. This was in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR of 8 this week. Patient also had a bone
marrow biopsy 1.5 months however it did not appear to be
related. This incident may have been related by reaching over a
barrel and picking up heavy water gallon. Patient received a
total of 4 units of pRBCs and 2 units of FFP as well as 10mg of
vitamin K. Serial hematocrits remained stable. Patient's pain
slowly improved. Given hemodynamic stability and stable Hct,
patient was discharged directly from the ICU with close PCP and
cardiology follow up. Patient to have hct rechecked 1-2 days
after discharge and follow up with [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 1944**] clinic.
Anticoagulation was held prior to discharge.
.
# A-fib with RVR: Patient initially presented with HRs in 130s
which was thought to be [**1-9**] volume depletion and pain. With
blood/fluid
