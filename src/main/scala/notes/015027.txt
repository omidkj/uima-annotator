Chief Complaint:
backpain, abd pain, chest pain, n/v

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
spontaneous vaginal delivery
endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
29 yo G3P2 at 31+2 WGA reports vomiting twice today and unable
to keep anything down since last night. She has been able to
drink tea today. She has an abdominal pain and back pain that
comes and goes but she can't specify how frequently.  (Pt is
often not answering questions at all or says "I don't know") She
also complains of a substernal chestpain that comes and goes
without radiation. When asked she feels it might coorelate with
the abd pain in timing. Denies vaginal bleeding and leaking of
fluid vaginally. +FM.

ROS: denies SOB, +palpatations at times, denies dysuria,
hematuria, urinary frequency

Past Oncologic History:
- presented in [**2127-3-22**] with abdominal pain, which developed
acutely over the preceding several weeks. A CT scan revealed a
large intra-abdominal mass with CT-guided biopsy on [**2127-4-4**]
confirming a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma. By
immunohistochemistry, the cells were strongly immunoreactive
for CD45 and expressed pan T-cell markers of CD3, CD5, and CD2,

but are negative for CD7. HTLV1 was positive.
- She was initiated on [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy with her first cycle
starting on [**2127-4-6**].
- She was admitted after cycle one with constipation and this
has since resolved.
- Cycle two of [**Hospital1 **] was initiated on [**2127-4-25**]. Unfortunately,
this was complicated by readmission due to fever and she was
noted for positive blood cultures with streptococcus pneumoniae

bacteremia. CT scan of the chest on [**2127-5-12**] with notable for

ill-defined nodules in the bronchioles and lower lobes as well
as bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with possible tricuspid

valve vegetation. Subsequent TTE on [**2127-5-13**] confirmed a large

1.7 cm long x 0.7 cm wide mobile echogenic mass on the tricuspid

valve. A [**2127-5-15**] TEE confirmed the mass to be a large
globular well-circumscribed right atrial mass adherent to
the wall at the base of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid
valve. Mrs. [**Known lastname 59601**], therefore, is requiring four weeks of
ceftriaxone for right endovascular infection. In addition, she
was started on Lovenox. The pulmonary nodules were possibly
related to septic emboli.
- [**Known firstname **] received her third cycle of [**Hospital1 **] initiating on
[**2127-5-19**] and was discharged following completion of this
treatment
- [**Known firstname **] now recieving cycle 2 of CHOP therapy (first day
[**2127-7-8**])

Interim Results:
MRI ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST ([**6-3**])
1. Large mesenteric mass on the right, and lying posterior and
along the
right side of the gravid uterus. This is new since the FDG-CT
imaging
examination of [**2127-12-2**], and is consistent with recurrent
lymphoma.
2. A smaller cluster of lymph nodes are seen in the upper left
paraaortic
region of the abdomen.
3. At least two foci of high signal on diffusion-weighted
imaging within the
placenta corresponding to well-circumscribed lesions on the
T2-weighted
(SSFSE) images. This is a nonspecific but atypical finding.
Notably, there
have been case reports of lymphomatous deposits within the
placenta and this
is a consideration.
4. Gravid uterus as described. The cervix measures at least 3.5
cm.
.
CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST ([**6-14**])
1. Recurrence of lymphoma with mucosal involvement of the
gastric antrum and
pylorus, and also loops of small bowel within the right side of
the abdomen.
2. There is a large contiguous soft tissue mass extending from
the level of
lesser sac into the mesentry with a large mass in the right side
of the
mesentry, which extends inferiorly to the level of the iliac
crests.
3. Uncomplicated 15-gauge core biopsies (3) taken from the
posterior aspect of
the right mesenteric mass and sent for pathological assessment.
.
PELVIC ULTRASOUND ([**6-16**]):
1. Blood products within the endometrial cavity with no evidence
of
hypervascularity to suggest retained products of conception.
2. Small-to-moderate amount of pelvic free fluid.
.
MRV PELVIS ([**6-17**]):
1. 3.5 x 7.4 cm contained right pelvic fluid collection,
adjacent to the
right lateral wall of the uterus, in communication with the
endometrial/endocervical canal and, apparently, vagina. Findings
are
concerning for post-partum rupture of the vaginal fornix and
lateral cervix.
However, recommend OB/GYN evaluation and correlation with direct
visualization.
2. Patent pelvic veins without evidence of thrombosis, as
questioned.
3. Moderate ascites and pelvic free fluid.
4. Persistent mesenteric masses concerning for lymphoma
recurrence, biopsy
results pending.
