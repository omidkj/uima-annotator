Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coil Embolization

History of Present Illness:
53F with minimal past medical history went to an OSH emergency
department with nausea, vomitting and abdominal pain for 24
hours. On [**2189-4-17**] she developed a "stomach bug" with nausea. The
PCP called in zofran and cipro for possible infection. Then the
next day she developed nausea, dry heaves, and [**10-25**] abdominal
pain. She went to OSH ED where she was found to have a 17 x 19 x
8 cm retroperitoneal mass with extension through gerota's fascia
around the right kidney, IVC compression, and possible aneurysm
or pseudoaneurysm in central portion of the mass. ROS revealed
several week history of drenching night sweats but no fever. She
was given Levofloxacin and Flagyl ([**2179**]) and tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
In the Emergency Department her initial vitals were 96.5, 90,
118/70, 18, 100% RA with a hematocrit of 32.4.  At 11pm
complained of more pain not responsive to morphine.  Started on
2L NC for O2 sat 89%.  Nausea and pain continued.  Surgery saw
her.  At midnight she became unresponsive, and hypoxic, and was
emergently intubated.  She then dropped her blood pressure to
the 60s. Right IJ was placed.   Emergency PRBCs given and
levophed started.
.
Repeat HCT was 24 at 12:30. 3+ L IVFS, Levophed continued, still
dropped BP into 50s.  Neo transiently started but then able to
be turned off.  She was transfused total of 6u PRBC, 4 FFP.  CT
was repeated, showing pseudoaneurysm with active blush, not
present prior, concerning for a RP bleed.  She was taken
emergently to IR for mesenteric angiogram and possible coil
embolization of the aneurysm.
.
In IR, she had coiling of pseudoaneurysm (with supply from SMA
or possibly GDA), without any evidence of residual bleed.  By
the end of procedure, she had received total of [**8-25**] units
PRBCs, 6 FFP, and 2 bags of plts.  She was also given calcium.
Her BP improved and she was able to be weaned off vasopressors.
She required some doses of lasix due to low urine output. Her
Lactate peaked at 5.7, but trended down to 2.9 on transfer to
the medial floor. Her pH nadir was 7.11 (bicarb 15), but
improved up to 7.36.  Her last whole blood Hct was 31 prior to
transfer to the medical floor.

IMAGING:
CT TORSO [**2189-4-20**]:
CT OF THE CHEST: There are several hypoattenuating nodules
within the right lobe of the thyroid gland, the largest
measuring 2.2 x 1.2 cm. The heart, pericardium, and great
vessels are normal. There is no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear. An endotracheal tube is in
place, terminating just above the carina.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Initial non-contrast images through the
abdomen
demonstrate IV contrast material within the renal cortices
bilaterally as well as vicarious excretion of contrast in the
gallbladder and biliary system.  Both of these findings of
retained contrast from prior CT performed at the outside
hospital 7 hours prior are consistent with acute renal failure.
Prior to contrast administration, there is extensive
heterogeneous material in the retroperitoneum and extending into
the paracolic gutters consistent with extensive retroperitoneal
hematoma. Post-contrast images demonstrate the hematoma anterior
to the aorta extending from the level of the celiac origin to
the pelvis. The hematoma displaces the pancreas and SMA/SMV
anteriorly and superiorly and surrounds the retroperitoneal
duodenum. The mesenteric vessels and IVC are markedly
compressed; however, remain patent. On the arterial
phase imaging, there is a well-defined rounded focus of
enhancement within the hematoma to the right of midline, just
posterior/inferior to the pancreatic head. There is also a blush
of contrast extending to the left of midline.
Both areas do not change significantly in configuration on
delayed images, and are concerning for a large pseudoaneurysm
potentially from one of the SMA or celiac axis branches (4:76).
No definite mass lesion is identified.
.
There is a 7-mm hypoattenuating lesion within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the
liver (4:52) which is too small to further characterize. The
spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys are
hyperenhancing due to acute renal compromise.  There are
multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys, which are
likely simple cysts but too small to further characterize. As
noted
previously, the gallbladder is heterogeneous and filled with
previously
administered contrast. The pancreas is enlarged and the head is
distorted and compressed by the hematoma. The uncinate process
is not clearly identified.  Hemorrhage extends into the
paracolic gutters and into the pelvis. The intra-abdominal small
and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
 .
CT OF THE PELVIS: Again complex fluid extends into the pelvis.
The sigmoid
colon, rectum, and bladder are unremarkable. The uterus is
poorly visualized. The osseous structures are unremarkable with
no lytic or sclerotic lesions.
 .
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast
extravasation
posterior to the pancreas suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm.
Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may relate to
prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal ulceration/inflammation.
No definite retroperitoneal mass is identified. These findings
were discussed urgently between radiology resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17470**], and the patient
was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should
also be evaluated during
angiography.
3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up
to 2.2 cm,
for which thyroid ultrasound
