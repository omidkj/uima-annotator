Pertinent Results:
[**Name2 (NI) 1326**] kidney US [**6-15**]: Transplanted kidney with appropriate
arterial waveforms and resistive indices. No hydronephrosis or
perirenal fluid collection. Apparent slow flow within the renal
vein but it appears patent.

[**Month/Year (2) 1326**] kidney US [**6-16**]: 1. No hydronephrosis and no
perinephric collection. 2. Elevated resistive indices in the
intraparenchymal renal arteries.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Known lastname 1326**] Surgery Service and
underwent Living Unrelated Donor Kidney [**Known lastname 1326**]. The kidney
came from his wife. His post-operative course is summarized
below by system.

Neuro: Post-operatively pain was controlled on a morphine PCA
and was transitioned to PO pain meds.

Renal/[**Known lastname 1326**]/Immunosuppression: Mr. [**Known lastname 51792**] [**Known lastname **] was
complicated by delayed graft function requiring dialysis on [**6-20**].
His CBC and chemistries were monitored daily and more often as
indicated. He completed the typical post-operative course of
immunosuppression except that, due to low platelet counts, his
dose of ATG was given over more days in doses of 75. On [**6-21**]/5th the patient began to have increased urine output with an
associated drop in creatinine, seen the day before. This
continued up until his discharge with good urine output.

F/E/N: In general the patient did well with regard to fluids.
Because of the delayed graft function, he required dialysis on
[**6-20**]. After this, however, his graft function picked up and he
was able to handle his own excretory needs. On the day prior to
discharge, his potassium was elevated on his AM labs, follow up
showed an increasing potassium level to 6.1. This was treated
with dextrose, insulin, and IV lasix with moderate response,
thus he was also given kayexelate on the day of discharge after
his potassium had begun trending down. There were no associated
EKG changes. He will have labs checked on Monday in clinic.
During his hospitalization, he had an HD line present on right,
which served as IV access during the hospitalization. This will
be removed in office during followup.

Heme: In the context of the operation and the immediate
post-operative period he required transfusion of 2 pRBCs on
[**6-15**] FFP on [**6-16**]  plt on [**6-16**]. He also had low platelets
intermittently in response to the ATG, thus the dose was given
at 75 a day.

Physical Therapy: The patient was seen in house by physical
therapy and considered able to go home with home PT. He was
encouraged to ambulate early and often.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was discharged on POD 10 afebrile, with normal
hemodynamics, making good urine, tolerating a regular diet with
pain controlled on oral medications. He will follow up for lab
work on Monday [**6-27**].
