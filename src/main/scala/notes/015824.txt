History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo spanish speaking lady with T2DM, CKD, CHF
with EF 15-20% ([**10/2123**]), chronic thrombocytopenia thought to be

Oncology physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-29**] for a regular follow up appointment.
He ordered a routine CBC that showed a platelet count 8 which is
below recent baseline of 40-60. She was instructed to come to
the ED.  She denied any recent episodes of bleeding but did say
that she had new petechiae on her upper extremities as well as
large bruises on her forearms and lower extremities.  She has a
diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome but also has a history of
prior episodes of ITP.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2124-7-4**]):    NO YEAST ISOLATED.

Serology:
[**2124-7-5**] 6:05 am SEROLOGY/BLOOD
HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2124-7-7**]): POSITIVE BY
EIA.

Imaging:
CXR-When compared to the prior chest x-ray of [**Month (only) 116**] the 21st.
The apparent increase in size of the heart is probably due to
projection
alone. Some upper zone redistribution may be present,
particularly when
compared to the two prior chest x-rays and I suspected degree of
failure is
present.

RENAL U.S.-Bilateral renal cysts, as detailed above, slightly
increased in size from
prior exam. There is no hydronephrosis or renal masses.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 124 bpm, 2 mm STE aVR, downsloping STD
1-2 mm in leads I, II, V4-V6. Compared to prior these changes
are more pronounced.

ECHO ([**2124-7-2**]):IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe
global systolic dysfunction. Moderate aortic, mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-9**], LV
cavity is larger, and both aortic and mitral regurgitation are
more prominent. Estimated pulmonary pressures are significantly
higher. LV systolic function and other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1005**] is an 80 yo lady with a significant PMH
including T2DM, CKD, CHF with EF 15-20% ([**10/2123**]), chronic
thrombocytopenia thought to be due to ITP/MDS who presented to
the hospital for a platelet count of 8.

#. Melena: On arrival to the floor the patient had an episode of
melena.  Her hema
