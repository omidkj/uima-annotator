CT NECK:
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal signs of infection or abscess in the neck.
2. Probable small right pleural effusion.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of ischemia and no etiology for diffuse abdominal
pain.
2. Stable extensive vasculopathy.
3. Small right pleural effusion, perihepatic fluid, and
generalized anasarca without evidence of abscess.
TTE:
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to
cooperate.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Free wall motion could not be assessed. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**11-9**] MRI C spine:
1. Confirming the suspicion of infectious phlegmon in the left
more than right ventral epidural space, extending over roughly 4
cm (CC), from the C3 through C6 level. Though there is no
specific evidence of liquefactive necrosis to suggest frank
abscess formation, such findings are unusual, in general, in the
cervical spine, and this study has poor contrast resolution.
2. Process is centered on the C3 through C5 vertebrae, which
demonstrate
abnormal signal and patchy heterogeneous enhancement after
contrast
administration, suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis, with
probable component of discitis at the C4-5 level, at least.
There is also a prevertebral component to the phlegmon, as
demonstrated on the earlier study.
3. No cervical spinal cord signal abnormality at this time.
4 No other finding suspicious for osteomyelitis or epidural
abscess in the remainder of the cervical or thoracolumbar spine
(though the imaging is quite limited).

[**11-16**] C Spine CT:
Status post C4 and C5 vertebrectomy and anterior fusion with
normal alignment.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 year-old woman initially admitted w fever and found to have
persistent MRSA bacteremia.  Hospital course by problem:
.
1. Cervical osteomyelitis, MRSA bacteremia: She underwent spine
imaging and TEE.  Noted to have osteo of c-spine.  Her HD line
was pulled and she underwent a line holiday.  She was treated
with c4/5 corpectomy and c3-6 anterior fusion on [**11-15**] by spine
surgery.  The tissue grew MRSA.  Last positive blood cx was from
[**11-13**].  Patient will need the following:
- continue [**Location (un) **] J per spine team.  She may remove for shower
only
- continue IV vanco dosing w dialysis.  Continue rifampin [**Hospital1 **].
She will need 6 weeks of total therapy from [**11-15**] - [**12-27**].  She
will followup with the [**Hospital **] clinic.  She will need surveillance
labs sent WEEKLY to the [**Hospital **] clinic attng Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] via f
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **]
- f/u with neurosurgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], within the next 4-6 weeks.
- Please remove staples on [**11-23**] per neurosurgery team.
- continue surveillance blood cultures intermittently during HD
- oxycodone, tylenol, tramadol prn, lidocaine patch for pain
control
.
2. End-stage renal disease on HD: Continue HD T,Th,Sat as
scheduled.  She underwent line holiday with new HD line placed
in left IJ on [**11-19**].  She tolerated HD well with her new line
prior to discharge.  F/u with renal team.  Continue phos
binders.
.
3. Diabetes mellitus: continue outpt regimen of DM control
- metoclopramide for gastroparesis prn
.
4. Insomnia, depression
- continue bupropion, trazadone, mirtazapine,
.
5. Right eye pain - seen by ophthmo and dx w episcleritis during
hosp stay.  Received motrin 800mg q8h scheduled.  Had no eye
pain by discharge.  We recommend using motrin prn then
discontinuing it as tolerated.  She is at risk of GIB given her
renal disease so this should not be longterm med.
- she should f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in ophthmo in [**Last Name (un) **].
.
6. CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
- continue metoprolol, statin; held ASA post-operatively
- restarted ASA 81mg on [**11-21**].  Ok per d/w neurosurgery
.
FEN. renal diet; sevelamer with meals when eating
Access. PIVx2, L subclavian CVL
- L subclavian CVL was removed on [**11-21**] prior to discharge to
rehab
