Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
calf claudication/LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-12-19**] AVR (CE 23mm pericardial)/CABG x 3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
OM1, SVG to OM3)


History of Present Illness:
51 year old man who presents with symptoms
of calf claudication, bilateral lower extremity pain who was
found to have pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR, an EKG with
an intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle morphology,
poor RWP progression, Q in III.  Echo done showed EF 20-25%,
critical AS. Cardiac enzymes have been flat. He reports B/l calf
"fatigue" x several months, relieved by rest and associated with
some shortness of breath. He denied any significant LE edema in
the past.  In the week prior to admission, he had a significant
increase in B/L LE edema, making it difficult for him to
ambulate.  He also reports increase in DOE with the LE edema.
Cardiac surgery consulted for evaluation for valve replacement


Past Medical History:
tobacco abuse
MVA in [**2130**]

Social History:
Currently smokes half a pack daily. Smoked over a pack daily for
about 20 years. Drinks several days for week. Only beer. The
most he will drink is 6 when watching a game, but usually just
2. Works in property management. Lives by himself. Divorced 10
years ago.


Family History:
Hyperlipidemia
Says his father had "blockage" and a stent in his 60s

Pertinent Results:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global hypokinesis and more severe
hypokinesis of the inferior wall (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets
appear to move normally. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-12**],
the aortic valve has been replaced with a normal functioning
bioprosthesis. Global LVEF is improved.

Echo, [**2131-12-26**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated,
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-12-12**],
the aortic valve has been replaced with a normal functioning
bioprosthetic AVR. Left ventricular cavity is smaller/now
smaller, and systolic function is improved.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2129**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-19**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see
operative note. Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
titrated levophed, milrinone, and amiodarone drips. Extubated
the following morning. PICC placed for IV access. All drips
weaned off by POD #5. Early AM [**12-25**], he developed VT and was
unresponsive. He was immediately shocked X 1 with good response.
IV amiodarone continued for his Hx of ectopy intraop and postop.
EP consulted for further management.  Medical management of
rhythm was optimized and cardiac meds were titrated as
tolerated.  EP concluded that episode was related to
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (secondary to EtOH), and this
combined with CHF did not warrant an ICD at this time.  EP
recommended a defibrillator vest on discharge.  The patient
remained stable through the remainder of the hospital course
without further rhythm disturbance.  The Life Vest was
implemented and will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on discharge.
The patient was discharged home with VNA on POD 10.
