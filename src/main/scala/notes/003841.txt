Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) 26058**] Mitral leaflet, CAD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
[**2165-6-27**] CABGx1 (SVG->OM), Mitral Valve Replacement (pericardial)


History of Present Illness:
70 y.o. female with HTN, CAD, recent PCI in [**2163**] w/ stent to
RCA, 2 days s/p discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] presents with dypsnea and
found to have acute mitral regurgitation.  She was in her USOH
after her discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] 2 days ago (during which time a
pMIBI demonstrated a reversible inf/lat defect without cardiac
cath).  She then quickly became markedly dyspneic and was unable
to lie flat.  She presented to the ER where SBP 155, HR 112, O2
was 80% on RA and 100% on CPAP.  She was given 180 IV lasix,
morphine and nitro with marked improvement in dyspnea.  She was
admitted to the CCU on 2 liters O2 and a bedside echo
demonstrated severe 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] posterior mitral leaflet.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. CAD s/p stenting (see below)
3. DM
4. s/p hip and [**Last Name (un) **] fracture secondary to fall, recently
d/c'ed from Rehab
5. former smoker

Echo [**9-17**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal
(LVEF 60%); the basal segments of the inferior free wall and
posterior wall are hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but not stenotic. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cath [**9-17**]:
  1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with two vessel disease. The LMCA was without significant
disease. The stent in the proximal LAD was widely patent without
flow limiting stenosis. The distal LAD had a 50% stenosis. The
LCX had a 40% stenosis in its mid segment and a 60% stenosis in
its distal portion. The RCA had a patent stent proximally. The
mid RCA was subtotally occluded.
 2. Successful PCI of the mid-RCA with a 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher DES.
 Final angiography demonstrated no dissections, no residual
stenosis, and TIMI-3 flow.
