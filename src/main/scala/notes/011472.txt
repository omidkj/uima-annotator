Echo:
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %). with mild global free wall
hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Mitral annulus measures 4.3cm.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is on Epi and Milrinone infusions.
There is moderate LV systolic dysfxn. The septum and inferior
septum are very HK. The LV is otherwise globally HK.
The RV remains moderately HK.
There is a mitral ring prosthesis in place with no leak, no MR.
Residual peak gradient = 6 mmHg, and area = 3.2.
AI remains 1+. Aorta intact.

Vein Mapping: [**2195-11-4**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] with measurements was performed of the right
and left greater and lesser saphenous veins.
On the right, the greater saphenous vein is patent from the
ankle to the upper thigh, and measures between 0.22-0.55 cm in
diameter (at the greater
saphenous-SFV junction). The lesser saphenous vein was not well
evaluated.
On the left, the greater saphenous vein is patent from the level
of the knee to the upper thigh, measuring 0.16-0.40 cm in
diameter (at the greater saphenous vein-SFV junction). Multiple
varicosities are noted in the lower left calf.
IMPRESSION: Patent right greater saphenous vein from the ankle
to the upper thigh and the left greater saphenous vein from the
knee to the upper thigh.

CXR:
[**2195-11-5**]:
Persistent opacification at the bases consistent with effusion
and
atelectasis. There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure.
[**2195-11-3**]: 1. No evidence of pneumonia. Cardiomegaly.  Fullness
of the right hilus is incompletely evaluated and could reflect
fluid overload or adenopathy. This could be better evaluated
with PA and lateral radiographs if the patient is able to
tolerate.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the CVICU on [**2195-11-4**] following
coronary artery by-pass (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-AM-SVG-PDA/MVRepair (#30mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future Ring). See
operative report for further details. In the first twenty four
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without complications.  On post operative day
one he was started on beta blockers and diuretics.  He continued
to do well and was transferred to the floor hemodynamically
stable.

Respiratory: aggressive incentive spirometer, nebs and
ambulation he titrated off oxygen with room air oxygen
saturations of 98%

Chest tubes: chest tubes were removed on POD1.

Cardiac: On POD1 he had an episode of atrial fibrillation,
started on a amiodarone drip transitioned to PO. He converted to
sinus rhythm and Beta-Blockers were titrated as needed for
better rate control. The pacing wires were removed on POD4. He
remained hemodynamically stable. ACE was started on [**2195-11-8**].
Low-dose ASA& Statin were continued.

GI: benign.  H2 blockers and bowel regime were given

Nutrition: diabetic diet was started on POD1 and he tolerated

Renal: diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed.  The
Foley was removed with good urine output.  Electrolytes were
repleted.  His Renal function remained within normal limits.

Endocrine: While in the SICU he was on an insulin drip and
transitioned to insulin SS with blood sugars < 150.

Heme: transfused on [**2102-11-4**] 1 unit PRBC for HCT 27 to HCT 30.
On [**2195-11-7**] he was given 2.5 mg of Warfarin for atrial
fibrillation.  Cardiac surgery will follow INR/coumadin dosing
until PCP is established as directed on discharge instructions.

Neuro: awake, alert and oriented.  Pain was control with opioids
and acetaminophen.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy and deemed safe for
home.  He was seen by social work to assist with disability
papers from work.  He was discharged to home with his wife and
[**Name (NI) 269**] on POD 5.
