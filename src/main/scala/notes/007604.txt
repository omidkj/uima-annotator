Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure, subsequent transfer to MICU for angioedema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thrombectomy by IR
PEG placement - converted to G-J tube
Tracheostomy
Chest Tube placement/removal

History of Present Illness:
62 y.o. F with h/o ESRD on HD, s/p failed kidney transplant on
prograf, h/o DVT (associated with HD catheter) - on coumadin,
who was admited to neurology service ([**1-10**]) after experiencing
becoming unresponsive due to presumed seizure during her
scheduled HD (at OS facililty). Patient subsequently transfered
to MICU in the morning of [**1-11**] after she was found to be severely
hypertensive to 220/120 with tachycardia to 130s, elevated K,
and continued seizure activity - unresponsiveness.
.
Patient during initial presentation was found "catatonic",
tracking but not able to speak or follow comands. No active
convulsions were noted. She was spontaneously moving her all
extremities equally. Patient was felt to have nonfluent aphasia
with mouth twitching and left gaze palsy that resolved with
adminstration of ativan. CT head showed no evidence of acute
stroke, no tPA was administered as she was felt more likely to
have a seizure. Patient was also loaded with dilantin at that
point (1 gm). She was continued on Dilantin 100 mg IV q8; An
extra 700 mg and 300 mg IV dose was give @ 7 pm [**1-10**]. Patient was
subsequently given Kayexcalate and CaGluconate, insulin and D50
for hyperkalemia and peaked T waves @ 2 am. She was given about
1L NS overnight as well. In the morning, patient was
unresponsive to vocal commands, but gesturing to noxiuos
stimuli. Her angioedema including lip and eye swelling appeared
to have worsened over last 12 hours. She initially appeared to
be protecting her airway. A nasal trumpet was inserted and she
was bagged on her way to the MICU. Patient was also given 2 mg
Ativan @ 7 am; Of note her FS was 35 @ 4 pm [**1-10**] as well, and
went to 143 after D50 amp. (It was 63 upon ED presentation).
Patient also had respiratory acidosis with likely worsening
transcellular shift of potassium. Patient was subsequently
hypertensive to 220/110 upon arrival, with HR in 120s,
responding only to noxious stimuli with impressive angioedema.
Patient was subsequently intubated using Rocuronium with 7.5
ETT, moderate to severe vocal edema noted. Patient with
transient desaturation to 60s with quick recovery upon bagging.
Patient was given 10 mg of IV labetalol for BP 220/110 during
intubation, subsequently after IV propofol was started,
rocuronium and intubation patient's SBP dipped to 60s, it
improved to 90-100s over next 10 minutes after 300 cc of NS
bolus. Post-intubation Xray was showed ETT 4 cm above coryna
with large sided PTX and CT surgery was called.

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
as above in HPI
.
EKG:
NSR @ 88, nl axis; no STE in precorrdial leads; markedly reduced
voltage compared to prior
.
[**1-10**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and
sleeping
states due to the disorganized background, initially [**7-14**] Hz, but
later
interrupted by prolonged bursts of moderate amplitude
generalized mixed
theta and delta frequency slowing with a bifrontal predominance.

Findings are consistent with an encephalopathy, which suggests
bilateral
subcortical or deep midline dysfunction. Medication, metabolic
disturbances and infection are among the common causes of
encephalopathy. Of note, the superimposed faster beta frequency
rhythm
likely represents medication effect. No clearly epileptiform
features
were noted and no electrographic seizures were seen.
.
Head CT [**1-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or infarct. Normal CT perfusion
study.
2. No evidence of occlusion or flow-limiting stenosis in the
vessels of the head or neck.
3. Old infarcts in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter as described above.
.
[**1-11**] UE US:
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite flow seen within either the right or left
internal jugular vein, likely chronically thrombosed as
previously reported. The venous flow seen in vessels medial to
the carotid arteries, bilaterally, likely represent flow within
prominent collateral vessels.
2. Abnormally sluggish and "to-and-fro" flow seen within the
subclavian veins, bilaterally, more evident on the right than
the left. In this setting, these findings raise the possibility
of more central (ie. SVC), perhaps partially occlusive, venous
thrombosis.
3. Thrombosis of the right cephalic vein, while brachial vein is
patent.

COMMENT: Depending on patient's overall condition and the state
of the patient's renal function and timing of dialysis, further
evaluation with possible CT venography, MR venography with time-
of-flight images (as gadolinium may be interdicted), or
radionuclide pertechnetate venous flow- study may provide
further information.
.
[**1-11**] SVC gram:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral upper extremity venograms demonstrating relatively
stable appearance of complete thrombosis of the distal right
subclavian and right brachiocephalic vein with extensive venous
collaterals.
2. Interval progression of thrombosis of the left upper
extermity veins with complete occlusion extending from the left
mid axillary vein to the the left brachiocephalic vein,
supported by extensive venous collaterals.
3. Delayed opacification with contrast identified centrally of
the azygous vein and superior vena cava, although assessment of
these vessels is limited secondary to the poor bolus of contrast
from extensive thoracic collateral vein
