Service:  OMED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male with
recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the base of
the tongue, who was admitted for treatment of this new
cancer.  The patient initially presented with difficulty
hearing and left ear pain, and noted to have a large
pharyngeal mass prompting a work-up including a CT scan.  The
patient was seen in clinic for evaluation of his pharyngeal
cancer with possible biopsy.  The patient was also evaluated
by anesthesia who wanted cardiac clearance for upcoming
surgery.

Head CT performed in [**2196-3-24**] showed a 4 cm left tongue mass
with positive lymphadenopathy.  The patient underwent a
fine-needle aspiration consistent with squamous cell
carcinoma.  The patient is to be seen by radiation oncology
for possible XRT with plans to place a Port-a-Cath for
adjunctive chemotherapy.

The patient reports adequate pain control today, tolerating
thick fluids.  He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
abdominal pain.  He hasn't had a bowel movement for several
days.  He complains of generalized weakness and some fatigue
with only minimal ambulation.  He denies fevers, chills,
night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 98.2,
blood pressure 110/70, heart rate 50, respiratory rate 16,
98% on room air.  General:  No acute distress, somewhat
anxious-appearing elderly male.  HEENT:  Pharyngeal mass of
the left palate and tongue, increased pigmentation of his
tongue.  Neck:  Mild tenderness on the left, positive
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur, normal S1 and S2, no rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Midline incision with G-tube, soft, nontender,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:
1+ pedal edema, cool, no evidence of cyanosis, 2+ brachial
pulses bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse on the right, no
dorsalis pedis on the left.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed a white blood
cell count of 7.9, hematocrit 39, MCV 88, platelet count 388.
Coagulation studies were PT 12.8, PTT 30.1, INR 1.1.
Chemistries showed a sodium of 143, potassium 3.7, chloride
102, bicarbonate 30, BUN 14, creatinine 1.1, glucose 117,
albumin 3.4.  Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.018,
20 white blood cells, moderate bacteria, negative nitrites,
small leukocyte esterase.

CT of the neck ([**2196-4-7**]) showed a 4 cm mass at the tongue
base left of midline with inferior extension to
pre-epiglottic space, 1.4 cm lymph node lateral to the left
carotid bifurcation.

Chest x-ray ([**2196-5-9**]) showed increased opacity of the right
lower lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Hematology-oncology:  The patient was
admitted with recently diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of
his tongue.  He was kept on his outpatient pain regimen with
MSO4 IV p.r.n. and Percocet 1-2 tablets p.r.n. for
breakthrough pain.  The patient underwent XRT mapping and
initiated radiation therapy on [**2196-5-16**].  A Port-a-Cath was
placed on [**2196-5-16**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  As the
patient was bout to undergo XRT on [**2196-5-16**], he refused to
undergo treatment secondary to fatalism, "I want to lay down
and die".  By [**2196-5-18**] the patient had begun XRT, but over
the next several days became extremely combative with staff
members and required Haldol and a sitter.  The patient had a
brief stay in the unit secondary to respiratory arrest and
once transferred back to the floor he continued to refuse
XRT.  Psychiatry saw the patient on his return to the floor
and determined him to be competent to make this decision.  A
family meeting was conducted with the attending and it was
decided to withhold XRT and chemotherapy at this time.

2. Cardiopulmonary:  The patient was initially seen by
cardiology as a consultation for potential surgery on
hospital day number one.  His [**Doctor Last Name **] Risk Index was three,
which placed him in Class I, determined to be a 1.3% risk of
death or major complication from surgery.  They recommended
continuing his beta blocker, atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.  The
patient was cardiovascularly stable until [**2196-5-22**] when he
suffered a hypoxic, hypercarbic respiratory arrest,
complicated by bleeding in his oropharynx during intubation.
The patient was transferred to the ICU and given clindamycin
and levofloxacin secondary to question of aspiration, as well
as a right-sided infiltration seen on chest x-ray.  The
patient had a troponin that peaked at 3.0 and eventually
trended down.  There was a question of an inferior defect and
the patient was maintained on low-dose aspirin throughout his
hospitalization.

On [**2196-5-24**] the patient's blood pressure was noted to have
decreased into the 80s.  He was fluid resuscitated with one
liter of normal saline and two units of packed red blood
cells, as well as the use of Levophed.  Chest x-ray at this
time showed worsened opacification.  Sputum sample was sent
and became positive for MRSA.  Vancomycin was added to his
antibiotic regimen.  The patient was placed to ceftazidime
the following day.  Throughout the rest of the patient's
hospitalization, his blood pressure was stable and he was
stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.

3. Infectious disease:  On admission to the hospital the
patient was placed on levofloxacin for a question of urinary
tract infection, given his urinalysis which showed moderate
bacteria.  He received a full seven-day course.  After the
patient's hypoxic, hypercarbic respiratory arrest, the
patient was started on clindamycin and levofloxacin secondary
to a question of aspiration, as well as a right-sided
infiltration shown on chest x-ray.  On [**2196-5-24**] the patient's
chest x-ray showed worsened opacification and the following
day MRSA grew out in his sputum.  Because of continuing
fevers on his antibiotic regimen, the patient was switched to
vancomycin and ceftazidime.  On the following day the patient
respiked a temperature to 103 and ceftazidime was
discontinued at this time.  The patient has received 12 full
days of vancomycin IV and is to continue for a full 14-day
course as an outpatient.

4. ENT:  The patient suffered a hypoxic, hypercarbic
respiratory arrest on [**2196-5-22**], which was complicated by
bleeding in his oropharynx during the intubation.  The
patient at this time received a tracheostomy tube and was
followed by the ENT service.  One week following the
placement of his tracheostomy tube, the patient was seen by
ENT and received a new tracheostomy tube.  The patient was
seen by speech and swallow on [**2196-6-2**], who recommended
continuing a cuffed tracheostomy due to aspiration of thin
liquids seen on the swallow study.  The patient has thick
tenacious sputum such that the speech and swallow
consultation team felt he could not handle, and recommended
leaving the cuff up while the patient is taking p.o.  the
patient was also given a voice valve to be fit into his
tracheostomy tube to enable effective communication.

5. Psychiatry:  On [**2196-5-14**] the patient was noted to be
verbally abusive to nursing about an alleged incident that
didn't occur, and became increasingly threatening to house
staff and hospital staff members.  Psychiatry was consulted
and the patient was given Zyprexa q. day on [**2196-5-15**].  On
[**2196-5-16**], the patient refused XRT secondary to fatalism, and
the following day was confused about place and year, with
increasing hostility to staff members.  On [**2196-5-18**] the
psychiatry consult felt that he was delirious and recommended
increasing the Zyprexa and checking psychiatry laboratory
studies.  TSH was negative at that time.  Vitamin B12 and
thiamine were also negative.  The patient required a sitter
on [**5-18**] and was still combative the following day.  On
[**2196-5-20**] a code purple was called when the patient threw a
chair at his sitter and swung a cane at he house staff
officer taking care of him.  He was placed in restraints and
remained combati
