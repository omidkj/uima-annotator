History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 70M with history of advanced MS, anxiety, CAD
status post CABG presenting from nursing home with acute renal
failure, fever to 101.
.
Patient reports feeling unwell for the last few days with
diarrhea and dysuria.  He was having low grade temperatures with
a positive urine culture with proteus bacteria with multiple
resistances.  For this he was started on Tobramycin 350mg X two
doses 12 hours apart starting [**3-3**] in the evening.  By morning,

([**2-3**] - [**2-12**]) for R sided PNA and COPD exacerbation.  He has also
had worsening anema from baseline Hct of 39 to 32, with iron
deficieny and was started on iron supplmentation last week.
Stools have been guaic negative.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T99.3 HR 64 BP 87/48 RR 16
O2 sat 99%.   Triggered for hypotension in mid 80s. Foley
catheter was placed for urine sample with output of small amount
of blood and dark urine. Received 300 cc NS  with improvement of
his BP to BP100/52 HR71 BP30  O2 sat 98% on 2L.  He received
vancomycin and levofloxacin.

CXR [**3-4**]: Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with
infection in the
proper clinical setting. Recommend repeat after treatment to
document
resolution of this finding and of nodular opacity in the right
mid lung.
.
Renal U/S [**3-5**]: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm and the left
kidney measures 11.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis seen
bilaterally. No cyst or stone or solid mass is seen in either
kidney. The bladder is collapsed on a Foley catheter.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound. No hydronephrosis
identified
.
CT chest [**2199-3-6**]
1. Loculated moderate right pleural effusion. Adjacent
consolidation most
likely reflecting rounded atelectasis.
2. Nodular opacity seen on the radiograph most likely represents
summation of shadows or atelectasis adjacent to the major
fissure, 4:108.
3. A loculated pleural effusion and rounded atelectasis are of
uncertain
chronicity.
4. Right upper lobe 3.5-mm nodule that in the presence of severe
emphysema should be reevaluated in one year for documentation of
stability. Given the presence of multiple mediastinal lymph
nodes, a short-term followup is recommended such as three to six
months.
5. Calcified gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.
6. Lunate shape of the trachea that might reflect
tracheomalacia, if
clinically indicated, correlation with dedicated assessment of
the trachea is
recommended.
.
TTE [**2199-3-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No left ventricular thrombus seen. Mild symmetric
LVH with normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation
.
Chest CT [**3-8**]: 1. Interval placement of a right pleural catheter
with decrease in size of the right pleural effusion and
persistent but decreased adjacent atelectasis.
2. Hypodensity of the contents of the left ventricle with
possible discrete area of thrombus, although this most likely
represents artifact. Although suspicion is low, further
evaluation is recommended with echocardiogram
.
Chest CT [**3-10**]: 1. No significant change in the right
hydropneumothorax with drainage catheter in situ. 2. Stable
parenchymal changes in the subpleural right lower lobe which
could reflect pneumonic consolidation, rounded atelectasis, or a
combination of the two.

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2199-3-11**]):
      STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS (MILLERI) GROUP.    SPARSE GROWTH.


Urine culture was done at an OSH, had multi-drug resistant
proteus


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, recent PNA,
recurrent UTI, who presents with fever, urinary tract infection
and acute renal failure, later found to have strep milleri
empyema.
.
# Urinary tract infection, w/ urosepsis: initially presented
febrile and hypotensive to 80's. He was initially in the MICU,
but responded very well to IVF, so was called out after 24
hours. He grew resistant proteus, and was started on meropenem.
He was initially to complete a 2 week course, but then empyema
was found so course of meropenem extended to 28 days minimum. A
PICC line was inserted on [**3-8**]. While on meropenem, should check
weekly CBC with dif, BUN, Creatini
