Allergies:
Vincristine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
Tumor lysis, respiratory failure, pituitary macroadenoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Central Venous Line
Occuloplasty: Right Eye Lid approximation


History of Present Illness:
40 yo homeless [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] admitted for workup of acromegaly, found to
have laboratory abnormalities consistent with tumor lysis
syndrome, also with respiratory distress.
He was admitted on [**2144-7-11**] as OSH transfer for multiple concerns
including bell's palsy, urinary retention, pituitary
macroadenoma, acromegaly, persistent sinus tachycardia, scrotal
pain and swelling, bilateral LE weakness, thecal/ epidural
enhancement in thoracic region, and tumor lysis syndrome
concerning for underlying malignancy.
.
Patient received 150cc NS/hr for rising tumor lysis labs and
became progressively more dyspnic with increasing oxygen
requirement. Cardiology was consulted for persistent sinus
tachycardia non-responsive to IV fluids and he was started on po
metoprolol 50mg TID.  He was being treated w/ acyclovir and
prednisone for question of viral-induced Bell's Palsy. Endocrine
and neurosurgery were following and work-up ongoing for
pituitary macroadenoma and acromegaly. MR of T spine was
performed to evaluate LE weakness, without evidence of cord
compression. Heme/onc on the day prior to transfer attempted
bone marrow biopsy but could not obtain due to respiratory
distress induced with prone positioning.
.
Patient transferred from floor to the ICU because, he had
received 150cc NS/hr, received 20mg IV lasix x3 in 8 hours. UOP
had been good but oxygen requirement had increased to 5L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, non-invasive ventilation was attempted
but unsuccessful [**2-17**] facial structure. He received nitro gtt,
morphine 2mg Iv, metoprolol 10 mg Iv, and 40mg IV lasix without
improvement in his respiratory status and was intubated.

.
[**2144-10-27**] CT torso w/contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease of left lower lobe atelectasis.

2. Stable biliary ductal dilatation without etiology identified.


3. Unchanged picture of severe constipation.

4. Sacral decubitus ulcer defect decreased in size with apparent
vacuum
dressing in place. No definite evidence for sacral destructive
process.

5. Filling defects in the left and possibly right common femoral
veins. While
this could represent flow artifact, cannot exclude deep vein
thrombosis.
Recommend followup with ultrasound study.

6. Mild splenomegaly unchanged.
.
[**9-12**] U/S LE:
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus in the left common femoral,
superficial
femoral and popliteal veins. No thrombus in the right lower
extremity.
.
[**9-10**] MRI L-spine:
IMPRESSION: Limited examination demonstrates markedly decreased
bone marrow
signal, likely relating to the patient's lymphoma. There is no
cauda equina
compression, though evaluation for intradural disease is limited
in the
absence of intravenous contrast. Degenerative changes are
present as
detailed. Striking signal abnormality and probable atrophy
within paraspinal
musculature and psoas muscles which should be correlated with
the patient's
history.
 .
[**8-15**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia in an atrial bigeminal pattern. RSR' pattern
in lead V1
with early transition suggests an incomplete right bundle-branch
block. Low
QRS voltage in the precordial leads. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2144-8-12**] atrial bigeminy is present.
The QRS voltage
in the precordial leads has decreased.
.
Echo 7.30:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
[**8-4**] MRI head:
IMPRESSION:

1. Enlarged pituitary gland, mostly the left lobe, without
evidence of
hyperenhancement to suggest lymphomatous infiltration. This may
represent a
macroadenoma. Clinical correlation is recommended.

2. No other evidence of intracranial lymphoma.

3. Fluid in the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
.
[**9-1**] CT torso:
IMPRESSION:

1. Large ulceration mainly containing air and no discrete fluid
just
superficial to the sacrum, without evidence of osteomyelitis.

2. No evidence of inflammatory change in the abdomen to explain
constipation;
large amount of stool in the rectum.

3. Small amount of air around the right chest port device.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, 40M with tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy
on [**7-21**] for Burkitt-like lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly,
in ICU with respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia,
possible ARDS, and diffuse malignant infiltration. Original
presenting complaint was Bell??????s Palsy, urinary retention, and
lower extremity weakness.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated on [**7-12**] in the setting of LLL
PNA, lactic acidosis, and significant evidence of infiltrative
malignant process on CT with peribronchial thickening. Two
failed extubations on [**7-15**] and [**7-25**] secondary to copious
secretions and work of breathing, respectively. Patient was
initially maintained on AC, but was intermittently dysynchronous
with vent which improved with PSV. Throughout stay he maintained
large tidal volumes (700-800cc) and large minute ventilations
(10-15L/min). On [**7-18**] patient had increasing evidence of
infection and met criteria for ARDS, although compliance
remained normal and large tidal volumes were tolerated.
Respiratory status improved on broad spectrum abx and
significant diuresis. Patient was gradually weaned on PSV and
successfully extubated on [**7-30**]. On discharge, patient breathing
comfortably on room air.

PNEUMONIA/INFECTION: Initial CXR on [**7-12**] showed a LLL PNA. Later
CXRs showed a persistent infiltrate at the R base. Patient
received vanco, meropenem, cipro, cefepime, and doxycycline
during his stay. BAL grew mycoplasma hominis on [**7-19**] and sputum
grew coag+ staph on [**7-23**]. Starting [**7-22**], patient was neutropenic
and put on prophylactic fluconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone.
EBV serum PCR was positive (level of 40). CSF fungal, AFB, and
viral cx and EBV PCR were negative. HIV, HBV, HCV,
galactomannan, and B-glucan were negative as was evidence for
acute CMV or HHV-6 infection. Cultures from an A-line and from
an IJ both grew coag-negati
