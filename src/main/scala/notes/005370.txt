History of Present Illness:
57M was sent for echo after his PCP heard [**Name Initial (PRE) **] systolic murmur.
Echo demonstrated aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation, possibly
secondary to a bicuspid valve.  Pt was asymptomatic wtih rare
episodes of palpitations and occasional episodes of postural
lightheadedness that resolve spontaneously within seconds.
Catheterization demonstrated severe AR and normal coronary
arteries.

Aortic stenosis/regurgitation
Left ventricular hypertrophy, Heart murmur
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Diabetes mellitus type 2 (newly diagnosis ed [**3-/2200**])
S/P remote MVC with injury to liver as child
Left shoulder pain (going to PT with improvement)
Hemorrhoids

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-5-14**] cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no epicardial coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD, LCx,
and RCA were without angiographically apparent flow-limiting
stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension
with central aortic pressure of 117/59 mmHg. There were normal
left and
right-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 10 mmHg, PCWP mean
of 5
mmHg, and RVEDP of 7 mmHg.
3. Supravalvular aortogram showed severe aortic regurgitation, a
dilated
left ventricle, and moderately reduced LVEF.

[**2200-9-17**] echo:
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta,
aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Vena
contracta 0.46cm. Pressure [**1-6**] time 359msec.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-Bypass:

Patient is on a phenylephrine infusion s/p AVR.
There is a well seated #25 bioprosthetic aortic valve. There is
no evidence of a perivalvular leak. There is trace central AI.
Peak/mean gradients are measured at 21/11mm/Hg with a cardiac
output of 8.5.
Left ventricular function is preserved with an estimated EF-50%.
No wall motion abnormalities are noted.
Trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**].
There is no echocariographic evidence of an aortic dissection
post-decannulation. The remainder of the exam is [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**].

CXR [**2200-9-19**]: There is still some enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with left effusion and atelectatic changes at both
bases.  No vascular congestion. On the lateral view, there is
gas in the region of the retrosternal tissues, presumably
related to the recent surgery.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] on [**2200-9-17**] underwent Aortic valve replacement with
a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**] tissue valve, serial #[**Serial Number 35898**], reference number [**Serial Number 35901**].

Postoperatively, he was admitted to the CVICU, where he was
successfully extubated and weaned off pressors.  On POD 1, he
was transferred to the floor and his chest tubes were removed.
A beta blocker was started. On POD 2, his pacing wires were
remmoved. He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight. He was
seen by PT and cleared for d/c home.  On POD 4 he was discharge
to home with [**Location (un) 86**] VNA. He was hemodynamically stable,
ambulating, tolerating a PO diet, and his pain was controlled
with PO medication.  He will follow-up as an outpatient.
