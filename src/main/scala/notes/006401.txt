Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hip replacement
Picc line
Intubation
Trans esophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 88 yoM w/ Parkinson's disease, history of AF (on coumadin),
h/o CHF (EF 35-40%) presents with hypotension in the setting of
bleeding s/p fall. Patient was in USOH when he got up from a
chair to walk into the next room, felt a little lightheaded, and
fell on his left side, striking his left elbow and left hip. No
head trauma, LOC, or assoacited chest pain, palpitations, N/V,
loss of bowel/bladder control. The fall was unwitnessed, but
within several minutes, his family called EMS and he was
transported to [**Hospital 882**] hospital. There, a Head CT was (-) for
bleed, and he was noted to have a left femoral neck fracture and
a left elbow skin tear/abrasion. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. There, elbow plain films were without
fracture or dislocation. He was seen by orthopedics, who plan
surgery to repair the left hip on Tuesday. He was noted to be
bleeding copiously from left elbow abrasion, requiring ~12
dressing changes. He became progressively hypotensive to sbp
60s, and his HCT was noted to be 23 from 26.6 (baseline 32-35).
He received 1L NS and 2u PRBC with good response. His INR was
2.8. Currently, the patient reports left elbow and left hip
pain. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, numbness/tingling. Reports baseline left facial
droop. Reports baseline episodes of intermittent
lightheadedness/vertigo, which have been attributed to PD/PD
meds.

Brief Hospital Course:
A: 88 yoM w/ h/o PD, AF on coumadin presents s/p fall with left
femoral fracture and hypotension.

1) Hypotension: [**12-29**] dehydration and blood loss from large left
elbow skin tear in setting of elevated INR. Patients blood
pressure was managed with fluids and blood transfusions. Was
stable and did not need pressors. Other than admission he did
not have any further problems with hypotension.
.
2) Bacteremia: [**12-29**] left forearm tear: grew MRSA from swab of
left elbow. Patient spiked temp on [**6-1**], ID w/u was done but
vancomycin was not started until [**6-3**] once blood cultures
revealed GPC's. He was being covered in the interim for skin
flora with clindamycin as per recommendations of Ortho. He was
started on vancomycin empirically on [**2185-6-3**] and cultures 2 days
later grew MRSA bacteremia. 3/4 bottles on [**7-18**] on [**6-3**] all
other bottles NGTD. ID came to see patient and recommended 6
weeks of antibiotics. Left hip was not imaged due to metal
prosthesis. CT would show artifact and MRI CI with metal in hip.
Bone scan and White cell scan would give false positive given
recent surgery. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] from ortho had recommended tap of joint
for fluid collection, gram stain and culture but given risks of
procedure (CT guided tap of left hip) and risk of infection with
procedure, the teams (ID, Ortho, Medicine team) in agreement
with the family, decided that the best course of action was to
treat with Vancomycin for 6 weeks with therapeutic trough levels
above 15. Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and ID as outpatient and follow
ESR for infection. TEE was done and was negative for
endocarditis. Left elbow was imaged with films and was negative
for [**Last Name (un) 2043**] destruction/erosion. Patient had been afebrile since
spike on [**6-1**], white count since then was within normal range.

Left elbow: improved throughout hospital course. Pitting edema,
redness and tenderness improved throughout hospital stay. Good
granulation tissue in the wound, no pus or foul smelling odor.

3)Respiratory failure: [**12-29**] anesthetics from surgery, patient
intubated for airway protection, admitted to MICU for [**12-30**] day
and extubated successfully on day 2 of admission.

4) Anemia: blood loss superimposed on h/o Fe def anemia
Patient received 4u PRBC (last transfusion [**5-27**]), his
anticoagulation was reversed with FFP ad vitamin K. His
hematocrit has been stable since. The source of the bleed was
from the large skin tear on the left forearm/elbow area.
.
5) UTI: when patient spiked a fever on [**2185-6-1**], w/u of fever
revealed UTI with pansensitive proteus mirabilus. He was treated
with Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] for 7 days, remainder of days to be
continued at rehab.

6) Left femoral neck fracture: Seen by ortho in the ED who
recommended surgery for hip fracture. [**2185-5-31**] had
hemiarthroplasty, Surgery was uncomplicated. Placed metal
prosthesis in the left hip. Patient being seen by PT while
hospitalized.
.
7) Fall: Given lightheadedness prior to fall, the ddx includes
PD sx/PD meds (which patient attributes prior episodes of LH),
orthostais, vasovagal, myocardial ischemia, volume depletion
(given home lasix, spironolactone). No new neurological deficit
to suggest stroke. Patient ruled out for MI, ECG without any
acute changes, unclear whether this was purely a mechanical
fall. Telemetry without any other arrythmia other than atrial
fibrillation. PT saw patient post op and recommended further
rehab. No further c/o lightheadedness.
.
8) h/o CHF: Although no known h/o CAD, findings on TTE
concerning for prior ischemia.  Patient was euvolemic here w/o
c/o shortness of breath on exam. c/w with all his cardiac meds
with the exception of his lasix an spironolactone which will
need to be added back on as an outpatient.
.
9) AF: stable, rate controlled. INR reversed given bleed,
hematocrits stable and started on lovenox post op. Starting
coumadin at rehab for goal INR [**12-30**].
.
10) ARF on CRF: Cr 1.9 from b
