Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2112-6-10**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 3 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  He required multiple blood products in the
immediate post-op period.  He had VTac in the OR and was placed
on Amiodarone.  Permanent Pacemaker was interrogated.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  He
continued to have runs of VTac and was placed on PO Amio.
Coumadin was also resumed for chronic AFib.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to LiveCare of the [**Hospital3 **] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
