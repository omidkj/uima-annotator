History of Present Illness:
This is a 35 year old female with past medical history
significant for paranoid
schizophrenia. She jumped in front of a train per witness
reports. She was intubated in the field and was initially taken
to [**Hospital **] hospital but was deemed to unstable and was
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. She was found to
have a left subdural hematoma.


Past Medical History:
paranoid schizophrenia

She lives in group home. Family members actively involved in her
life.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
On Admission:
O: T:98.1  BP: 180/111    HR:88    R 18      O2Sats 96%
Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
HEENT: large hematoma right parietal/occipital Pupils: 2mm
minimally reactive    EOMs unable to assess
Neck: c-collar
Neuro:
Mental status: intubated and sedated

Cranial Nerves:
I: Not tested
II: Pupils 2mm and minimally reactive
III to XII: unable to assess

Motor: initially was not responding to noxious stimuli however
20
minutes after evaluation she moved to command per the trauma
team.  Upon assessment of her she was moving all 4 extremities
but unclear if it was truly to command

Sensation: unable to assess

Toes downgoing bilaterally

Coordination: unable to assess

Initially no corneals cough or gag on exam.  however when she
began moving her extremities she was noted to have a corneal on
the left, as well as a weak cough.

On Discharge: Opens eyes to voice and tracks. Occasionally
smiles. No commands and or mimicking of behavior.  Pupils [**5-26**]
bilaterally/gaze conjugate.  Right hemiparesis with right
facial. Purposeful with left UE and active.


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2155-6-5**]
1. Longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone with
extension to the
skull base, through the sphenoid sinus, to the left
squamotemporal bone.
Blood is present within the right mastoid air cells and right
middle cavity, with likely disruption of the right ossicles.
2. Non-displaced fracture of the right parietal bone, with
incomplete
extension to the vertex.
3. Acute left subdural hematoma with local mass effect. This, in
combination with diffuse edema, results in complete effacement
of sulci and the suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns. There
is also loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. These
findings are compatible with prolonged hypoxia in the context of
severe traumatic injury.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2155-6-5**]
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
2. Large amount of edema overlying the thyroid gland, most
compatible with
thyroiditis in the absence of secondary findings of traumatic
injury.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2155-6-6**]
1. Interval evacuation of the left subdural hematoma with a 2.7
cm
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the herniated brain portion
through the
craniectomy defect.
2. Worsening multifocal subdural, subarachnoid, intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
3. Continued cerebral edema and findings suggesting central
herniation. No
evidence of subfalcine herniation.
4. Unchanged multiple skull base fractures as previously
described.

CT head [**2155-6-10**]:
1. Increased herniating of left cerebral hemisphere through the
craniectomy defect. Slight interval enlargement of two dominant
foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe with
moderate increase in surrounding vasogenic edema compared to [**6-8**], [**2155**]. Unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage along the herniated
brain.
2. Decreased subdural blood layering along the falx cerebri.
Stable small
bifrontal and paratentorial subdural hematomas.

[**2155-6-13**] LENIS:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

CXR [**2155-6-15**]:
There has been interval decrease in the amount of free air seen
below the hemidiaphragms. The left subclavian line tip is in the
SVC.
Tracheostomy tube is in similar location. There is improved
aeration in the left mid lung. There is no focal infiltrate.


Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2155-6-30**]


FINDINGS:
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true interictal epileptiform
discharges
were seen.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true electrographic seizures were
seen.
These were typically detections of artifact which contaminated
many of
the leftsided electrodes. Selected review of the video
demonstrated no
apparent change in the patient's clinical behavior in
association with
these detections.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: A review of sampled excerpts of
continuous
EEG demonstrated background activity that was very slow and
disorganized
throughout the recording. The posterior dominant rhythm was
typically
in the delta frequency range although occasional periods of
theta
frequency activity were seen. Many of the sampled excerpts were
contaminated by the electrode artifact described above, however.

SLEEP: No normal sleep architecture was seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or interictal
epileptiform
discharges were seen. The background was very slow and
disorganized
throughout the recording indicative of a severe encephalopathy.
Compared to prior days' recordings, left frontal epileptiform
activity
was no longer seen but the background remained unchanged.



Radiology Report CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-6-16**] 3:42
PM


Provisional Findings Impression: JMGw MON [**2155-6-16**] 5:13 PM
1. Moderate volume of pneumoperitoneum without leak of
Gastrografin
administered through the patient's gastrostomy tube.

2. Lingular atelectasis.

3. Tracheostomy tube in satisfactory position.

4. Eleventh and twelfth left posterior rib fractures.


Final Report
HISTORY: 32-year-old woman status post being hit by a train with
increased
pneumoperitoneum.

CT TORSO: Helical imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet
to the pubic
symphysis after uneventful administration of intravenous
contrast.
Gastrografin was administered through the patient's gastrostomy
tube.
Sagittal and coronal reformats were prepared.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2155-6-16**], torso [**2155-6-5**].

CT CHEST: The patient is intubated. Patient has a tracheostomy
with the tip
of the tracheostomy tube 1.7 cm above the carina. There is
lingular
atelectasis and hypoventilatory changes within the lungs. No
pneumothorax or
pleural effusion is present. The heart appears unremarkable.
There is no
significant axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The
partially
visualized lobes of the thyroid appear normal.

CT ABDOMEN: There is a moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum, with
a few
locules of air in the splenic hilum. Gastrografin administered
through the
patient's gastrostomy tube is not present within the peritoneal
cavity, but only remains within loops of bowel. There is a
gastrostomy tube within the antrum of the stomach and the
anterior wall the stomach is opposed to the peritoneum.
Abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal. The spleen,
adrenals, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder appear normal. The
kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without
masses, or hydronephrosis.

CT PELVIS: There is a small amount of free air within the
pelvis. Pelvic
loops of small and large bowel appear normal. The uterus and
adnexa appear
normal. No free fluid is present. There is a Foley catheter
within a
decompressed bladder. There is a small amount of air within the
nondependent portion of the bladder. There is no adenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: There is a minimally displaced left posterior
twelfth rib
fracture, slightly more displaced than on the prior examination.
There is
newly evident minimally displaced left eleventh rib fracture
