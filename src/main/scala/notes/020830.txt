Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation
RIJ placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo F with DMII, HTN, dementia, and paranoid
schizophrenia who presented from an OSH after a witnessed
cardiac arrest at her nursing home. Patient lives at [**Location 582**] x1
year. Per report, she was sitting in a chair before dinner when
she was noted to become blue, slumped down into her chair, and
became unresponsive. No report of chest pain or shortness of
breath. She was carried back to her room, and approximately 3
minutes elapsed before CPR was started. She was coded for 15
minutes, and reportedly had an AED placed with 1 shock prior to
EMT arrival. A perfusing rhythm was obtained, and she was
intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital6 **].
.
At OSH, pt's VS were 106/65 HR 100. EKG with ST depressions in
V2-V6 with no prior for comparison. She reportedly had another
VF arrest 20 minutes later, and was shocked at 200 J back in
sinus tachycardia. She received 300 mg IV amiodarone x1. She
then received ASA 325 mg PO x1, Plavix 600 mg PO x1, heparin gtt
with bolus, integrillin gtt with bolus, and benadryl 25 mg IV
x1. She underwent a cardiac catherization that showed a 90% left
main stenosis, 60% proximal left circumflex, 80% RCA, 90% lesion
followed by a long complex cork screw like 70% lesion in the
proximal RCA. Mid to distal RCA has a haze 95-99% lesion. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of CABG.
.
In the CCU, patient is unable to answer ROS due to intubation
and sedation. She was noted to have bleeding from groin site.
Angiosheath was removed and pressure held with good effect. NG
tube was noted to be draining ~250 ccs of dark, frothy,
coffee-ground blood. Gastric lavage was + after 750 ccs of
irrigation. Also noted to have upward deviated gaze and
seizure-like activity (first shaking of the upper extremities,
and then lower extremities, then tongue fasciculations).
Neurology urgently consulted, recommended IV dilantin load and
IV ativan (received 6 mg IV total) with good control of seizure
activity. A-line, R IJ placed, and patient sent for non-contrast
CT and CTA to assess for acute ICH prior to initiating Arctic
Sun protocol.

STUDIES:
.
CXR [**2177-12-28**] 1:00AM: In comparison with study of [**2177-12-24**], there
is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately
4.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper
stomach, though the side hole is in the distal esophagus. Right
IJ catheter extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to evaluate the
cardiac size, though it appears to be within upper limits of
normal. No definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
Probable mild atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.
.
CXR [**2177-12-28**] 7:30AM: In comparison with the study of earlier in
this date, there is little change. Monitoring and support
devices remain in place with the side hole of the nasogastric
tube just proximal to the esophagogastric junction. Mild
atelectatic changes persist at the bases.
.
CTA Head [**2177-12-28**]: Bilateral atherosclerotic disease involving
the carotid bifurcations with possible ulceration versus small
dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid as
described above. Fenestration at the anterior communicating
artery with small aneurysmatic formation measuring approximately
2 mm in size. Areas of low attenuation are identified at the
subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. Bilateral sinus
disease.
.
TTE [**2177-12-29**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
EEG [**2177-12-31**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to
slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm suggestive
of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Additionally, there are
rare sharp transients phase reversing in the left mid to
posterior temporal region consistent with possible increased
cortical irritability and potential for pileptogenesis. This
telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There was no
evidence of electrographic seizures in this recording.
.
EEG [**2178-1-1**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal noncontinuous
extended routine EEG due to mild slowing and disorganization of
the background rhythm and rare sharp transients in the left
anterior sylvian to midtemporal region. These findings suggests
a mild to moderate encephalopathy and po
