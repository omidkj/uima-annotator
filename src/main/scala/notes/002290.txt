Admission Date:  [**2173-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2173-2-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2135-2-18**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOVASCULAR

CONTINUATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-2-8**] the patient
developed an episode of shortness of breath, hypoxia with O2
sats up to 91% on room air.  The patient underwent further
evaluation.  Chest x-ray demonstrated lower lobe and
echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 15%.  The patient
responded well to intravenous Lasix.  The etiology of the
patient's heart failure remains unclear with the differential
diagnosis including HIV cardiomyopathy versus a viral
myocarditis.  The question of adenovirus in the patient's
stool and possible nasopharyngeal swab may be indication of
an acute viral illness.  The patient's volume status was
monitored carefully throughout the rest of his
hospitalization and the congestive heart failure service was
called to assist with management.  The patient had repeat
echocardiogram on [**2-19**], which demonstrated an EF of 15 to 30%
of global left ventricular hypokinesis and 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  At the time of discharge the patient's heart
failure management included Toprol XL 12.5 mg po q day and
Lasix 20 mg po q day.  The patient will need continued follow
up for proper titration of these medications including daily
weights, monitoring of input and output and pulse oximetry.
The patient is to follow up with the congestive heart failure
service in clinic on [**2173-3-15**] at 1:00 p.m. with a Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**].
The patient also was instructed to limit fluids 2 liters per
day.  Further investigation of possible adenovirus etiology
and question of further treatment necessary will be deferred
to the outpatient setting with the patient's primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6164**].

Psychiatric issues, the patient suffers from significant
anxiety for which he was taking Ativan prn at home upwards to
10 mg po q day.  Upon hospitalization his anxiety increased
with issues of confusion as well.  Psychiatry was consulted
for further management of his medical regimen including
attempts to control his anxiety with Ativan and Haldol, which
were unsuccessful.  He was subsequently switched to
intravenous Trilafon b.i.d. with good effect.  However, on
[**2-19**] the patient was noted to have significant stiffness,
difficulty moving, speaking and notable right sided weakness
after receiving his dose of Trilafon.  Intravenous Benadryl
was administered and in conjunction with the psychiatry team
Cogentin therapy was administered times three days.  The
patient's symptoms of stiffness slowly resolved as well as
the strength and sensory deficits.  Ischemic event was
excluded with noncontrast head CT and brain MRI.  Of note,
the patient is now considered intolerant of all antipsychotic
medications given this reaction.  At the time of discharge
the patient was maintained on Valium 5 to 10 mg po q 8 hours
prn.

Renal, the patient experienced acute bump in his creatinine
with results of treatment with Ambazone.  With this his
creatinine increased from 0.9 to 1.7 with treatment.
However, upon institution of fluid bolus prior to Ambazom
administration his creatinine decreased and stabilized at
1.5. Should plan to continue pretreatment for all doses of
Ambazome with 500 cc normal saline bolus.

Skin, the patient experienced a generalized erythrodermic
reaction, which he states is chronic and was present on
admission and improved dramatically with holding of the
patient's Bactrim.  Upon reinstitution of antibiotics
prophylaxis, the rash reappeared.  The patient tolerated this
condition well with no pruritus, no fever and no edema.  The
patient was maintained on Benadryl 25 mg intravenous prn.
