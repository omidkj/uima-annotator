Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Pt is a 45 yo with h/o Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, EtOH abuse,
PNA, withdrawal seizures, and sepsis who presents after being
found confused at home.  She has evidence of injury and
apparently told EMS it was due to a seizure 2 weeks ago, then
said it was due to tripping on her cat and falling recently.
She
was visually hallucinating and apparently seeing the Celtics at
her house.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p craniotomy for SDH evacuation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 45 yo with h/o Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, EtOH abuse,
PNA, withdrawal seizures, and sepsis who presents after being
found confused at home.  She has evidence of injury and
apparently told EMS it was due to a seizure 2 weeks ago, then
said it was due to tripping on her cat and falling recently.
She
was visually hallucinating and apparently seeing the Celtics at
her house.  She was confused but reportedly A&Ox3 at times at
the
OSH.  Head CT there showed a SDH (scan not sent with pt) and
C-spine CT was read here as normal.  She got dilantin 1g and INR
was 1 there.  Plts were 38 there.  She was given platelets and
sent here for eval.  Here her MS was much poorer, and a repeat
head CT showed a large SDH.  She was given
platelets and taken to the OR emergently.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-11-25**] 9:40 AM
Reason: rule out PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old woman with fever/CXR concerning for bronchopneumonia

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
rule out PNA
HISTORY: A 45-year-old female with fever and chest x-ray
concerning for bronchopneumonia. Rule out pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2115-11-24**].

CHEST PA AND LATERAL: Again seen is an ill-defined opacity in
the lingula as well as the left lower lobe, consistent with
bronchopneumonia. Lungs and pleural surfaces are otherwise
clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal.

IMPRESSION: Lingula and left lower lobe bronchopneumonia.

[**2115-11-16**] Head Ct
COMPARISON: [**2115-11-16**].
FINDINGS: Patient is status post right frontal, parietal and
temporal bone craniotomy and expected post-surgical changes are
seen including a large degree of predominantly right-sided
pneumocephalus. Previously seen epidural hematoma has been
evacuated. A small amount of extra-axialblood persists. There is
7-mm leftward subfalcine herniation. Small amount of
subarachnoid blood persists within the left temporal lobe. The
degree of parafalcine subdural hematoma along the falx and
layering over the right tentorium is mildly increased.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of large right-sided epidural hematoma
with small amount of right-sided extra-axial hematoma remaining.
Expected post-operative changes status post evacuation.
2. Left-sided temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged.
[**2115-11-17**] Head CT:
COMPARISON: [**2115-11-16**].
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Patient is status post right frontal,
parietal and temporal bone craniotomy for evacuation of right
convexity subdural hematoma. A drain terminates into the
anterior cranial fossa inferior to the right frontal lobe via a
right parietal approach. Extra-axial blood persists along the
right convexity, adjacent to the falx and layering on the
tentorium, essentially unchanged from prior exam. The degree of
leftward shift of normally midline structures (8 mm) and
effacement of the right hemispheric sulci and posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right lateral ventricle is unchanged. Basal cisterns remain
open. Small amount of subarachnoid blood persists within the
left temporal lobe. Expected postop pneumocephalus is again
identified. Mucosal thickening is identified within the
paranasal sinuses. The mastoid air cells remain normally
aerated.
IMPRESSION: Status post craniotomy and evacuation of right
convexity extra- axial collection. Essentially stable exam. No
new hemorrhage.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-11-20**] 10:05 AM
Reason: eval for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old woman s/p evacuation of EDH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAM: CT of the head.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subdural hematoma, for
assessment of interval change.

TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without
contrast. Comparison was made with the previous CT of [**2115-11-17**].

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, right-sided subdural drain
has been removed. There is a small right-sided
frontoparietooccipital subdural hematoma still identified with
decrease in size compared to the prior study with a maximum
width of approximately 8 mm in the parietal convexity region.
There remains slight midline shift to the left side. There is
also subdural blood seen along the right side of the tentorium
as before. There is no hydrocephalus seen.

IMPRESSION: Status post removal of the subdural drain. Small
subdural frontoparietooccipital hematoma is again noted and
hematoma along the tentorium is also seen, decreased from
previous study with resolution of air within the subdural space.
Slight right-to-left midline shift remains.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo with h/o Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, EtOH abuse, PNA,
withdrawal seizures, and sepsis who presents after being found
confused at home.  She has a large epidural and SDH on scan and
is currently in the OR for emergent evacuation.  She likely had
a
traumatic cause for this, but the exact reason is unknown and
she
can't tell us.
She was given Platelets prior to surgery x 2.
Post surgically she is admitted to ICU on trauma service. She
was started on Dilantin schedule. She also had a subdural drain
placed, which was removed on [**2115-11-17**] after f/u CT showed
improvement.
On [**11-19**] she was extubated successfully, and C-spine was
cleared.
On [**2115-11-21**] Dobbhoff was placed, and tube feeds were started;
however, on [**2115-11-21**] Dubbhoff was removed by patient.
She received 2 units of packed RBC on [**2115-11-22**], also she passed
the speech and swallow eval and diet was advanced.
[**11-24**] - [**11-26**] Pt with fevers Tmax 101.2, antibiotics started for
pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
