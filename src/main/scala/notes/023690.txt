Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
51 yo woman h/o T1-T2 paraplegia following MVC [**1-4**], chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and recent admission [**Date range (1) 49732**] for
COPD exacerbation (t/w rapid prednisone taper and 7-day course
of levofloxacin) who is admitted to the ICU for respiratory
distress and hypotension. History was taken from patient and her
friend [**Name (NI) **], who was present during the majority of the
interview.
.
Per patient, she was in her USOH until morning of admission.
When she awoke she felt "foggy" mentally, and she was coughing
up large amounts of clear sputum. She came to the ED where her
inital vitals were remarkable for hypotension to 90/60,
afebrile, with HR 55. She required non-rebreather to maintain
sats in the 90s. CXR was done which showed RLL pneumonia. Due to
the fact that she had difficult access and was hypotensive, a
right IJ was placed. She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin, and she was started on norepinephrine drip. Prior
to transfer to MICU, she had received about 2L IVF.
.
By the time she arrived to the MICU, she felt much better from a
respiratory standpoint. She denied chest pain or pressure,
lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, nausea or vomiting. She
denied abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She
denied joint pain, fever, or chills. Per patient and friend, her
mental status overall was much improved.
.

Wed [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased right base opacity with blunting of the right
costophrenic angle may represent a combination of pleural fluid
and right lower lobe pneumonia.  Patchy lateral left lung
opacity may reflect atelectasis. 2. Persistently enlarged
cardiac silhouette could be due to cardiomyopathy and/or
pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo F with COPD, h/o recurrent pneumonias, presents with
respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental
status in setting of likely RLL pneumonia
.
# Respiratory distress - differential includes pneumonia vs
bronchitis/bronchospasm. Rapid improvement after nebs in the
emergency room would be more consistent with the latter.
Patient initially admitted to ICU given hypotension.  Was
transiently on a norepinephrine drip, but was quickly weaned
off.  Received IV vanc, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin in the ICU
but was transitioned to just PO levafloxacin on call out to the
floor.  Patient tested negative for Legionella.  Anxiety also
likely played a large part in her shortness of breath as she
went up in her O2 requirement every time she became anxious on
this admission.  Patient was discharged to complete a 7 day
course of oral levofloxacin and a fast prednisone taper.
Patient will continue on her home regimen of inhalers.
.
# Altered mental status - resolved following nebulizers, likely
secondary to hypoxemia/hypercarbia from respiratory distress
.
# Hypotension - required norepi drip while in the ICU, but
quickly weaned off.  Patient was discharged to complete a 7 day
course of levofloxacin.
.
# Chronic pain - patient was continued on methadone, oxycodone,
and pregabalin per home regimen
.
# Hypothyroidism - patient continued on levothyroxine
.
# Chronic gastritis - patient continued on omeprazole
.
# Anxiety - patient continued on citalopram and klonopin
.
# Smoking history - patient continued on nicotine patch
