[**2133-11-6**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific ST
segment depression most pronounced in the lateral leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-9-3**] sinus tachycardia and
ST segment depression are new.

[**2133-11-6**]:  cat scan of abdomen pelvis:

 IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple locules of free air and mesenteric fluid surrounding

abnormal-appearing loops of small bowel in the right lower
quadrant and left mid to lower abdomen consistent with bowel
perforation and concern for ischemia. These loops of bowel
demonstrate wall thickening; however, they remain enhancing. An
air and fluid extraluminal collection in the right pelvis has
the appearance of stool and abuts small bowel and the sigmoid
colon.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, particularly along the sigmoid
colon.

2. Fat-containing ventral wall hernia with engorged vessels.

[**2133-11-7**]:  ECHO:

 Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic
function.

[**2133-11-12**]:  chest x-ray:

 Continued progressive worsening of volume status, with
increased cardiomegaly, bilateral effusions and pulmonary edema.


Dense retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects volume loss.

[**2133-11-13**]:  EKG:

 Sinus tachycardia, rate 102. Left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in leads I, II and V3-V6.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-11-6**] the rate has slowed
from sinus tachycardia, rate 129, to sinus tachycardia, rate
102. The non-specific ST-T wave changes are less prominent on
the current tracing. Otherwise, no diagnostic interval change.

[**2133-11-20**]:  chest x-ray:

 Asymmetric pulmonary edema now involves the left upper lobe.
Left lower lobe remains consolidated, and there is a large band
of atelectasis in the right mid lung. Right upper lung is clear.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Tip of the endotracheal tube above
the upper margin of the clavicles is at least 5 cm above the
carina, 15 mm above the optimal placement. Nasogastric tube
passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Left subclavian line
ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

[**2133-11-21**]: chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated. The left central venous access line and the
nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Unchanged left
pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis and right basal
atelectasis. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities
