[**7-27**] CXR: NG tube tip has been inserted and its tip is in the
stomach.  ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  Mediastinal
drain is in place.  Heart size is top normal.  The assessment of
the mediastinum demonstrates bulging of the aortopulmonic window
that might be due to pericardial effusion or hematoma, attention
to this area is recommended.  Patient has mild pulmonary edema.
Left retrocardiac opacity is new and might reflect atelectasis,
although aspiration cannot be excluded.

[**7-28**] CXR: As compared to the prior study, there is interval
improvement of the mediastinal appearance, most likely
consistent with resolution of atelectasis. Bilateral pleural
effusions have slightly increased as well as bibasal
atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.

[**8-2**] CTA: No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Bilateral pleural
effusions, increased in size since [**7-19**], with overlying
atelectasis; however, infectious process cannot be excluded,
particularly in the right lower lobe. Mild pulmonary edema.
Slightly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes since [**7-19**].
Calcified thyroid nodule in the right lobe.

[**8-3**] CXR: Heart size and mediastinal contours remain within
normal limits
allowing for technique.  There is marked interval improvement in
bilateral
upper zone pulmonary vascular re-distribution and patchy
consolidation
consistent with improvement in pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
infrahilar and
bibasilar opacities persist.  Probable small left pleural
effusion.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.

[**8-6**] ECHO: Very poor image quality. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall
contractility. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to the
prior study dated [**2159-8-2**], no clear change (LVEF was probably
overestimated on prior).


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo female with history of ER/PR positive breast DCIS s/p ex
lap, resection of tumor, infragastric omentectomy, left
hemicolectomy, end colostomy, BSO for advanced ovarian cancer,
who was admitted to the ICU for post-procedure extubation and
hypotension and another ICU admission for flash pulmonary edema.

#ICU admission #1 for hypotension, intubation, require intense
monitoring immediately post-operation: 2 liters of ascitic fluid
was drained upon opening of her abdomen, estimated blood loss
for the surgery was 1 liter. During the surgery, patient
transiently dropped her blood pressure during the procedure to
50s/30s, she was initiated on phenylephrine gtt through
peripheral IV. She received 10 liters NS IVF during her
procedure, ~2 liters NS while in PACU, 2 units PRBCs, 2 units
FFP. Serial labs were obtained for monitoring.  Pt was gradually
weaned off the phenylephrine gtt. HCT were monitored and there
was a slow decrease in her HCT but no evidence of active
bleeding, she was given 2 additional units of PRBC. Once pt's
condition improved, she was extubated and transferred out of the
ICU.

# ICU admission #2/desaturation secondary to flash pulmonary
edema: [**2159-8-2**] she had respiratory distress after CTA of the
chest was performed for tachypnea and persistent tachycardia in
the 100's. CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed
worsening bilateral pleural effusion with pulmonary edema. She
did not improve with non-rebreather mask and was transferred to
the ICU for the 2nd time during her hospital stay. Her Lung exam
was significant for extensive inspiratory crackles, CXR
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. EKG showed left
bundle branch block that is unchanged compared to EKG on
[**2159-7-23**]. She was placed on BiPAP. Nebulizers were given with
minimal improvement. IV Lasix was administered with good urine
output during her 2nd ICU stay. A s
