BRIEF HISTORY:   72 year old male with multiple CAD history
referred for
cardiac catheterization in the setting of worsening chest pain
at night.
He had CABG in [**2077**] with LIMA-D1, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM with re-do
CABG in
[**2092**] with SVG-PDA and SVG-OM. His last cardiac catheterization
was on
[**2100-9-6**] that revealed 40% LM, total occlusion of LAD, RCA, and
LCX.
Patent LIMA-D1, TO SVG-OM, and 90% mid stenosis of SVG-RCA that
was
stented with Cypher 3.5x18mm.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class II,  stable.
Prior CABG
[**2077**] & [**2092**].  Prior PTCA [**2100-9-6**].

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Graft Angiography: of 2 saphenous vein bypass grafts was
performed using
a 6 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography showed a totally occluded

SVG-RCA. We planned to recanalize the graft. Eptifibatide was
given
prophylactically. A 6 French MP guide provided good support. The
lesion
was crossed with a Choice PT wire and a distal injection showed
in-stent
restenosis with minimal thrombus. The wire was then exchanged
for a
GuardWire which was inflated in the distal graft. Next, a 3.5x24
mm
Taxus DES was deployed at 18 atm. and post-dilated with a 4.0x13
mm
Powersail balloon at 24 atm. Final angiography showed no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow. The patient left the
lab in
stable condition.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
native three vessel disease. The LMCA had mild disease. The LAD
and RCA
were chronically occluded. The LCX had mid 50% stenosis, giving
collaterals to occluded RCA and OM.
2. Selective vein graft angiography demonstrated occluded mid
SVG-RCA.
The SVG-OM was not engaged due to known chronic occlusion.
3. The LIMA to LAD was not engaged.
4. Successful stenting of the SVG-RCA with a 3.5 mm Taxus
drug-eluting
stent, which was post-dilated to 4.0 mm.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Chronic occlusion of SVG-OM. Mid occlusion fo SVG-RCA.
3. Successful stenting of the SVG-RCA.
