CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint was hypoxia,
status post bronchoscopy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female
with a history of bronchiectasis and Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare in sputum, admitted on [**2154-2-18**]
with diarrhea times 12 hours for four days followed by
gasping dyspnea on exertion and then shortness of breath at
rest.  At that time, her SpO2 was 91% on room air.

A chest x-ray showed hyperinflation with new right middle
lobe consolidation, an interval increase in the amount of
right upper lobe patchy airspace consolidation.
Electrocardiogram  showed new T wave inversion in V2.  A CT
scan of the chest with intravenous contrast angiogram
protocol showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, multiple
areas of patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in
the right middle lobe, right upper lobe, lingula, enlarged
pretracheal right hilar lymph nodes increased from prior
study.

The patient received levofloxacin for presumed
community-acquired pneumonia.  The Pulmonary Service was
consulted due to the complicated history.  Their examination
noted crackles in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] favored Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare as
cause of new imaging findings.  Levofloxacin was
discontinued.  He recommended an induced sputum for bacteria,
acid-fast bacillus, fungal culture, and the patient was sent
home with outpatient followup.  At this point, her SpO2 was
92% on room air.  Urinary Legionella antigen was negative.

The patient continued to have increased shortness of breath.
No fever.  She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in clinic on [**2154-3-18**].
The examination was unchanged and Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare still suspected culprit.  Repeat
spirometry was unchanged, FVC of 66%, FEV1 of 61%, with a
ratio of 91% of predicted.  No response to bronchodilators.
Her diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide was 64%.
A chest x-ray showed interval clearing of right upper lobe
process but persistent right middle lobe lingula and right
upper lobe bronchiectasis.

The patient was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy which
took place on [**2154-3-25**].  Prior to procedure, the
patient's SpO2 was recorded as 82% to 86% and 92% on room
air.  During the procedure, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] observed an
increase in systolic pressure at one time to 190.  Procedural
findings were dilated airways, friable mucosa, no
endobronchial lesions, purulent secretions in the right
middle lobe and lingua.  Mucous plugs were retrieved.
Bronchoalveolar lavage was sent for right upper lobe and left
lower lobe culture.  Bronchial washings were sent from the
right middle lobe.

Status post procedure, she did not recover from her
peripheral oxygen saturation.  She had recordings of 83% to
88% on a nonrebreather mask.  She vomited times one.
Lasix 20 mg intravenously was given.  Arterial blood gas at
that time showed a pH of 7.36, PCO2 of 55, PO2 of 53 on
nonrebreather.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for monitoring.

Currently, on admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 71353**] felt a lot better
breathing; felt like she had just walked up stairs.  At
baseline, she can walk up two flights of stairs before
becoming dyspneic.  She had a chronic cough for five years,
worse while lying down.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe focal bronchiectasis secondary to Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare and sputum in [**2149-6-27**].  This was
status post four separate course of triple antibiotic
therapy; three times six months, and one times 12 months.
Most recent course was ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin,
ethambutol.
2.  The patient also has restrictive lung disease with
pulmonary function tests in [**2152-4-27**] showing FVC of 64%,
FEV1 of 62%, with a ratio of 97%.
3.  Gastrointestinal workup showed normal upper
gastrointestinal, small-bowel follow-through in [**2154-4-27**], C-scope in [**2154-1-25**] showed two adenomas in the
descending colon with diverticulosis.
4.  The patient had positive purified protein derivative in
the past.
5.  Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2151-2-25**] showed
normal left ventricular and right ventricular function,
mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency, mild mitral
regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Single, no children.  Lives with sister.  A
retired research technician.  He worked in multiple [**Location (un) 86**]
hospitals.  Occasional use of alcohol.  Quite smoking four
years ago.  No recreational drugs.  Does aerobics twice
weekly.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 74 of prostate cancer.
Mother died at 93 of colon cancer.  Sister is still alive at
the age of 68.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was an
elderly, cachectic, cyanotic, using accessory muscles.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Conjunctivae were pink.  No scleral icterus.
Mucous membranes were moist.  No lesions.  Neck was supple.
No lymphadenopathy.  Chest revealed right lung field with
decreased breath sounds at apex, rales at base, left lung
field pops and squeaks throughout except for base which also
has fine rales.  Cardiovascular revealed borderline
tachycardic, second heart sound louder than first heart sound
at the apex with early systolic murmur.  The abdomen had
normal active bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremities were mildly cyanotic.  No edema.
Able to appreciate slight Quincke pulsations.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
from [**3-18**] revealed platelets of 191, PT of 12.1, INR
of 1.  On [**3-25**] bronchoalveolar lavage showed white blood
cell count of 3500, 99% polys, 1% lymphocytes, 11,144 red
blood cells.  Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.36, PCO2
of 55, PO2 of 53.  Bronchoalveolar lavage Gram stain on
[**2154-3-25**]; final showed 4+ polys, 1+ gram-positive cocci
in pairs, 1+ gram-positive rods.  Bronchoalveolar lavage
washing Gram stain from the middle lobe showed 4+ polys, 1+
gram-positive cocci, 1+ gram-positive rods, 1+ squamous
epithelial cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed new bilateral
confluent alveolar opacities concerning for acute aspiration
event, new small bilateral pleural effusions, background
pattern of multifocal patchy opacities, as well as underlying
bronchiectasis, and curvilinear opacity in peripheral right
lung may reflect pneumothorax versus structure external to
patient.

Subsequent chest x-ray showed curvilinear opacity no longer
identified, suggesting it was external to patient.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.  No change from prior study.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 100 on
admission, borderline left axis, normal intervals, tall T
waves in lead II, suggesting right atrial enlargement,
persistent low voltage in limb leads; however, there were Q
waves in leads III and F, apparently new since [**2-18**].

ASSESSMENT:  An 80-year-old with recurrent Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare infection and bronchiectasis.  She has
been progressively dyspneic and hypoxic for over one month
with right upper lobe infiltrates that resolved on their own.
Most concerning for recrudescent Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare infection.  Multiple etiologies might
explain new bilateral alveolar opacities.  The patient with
new Q waves on electrocardiogram and known valvular disease.
Cardiac etiology such as ischemia or worsening pump
dysfunction cannot be excluded.   Things, such as bacterial
pneumonia are certainly a possibility.

PLAN:

1.  PULMONARY:  Supplemental oxygen as needed.  Await
microbiology results from bronchoalveolar lavage and
bronchial washings.  Await culture and further data before
giving antimicrobial therapy.  Check complete blood count
with differential.  Monitor closely for signs of ventilatory
failure.  Congestive heart failure workup and management.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Check transthoracic echocardiogram on
[**3-26**] in the a.m. to re-evaluate for w
