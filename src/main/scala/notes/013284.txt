Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially maintained on intravenous Esmolol and
Nipride for tight blood pressure and heart rate control. He was
urgently taken to the operating room where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed
a replacement of his ascending aorta. For surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.

CARDIAC: He was initially started on Amiodarone for bouts of
perioperative atrial fibrillation. He also required multiple
intravenous anti-hypertensives for persistent hypertension. In
the postop period, he remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm.
No further episodes of atrial fibrillation was noted. Amiodarone
was discontinued in the early postop period secondary to ARDS.
Anti-hypertensives were titrated to maintain MAP less than 100
mmHg. The cardiology service was eventually consulted to assist
in the management of his hypertension. At discharge, his blood
pressure was still labile but improving. Patient should follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient.

NEURO: He initially failed to recover after withdrawal of
sedation and paralysis. He initially remained comatose and
unresponsive which suggested severe brain stem injury. However
brain MRI revealed no evidence of brainstem infarction. Over
several days, his neurological exam gradually started to
improve. EEG was suggestive of severe encephalopathy, no
epileptiform discharges or seizures were seen. All sedative were
withheld and by postoperative day eight, he showed remarkable
improvements. He intermittently required Haldol for
hallucinations. Throughout the remainder of his hospital stay,
his neurological status continued to improve.

PULMONARY: Initially hypoxic, most likely secondary to ARDS, he
underwent multiple diagnostic and therapuetic bronchoscopies.
Amiodarone was discontinued in the early postop period as it may
have contributed to ARDS. Eventually started on empiric
antibiotics for concern for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Given his respiratory failure, the thoracic service was
consulted for tracheostomy and gastrostomy. This was originally
delayed due to his increasing requirements for ventilatory
support. As his neurological status improved, so did his
oxygenation. He was slowly weaned from mechanical ventilation
and was extubated on postoperative day 10. No tracheostomy was
required. At discharge, he was tolerating room air with 94%
oxygen saturations.

RENAL: Had acute decline in renal function with oliguria. His
creatinine peaked to 3.1 on postoperative day two. Nephrology
service was consulted and attributed his ARF to acute tubular
necrosis/prerenal azotemia. There was no indication for
hemodialysis. Diuretics were initially held to allow auto
diuresis. Over the remainder of his hospital stay, his renal
function gradually improved. ACE inhibitor was eventually
resumed for hypertension without any further renal insult. At
discharge, he continued to have 3+ bilateral pedal edema. He was
diuresing well with Lasix.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Started to experience fevers around
postoperative day three. His fevers persisted despite no obvious
source on infection. Postop white count peaked at 16K. All
invasive lines were changed and pan cultures were obtained, all
remaining negative. Ceftriaxone and Linezolid were empirically
started for coverage with major concern for ventilator
associated pneumonia. Chest x-ryas showed persistent right lower
lobe collapse. Around postoperative day seven, was noted to have
a widespread rash. ID recommended to discontinue Ceftriaxone(PCN
allergy) and start Aztreonam. Drug fever at this point could not
be ruled out. By postoperative day 10, his fevers resolved.
Intravenous antibiotics were transitioned to PO.

NUTRITION: Given prolonged sedation period, was started on
trophic tube feeds. He was maintained on an Insulin drip for
strict glycemic control. He tolerated goal tube feeds but
required free water for hypernatremia. Eventually transitioned
to oral diet without difficulty.

OTHER: Given immobility, maintained on subcutaneous Heparin.
Initially very deconditioned, he worked with physical therapy to
improve strength and mobility. In the postop period, required
treatment with Colchicine for acute gouty attack. Will continue
to wear compression stockings for lower extremity edema.
