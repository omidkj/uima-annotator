CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1. Hypotension.
2. Bowel ischemia.
3. Urosepsis.

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female
with  multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus,
coronary  artery  disease,  atrial  fibrillation,  congestive
heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease status post
multiple  surgeries,  history  of  bowel  ischemia  per  last
admission  to  [**Hospital1 97488**] and renal artery
stenosis  status post bilateral stents.  She was in her usual
state  of  health  until  the  morning of admission, when she
complained   of  vague  symptoms  of  not  feeling  well  and
right-sided  neck  pain  that  initially  was  relieved  with
Vicodin.    The  patient  had a normal bowel movement the day
prior  to  admission,  but  on  the  morning of admission was
unable to have a bowel movement.

She was brought to the emergency department and noted to have
heart  rates in the forties without response to a half ampule
of  atropine  or  dopamine  infusion.    Her  systolic  blood
pressure  was in the sixties, and her oxygen saturations were
80% on room air to high 80's on 100% non-rebreather.

The patient was intubated in the emergency room, and received
intravenous  fluids,  with an increase in her heart rate.  In
addition,  she was noted to have a distended abdomen, and the
right  lower  extremity  was noted to be cold and mottled.  A
right  I-J  was  placed, and a Foley catheter was inserted to
reveal small pus in her urine.

Also  noted,  she  had  a positive urine culture on [**2155-4-11**],  which  revealed  greater than 100,000 enterococcus and
yeast of 10,000 - 100,000.

The  patient received a total of five liters of normal saline
in  the  emergency  room.  She  was  started on pressors with
Levophed and dopamine infusions.  She also received a dose of
vancomycin,  Levaquin and Flagyl.  A CT angiogram at the time
was  negative  for  acute pulmonary embolus, but positive for
bilateral  pleural  effusions as well as opacities within the
right  lung  base.   An abdominal CT scan was performed which
showed  diffuse  bowel  wall  thickening.  A head CT was also
performed, and this showed no acute bleed.

Electrocardiogram  at  the time showed low voltages, with QTc
interval  of [**Street Address(2) 97489**] depressions that were 1 mm in V5
to   V6,   with   poor   R   wave   progression.    A  repeat
electrocardiogram   showed   a  junctional  rhythm  that  was
progressive.

The  patient  was  transferred  to the medical intensive care
unit,  where  Surgery  was consulted for a distended abdomen.
Flexible   sigmoidoscopy  was  performed  and  showed  viable
mucosa,  initially thought likely to be due to hypoperfusion.
The  patient was also evaluated for her right lower extremity
by Vascular Surgery at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.      Diabetes   mellitus  complicated  by  neuropathy  and
blindness.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post non-Q wave myocardial
infarction in [**2154-2-16**].
3.    Atrial  fibrillation  status  post  Coumadin, which was
discontinued two weeks prior to this admission due to falls.
4.  Diastolic dysfunction.
5.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 60%.
6.  Status post fall.
7.  History of back pain.
8.    Peripheral  vascular disease status post fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
and multiple other surgeries.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Renal artery stenosis status post bilateral renal stents.
11. Osteoarthritis.
12. Urinary incontinence.
13. Uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
14. Legally blind.
15. Early Parkinson's.
16. L2 wedge compression.
17. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
18. Status post multiple thoracenteses.
19.  Bowel  ischemia,  with  recent  admission to [**Hospital6 8866**] in [**2154-11-16**].
20. Question of cardiac arrhythmias.

ventilator  with  settings A.C. 550 tidal volume, respiratory
rate  18,  PEEP  12,  plateaus  of  30  and  peak inspiratory

DATA  ON  ADMISSION:    White  count  10.9,  hematocrit 33.8,
platelet  count  189.    No  bandemia.    58%  polys  and 33%
lymphocytes   on   the  differential.    INR  2.0,  PT  90.6,
fibrinogen 237, D-dimer 5338.  Potassium 4.2, creatinine 1.6,
phosphorus  6.2.    CK initially 37, troponin less than 0.01.
ALT 10, AST 25.

Urinalysis  from  [**4-11**]  shows  482 whites and occasional
white  blood  cell  clumps, many bacteria. Urine culture from
that  same  urine  sample shows probable enterococci, greater
than 100,000 organisms, and yeast 10,000 - 100,000 organisms.
Urine culture from [**2-28**] showed enterococcus "resistant
[**Month (only) **]."

Chest  x-ray  showed linear opacities in the right lung base,
no  consolidation,  slight  blunting  of the right lung base.
Electrocardiogram  as  described  above.  CT scan of the head
negative  for  bleed.  Old known infarct.  Nothing acute.  CT
scan  of  the  chest  showed  right  base  consolidation with
bilateral  pleural  effusions.  CT scan of the abdomen showed
no  free  air,  small ascites. The SMA is patent.  Bowel wall
edema, patchy, ascending less than descending colon, and also
in the sigmoid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Septic  shock.  The  patient presented with septic shock,
likely  urosepsis  from  question  Enterococcus in a previous
urine  culture  on  the 26th plus or minus [**Female First Name (un) 564**] infection.
Other  etiologies to consider are bilateral pleural effusions
and  consolidation,  and  abdominal  contents bugs, given her
ischemic   bowel.      Her   infection   was  complicated  by
disseminated intervascular coagulation.

She  was  resuscitated  and  aggressively  resuscitated  with
volume,  a  total  of eight liters on the night of admission,
with  improvement of her mean atrial pressure and improvement
of  her  central  venous  pressure, to the point where she on
admission  had an increasing oxygen requirement without being
able  to  decrease  her  FIO2.   This was likely due to fluid
overload  in  this patient with a history of congestive heart
failure.  The patient was subsequently diuresed.  The patient
was  initially  started  on Levophed and dopamine on arrival.
Dopamine   was  weaned  off  in  favor  of  vasopressin,  and
subsequently on hospital three, Levophed was weaned off.

The  patient  was  broadly  covered with antibiotic coverage,
with  vancomycin  for  probable  enterococcus  and Flagyl for
possible   abdominal   sources,  and  she  was  treated  with
ceftriaxone  for possible pneumonia, given the consolidation,
and  fluconazole  for  candiduria.  Enterococcus in the urine
was pan-sensitive, except for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**First Name3 (LF) **] was d
