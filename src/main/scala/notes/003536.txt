Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
progressively increased swelling of his graft site since surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-1-11**] Ultrasound-guided access for vascular imaging,
aortic catheterization with abdominal aortogram and pelvic
runoff, right common iliac artery stent, right external iliac
artery stent, right to left femoral to femoral bypass,
removal of axillary to femoral bypass graft.


History of Present Illness:
59M Hispanic male s/p left axillofemoral bypass on [**2175-4-3**] with PTF Propaten graft. He has a long history of severe
symptomatic left aorto-iliac disease thigh and calf claudication
with ambuation, L>R. He has had significant improvement in his
claudication symptoms since his surgery, however he has had
progressively increased swelling of his graft site since
surgery.
He was recently discharged for increased swelling of the graft
site for concern of graft site infection v. seroma v. allergic
reaction, and was on IV anti-biotics. Since then, he has
continued to have further expansion of the graft site with
tightness.


Past Medical History:
-Coronary artery disease
-myocardial infarction in [**2166**], status post percutaneous
coronary intervention, vessel intervene unknown.
-systolic congestive heart failure recurrent with ejection
fraction of 20%.

- hypertension, controlled
- bilateral renal artery stenosis status post renal artery
stenting bilaterally.

Cardiology Report

ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-10**]  9:16:54 PM
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2175-9-19**] the  ventricular premature beat is new and
the ventricular rate is slightly faster.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2176-1-11**] at 8:46:47 AM
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of
the inferior and inferolateral walls. (LVEF = 20-25 %). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPERSSION: Severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. Diastolic dysfunction. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation with an eccentric jet due to
tethering of the posterior mitral valve leaflet by the infarcted
infero-lateral wall.

ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-11**]  4:15:34 PM
Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. T wave inversions in the
lateral leads.
Early R wave transition. Possible right ventricular hypertrophy.
Possible
left ventricular hypertrophy. The ST-T wave changes may be
related to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2176-1-10**]
there is no significant change.

ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-12**]  12:50:16 PM
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Possible
biventricular
hypertrophy with extensive ST-T wave changes secondary to left
ventricular
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-11**] there
is no
significant change.

Radiology Report

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2176-1-10**] 8:28 PM
Final Report COMPARISON: [**2175-9-19**].
FINDINGS: There is a tortuous thoracic aorta. Heart size is
within normal
limits. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia present. Pulmonary
vascularity appears within normal limits. No effusion or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2176-1-12**] 9:07 AM

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of Swan-Ganz position.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2176-1-11**].
The patient was extubated. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the
right main
pulmonary artery. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
Bibasilar
atelectasis are unchanged. No edema or pneumothorax is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2176-1-10**] Patient admitted for increased swelling of Axillary to
femoral bypass graft,
seroma versus infection, claudication. Routine nursing, labs,
NPO post MN and IVF and Bicarb drip start at MN. Pre-op
EKG-Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2175-9-19**] the  ventricular premature beat is
new and the ventricular rate is slightly faster. Pre-op CXR-No
acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Pre-op and consented

femoral to femoral bypass and removal of axillary to femoral
bypass graft.
[**2176-1-11**] TTE ECHO-that showed severe global hypokinesis with
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Diastolic
dysfunction. At least moderate mitral regurgitation with an
eccentric jet due to tethering of the posterior mitral valve
leaflet by the infarcted infero-lateral wall. Taken to OR and
underwent Ultrasound-guided access for vascular imaging,aortic
catheterization with abdominal aortogram and pelvic runoff,
right common iliac artery stent, right external iliac
artery stent, right to left femoral to femoral bypass,removal of
axillary to femoral bypass graft. A-line, PA line, foley
catheter and JP drains were placed intra-op. Cultures sent in
OR. Patient tolerated procedure. Transferred to CVICU post-op
for recovery and further monitoring. Patient was hypotensive
post-op, placed on pressors, transfused with 1 unit PRBC, sedate
and intubated. Started ABX vanco/Cipro and Flagyl. Pulses stable
pulse signals. DVT prophylaxis. Pain control.
[**2176-1-12**] Patient was extubated in CVICU, remains on ABX
Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl. T maxed 101.7. Pulse status stable. Pressors
weaned off, vitals stable. Started diet. Tranferred to VICU [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
5 w/ telemetry for further monitoring. Pain managed w/ prn.
[**2176-1-13**] Patient remains febrile T maxed 101.4 pan cultured, the
rest of his vitals stable. PA line changed to tripple lumen
line-placement confirmed by CXR- also showed no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion and no signs of new parenchymal
infiltrates. JP remain in place. Pulse status stable. Physical
therapy consult- started out of bed to chair activity. Cultures
from the OR came back negative. [**217
