History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 yo Laotian speaking female with PMH significant for
osteoporosis, s/p L total hip replacement [**1-3**], s/p L hip
debridement and hardware removal [**7-3**] who presented with rash in
the setting of having been on multiple antibiotics in the past
3-4 weeks and L hip wound infection. The pt was originally
admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in late [**Month (only) 205**] with swelling and
infection of the left hip for which the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ortho. The patient was admitted [**2118-6-28**] to [**2118-7-18**] for
drainage and removal of hardware as well as treatment of
multiple decubitus ulcers noted on her coccyx and L hip.
Superficial swab cultures revealed only rare coag negative staph
and deep swabs revealed nothing. The patient was on a number of
abx regimens during this admission including Vancomycin,
Ertapenem, Zosyn, Meropenem (x 1 day), CTX and Flagyl with the
mainstay of therapy being Vanco, CTX, and Flagyl (until
[**2118-7-15**]). The patient was discharged to home with PT and family
care off antibiotics, afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
.
The patient represented to the hospital with rash and
accomanying fever and headache. The rash started on the trunk
and spread to the extremities and face, sparing the palms and
soles. Per family report, the patient (Patient is [**Country **] speaking,
minimally verbal and demented at baseline) was reporting diffuse
pain everywhere, but was without cough, diarrhea, N/V, SOB, CP.
Vitals in ED eval were 103.2, 102/94, 108, 97% on RA. Given
rash, fever, and headache an LP was performed that was not
consistent with meningitis. The patient had received Vanco and
CTX in the E.D. prior to LP for meningitis coverage.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y.o. nonverbal Laotian-understanding only woman with
dementia, s/p surgical debridement and hardware removal of L hip
p/w fever, diffuse macular rash, pressure ulcers and LUL
pneumonia on CXR.
.
1) Fever. Consistent with either drug rash fever, [**12-30**] osteo at
site of ulcers or LUL pneumonia. LP without signs of infection,
and no UTI. All blood cultures were negative. Pt continued on
CTX for LUL pneumonia, restarted on Vancomycin for possible
osteomyelitis/soft tissue infection at site of ulcers. Completed
12 day course of Vancomycin. CTX swiched to levaquin for
treatment of PNA. Repeat CXR was also significant for L
retrocardiac opacity. While in MICU, IV antibiotic coverage
broadened to include IV Flagyl and Meropenum (see below) as pt c
continued fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension which were
subsequently d/c'd as pt clinically improved. The pt was kept on
Levaquin for a 10 day course of treatment for PNA. Had low grade
fever to 100.5 on day of discharge, however subsequently
defevesced and remained AF. The pt was discharged home to
complete a 10 day course of Levaquin.
.
2) Rash - Seen by dermatology who believed that rash was likely
[**12-30**] drug rash as pt had had exposure to a number of antibiotics
over the past month. Pt with no other exposures for etiology of
rash. The pt was continued on Vancomycin and CTX and later added
on Flagyl, Meropenum, and Levaquin with improvement in drug
rash. Was given clobetasol cream which was eventually d/c'd and
given sarna lotion prn. The rash subsequently resolved during
hospital course.
.
3) Hypotension - During hospital course, pt became hypotensive
with SBPs in the 70-80s, was transferred to the MICU as was not
responded well to IVF boluses. In the MICU, never required
pressors and was IVF boluses were continued. As pt still c
leukocytosis and occasional low grade fevers, antibiotics were
broadened to include Vancomycin, Meropenum, and Flagyl.
Subsequently with decreased WBC, remained AF, BPs stable and did
not require further IVF boluses. Meropenum and Flagyl were d/c'd
as only source isolated on pt was LUL and L retrocardiac PNA and
possible soft tissue infection [**12-30**] decub ulcers and open L hip
wound. Pt was called out of MICU and transferred to floor for
further management. No further episodes of hypotension while on
the floor.
.
4) Altered mental status - Per family, pt's baseline is alert to
self; however not oriented to place or date. Occasionally verbal
c family, will speak in [**11-29**] word sentences. On admission, it was
thought that PNA may be playing a role. There no acute CVA on
CT, LP without infection, TSH wnl. Upon discharge, the pt was
near her baseline per her family. Was more awake, occasionally
spoke in 1 or 2 word sentences in Laotian.
.
5) Decub ulcers - The pt has stage III R trochanteric and sacral
decub ulcers as well as open L hip wound. Started on Vancomycin
for possible soft tissue infection/osteomyelitis given fevers
and leukocytosis, X 12 days. Seen by woundcare nurse who
recommended wet to dry dressing changes tid without accuzyme
until more granulation tissue present.
.
5) Anemia - Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic
disease (low iron, low TIBC, high ferritin). During hospital
course, Hct initially hovering around pt's baseline of high 20s;
however noted to slowly trend down. Hemolysis labs mixed with
low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, but nl total bilirubin. Guiaic
negative, no frank episodes of BRBPR, melena, hematochezia.
.
6) Thrombocytopenia - Plt count noted to trend down from
baseline in 200s, down to as low as 130s with elevated PTT, but
nl INR/PT. DIC labs significant for possible chronic smoldering
DIC picture. HIT Ab negative. Plt count eventually drifted back
up to upper 100s, low 200s with normalization of PTT.
.
7) B/L pleural effusions - Pt became increasingly fluid
overloaded on exam during hospital course and CXR significant
for b/l pleural effusions. Was diuresed successfully with Lasix
20 IV prn to keep I/O negative. No h/o CHF.
.
8) FEN - Pt started on tube feeds as failed swallow
