History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and coumadin, CAD with 3VD
seen on cardiac cath in [**2186**], CHF with EF of 20%, who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] last night complaining of a slow heart
beat.  Per his wife at around midnight last night he came to bed
complaining that his heart was beating very slowly, he felt weak
and that he could "feel it in his chest."  At that time he asked
his wife to call 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further
evaluation.  Per his wife he did not complain of any chest pain,
shortness of breath or nausea.  Also, the family notes that he
has been having some falls/syncope at home including one event
that he did not remember in the past few weeks.
.
Per EMS report he was found to be pale, cool and diaphoretic on
initial examination.  There he experienced some nausea, vomited
once, appropriate but lethargic, he was found to be bradycardic
to the 20's to 30's and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  En route to
[**Location (un) 620**] he was given atropine 0.5mg x 2 with no effect, he was
put on external pacing with electrical but not mechanical
capture.  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was still bradycardic initially to
the 20's, was given atropine 1mg x 2, a right cordis was placed
and pacing wires were floated but kinked and were unable to
capture.  His CK was 87, CK-MB was 2.1.  He was then intubated
for reported AMS, external pacing was again attempted but there
was no mechanical capture.  Throughout his course he was never
hypotensive with his episodes of bradycardia.  EKG's done at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] showed at times a junctional rhythm, ventricular escape
and then bradycardia with his old LBBB.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his initial VS were: 96.8, 63,
113/60, 99% on 14x450, 5 PEEP, FiO2 of 100%.  His heart rate
remained in the 50's, he was given fentanyl/versed for sedation,
an OGT was placed and he was transferred to the CCU.  VS on
transfer were: 96, 51, 124/59, 97% on the above ventilator
settings.  His CK was 88, CK-MB was 4 with a troponin of 0.04.
On arrival to the CCU his initial VS were: 97, 43, 130/57, 22,
100% on AC 14x450, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 60%.  He is currently
intubated and sedated, unable to respond to any questions, he is
moving his extremities.

sedated

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2191-2-23**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis (and inferior akinesis).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-4-7**],
the LV appears more dysynchronous
.
CXR [**2191-2-23**] Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. The
widened mediastinum may represent an enlarged aneurysmal
thoracic aorta or an aortic dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone/coumadin, CAD with 3VD, CHF
with EF of 20% who presented with symptomatic bradycardia.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for permanenet pacemaker placement.
Hospital course complicated by brief intubation for altered
mental status.
.
# RHYTHM / BRADYCARDIA: Review of EKGs prior to admission reveal
sinus arrest after a junctional rhythm and subsequent
ventricular escape.  When he returned into sinus rhythm he had a
wider QRS interval and prolonged PR interval of 300 ms thank on
prior EKGs.  Etiology unclear, may be secondary to conversion
pause or a toxic or metabolic condition pre-empting sinus arrest
with long PR and wide QRS.  A free T4 was normal. The patient's
home dose of amiodarone was held with concern for toxicity.  A
temporary pacemaker was placed and noted to be coiled in the IVC
and was thus subsequently removed.  Coumadin was held in
anticipation of pacemaker placement.  A permanent pacemaker was
placed on HD 2.  Although the patient is a given EF of 20%
candidate for biventricular ICD placement, dicussion with the
patient and primary cardiologist prompted placement of pacemaker
only, to place the simplest device that would address his
bradycardia. Coumadin was restarted post procedure at his home
regimen, with follow-up at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] coumadin clinic.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has a history of three
vessel disease and was not on a statin or beta blocker as an
outpatient.  He was started on atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin
325 mg daily.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and flat.  Lipid
panel revealed an LDL of 105, HDL of 33 and total cholesterol of
173, the atorvastatin was discontinued at the time of discharge.
.
# AIRWAY PROTECTION: The patient was intubated prior to
admission to the intensive care unit due to altered mental
status in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia.  He was
successfully extubated on admission to the CCU.
.
# SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Most recent echo prior to
admission demonstrated EF of 20%. An echo on admission was
similar demonstrating more dysynchronous LV function. The
patient was continued on lisinopril at his outpatient dose of
5mg daily.
.
# HYPERTENSION: All antihypertensive medications were held given
bradycardia, and then restarted after pacemaker placement, he
was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# HYPOTHYROID:  The patient was continued on home synthroid at
225mcg daily.  Free T4 was normal with elevation of TSH.  He was
dischargard on his home dose with outpatient PCP follow up for
further titration of his synthroid.
.
# GLAUCOMA: continued on his outpatient eye drop regimen
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE:
1. CODE: FULL
2. FOLLOW-UP: needs coumadin monitoring and PCP follow up for
titration
