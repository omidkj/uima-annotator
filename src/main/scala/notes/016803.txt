History of Present Illness:
83 year old woman with PMR on prednisone, recently on
azathioprine, IDDM, CKD Stage 3, and h/o colon CA s/p resection
[**2122**] presenting with thirst, hypovolemia, hyperglycemia, and
hyperkalemia. Patient reports persistent diarrhea [**5-22**] loose
watery dark black-green stools per day x last week attributed to
azathioprine which was subsequently discontinued 2 days PTA. Had
trace blood on tissue but no hematochezia. She took immodium
yesterday and had some mild improvement in her symptoms but
diarrhea has persisted today. She had mild crampy lower
abdominal pain and chest pressure several days ago now both
resolved. CP was associated with indigestion and improved with
maalox. Overall, she has been feeling unwell for last week but
denies fever or chills and reports good PO intake. She was
recently restarted on prednisone approx. 1 month ago and has
noted overall weight gains [**Last Name (un) 2675**] that time but no change in LE
edema. Also reports SOB for months which is stable. Denies
cough, dysuria, current abd pain, CP, N/V. Finger sticks athoem

labs significant for [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr 1.8 from 1.6, glucose 500s, K
8.8, 7.9 on repeat, Na 122. In the ED, she received 2LNS, 1 amp
bicarb, 30 kayexalate, 20 units IV insulin and glucose improved
to 170s and K improved to 5.3. ECG revealed sinus tach, no
peaked Ts or other signs of hyperkalemia. Had CT abdomen which
was overall negative for acute process. Has had persistently
high lactate 2.7-2.8. Now being admitted to MICU with
tachycardia and elevated lactate. VS prior to trasnfer: 97.8
119/57 119 20 99%RA 100%2L.

On the floor, she complains mostly of thirst and dry mouth and

Past Medical History:
#. PMR
#. Temporal Arteritis
- patient admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**9-/2136**] with FUO and Headache,
started on Prednisone at that time for likely TA. ESR > 140, CRP

2122
- unilateral biopsy with evidence of calcification but no
inflammation, clinical impression that TA still likely
- Methotrexate 10mg daily started [**2136-11-19**] to facilitate dose
reduction of Prednisone
#. Diabetes Mellitus II, uncontrolled with complication
#. Hypertension
#. Hyperlipidemia
#. Aortic Stenosis s/p Bioprosthetic porcine AVR [**2130**]
#. Hearing Loss

#. Stage 3 CKD

Social History:
The patient currently lives in [**Location **], MA alone and is widowed.
The patient's daughter lives in the house next door. the patient
was previously employed by [**Company 2676**], now retired.
Tobacco:None
EtOH: None
Illicits: None

Family History:
Mother, father and sister with DM. No FH malignancy.

Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear, no thrush
Neck: supple, JVP difficult to appreciate, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, with faint systolic murmur LUSB,
normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, reducible ventral
hernia, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding,
no organomegaly. Rectal exam with external hemorrhoids and
erythema,brown faintly guaaic positive brown stool
GU: no foley

clubbing, cyanosis

Pertinent Results:
[**11-8**] CT abdomen/pelvis: No radiographic explanation for the
patient's symptoms. Specifically, there is no evidence for
colitis or diverticulitis, as questioned. Uncomplicated ventral
hernias are redemonstrated. Minimal sludge is seen within the
gallbladder, without evidence of cholecystitis.

Labs on discharge:


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old woman with DM2, morbid obesity, PMR recently
restarted on steroids admitted with hyperglycemia, diarrhea,
tachycardia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, all now improved.
.
#. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome vs DKA/IDDM2: Patient
presenting with elevated blood sugars, hyponatremia and
hypovolemia consistent with HHS. AG 12 on arrival but also has
acute on chronic renal failure. Unclear precipitant but most
likely related to recent diarrhea/infection in addition to
steroid use. Of note, patient also missed her PM dose of insulin
prior to presentation. GIB and ACS also possible precipitants.
Has mild leukocytosis but no fever although steroids may be
masking a fever. UA and CXR negative for PNA. Cardiac enzymes
were negative. Patient was continued on her home insulin
regimen.
.
#. Tachycardia: resolved. Likely related to dehydration +/-
infection although afebrile. Not hypotensive but could also have
component of adrenal insufficiency. Could also be secondary to
slow GIB given h/o CA and guaaic positive stool although HCT
[**Last Name (un) 2677**] around baseline. During hospitalization, TSH wnl and
tachycardia resolved with 2L IVF in the ICU.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: Likely related to renal failure in setting of
ACE and spironolactone use +/- dietary indiscretion. Given
diarrhea, would expect hypokalemia but K more likely to be
elevated on ACE in setting of hypovolemia. Now improved and did
not have ECG changes suggesting was not rapid rise. On
discharge, potassium was 4.5. Patient will hold her ACEi and
aldactone until discussion with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] BP here was well
controlled off these medications.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Initial corrected sodium 129 (122), now
improved with IVF resuscitation suggesting most likely
hypovolemic hyponatremia.
.
#. Diarrhea: Pt reports several days of diarrhea which was
attributed to azathioprine. [**Month (only) 116**] be med effect vs infectious. CT
A/P without evidence for colitis. Patient will hold her
azathioprine until discussed with her rheumatologist.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.8 from baseline 1.5. Likely prerenal vs ATN. Has
improved back to baseline with IVF in ED.
.
#. PMR: On high dose prednisone. ? should be on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as
outpatient, will not start now given [**Last Name (un) **]. Did start PPI given
recent GERD symptoms and high dose prednisone use.
.
#. Anemia: Hct on presentation 35, likely hemoconcentrated from
hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea. Dropped to 30, which was
likely dilutional from previous baseline 32-34. Faintly guaiac +
stool most likely [**2-18**] hemorrhoids. Otherwise, no evidence of
bleeding.
.
#. HTN: Held all meds except metoprolol and BP remainded stable.
.
#. Leaving AMA: Patient requested to leave AMA during her MICU
visit. MICU staff were able to convience her to stay after 2
hours of discussion. 5 minutes after arrival to floor she became
angry and requested discharge AMA. I discussed with her the
risks of leaving AMA. She was cometent and was discharged AMA.
Her friend accompanied her. I asked her to stop her aldactone
and resume Lasix and ACEi (lisinopril) and see her PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 2678**] on
her way out.
