History of Present Illness:
67 year old male was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 19345**] where he was admitted on [**2134-9-22**] for bilateral UE pain.
Approximately 2 weeks ago he received IM Vidaza for his MDS and
then subsequently developed bilateral upper extremity cellulitis
and blistering at the injection sites. While hospitalized, his
abdomen slowly became more distended and tender. WBC count has
trended upward (12 --> 26). Over the past 24 hrs he was also
found to be in atrial fibrillation and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
this morning for further care. On presentation to the MICU, his
abdomen was markedly distended and tender, and he was intubated
for respiratory distress. OG placed and 200 cc of bile returned.

Past Medical History:
Myelodysplastic syndrome, Carpal tunnel syndrome, COPD.

Past Surgical History:
L knee surgery, back surgery.

Social History:
Retired, used to work for a chemical company. History of
asbestos and other chemical exposure. He has a history of
significant alcohol use, which he stopped approximately seven
years ago. 60 pack year history of tobacco use.

CT abdomen [**2134-9-27**] at LGH showed:
Dilated small bowel loops without a clear transition point.
Several streaks of air in the right colon suspicious for
pneumatosis.

MRI LUE [**2134-9-25**] at LGH showed:
Extensive SC edema which may represent cellulitis. Extensive
edema within the muscles of the posterior compartment of the LUE
may represent myositis. No abscess.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2134-9-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] showed:
1. Findings of diffuse small bowel dilatation up to 4.5 cm with
segments of decreased bowel wall enhancement, pneumatosis of the
small bowel and cecum, mesenteric edema, free fluid and celiac
axis origin stenosis concerning for ischemic small and right
sided large bowel.
2. Diverticulosis of the descending and sigmoid colon without
evidence of diverticulitis.
3. Complex small pericardial effusion might represent
hemopericardium.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2134-10-2**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.

TTE [**2134-9-29**] showed:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50%). There is considerable beat-to-beat
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an
irregular rhythm/premature beats. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a probable
vegetation on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global LV hypokinesis. There may be a small
mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve - best seen on
image #45. This appears to move back and forth through the plane
of the valve. It could be a scallop of the mitral valve or an
acoustic artifact or a small vegetation. TEE would help to
clarify, if clinically indicated. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation is seen.

TEE [**2134-9-30**] showed:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present
with transition of agitated saline bubbles from the right to
left atrium at rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is low normal (LVEF 50%) with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No atrial thrombus seen. No vegetation/ abscess
seen. Patent foramen ovale. Low-normal global left ventricular
function.

RUQ US [**2134-10-1**] showed:
Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

CT LUE [**2134-10-1**] showed:
1. Diffuse subcutaneous edema and skin thickening is most
consistent with cellulitis. No subcutaneous emphysema.
2. Fluid along the superficial fascial planes of the biceps and
brachialis muscles. No deeper fluid or organized fluid
collections.
3. Degenerative changes of the left shoulder.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, with collapse of left lower lobe
and atelectasis of the right lower lobe, incompletely evaluated.
5. Small peric
