History of Present Illness:
55yM with h/o DM2 and gastroparesis, here with abdominal
pain.  Pain is chronic and he was going to see a
Gastroenterologist this week.  However, he developed more acute
LLQ pain and N/V this past few days.  Also noted some right
buttock and scrotal pain.  Was initially admitted to the medical
service
with surgical consultation for concern of perirectal infection
vs. Fourniers Gangrene.  He had an unremarkable CT scan at
admission, but he was mildly septic with a HR in the 120s and BP
in the 90s which both responded to fluid challenge.


Past Medical History:
PMH: DM2, gastroparesis, MRSA infections, kidney stones, HTN,
Hyperchol.
.
PSH: left knee replacement


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:

PE:
Gen: mild distress, warm, AAOx3
HEENT: anicteric
CV: RRR
Pulm: CTA b/l
Abd: soft, LLQ mild TTP, no rebound or guarding, nondistended
Rectal: unable to perform rectal.  Entire right buttock very
indurated with some spreading erythema.  Posterior scrotum firm

drainage.


Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**12-8**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No evidence of free
air
beneath the diaphragms.
[**12-8**] KUB: pending
[**12-8**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1. Bilateral small pleural effusions. 2. No
small-bowel obstruction. 3. Non-specific fat stranding about the
kidneys. Delayed contrast excretion. 4. Foley catheter and air
within the urinary bladder could be from placement of Foley;
correlate clinically. 5. Non obstructive 2mm stone at the lower
pole of left kidney.
[**12-9**] SCROTAL U/S: Extensive hyperechoic foci tracking to the
floor of the perineum concerning for gas w/in the scrotal cavity
and Fournier's. No fluid collection to suggest an abscess.
[**12-10**]: CXR:New right IJ catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC
and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. ET tube tip is 6.6 cm
above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm, difficult to visualize. Cardiac silhouette is
unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity has worsened, consistent with worsening
atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
[**12-10**]:abd Xray:Motion artifact, unable to visualize nasogastric
tube. Recommend repeat imaging to further assess.
[**12-11**] ECHO:LA severely increased,RA is moderately dilated, mild
symm LVH with normal cavity size, moderate regional left
ventricular sys dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
anterior, anteroseptal and lateral walls and of the inferior
septum. increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). RV dilated.Aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) MR, moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion
[**12-11**]: CXR: Persistent retrocardiac opacity, can't exclude
infectious process
[**12-11**]: ABD: G tube in gastric antrum
[**12-12**] CXR: Continued evidence of increased pulmonary venous
pressure with substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
There is continued opacification in the retrocardiac region
incompletely silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Again this is
consistent with some combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, and
pleural effusion.
[**12-14**]: CXR: Mild pulmonary edema, most readily visible in the
right lung has improved. Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal
vascular engorgement have decreased slightly. Left lower lobe is
still collapsed.
[**12-15**]: CXR: cardiomegaly unchanged, diffuse b/l alveolar
opacities likely representing pulmonary edema worsening, LLL
atelectasis
[**12-15**]: KUB: tip of OGT in antrum of stomach
[**12-16**] CXR:e/o elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Extensive
opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in
the left lower lobe and pleural effusion
[**12-17**] CXR:enlarged cardiac shadow, decreased lung vol, LL
collapsed, minimal left pleural eff.
[**12-18**] CXR:enlarged cardiac shadow, decreased lung vol, LL
collapsed, minimal left pleural eff.
11/25CXR:As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced by a
tracheostomy tube. The tip of the tube is projecting 4.8 cm
above the carina. Unchanged course and position of the
nasogastric tube and of the right-sided central venous access
line. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax. Unchanged severe cardiomegaly with a small left
pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
[**12-20**]: CXR: No acute changes.
[**12-21**]: CXR: New large RLL consolidation consistent with
aspiration.
[**12-21**]: KUB: NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach
[**12-22**] CXR: Consolidation RML RLL, pulmonary edema periphery
right lung as well as the left has improved. Mod cardiomegaly
improved. Trach tube abuts right tracheal wall. RIJ line can be
traced junction of brachiocephalic veins. feeding tube w/ wire
stylet in place passes into stomach and out of view.

[**2177-12-29**] Chest
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-23**], the monitoring
and support devices remain in place. There is continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure and bilateral pleural effusions more
prominent on the left. The more focal opacification in the right
mid zone is not appreciated at this time

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient seen by acute care surgical team and was admitted for
ICU management and aggressive debridement.
ICU Course as follows per dictation of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7656**] [**Name (STitle) **]:
[**12-9**]: admission to TSICU. R IJ CVL placed. Transfused 2U
overnight.
[**12-10**]: s/p further debridement in OR, upon transfer back to ICU
pt was hypotensive- received Calcium, neo, ephedrine by
anesthesia
[**12-11**]: Went to OR for debridement and colostomy. Plan to return
to the OR tomorrow. Tissue culture is growing coag negative
staph. Echo today showed EF of 35-40%. Post op he did well, but
Hct dropped to 25 from 30 and he was started back on Neo to
maintain MAPs>65. As a result, he received 1 unit PRBCs.
[**12-12**]: went to OR for further debridement. started TFs postop.
started NPH [**8-31**] in addition to insulin gtt.
[**12-13**]:[**Last Name (un) **] consulted,erythromycin started for high TF
