Admission Date:  [**2173-5-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-5-10**]


Service:  C-MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint is rapid heart beat, status
post cardioversion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old male with
a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, questionable
history of coronary artery disease, who presented as a
transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization and electrophysiology study.

The patient states that on the day prior to admission he was
performing yard work when he noticed that he felt more
fatigued than usual.  He stopped his activities and ate lunch
and dinner but continued to feel fatigue.  Upon going to
sleep, he felt that his heart was beating rapidly and called
Emergency Medical Service.  He states that he felt no other
symptoms aside from fatigue.  He denies any dizziness,
shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, or abdominal pain.

On arrival to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital Emergency Department, the
patient was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 70.  An admission electrocardiogram revealed a
wide complex tachycardia.  He was successfully cardioverted
at 100 joules into a normal sinus rhythm.  Peak creatine
kinase at that time was 250, with a MB fraction of 29.3, a MB
index of 1.3, and a troponin of 27.2.  He was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization and possible implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

Cardiac catheterization revealed a right-dominant system with
a 50% mid left anterior descending artery lesion, 40% distal
left anterior descending artery lesion, mid 85% mid obtuse
marginal, 30% ostial, and 70% ostial right posterior
descending artery.  The left circumflex and obtuse marginal
were successfully stented, and Integrilin was discontinued
secondary to dental bleeding.

He currently has no complaints of chest pain, and no
complaints of palpitations at this time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past Medical History includes)
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
3.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2167**].
4.  An admission for syncope in [**2172-11-3**].
5.  Status post right arm amputation secondary to a gunshot
wound.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife who has
[**Name (NI) 2481**] disease.  He has no children.  He is a former
smoker; three packs per day times 35 years.  No alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is negative for coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Gentleman physical
examination revealed the patient was in no acute distress.  A
pleasant elderly male.  He had some bloody urine in his Foley
catheter.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  Neck examination revealed
no jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lung
examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Ventricular bigeminy.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed bowel sounds were present.
Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  An area of ecchymosis in
the right upper quadrant.  Groin examination revealed oozing
in the right groin with no bruit.  Extremities were warm.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital revealed white blood cell count was
9.6, hematocrit was 42.5, and platelets were 174.  Sodium was
140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was 23,
blood urea nitrogen was 32, creatinine was 1.7, and blood
glucose was 177.  Prothrombin time was 13, partial
thromboplastin time was 24, and INR was 1.  Creatine kinase
was 185, MB was 29, with an index of 11.7, and troponin was
27.2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular
contractions and normal QRS axis.  Minimal ST segment
depressions in V3 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix as well as initiated on
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.   Serial cardiac enzymes revealed a
resolving creatine kinase with a troponin of 9.4.  Peak
creatine kinase was 354 with a MB fraction of 7.

He was continued on his atenolol, and low-dose lisinopril 2.5
mg p.o. q.d. was added to his regimen.  He will continue his
course of Plavix for a total of ninth months.

2.  VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA ISSUES:  It was noted on hospital
day three by telemetry that the patient was noted to be in a
wide complex tachycardia with mental status changes and a
systolic blood pressure of 90.  The patient was started on a
lidocaine drip and was given Lopressor 2.5 mg intravenously
and was successfully cardioverted into a normal sinus rhythm.

He was then transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit
for further monitoring and evaluation.  The Electrophysiology
Service recommended an amiodarone infusion which was then
switched to oral dosing of 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., after a 3-day
course, followed by amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.  It was felt
that if the patient's rhythm remained in normal sinus on
amiodarone he would not require an electrophysiology study.

He will be sent home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor for
further evaluation as well as monitoring of his QTc while on
amiodarone and will follow up with his primary cardiologist,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.

3.  COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  It was noted on
hospital day two that the patient spiked a temperature to
102.4 and was coughing up yellow sputum.  He was also noted
to desaturate to 68% on room air.

A STAT chest x-ray was taken at that time revealing mild
congestive heart failure with bibasilar atelectasis.  This
left basilar atelectasis was persistent through serial chest
x-rays, and it was felt that this could represent a left
lower lobe pneumonia.  He was started on levofloxacin and
vancomycin.  His white blood cell count climbed to 19.5 but
then downtrended with the initiation of antibiotics to a
nadir on 8.5 on discharge.  The vancomycin was discontinued.
Urine cultures and blood cultures at this time were
unremarkable.  He was to complete a total of a 10-day course
of levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. and should follow up with
his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17025**], in
approximately one to two weeks for follow up of his
community-acquired pneumonia.

4.  ELEVATED BILIRUBIN ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have
an acute rise in total bilirubin with a peak total bilirubin
of 9.2; which coincided with his acute hypoxia and evolution
of his community-acquired pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis
without evidence of cholecystitis.  His total bilirubin
downtrended without intervention to a discharge bilirubin of
2.1.  It was felt that this acute rise in bilirubin was
secondary to possible sepsis/bacteremia, even though blood
cultures were sterilized with initiation of antibiotics prior
to obtaining these cultures.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17025**] for further evaluation of his liver function
tests.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with Physical
Therapy services.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
