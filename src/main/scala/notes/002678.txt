Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital1 1474**] with rapid atrial rhythm, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a complicated 34 year old woman with hypertrophic
nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, atrial tachyarrhythmias, PVI for
AF complicated by R atrial perforation and  clot in pericardium
with recent VF arrest with prolonged CPR and subsequent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 5932**]. The patient was discharged to home
on [**5-27**] and did well for about one week per her report. She then
developed increased lower extremity edema bilaterally as well as
left hand swelling per her report. She felt that she might be
volume overloaded so she presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**6-3**].
States she was minimally active (using wheelchair/bedside
commode) but she was trying to be as active as possible.

On admission to [**Hospital1 1474**], INR was supratherapeutic 5.8 which
increased to 7.2 on [**6-5**]. She was treated with various
medications (zaroxolyn, lasix IV & PO) for volume overload. CT
of the chest demonstrated large right-sided pleural effusion and
right-sided infiltrate. On [**6-9**], right-sided thoracentesis was
performed with removal of 1300 cc fluid. Initially treated with
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, changed to
azithromycin/cefuroxime on [**6-6**]. She was diuresed ~ 5 L in first
3 days. She tells me her breathing felt "improved" after the
[**Female First Name (un) 576**], but increased resp distress noted after thoracentesis
([**6-10**]); she was further diuresed. RUQ ultrasound performed due
to elevation of bilirubin (level unclear) which was benign.
Patient afebrile throughout admission, BPs ranging 90s-120s. HR
typically 40-50s, with brief episodes in the 90s. Weight noted
to be 88.9 kg on admission and 82.1 on transfer. Last BP in
nursing notes documented to be 65/60 with HR 54 prior to
transfer; CCU attending note states patient blood pressure
80s-90s and HR 90-110s prior to transfer. She received 250 cc NS
bolus at [**2023**] this evening.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
black stools or red stools. States she hads had cough since
prior admission and small amounts of blood in sputum during
recent [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization and at home but none since [**Hospital1 1474**]
admission. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Cardiac MR on [**2121-2-28**] with asymmetric LVH with maximal wall
thickness of 19 mm at mid septum with focal hyperenhancement
consistent with hypertrophic CM. EF 55%.
# SVT with A fib, left atrial tach and AVNRT s/p pulmonary vein
isolation on [**2121-3-18**] complicated by right atrial perforation,
pericardial clot
# Questionable history of WPW
# Tobacco use with bronchitis and associated multifocal a tach.

# Anxiety
# Obesity
# Asthma, ?COPD
# Ob/gyn history includes 4 TABs, 2 deliveries with one
surviving son, both premature (25 weeks and 23+ weeks); the
second infant was delivered in the context of chorioamnionitis
and did not survive.

Cardiac history, compiled from OMR:
Age:
12: Initial presentation with syncope
13: Seen at [**Hospital3 1810**] for history of syncope, chest
pain and progressive exercise intolerance; diagnosed with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and underwent catheterization in
which LVEDP was found to be 20. Started on ongoing verapamil
therapy.
16: Cardiac arrest secondary to complex tachycardia,
successfully resuscitated. Repeat catheterization showed left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 36-40 without outflow
tract obstruction. EP showed inducible atrial flutter with a
rapid ventricular blood pressure; dx'ed w/rapid antegrade
conduction and possible pre-excitation. Started on Norpace
(dysopyramide); kept on verapamil and Norpace for many years.
Had occasional palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.
25: Appendicitis during pregnancy, with post-op course
complicated by congestive heart failure, intubated and then
eventually extubated without difficulty; delivered son at 25
weeks.
RECENT HISTORY:
* [**2121-2-8**]:  Atrial arrythmias (MAT diagnosed at [**Hospital1 18**],
Afib/flutter seen at OSH), started on amiodarone.
* [**2121-3-1**]:  Admitted from [**Hospital 1474**] Hosp w palpitations,
diagnosed as AVNRT, discharged with increased dose of verapamil,
made long-acting.
* [**2121-3-18**]:  Pulmonary vein isolation procedure. Post-procedure
atrial tachycardia w/multiple morphologies-->cardioversion.
Respiratory distress and post-procedure
re-intubation<--pulmonary edema and possible contribution of
pan-sensitive klebsiella PNA. Ongoing fevers, ?PE treated with
heparin. Discharged on amiodarone 200 mg TID.
* [**2121-4-5**]: Dyspnea, chest pain, possible pneumomediastinum;
diagnosed with large pericardial effusion; pericardial window
done; post-op atrial tachycardia. During post-op course, had
difficult-to-assess fluid status and was taken to the cath lab;
in holding area had PEA arrest, coded for 1 hour; intubated for
6 days and put on CVVH after cath confirmed volume overload;
extubated; and then reintubated 2 days later for aspiration and
hypoxia, then had pneumothorax as complication of intubation;
ultimately extubated again, treated for pneumonia. Admission
also notable for ARF and pancreatitis.
* [**2121-5-12**]: Admitted from rehab with dyspnea and chest pain,
anemia and mild CHF symptoms; having atrial tachycardia with
varying 2:1 and 3:1 conduction. Discharged [**5-15**].
* [**2121-5-18**]: Admit for shortness of breath, coded for 30 minutes
while being evaluated in ED: PEA w wide-complex near-sine-wave
tachycardia [**3-15**] hyperkalemia; regained pulse in 30 minutes,
after which she had NSR w RBBB; then had wide complex tachy and
BP drop; defibrillated x1 200J, briefly on dopamine gtt.
Admission notable for ongoing fluid overload and
weakness/apparent deconditioning. Source of hyperkalemia was
never clear and did not repeat itself. Pt discharged on [**5-25**] to
home after refusing placement to rehab. Pt had been at home
until her most recent admission to [**Hospital1 1474**].
