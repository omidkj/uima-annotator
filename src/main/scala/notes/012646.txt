Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Simvastatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10370**]
Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain and syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Small Bowel Enteroscopy
Right Internal Jugular Vein Catheterization
Left Knee Arthrocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Briefly this is an 88 year old male with hypertension, atrial
fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement, GI bleeding, prostate
cancer MGUS and chronic renal insufficiency who presented from
home with left knee pain and syncope. The patient reports that
he was in his usual state of health prior to admission.  On the
day of presentation he woke up with significant pain in his
right knee with swelling.  It made it difficult for him to
ambulate.  Later in the morning the patient was sitting on the
comode when he began to "act funny" and subsequently "blacked
out."  He does not rememeber this event well but says that his
daughters were present. He does not report any head trauma.  He
does note that the week prior to this event he was experiencing
black stools.  He also experienced non-bloody emesis x 1 on the
day of presentation.  He had had multiple admissions in the past
for dizziness and melena.  He was brought to the emergency room
for further evaluation.

In the ED, his VS were 96.7, 59, 111/33, 19, 98%RA. He was
guaiac negative on exam. An old facial droop on the right was
noted. EKG showed v-paced rhythm. Trop was 0.14 around his
baseline with CRI. NH4 was 99 around his baseline. No asterixis.
He was given 1L NS, ASA 325mgX1 and admitted for further workup.


On admission the floor the patient was noted to be hypotensive
with systolic blood pressures in the 60s with altered mental
status.  He was not noted to have any melena or hematochezia.
His hematocrit on presentation was 32 but the following morning
it had decreased to 22. He received a liter of IVF, one unit of
O negative blood while awaiting type and cross with subsequent
improvement in his blood pressure and mental status.  He was
subsequently transferred to the MICU.

In the MICU, hypotension was felt to have been most likely from
GIB. Also found to have hemarthrosis of the left knee which was
not felt to be contributing significantly to his decreased
hematocrit.  He had no signs of infection, no EKG changes, TnT
stable with ARF, improving. Got vitamin K and FFP on admit to
ICU. Small bowel enteroscopy showed no active bleeding or AVMs,
only small erosion in antrum. He received a total of 8 units
PRBCs in the MICU with stabilization of his hematocrit in the
range of 28 to 30.  Of note he also developed laboratory
abnormalities consistent with low grade DIC with
thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen at 64 and elevated fibrin
degredation products of 160-320.  He received one dose of
cryoprecipitate with improvement.  He was transferred to the
floor in stable condition.

Of note- MICU team spoke with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] whom discussed his
prior 6 GIB with similar presentations with a dramatic HCT drop
in absence of melena/hematochezia, no other sx other than HCT
drop. Melena or guaiac + stools appear ~2 days later. He is
unaware that family declines endoscopies. He also noted that pt
has known severe DJD/arthritis of knees and stated that if knee
effusion was asymmetric then most certainly sustained trauma to
knee although has close to 24hour supervision. Pt has underlying
dementia w/waxing & [**Doctor Last Name 688**] change in AMS. Pt never received
anticoagulation for AF due to severe GIB risk. He is not on
ASA/NSAIDs for same reason.

On re-transfer to the floor, the patient was hemodynamically
stable.  He currently denies specific complaints including
fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizzines, chest pain, shortness
of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria,
leg pain or swelling. No bowel movements over a 24 hour period.
All other review of systems negative in detail.
