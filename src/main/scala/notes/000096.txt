ADDENDUM:  Ms. [**Known lastname 96864**] was actually not discharged from the
hospital on [**2115-9-21**], but rather was kept on the Medicine
Service and transferred to Gynecology/Oncology on [**2115-9-27**]
which was the date of exploratory laparotomy with surgical
debulking and staging of presumed ovarian cancer.

From the time of the last dictation until her transfer, she
was continually treated for her DVT with a PTT of 60-80.  She
also received an IVC filter on [**2115-9-24**] without
complications, and her Coumadin was restarted after this
procedure.

She completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
questionable UTI versus fecal contamination.  She was
afebrile throughout her stay with little rise in her white
blood cell count.

From the time of the last dictation, she was continually kept
on [**12-20**] liters of oxygen via nasal cannula, and kept on
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments around the clock
for her COPD, in addition to diuresis with IV Lasix for
likely pulmonary edema.  Her creatinine bumped to 1.3 on
[**2115-9-26**], and her Lasix was held.

Her hypertension was under good control throughout admission
with Atenolol 25 mg b.i.d. and Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.  Her
diabetes was continually controlled with sliding scale
insulin with holding of her home oral hypoglycemics due to
decreased p.o. intake while admitted.  She had no episodes of
hypoglycemia.

Hematologically, she was anemic with iron studies consistent
with anemia of chronic disease, and she was transfused a
total of 3 units between the time of the last dictation and
the time of transfer to Surgery.  She was transfused 2 of
these units on the day before surgery in preparation for
possible surgical bleeding.
