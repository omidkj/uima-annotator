Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
tx from OSH with resp failure and left hum fracture.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 2

History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 83 year-old woman with history of htn,
hypothyroidism, parox afib, hip fracture 4 years ago and s/p b/l
mastectomy for breast cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 12594**] after fracturing her left humerus on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF,
anemia-guiaic positive requiring transfusion-neg
egd-(esophagitis and gastroparesis), no colonoscopy done due to
instability, with d/c to rehab on [**10-3**], then re-admitted [**10-4**] with
resp distress, initially thought [**3-6**] pneumonia, placed on broad
spectrum abx, spiked fever on [**10-5**], ICU stay without intubation,
but [**3-6**] high o2 requirement serial CT's done and revealed
interstitial fibrosis and b/l ground glass opacities.  Has been
afebrile since [**10-5**], on zosyn/vanc until [**10-11**], switched to
levoquin at that time.  Because of CT findings, diff expanded to
possible amio toxicity (for afib on for years w/o previous
problems), pulm fibrosis, alv proteionisis, fat embolism and
steroids were started. Amio d/ced on [**10-10**], steroids started 9/
Now on 40 prednisone daily with plan for quick taper. Before
transfer, by report 94% on 4 liters.  On arrival here, on
5liters 86-87%-->93% on non-rebreather.  Not tachypneic.  ABG
shows 7.48/34/64.
.
She reports no fevers over past few days, stable largely
non-productive cough.  otherwise she says sob has been improving
and currently with non-rebreather she feels comfortable.
..
Concerning her humeral fracture, she continues to have
significant pain, says she was told pins had "slipped" and she
needed further repair.  By report, discharge summary, shoulder
is misaligned and patient needs correction. Patient primarily
transferred for further management of shoulder.
..
She feels comfortable, has some pain in left arm which is better
after iv pain meds. No other sign complaints at this time.

Pertinent Results:
wbc 33.3 when last checked
.
IMAGING:
Chest CT [**2120-10-13**]: ground glass opacities with upper lobe
predominance, septal thickening, associated pleural effusions,
small mediastinal lymphadenopathy, dilated esophagus,
cardiomegaly
.
CTA [**2120-10-16**]:
1. Comminuted left humeral head fracture, not transfixed by the
large indwelling pins.
2. Small fracture fragments within the shoulder joint.
3. Diffuse abnormalities within the left lung worrisome for
infectious/inflammatory process. Would correlated with the
dedicated CT of the chest from [**2120-10-13**].

.
Chest CT [**2120-10-24**]:
1. Diffuse ground glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis
consistent with the diagnosis of ARDS, with associated
organizing fibrosis. Although the etiology of ARDS is uncertain,
hyperdensity of the liver raises the concern for drug reaction
from amiodarone toxicity as a potential cause of ARDS.

2. Increasing dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and
medial right lower lobe, which could represent superimposed
acute infection.

3. Increasing bilateral pleural effusions with a
moderate-to-severe right pleural effusion and a moderate
left-sided pleural effusion.

4. Increased CT attenuation of the liver could be due to
amiodarone toxicity given that the patient had been on
amiodarone.

CXR [**2120-11-12**]: Tip of the NG tube is in the stomach. Tip of the
right IJ line is at the junction of the SVC and right atrium.
Since the prior study, there has been improvement in the right
lower lobe and left perihilar opacities, although there is
persistent opacity in the lateral aspect of the left mid lung.
Most likely this represents a degree of infiltrate superimposed
on increased interstitial markings consistent with CHF.

IMPRESSION: Overall, there has been a slight improvement in the
degree of pulmonary opacities bilaterally. Underlying
interstitial process remains essentially unchanged.

Bronchial washings: Rare atypical epithelial cells, numerous
neutrophils and bacteria. No hemosiderin-laden macrophages are
seen.

ECHO [**2120-10-16**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

MICROBIOLOGY:
c diff neg x 3, toxin B: pending
VRE UTI by cx [**2120-11-7**]
[**2120-11-2**]: mod MRSA in sputum
pl fld [**2120-10-26**]: rare MRSA
BAL [**10-14**] and [**2120-10-25**]: HSV 1, 10-100K MRSA


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is an 83 year-old woman with history
of htn, hypothyroidism, paf who suffered humeral fracture on
[**9-28**] s/p ORIF at [**Hospital6 19155**] which failed. Patient
was sent to rehab [**10-3**] but returned the following day with
hypoxic respiratory failure and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. She suffered progressive respiratory
failure and was eventually made CMO and passed.

# Fever/ID: Was not spiking fevers during first week of
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] while off of antibiotics. Pneumonia not
thought to be bacterial, initially.
- started acyclovir 400mg tid on [**2120-10-19**] for HSV 1 cultured
from lungs. We treated given we had no other diagnosis. Stopped
[**10-28**].
- Gave fluconazole for [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] uti (x2days =[**2034-10-19**])
- Pt extuabed [**10-21**], but had further resp distress and vomiting,
possible aspiration. Started Levaquin/Flagyl [**10-22**] and completed
14 day course.
- BAL showed GPC in pairs, started vanco [**10-26**] and completed 14
day course.
- wbc back on the rise prior to being made CMO, cx remain NGTD -
? new PNA vs C diff (toxin B pending)
.
..
# Resp failure: Initial CXRs upon admission to the OSH were
unremarkable, so this process is acute. CT w/ground glass
opacity. Pt was intubated [**10-14**] for bronch and kept intubated for
ARDS. Pt placed on ARDSnet settings then entered in ARDS study.
Per path, hemosiderin and fat laden macrophages have ddx =
alveolar hemorrhage; Wegeners; GBM, also can be fat emboli.
- s/p bronch [**10-14**] with BAL to r/o
