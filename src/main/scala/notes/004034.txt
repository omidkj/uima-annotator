stabilized with IV diltiazem and lopressor. Pt was stabilized
and transferred to floor
.
On floor, he triggered for HR in 150s. also was found to have
vomit in mouth and chest with satts in low 90s on 8L. was
transferred to MICU for presumed aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 yo male with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, afib w/ RVR p/w
hypoglycemia, hypotension. was treated for aspiration pneumonia
and suspected sepsis. was in MICU twice and was finally
transferred to floor for further care.
.
#Tachypnea/hypoxia:  Patient had a known multifocal PNA, with
MRSA in his sputum.  had witnessed aspration of his vomit. CXR
showed bilat consolidation. pt was afebrile and wbc count was
wnl. was hypotensive on presentation and hence considered to be
in sepsis. was started on vanc, zosyn and flagyl initially. on
transfer to the MICU, the flagyl was discontinued. on discharge
the antibiotics were converted to PO abx. hence vanc and zosyn
were d/c'd and linezolid and ciproflox were started. the patient
will be treated for total 14 days. hence will be on linezolid
and ciproflox for 7 more days from discharge. the O2 satts
improved after starting the abx. as mentioned above, pt was
afebrile with nl wbc count.aspiration precautions were followed
.
#Afib with RVR: identified during this admission. HR ranged from
90 to 170. pt used to convert to sinus rhythm by himself
sometimes and then would [**Last Name (un) 7162**] go back into afib. was started on
dilt 30 qid and was uptitrated to 60 qid. the HR was well
controlled at this dose with patient in sinus rhythm. will
require anticoagulation with coumadin. coumadin was held during
this admission as INR was supratherapeutic. will need to restart
once INR becomes therapeutic.
.
#Hypertension: Admitted with hypotension, which was thought to
be from sepsis. received 2 L NS in ED and BP returned to [**Location 213**].
was hypertensive later in the course. was treated with dilt 60
qid.
.
#s/p CVA: Patient was anticoagulated. was supratherapeutic on
coumadin. hence it was held. will need to restart once INR
becomes therapeutic.
.
#FEN: Continue tube feeds. NPO as aspiration risk. will need to
check electrolytes daily and replete accordingly as his
potassium, magnesium and phosphate were low during this
admission.
.
#Prophylaxis: no need of heparin SQ as INR was supratherapeutic,
bowel regimen, famotidine
.
#Code: DNR/DNI.
.
