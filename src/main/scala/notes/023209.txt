pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6483**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2161-4-23**] for further management of her coronary artery
disease. The cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
revascularization and Ms. [**Known lastname 6483**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
revealed a less then 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal
carotid arteries. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed
mild mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 15-20%. On
[**2161-4-24**], Ms. [**Known lastname 6483**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. Amiodarone was started
prophylactically for prevention of a ventricular arrythmia given
her low ejection fraction and past history. On postoperative day
one, Ms. [**Known lastname 6483**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated.
The electrophysiology service was consulted in regards to
placing a prophylactic internal cardiac defibrillator given her
low ejection fraction and past run on non sustained ventricular
tachycardia however elected to not treat her for ventricular
tachycardia given her preoperative run of ventricular
tachycardia was likely ischemia related. Beta blockade and an
Ace inhibitor were started and her amiodarone was discontinued.
Plavix was started for anticoagulation. She developed atrial
fibrillation on postoperative day two and her amiodarone was
restarted which converted her back to a normal sinus rhythm. The
congestive heart failure service was consulted for assistance in
her care. Gentle diuresis was continued. On postoperative day
four, she was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and recovery. The
diabetes service from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance with
her diabetes medication management. Ms. [**Known lastname 6483**] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged to her home on
postoperative day seven. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an
outpatient.
