History of Present Illness:
79 year old woman with history of severe oxygen dependent COPD,
and recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer (diagnosed
on imaging, no biopsy yet) who presents with 2 days of
difficulty breathing, fatigue, slight confusion, and
irritablity.  At baseline, the patient is on [**2-24**] L O2 at home
for severe COPD.  Per her daughter and son, she has had
increasing shortness of breath over the past 2 days with new
production of green thick sputum.  No observed fevers or chills.
 Symptoms are associated with increasing fatigue and appearance
of anxiety.  The patient's family increased her O2 to 6L, but
symptoms continued to progress.  They called her PCP who
recommended admission to the hospital.

In the ED, initial VS:  98.7 84 186/80 24 96% 4L.  The patient
was non-responsive, and was intubated for airway protection.
She was started on PCV with FIO2 40%, Peep 10, Rate 18,
Inspiratory pressure 35.  ABG following intubation: pH 7.25 pCO2
105 pO2 422 HCO3 48.  The patient underwent CXR that showed 1.
New widespread right pulmonary opacities, concerning for
infection versus edema.  2. Persistent right upper lobe mass.
She received 1 dose of vancomycin and zosyn for likely
pneumonia.  She was transferred to the MICU for further
management.  VS prior to transfer:  98.2 76 90/51 18 98%.

In regards to the patient's recent diagnosis of lung cancer, it
was diagnosed in [**7-3**] by CT scan.  Scan revealed an enlarging
right upper lobe mass, bulkly mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a
presumed large liver metastasis.  No biopsy was performed, as
the patient would likely be a poor candidate for both surgery
and chemotherapy.  Multiple goals-of-care discussions were held
between the family and the patient's PCP that resulted in "full
code" status for the time being, in accordance with the
patient's prior wishes.  However, the family is now considering
a "do not resuscitate" order given her poor prognosis. The
patient was supposed to be evaluated by palliative care today,
when her status changed acutely.  OF NOTE, the patient is not
aware that she carries a diagnosis of cancer, as the family is
worried that it will make her give up hope.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 98.6  108/56  83 94% on
CMV with FIO2 40%, TV 350, PEEP 10.  Patient was intubated and
lightly sedated.

Imaging:
CXR (on admission):
IMPRESSION:
1.  New widespread right pulmonary opacities, concerning for
infection versus edema.
2.  Persistent right upper lobe mass.

CXR ([**9-24**]):
Cardiac size is normal.  Patient has known right upper lobe lung
mass and
hilar lymphadenopathy.  Diffuse heterogenous opacities in the
right lung are unchanged.  There is most likely complication of
lung cancer , less likely pneumonia.  If any there are small
bilateral pleural effusions.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Left
lower lobe opacity is new worrisome for focus of pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube is in the standard position.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.

CXR ([**10-1**]):
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
improvement of the extensive parenchymal opacity on the right,
notably the level of the right lower lobe.  Otherwise, no
relevant change is seen.  A slight increase in lung density on
the left is caused by positional factors.  Endotracheal tube,
left PICC line and nasogastric tube are in unchanged
position.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old woman with history of severe oxygen dependent COPD,
and recent diagnosis of likely metastatic lung cancer who
presents with difficulty breathing, fatigue, confusion, and
irritablity; found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and
likely pneumonia.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure [**2-22**] pneumonia and pulmonary
malignancy:  She has baseline severe COPD and new diagnosis of
lung cancer complicated by acute decompensation.  She was
intubated in the ED for airway protection due to
unresponsiveness.  Acute fluffy infiltrates on CXR (R > L), and
worsening cough productive of green sputum concerning for large
aspiration pneumonia as a source of decompensated lung disease.
This is an addition to the diseased, cancerous lung that was
likely difficult to ventilate at baseline.  She completed a
course of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.  She became
very difficult to ventilate, given the 2 entirely different
physiologic properties of the 2 lungs (congested, cancer-filled
lung vs. hyperinflated, COPD lung).  Her peak a
