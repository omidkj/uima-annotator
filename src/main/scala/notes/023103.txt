hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR angiogram with stent placement
Rigid bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
65 yo male diagnosed with small cell lung cancer s/p chemo and
radiation therapy with increasing tumor burden and left main
obstruction, s/p left mainstem stent placement [**11-30**], presenting
today with submassive hemoptysis.  Patient was recently admitted
for elective rigid bronchocscopy, found to have pulsus, and had
pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion with tamponade.
Patient then had left main stem stent placed via IP and
discharged on [**2180-12-2**].
.
Per wife, patient was doing well following discharge.  Today,
just after eating breakfast, patient's wife (who is providing
history) heard patient coughing in kitchen.  Wife then found
patient had coughed up bright red blood, covering plate, with
coffee mug half-filled with blood.  Patient then asked wife to
call 911.  Patient had some lightheadedness, no syncope, no
other symptoms.
.
Patient was then transferred to OSH, where patient received 750
cc NS at OSH and tylenol for headache, and was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED given recent history.  In the ED, vitals were 97.4
106   113/80  22  100% 4L NC.  He felt well, although continues
to cough teaspoons to tablespoons of bright red blood and clots.
 He denied dyspnea, fever, chills or chest pain.  At baseline on
2 liters supplemental O2, requirements unchanged.  Patient went
to the OR from ED for rigid bronchoscopy and cauterization with
APC.
.
In OR, patient received LR 700 cc, propofol, midazolam 2 mg,
fentanyl 200 mcg, phenylephrine, and rocuronium.  Bronch showed
left main stem medial wall is completely eroded, unclear if
changed from prior bronch.  LLL patent, but with tumor burden
distal to stent.  LUL remains collapsed.  Fresh clot was noted
at carina, no signs of active hemorrhage.  Patient was then
transferred to ICU for further management and angiography,
possible embolization vs. vascular stent.
.
Patient arrived in ICU inubated and sedated.  History provided
by wife.

[**2180-6-14**]: hemoptysis of teaspoon 5cc BRB. CT scan noted for new
infiltrate showing encasement of artery to LUL and subtotal
occlusion of the bronchus to the LUL. Smoking was continued at

tumor.

headache, no addtional bleed.
CT: increasing central adenopathy, narrowing of left mainstem
bronchus to [**12-10**] of the right bronchus, complete obliteration of
the LUL bronchus with collapse of LUL with compromise of left
pulmonary artery. Bronchus to LLL, lingular were compromised.

CXR: There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 5 cm
above the carina. A left-sided tracheal stent is again seen and
without complications. Pacemaker wires are seen. There is again
seen volume loss on the left with increased density within the
left upper lobe. This is unchanged. The right lung is clear. No
pneumothoraces are present. No pneumomediastinum is identified.
Overall, there has been no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88214**] is a 65 yom with HLD, HCV [**1-10**] IVDU, SCLC complicated

1. Hemoptysis: Patient admitted intubated. He underwent rigid
bronchoscopy with no intervention performed, as well as IR
angiogram with [**MD Number(3) 88216**] placement on the first night of
admission. Hct stable s/p IR stenting of PA. Per discussion with
IP and IR, no further interventions possible at this time if
patient rebleeds. Discussed overal situation with patient,
confirmed DNR/DNI status prior to discharge.
