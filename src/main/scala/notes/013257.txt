HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 40474**] is a former
26 [**1-13**] week female born at 540 gm delivered at 7:17 on [**2152-3-28**].

screens 0 positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface
antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, GBS unknown and human
immunodeficiency virus negative.  Mom developed severe
pregnancy-induced hypertension which progressed to eclampsia
with a seizure at 4:20 AM on the morning on delivery.  Fetal
heart tracings showed decelerations during this event but
stabilization afterwards.  Mother initially presented on
The baby was known to have intrauterine growth restriction.
Mother was treated with Betamethasone on [**3-26**].

Past obstetric history revealed two miscarriages and one term
infant in [**2137**].

Delivery was by cesarean section with Apgars 5 at one minute
and 7 at five minutes.  The baby was intubated in the
Delivery Room and was transferred to the Newborn Intensive
Care Unit for ongoing care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission weight 540 gm, less than
10th percentile, length 30.5 cm 10th percentile, head
circumference 22.5 cm 10th percentile.  Current weight 1465
gm, 10th percentile, length 35 cm, 10th percentile, head
circumference 30.25 cm, less than 25th percentile.

Vital signs on admission revealed temperature 37, heartrate
156, respiratory rate 40s, blood pressure 49/25 with a mean
of 34.  The baby appeared slightly dysmorphic on admission
with prominent frontal bossing and possibly rocker-bottom
feet.  Anterior fontanelle soft and flat, large with sutures
slightly open and large posterior fontanelle.  Red reflexes,
not clearly visible.  Pupillary membrane present.
Respiratory equal with slightly forced breathsounds.
Cardiovascular, S1 and S2 normal intensity, no murmur.
Abdomen soft, three vessel cord.  Genitourinary normal for
gestational age female.  Extremities, feet somewhat flat.
Neurological, good tone, active responses to touch.  Of note,
chromosomes ultimately were sent and were 46 XX within normal
limits.

Current physical examination reveals with endotracheal tube,
3.0 cm tube taped at 7.4 cm marker at the lip on ventilator
settings of 27/7 and a rate of 36, requiring FIO2 of 30 to
40%.  Bilateral breathsounds are coarse and equal.  Heartrate
is 140s to 160s with a soft systolic murmur.  Pulses are
equal times four.  Baseline blood pressure is 60s to 70s/30s
to 40s with means in the 40s to 50s.  Abdomen is distended,
full, no bowel sounds.  Small umbilical hernia.  [**Last Name (un) 37079**]
tube to slow intermittent suction.  Anterior fontanelle, soft
flat and full with suture split.  Baby is lethargic with a
Fentanyl drip running.  She has a central PICC line in and a
peripheral intravenous line.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - The baby initially received
three doses of Surfactant and required conventional
ventilation with peak pressures of 22/5 and a rate of 35.
She transitioned to the high frequency ventilator on day of
life #2.  She had peak pressures of MAP of [**9-15**] and Delta P
of 22, required several bicarbonate boluses for metabolic and
respiratory acidosis.  She ultimately transitioned again to
the conventional ventilator on day of life #12 with settings
of 22/6 and a rate of 28, requiring 35% oxygen.  Her
respiratory and general support escalated around [**4-19**] when
she developed Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with a positive
trach aspirate.  She was critically ill which required not
only high ventilator settings but also prolonged course of
antibiotics, see Infectious Disease below.  The baby
ultimately developed large bilateral pneumatoceles which are
present on chest x-ray.  She has remarkably weaned her vent
settings over the last several days from 28/7 and a rate of
40, overnight on [**5-23**] to 19 escalated to 100% oxygen and
began a watch for necrotizing enterocolitis.  Today she had a
gas at 5 AM of 7.28,  54.  She has had her rate weaned over
the course of the day with her last decrease down to a rate
of 36 with 27/7 and oxygen requirement of 30 to 40%.  Her
last gas approximately 1600 hours of 740, 43, 59, 28 and 0
which prompted decrease in rate from 38 to 36.

Cardiovascular - The baby initially did not require any
pressor support on admission, had a soft murmur.  She has had
numerous echocardiograms, the first one being on [**3-29**]
which showed a probable patent ductus arteriosus with
supersystemic right ventricular pressure.  She received
another echocardiogram on day of life #3 which showed a large
patent ductus arteriosus with left to right flow and right
ventricular hypertrophy.  She had completed that course and
ultimately progressed without further issues of the duct.
She had a follow up echocardiogram on [**4-3**] that showed no
patent ductus arteriosus with right ventricular pressure
greater than half the systemic and again on [**4-17**], which
showed no patent ductus arteriosus, no evidence of vegetation
and no ventriculoseptal defect.  Plan would have been to
repeat another echocardiogram when she completed her
antibiotics if not indicated sooner.  On [**5-15**], Pulmonary
was consulted and agreed with the current treatment plan.
The baby had been receiving [**Name (NI) 19188**] 2 puffs q. 8 hours
which continues.  She was receiving Diuril 30 mg p.g. b.i.d.
which is 20 mg/kg/dose.  This has been on hold since she was
made NPO on [**5-24**].  The last dose was on [**5-23**].  She also
was receiving [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Cl supplements 1.5 mEq p.g. b.i.d., last
dose on [**5-23**], in PM.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The baby initially was
NPO.  She had a radial artery line inserted and a double
lumen umbilical vein catheter through which she received
maintenance intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition.
Trophic feedings were started on day of life #7.  She
achieved full feedings by day of life #12.  When she became
sick with Staphylococcus aureus she was once again made NPO
and enteral feedings were reintroduced on day of life #42.
She had frequent stops and starts but ultimately achieved
full enteral feedings of breastmilk or PE 22.  Feedings again
were held on [**5-23**] into [**5-24**] when her belly became
distended and on [**5-24**] she passed a bloody mucousy stool.
She currently is receiving PN 12.5% glucose, 2 gm of protein
and 1 gm of fat with 2 mEq/100 cc of sodium chloride and 2
mEq/100 cc of potassium acetate.  She currently has a central
PICC line in place and a peripheral intravenous line.  She
had electrolytes within normal limits on [**5-22**] with a
sodium of 135, potassium of 4.6, chloride 101 and carbon
dioxide of 23.  Her sodium has trended downward with a low of
127, 3.4, 89, 21, on [**5-25**] in AM BUN 22, creatinine .5.  At
the time of this dictation, there is a set of electrolytes
pending.  Her PN written for [**5-24**] has not been hung at the
time of this dictation.  She is NPO with [**Last Name (un) 37079**] to low
intermittent suction.  This has put out approximately 2 cc of
tan mucousy fluid.  Her abdominal girth as increased over the
last several days from 24 cm to 27 cm.  She has had no stools
since [**5-24**] and her urine output in the past 24 hours is
approximately 2 cc/kg/hr.

Gastrointestinal - The baby initially demonstrated
physiologic jaundice and received phototherapy and has
demonstrated a high direct bilirubin for which she has been
treated with Phenobarbital and Actigall which was started nearly
2 days ago . Her Phenobarbital started on [**4-18**] when her
bilirubin was 8.9/7.3, 1.6.  Her last bilirubin on [**5-22**] was
8/6.1 1.9.  Her Phenobarbital current dose is intravenously 7 mg
q.d.  Actigall was started on [**5-23**], dose 15 mg p.g. q. 12
hours, this is currently on hold.

Hematology - The baby is 0 positive, Coombs negative and has
received numerous blood transfusions.  Her hematocrit has
dropped over the last 24 hours from 43 to 28.  She is
currently receiving a total of 20 cc/kg divided into two
aliquots, the first is in the progress of infusing now.  The
baby also has required platelets in the last 24 hours.  Her
