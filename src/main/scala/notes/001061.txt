Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, tachypnea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
69 y/o F w/ a h/o respiratory failure s/p trach placement and
revision [**5-/2147**], pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with
pancytopenia, recently discharged [**2147-6-16**] for hemoptysis, trach
stenosis, VAP and sepsis who was referred to ED intensivist at
[**Hospital **] rehab, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 83106**], for tachypnea, tachycardia to the
140s, minute ventilation of 16, pancytopenia(unchanged from
recent hospitalization), and non-gap acidosis.  Patient has
remained febrile, presumed secondary to medication reaction (see
below). Also noted that she had a modest amt of hemoptysis
(thin, frothy).
.
Recent admission [**Date range (3) 102692**] for hemoptysis, inability to
ventilate, VAP, and septic shock. Septic shock presumably
secondary to VAP and was treated with levophed, IVF, cefepime,
and tobramycin (colonized with MDR pseudomonas and initially
treated with cefepime but isolated again from sputum now
resistent to cefepime). Blood cultures remained negative but MDR
pseudomonas isolated from sputum.  Patient then became volume
overloaded following fluid resuscitation but responded well to
diuresis. Plan was to discharge to [**Hospital **] rehab for a scheduled
14 day course of cefepime/tobramycin to be completed [**6-17**].
However, patient had creatinine elevation prior to discharge
thought to be due to Tobramycin, which was discontinued.
Patient found to have 80% stenosis of trach tube with
granulation tissue. Patient intubated from above. IP revised her
trach with placement of [**Last Name (un) **] device and excision of
granulation tissue. [**Last Name (un) 295**] was then replaced [**6-9**] with a
permanent customined #7 Shiley trach. Patient required
mechanical ventilation throughout hospitalization with periods
of apnea and presumed to have muscle weakness potentially from
central process due to h/o CVAs.
Hospitalization complicated by persistent low grade fevers
despite appropriate antibiotics thought to be most likely
medication related rather than infectious(INH, ethambutol most
likely). Also complicated by chronic pancytopenia secondary to
MDS and chronic hemolysis from frequent blood transfusions.
.
In ED, T104, BP 80s/60s, HR 170s, RR 30-40s, O2 100%. She
received Tylenol with temp decrease to 101.6.  A right femoral
CVL was placed. She was volume resuscitated with 7L NS but
remained persistently hypotensive so Levophed started with SBPs
to 90s. Patient remained tachypneic breathing over vent. Labs
notable for ABG 7.35/20/180. ARF with Cr 3.3 from last 1.4.
Pancytopenic but stable from prior discharge without left shift.
CXR intially showed improved R middle and lower lung opacities.
However, a repeat CXR following volume resuscitation showed
blossoming consolidation in R lung.  She received cefepime x 1.

[**6-21**] CT HEAD: COMPARISON:  Head CT, [**2147-2-10**]. FINDINGS:
Compared to prior examination, there is again evidence of prior
right frontal lobe infarct with cortical gyriform
calcifications.  This is unchanged in appearance.  There is also
a focal hypodense lesion seen in the
region of the right internal capsule, which may represent prior
lacunar
infarct.  This is also unchanged.  There are prominent sulci and
ventricles with parenchymal volume loss.  There is no evidence
of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline
structures, or new areas of infarction.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white
matter differentiation is preserved.  There is moderate mucosal
thickening of the sphenoid sinus on the left side.  There is
minimal mucosal thickening of the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage or new areas of
infarction.
.
[**2147-6-23**] MRI HEAD: FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia
seen in the right frontal lobe with areas of low signal on
susceptibility images indicative of chronic blood products.  In
this irregular area of encephalomalacia there is a irregular
area of high signal on diffusion images with low signal on ADC
map indicating slow diffusion.  Given the presence of chronic
blood product slow diffusion is most likely related to the blood
products.  This is unlikely to represent acute ischemia in this
location given the appearance.  Also in absence of vasogenic
edema and presence of encephalomalacia an abscess within this
location also appears less likely.  However, when the patient's
condition permit, gadolinium-enhanced MRI would help for further
assessment. There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and changes
of small vessel disease are seen.  Coronal images through the
temporal lobe demonstrate medial temporal atrophy wi
