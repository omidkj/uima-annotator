Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 103863**], [**MD Number(1) 103864**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Torn lateral meniscus left knee.
2. Neuropathy with atrophy of the left quads and left calf.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], MD

[**Known firstname **] presented with a magnetic resonance imaging scan dated
[**2177-12-30**].  I reviewed that image. He has a thick tear of
the lateral meniscus.  He has a positive [**Doctor Last Name 103865**].  The
risks and benefits of arthroscopic for torn lateral meniscus
were discussed and understood.  He is a firefighter from
[**Location (un) **].

[**Known firstname **] was brought to the outpatient Operating Room and
induced under general anesthesia, prepped and draped in the
usual manner.  The left lower extremity was outlined per his
topographical landmarks.  A 4 mm stab wound was placed in the
anterior lateral Hardy-[**Doctor Last Name **] triangle.  A 4 mm [**Doctor Last Name 79**]
arthroscope, 30 degree lens, was inserted.  The knee was
distended with saline.  High outflow cannula was placed
superior and medial to the patella.  With transillumination a
working portal was established in the anterior medial.

There was marked synovitis within the knee and a very
metaplastic fat pad that, with the ligamentum mucosum encased
the entire ACL.  At this point the articular cartilage of the
patella showed grade 3 changes particularly of the medial
facet.  The trochlea just appeared age appropriate.  We
performed a synovectomy along the medial gutter up under the
inferior pole of the patella and down to the ligamentum
mucosum.  This was lysed and then we resected the interior 60
percent of the inflamed infrapatellar fat pad ([**Last Name (un) 75398**]
lipoiditis) and continued the synovectomy up the lateral
gutter which was impacted with synovium metaplasia.  Once the
major synovectomy was completed, we were able to visualize
the medial compartment.  The articular cartilage looked fine.
The medial meniscus was lax and had loss of hoop tension,
however, it was serially visualized on the inferior and
superior surfaces and was intact.

The anterior cruciate ligament was intact.

In the modified figure-of-four position we found a radial
tear right at the mid point of the lateral meniscus as well
as a tear of the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  The meniscus was discolored
and there was mucoid degeneration in the horizontal cleavage
portion of the meniscal tear.  With a series of hand meniscal
punches, we trimmed it back to a stable rim.  We then used
the Mitek thermal radiofrequency wand for part of the more
degenerate parts of the lateral meniscus.  This will give us
more stability.  The knee was then copiously lavaged,
vacuumed, reinspected, and no further mechanical derangement
was noted.

[**Known firstname **] tolerated the procedure well.  He had some asthmatic
symptoms at the end and was taken to the Recovery Room
intubated and on pulse oximeter and we will order an x-ray at
the recommendations of the anesthesiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. s/p left knee arthroscopy - procedure went well. Will need to
f/u with Ortho (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13355**] as outpatient, scheduled already
[**2-13**]. Ortho resident = [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18732**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103867**], pager [**Numeric Identifier 56149**]

2. Hypoxia/difficulty extubating - The patient had a difficult
intraoperative course from respiratory standpoint and required
conversion from LMA to ETT for "floppy airway" and was difficult
endotracheal intubation. Unclear if pt may have aspirated during
surgery or post-operatively given CXR findings, elevated
lactate, and aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis may be contributing
to difficulty weaning from vent.  He had stable ABG's overnight
and RSBI of 24 and was extubated without difficuty the next
morning with anaesthesia present.

3. Elevated lactate - elevated, ranging between 3.2 to 3.9. Not
acidotic and anion gap is 12. Unlikely sepsis/aspiration
pneumonia as patient is clinically stable and afebrile without
evidence of hypoperfusion.

4. Asthma - No wheezes on exam.  Given albuterol MDIs Q4H
through ventilator overnight but given normal PIP and plateau
pressures unlikely asthmatic.

5. GERD - PPI IV was continued.

6. HTN - HCTZ was held
