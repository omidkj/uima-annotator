Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with placement of Cypher stent in RCA


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year-old male with a history of CAD (s/p CABG
and prior PCI to RCA) who presented to an OSH with chest pain
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for persistent chest pain.
.
He was in his usual state of health until 4 days prior to
admission.  At that time, he went fishing and walked up a large
[**Doctor Last Name **].  He experienced chest discomfort, typical for him, while
doing this.   The pain is "squeezing" and is associated with
diaphoresis and nausea.  It radiates to his shoulders/arms/neck.
 At that time there was some associated SOB, which is not
typical for him.  Over the next two days, he continued to feel
unwell, but the pain had subsided.  One day prior to transfer,
he experienced "reflux" which he explains is similar to his
cardiac chest pain.  This persisted with no relief from 2
percocet.  He presented to the OSH for further care.
.
Blood pressure noted to be 130/70, HR 70 and irregular.  Initial
troponin I (1:15pm) was 0.09 and the subsequent troponin
(5:05pm) was 0.13.  His Serum Cr was 2.1.  He was started on
nitro and heparin gtts.
.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 140/89 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was 78
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min and
he was satting 98% on 3L NC. Generally the patient was morbidly
obese. The patient was oriented to person, place and time. The
patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was large and
it was difficult to assess JVP.  There was an obvious sternal
incision scar and some chest pain with palpation.  The
respirations were not labored and there were no use of accessory
muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation bilaterally with
normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
.
Cardiac exam revealed no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
The heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing; there was 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection
and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no
stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

EKG demonstrated a v-paced rhythm with right bundle morphology.
There were no obvious ST-T changes.
.
ETT performed on [**2190-1-29**] demonstrated decreased uptake in teh
anterior septal wall with some reuptake, fixed inferior defect,
VL dilation and an EF of 34%.
.
Cardiac cath performed on [**2190-2-11**] right coronary dominance.  The
left main was free of disease; the LAD showed a known occlusion
with a patent LIMA; ramus was occluded with an open SVG; LCx was
patent and gave rise to several small marginal branches in the
posterolateral branch.  It was free of significant disease.  The
RCA showed an 80% focal, high-grade eccentric stenosis.  The PD
and PL were free of disease.
.
Cardiac cath [**2191-10-4**]:
The initial angiography revealed an 80% instent
restenosis of the previously placed mid RCA stent. Heparin was
administered for anticoagulation. The initial strategy was to
direct
stent the lesion with a drug eluting stent using minimal amount
of
contrast given renal insufficiency and using previously placed
stent as
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. JR4 provided an excellent support. Choice PT XS wire
crossed
the lesion relatively easily. 3.0 X 18 mm Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was
deployed
at 20 atms and postdilated with 3.5 X 12 mm Quantum Maverick at
20 atms
in the mid and proximal stent. There was no residual stenosis,
dissection, embolization or perforation. The patient experience
his
anginal pain with balloon inflations that resolved with
nitroglycerine.
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. patent LIMA to LAD and
SVG to
D1 graft.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful stenting of native mid RCA in stent restenosis
with Cypher
DES
.
Renal ultrasound [**2192-10-2**]:
The right kidney measures approximately 11.3 cm in diameter.
There
is a small, echogenic 9 mm focus within the left pole of the
right kidney,
appears relatively non-shadowing, but most likely represents a
noncalcified stone.  No renal masses.  Hydronephrosis is
present.  There is good corticomedullary differentiation.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 year-old male with history of CAD and multiple risk factors,
admitted with chest pain that had not resolved.
.
1. Chest pain:
Given the high suspicion for ACS, the patient was admitted to
the CCU and put on heparin and nitro drips, without improvement
in his pain.  The patient had no EKG changes and his enzymes
were negative.  It was felt that his chest pain was most likely
due to GI problems, and he was given a cocktail with maalox and
lidocaine and continued on a PPI and transferred to cardiac
stepdown.  He continued to have chest pain, and given his
established extensive disease, he was sent for cardiac
catheterization on [**10-4**].  He was found to have instent 80%
restenosis in his RCA and a Cypher stent was placed.  Given that
he described "heartburn" that was sometimes relieved by PPI/GI
cocktail, he was advised to follow-up with a gastroenterologist
near his home in [**Location (un) 3844**] for possible EGD.  He was advised
to continue his PPI on discharge.
.
2. Chronic kidney disease:
Pt had prior nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma as well as
possible medical renal disease from DM and hypertension.  His Cr
on admission was 1.8; his ACE inhibitor was held prior to cath,
and he received acetylcysteine with fluids prior to his cath.
In addition, administration of contrast was minimized during the
procedure.  His Cr was 2.0 on
