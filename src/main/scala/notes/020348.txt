Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with dementia (non-verbal) brought in from
[**Hospital3 2558**] with lethargy and hypoxia (not on baseline O2)
noted this morning. She reportedly sounded congested. O2 sat
there was 69% RA, 79% on 5L NC, T 96.7, HR 120's, BP 129/73. On
arrival in the ED VS were T 99.9 HR 85 BP 130/54 RR 26 (28-30)
Sat 70->improved to high 84% on NRB. ABG showed 7.33/49/62. She
was started on CPAP with improvement to 94%. After 1 hour ABG
showed 7.31/45/74. She was DNR/DNI on arrival however her
daughter and HCP reversed this and requested intubation if
needed. She received 1L NS. Blood cultures were drawn but urine
culture was not sent. She was given 1gm ceftriaxone when CXR
revealed RML consolidation. She was ordered for additional 1gm
vanco iv and zosyn (not clear if they were given). Labs were
significant for troponin of 0.07, potassium 5.9 (on repeat 5.1),
WBC 13.9, lactate 2.6. ECG showed a. flutter at rate of 111. She
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
At baseline per daughter she opens eyes, eats (with assistance)
thick liquids and purees. She has had private nursing for the
past 3 years with no infectious complications or bed sores but
prior to that had frequent UTI's, aspiration PNA's and bed
sores. Additionally daughter notes baseline blood pressure 'runs
low.'

activities of daily living and not ambulatory
2.  H/o Syncope
3.  Osteoporosis
4.  Depression
5.  Heel ulcer
6.  Incontinence
7.  Atrial fibrilation with RVR, not on anticoagulation

activities of daily living. Pt is non-verbal at baseline. The
patient is widowed. She has two daughters, one of whom is the
health care proxy [**Name (NI) 16405**] [**Name (NI) 349**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16406**]).  The other

Imaging:
ECHO Study Date of [**2199-8-12**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg).  There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the report of the prior
study (images unavailable for review) of [**2196-12-14**], a regional
wall motion abnormality is now detected.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2199-8-14**] 4:50 AM
Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved since [**8-13**], while
small right pleural effusion has increased. Small left pleural
effusion may be present, also increased and left lower lobe
atelectasis remains unchanged. ET tube in standard placement,
nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view and
a right-sided central venous catheter tip projects over the low
SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2199-8-13**]  9:34:52 AM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
LVH with secondary ST-T changes

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with dementia (non-verbal) brought in from
[**Hospital3 2558**] with lethargy and hypoxia and was found to have
paroxysmal atrial flutter with RVR, elevated troponin, MRSA
pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.  Pt was intubated and supported
by vasopressors.  Pt care shifted to comfort measures only on
[**8-15**] per family.
.
1.  Respiratory distress, likely due to PNA and pulmonary edema:
 CXR on admission suggested infiltrate in RML.  Pt had presented
with low-grade fevers and leukocytosis with L shift and
bandemia.  After IVFs for fluid resucitation in an effort to
keep her BP and UOP up, pt was found to have pulmonary edema on
repeat CXR and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
An ECHO showed new mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis with EF of 45% to 50%.
Prior to shifting to comfort care, pt was receiving vancomycin
and zosyn for MRSA pneumonia and furosemide as needed for
respiratory distress.  She was also extubated on [**8-15**].
.
2.  Hypotension, presumed septic shock from PNA + cardiogenic
component (decreased output during a fib, decreased LV function
on ECHO):  Pt required phenylephrine to keep MAP at goal of >60
prior to shifting to comfort care.  Upon discharge, she was
maintaining SBP 100s on her own.
.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  This ranged from being
rate-controlled on her own to RVR.
.
4.  Elevated troponin on admission, likely due to demand
ischemia in the setting of dehydration, hypoxia, and a. fib with
RVR upon at that time:  ECG had some concerning changes though
not significantly changed from previous readings.  CK, CKMB
index were not elevated x4.
.
5.  Hypertension: Pt's SBP remained <120 during her hospital
stay.  Her home antihypertensives were held.
.
6.  Fluids/electroyltes/nutrition:  Pt's electrolytes were
repleted as necessary.  She did received tube feedings prior to
shifting to comfort care.
