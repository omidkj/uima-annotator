Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
AICD firing


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 y.o male with history of [**Known lastname 15196**] disease
s/p aortic valve replacement, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF of 30% whose icd fired last night multiple times.  Patient
reports that around 2 am he was using a urinal and felt a
"thump" when his ICD fired.  He was assymptomatic and did not
have any chest pain, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath.
He was sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital where EKG/strip captured fast VT
(>200 bpm; K+ 4.1, Troponin-I 0.08).  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had similar
episode in [**Month (only) 404**] and was started on amio in that setting.  He
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial VS were HR 75, BP 94/72, RR 14, 99% 2L
NC.  He was given a 500 cc NS bolus.  He was seen by EP who
recommended lidocaine gtt at 4mg/min.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was comfortable and
assymptomatic.  Interrogation of his ICD revealed he had been
shocked 6 times between [**3-2**] 21:58 and [**3-3**] 05:37.  He had been
shocked out of afib into sinus rhythm.
.
On further review, the patient reports being admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital within the past month, discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab
on [**2-4**] where he was started on albuterol and his blood pressure
medications were uptitrated for hypertension.  He was then
transfered to [**Location (un) 169**] in [**Location (un) 1411**] for further rehab.  On
review of systems he reports worsening vision with difficulty
[**Location (un) 1131**] small print for the past couple of weeks and
intermittant lightheadedness on sitting up that resolved about 5
days ago.  Also positive for constipation with last bowel
movement 3 days ago.  He denied any increased orthopnea, PND,
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fevers, chills, recent
flu-like illnesses or rashes. No nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, BRBPR, melena, or diarrhea. All other review of systems
were negative.

[**2174-3-3**] ECG: Baseline artifact. A-V paced rhythm with A-V
conduction delay and ventricular premature beats. Since the
previous tracing of [**2174-1-22**] there is probably no significant
change but baseline artifact on both tracings makes comparison
difficult.

[**2174-3-3**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: No definite acute intrathoracic
abnormality. Limited study due to lack of imaging of the
costophrenic angles. Repeat imaging can be obtained if
clinically warranted.

[**2174-3-4**] Transthoracic Echo - The left atrium is markedly
dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF= 20%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Normally-functioning bileaflet aortic prosthesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-10-20**], LV
systolic function has further deteriorated. Severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. Pulmonary pressures are slightly
higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old male with non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy and history of atrial tachycardias, s/p failed
cardioversion and dofetelide who presents with multiple episodes
of v-tach/v-fib for which he was shocked with his AICD.

# V-tach/V-fib storm - Etiology of increased frequency of shocks
was unclear.  There was no evidence for infection, exacerbation
of pulmonary disease, or worsening heart failure on
presentation.  He was ruled out for an MI.  The patient was
started on a lidocaine drip in the ED that was continued for 24
hours without further episodes of VT or VF.  He was noted to be
difficult to arose the morning after admission that may have
been related to lidocaine toxicity.  These symptoms resolved
later in the morning after the drip was stopped.  EP also
recommended reloading the patient with amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for
2 weeks followed by 400 mg daily (instead of the previous 300 mg
daily), starting mexilitine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], and starting magnesium
oxide 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was continued on an aspirin and
beta-blocker.

# Heart failure - The patient's ejection fraction at last echo
was 30%.  Repeat ECHO on this admission showed worse EF of 20%
with increased MR and higher pulmonary pressures.  He did not
appear clinically volume overloade
