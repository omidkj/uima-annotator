History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 17029**] 65 year old man with past medical history
significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery
disease s/p CABG and recent PTCA with BMS to D1 [**2142-3-19**], CHF
(EF 40%) presenting with worsening difficulty breathing for the
past 3 days.
.
Patient reports worsening difficulty breathing for the past 3
days. He has been residing in rehab facility after recent TMA of
Right foot for non healing diabetic foot ulcer. Patient
describes shortness of breath with exertion (transfering to and
from wheelchair) that was at its worse today, and was associated
with chest burning which lasted one hour. Patient denies any
frank pain, arm / neck / jaw pain or tingling, did not
experience palpitations or syncope / presyncope/
lightheadedness.
.
Per Transfer note, pt coplained of shortness of breath and chest
pain at rehab facility. Pt given SL Nitro with good effect,
however with new recurrent episode shortly thereafter EMS was
called and patient trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
.
In the ED: 0 98.8 80 179/54 100% ? NC. Patients ECG obtained and
concerning given worsened ST elevations in setting of LBBB. Code
stemi called, patient given 40mg lasix IV, 1 inch nitro paste,
Heparin bolus given only 6K, integrilin bolus 18, 600 plavix
load, aspirin 324mg more given. He was guaiac negative. After
evaluation by cardiology fellow, clinical presentation felt to
be more suggestive of volume overload and hyperkalemia. Code
stemi cancelled, patient admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service for futher
managment.
.
At time of transfer, VS HR 72 118/42 21 4L NC 95%. Patient
remained chest pain free while in the ED, no urine output was
recorded.

Imaging:
C Cath ([**2142-6-11**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system revealed
diffuse
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was a small caliber vessel
without
disease.  The LAD had 60-70% calcified stenoses of the proximal
section,
as well as the diagonal branch, and was occluded after the
mid-section.
The LCX had sequential stenoses of the proximal and distal LCX,
with
occluded OM1 and OM2 branches, and total occlusion after the
distal LCX.
The RCA was a non-dominant vessel with sequential 80% stenoses.
2. Selective graft venography revealed a widely patent SVG-PDA
and LPL
graft.  The SVG-OM1 graft had a 30-40% stenosis in the mid-SVG,
and was
patent to the OM1 branch.
3. Selective graft arteriography revealed a widely patent
LIMA-LAD
graft.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg, and mean PCW
pressure of 30
mmHg.  The wedge tracing was notable for a prominant v-wave with

pressure of 51 mmHg, consistent with possible mitral
regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of
38 mmHg,
and mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 140mmHg.  The
cardiac output
was normal at 5.1 L/min.  There was no aortic stenosis detected
by
pullback technique.
5. Nonselective left subclavian injection revealed a 70%
stenosis of the
proximal left subclavian artery, with a 45 mmHg pressure drop
across the
stenotic lesion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
3. Mild pulmonary and systemic hypertension.
4. Subclavian stenosis.

CXR ([**2142-6-10**]):
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, bilateral airspace opacity, right
greater than
left, concerning for pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
effusions, also greater on the right.

Echo ([**2142-6-12**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. LV systolic function appears
moderately-to-severelydepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and hypokinesis of
the inferior septum, anterior free wall, and apex. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

A possible discontinuity in the myocardium between the inferior
and posterior wall at the basal level is seen. The discontinuity
occurs where normal inferior wall meets akinetic posterior wall.
This could represent a contained pseudoaneurysm of the left
ventricle. This finding was present on the prior study.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2142-5-1**], the mitral regurgitation is increased.

CT Chest ([**2142-6-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe coronary artery atherosclerosis. Anemia.
2. Likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. Contribution of drug
reaction, for
example amiodarone toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration
cannot be
a
