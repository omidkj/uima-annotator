History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old male with known coronary disease. He
sustained a myocardial infarction in [**2177**] and underwent stenting
to his LAD at that time. He continued to experience angina and

lesion in his circumflex and 70% diagonal stenosis. Based on the
above results, he was referred for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62520**] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].  Surgery was uneventful and he was
brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
Low dose beta blockade was resumed. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. He experienced brief bouts of atrial fibrillation for which
beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. He remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm. His last episode of atrial fibrillation was
on postoperative day two. His preoperative medications,
including Plavix were eventually resumed. He otherwise responded
well to diuretics and by discharge, was close to his
preoperative weight. PT followed pt during entire post-operative
course and was at level five by discharge. He continued to make
clinical improvements, labs were stable, physical exam
unremarkable and was cleared for discharge on postoperative day
seven. At discharge, his room air saturations were 96%. He went
home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
