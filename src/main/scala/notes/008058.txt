Fever, respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old woman with a medical history of HTN, DM, CKD, who
was transferred to the ED from [**Hospital1 100**]-MACU for fever to 102.
She recently had a prolonged stay at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**].

She was previously independent until [**2108-5-17**], when she was found
down in her apt in feces for an unclear amount of time (max
1-1/2 days).  She was initially unresponsive and hypothermic and
after being warmed she was conscious but incoherent.  Her blood
cultures from [**5-17**] grew pneumococcus (4/4 bottles) and MRSA ([**1-16**]
bottles).  Subsequent Cx ([**5-20**], [**5-21**], [**6-2**]) were negative.
Sputum Cx on [**5-17**] grew MRSA and Pneumococcus; subsequently sputum
grew MRSA on [**5-22**].  She was treated with a two and a half week
course of Vanco for the MRSA.  Vanco levels were mainly [**10-26**]
over her treatment course.  It is unclear for how long she was
treated with ceftriaxone but she was not discharged on it, so
max of two and a half weeks.  TTE on [**5-18**] and [**5-23**] were without
endocarditis.

Given her respiratory distress and acid base status she was
intubated in [**5-22**] and extubated on [**6-2**].  She was given frequent
nebs and placed on a steroid taper.

She also was found to have rhabdomyolysis from being down for an
unclear time.  Her CK trended from 3396 to 168 ([**5-23**]).  She was
treated with fluids.

Her creatinine was also elevated during the last admit.  She was
given aggressive IV hydration (also for rhabdo) and although her
Cr initially improved it trended up again to 4.1. She became
volume overloaded and developed anasarca and thus underwent 4
sessions of HD.  Her last HD sessoin was on [**6-4**] and her Cr was
2.4.

Given her change in mental status a CT Head was done which was
unrevealing.  Neuro was consulted and felt it was a metabolic
encephalopathy. An MRI was limited by motion, but did not reveal
anything and an EEG did not show a seizure focus.  Her mental
status improved with resolution of her PNA and HD but she was
still not oriented or able to verbalize.

Per report from the patient's sons, her NGT was pulled out last
pm, unclear if TF were running at the time.  Then, the morning
of admission, the patient was found to have a fever of 100.8 and
was tachypneic with an O2 sat of around 87% on 2L NC (per ED
report, not noted in transfer paperwork).  She was therefore
transported to the ED for further assessment.

In the ED, initial vs were: 102 76 190/70 30 100 on NRB. Her
labs were notable for WBC count of 11, Cr of 2.4, Na of 148.  An
ABG was done on NRB: 7.43/44/150.  Patient was given Vanco,
Zosyn, Levoflaoxacin.

On the floor, the patient is non-conversant, but is occasionally
able to nod appropriately. She is having occasional myoclonic
jerking.  She is on a NRB and appears to be in no acute
distress.

Review of systems: Unable to obtain.  Denies pain.

Social History:
Prior to [**2108-5-17**] [**Location (un) 620**] admit she was living alone,
independent and functional with all her ADLs. She was still
driving. She was independent of her shopping, accounting,
cooking and cleaning her house. She did not have any memory
problems. She had difficulty walking long distances secondary to
her neuropathy. She did not walk with a walker or cane.
After her admit she was discharged to [**Hospital1 100**]-MACU

Tob: few cigs per day. She first started when she was a
teenager. She used to smoke a pack per day.

but there is T wave flattening in leads V3-V5. Compared to the

[**6-7**] CXR: Left lower lung opacity may represent atelectasis
although
pneumonia cannot be ruled out; small bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**6-7**] LENIs: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the
bilateral lower extremities.

[**6-8**] TTE: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artrery systolic hypertension. No valvular pathology
or discrete vegetation seen.

[**6-8**] CT Chest (prelim):
1. Alveolar pattern of lung disease in right subpleural lung
zone compatible with infectious process. As far it can be shown
on a non-contrast examination, there is no evidence of
associated empyema. Bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Nodular opacity is unchanged in size since examination from
[**2103**], though has increased in density, and based on this
observation, malignancy cannot be excluded and delayed biopsy
should be performed after treatment of acute condition.
3. Relative distention of the gallbladder since prior
examination with
associated cholelithiasis. Correlation with ultrasound is
recommended to
exclude the possibility of cholecystitis.
4. Low-attenuation lesion within the right thyroid lobe, likely
nodule, and this can be correlated clinically, and if further
evaluation is deemed
necessary, a thyroid ultrasound on a non-emergent basis can be
considered.

[**6-8**] RUQ U/S: Distended gallbladder with intraluminal sludge and
gallstones without definite evidence of acute cholecystitis. If
clinical concern remains nuclear medicine hepatobiliary scan
could be performed
