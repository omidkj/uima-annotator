Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-24**]: Admitted to MICU service.  GI & transplant surgery teams
consulted.
[**12-25**]: Colonoscopy showed ischemic colitis.  Taken to OR for
emergent ex lap, where a subtotal colectomy & end ileostomy was
performed. Pathology eventually revealed mucosal infarction of
the colon & transmural necrosis of the small bowel.

[**12-25**]: Admitted to SICU for postop care.  Although his mental
status & hemodynamic profile improved folliwng his colectomy,
this was significant for several blood product transfusions for
blood loss anemia & thrombocytopenia.

[**1-2**]: He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 10 in good condition, where he
was followed by renal & ID consultants.  His postop course was
complicated by large ostomy outputs.  Eventually it was realized
that Mr [**Known lastname **] had developed an ascitic leak adjacent to his
ostomy.

[**1-21**]: Return to OR for repair of his ascitic leak & placement of
2 [**Doctor Last Name **] drains.  Returned to SICU for postoperative management.
This 2nd prolonged ICU stay can be summarized in an organ system
approach:

NEURO: His mental status gradually cleared, and his pain was
covered with intermittent opiates.  He was continued on
rifamixin to prevent encephalopathy.

CV: His cardiac function was following with echocardiograms & PA
catheters.  He remained in a high output cardiac failure c/w his
hepatorenal syndrome, which was treated intermittently with
midodrine/octreotide & levophed.

RESP: Postop, he did well with respect to his repiratory status.
 However, he developed worsening repiratory failure requiring
intubation on [**2-10**].  Post-intubation CXR revealed CHF vs. ARDS,
which was treated with diuresis.

FEN: Mr [**Known lastname 59177**] poor liver function led to worsening renal
failure, and eventually he became anuric with a rising
creatinine.  A R IJV dialysis line was placed on [**2-11**] & he was
maintained on continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis.

GI: His GI tract worked well, and he was tolerated tube feeding
via a postpyloric dobhoff tube.  His liver function never
completely improved, however, and developed an peritoneal leak
from midline wound because of his persistent ascites.  On [**2-8**],
he was noted to have blood loss anemia & melenic stools.  An
endoscopy showed gastric varices & other evidence of portal
gastropathy.

HEME: Because of his liver failure, Mr [**Known lastname **] had trouble with
blood loss & renail failure anemia, thrombocytopenia, & elevated
INR.  He required multiple transfusions of RBC, platelets & FFP
to prevent excessive bleeding.

ID: This ICU stay was notable for recurrent infections, with
[**Female First Name (un) **] repeatedly growing from his foley catheter & his [**Doctor Last Name **]
drains.  He developed a 2nd ascitic leak, this time from his
midline incision, which was treated with a VAC device & the
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 59178**] [**Doctor Last Name **] drains.  He was covered with broad spectrum
antibiotics & amphotericin bladder irrigation, but was unable to
clear the fungus in his peritoneal fluid.

ENDO: Following his surgery, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed marked
insulin resistance & required an insulin drip.  He was
transitioned to large twice daily NPH doses and a sliding scale
of regular insulin.

DISPO: After he was declined for orthotopic liver
transplantation, a family meeting was held on [**2-20**].  He was made
CMO, his pressors were discontinued & a morphine drip was
instituted.  He expired comfortably at 5:17pm with his family
present.  An autopsy was requested by his wife [**Name (NI) **].
