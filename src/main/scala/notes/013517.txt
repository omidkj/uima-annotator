Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
progressive shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old gentlemen with history of
emphysema, SCC diagnosed in [**8-/2129**] s/p left upper lobectomy and
s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation, PE/DVT in [**11/2129**], pericardial
effusion w/ tamponade requiring pericardial windown in [**1-/2130**],
s/p IVC filter placement who presents from clinic with SOB and
CTA showing multiple PEs and LLL pneumonia. On note, in early
[**Month (only) **] patient developed a DVT with pulmonary embolism, and he
was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].  At taht time, he was started on lovenox.
Subsequently, he was readmitted for a left upper lobectomy on
[**2129-12-20**].  He was discharged [**12-28**]. At that point, he was
anticoagulated with Coumadin. He subsequently developed
gradually progressive shortness of breath, which eventually
became quite profound.  He presented to the ER on [**2-7**]/2 and was
initially felt to have pneumonia, but at the time of admission
was found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade in the
setting of a supratherapetuic INR to 15.  He had a pericardial
drain place and a total of 1 liter of bloody fluid was removed.
However, then appeared to be continued loculated pericardial
fluid so eventually a sub-xiphoid pericardial window was
performed and an IVC filter was placed.
.
During the hospitalization, he had runs of afib/aflutter and was
started on metoprolol 25mg tid.  He was seen in house by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **], a cardiolgist, for further evaluation of afib/flutter.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have frequent runs of rapid atrial
flutter mostly along with some AFib, some of which were
symptomatic.  Metoprolol could not be tolerated up any further
due to low blood pressure.  Therefore, he was started on
amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and then 200mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3 weeks
and then 200mg daily.  2 days after starting the amio, the
atrial arrhythmias decreased significantly and he was more
ambulatory with less dyspnea. During that hospitalization,
decision was made to discontinue Warfarin given difficulty with
maintaining therapeutic INR and multiple recent surgeries.
Patient was discharged with Aspirin 325mg qd for
anticoagulation.
.
Over the last several days, patient has had progressive SOB.  He
states VNA saw him on Monday and he was 88% on RA and started on
O2.  His O2 req increased to 3.5 L.  Even with O2, he becomes
SOB after walking only 15 feet.  Patient was seen in clinic.
CTA was done and showed RML and RLL lobe pulmonary embolisms,
LLL PNA, trace pericardial effusion.
.
In the ER, initial vitals were: 99.1 84 124/73 32 95% 2L.
Later, patient triggered for tachypnea to 30s on 2L, speaking in
full sentences 89% on RA. Heparin ggt was started with a bolus.
A bedside TTE showed trace effusion but no RV collapse.  Of
note, atrius cardiologist perfomed a TTE in clinic which was
normal.  For pneumonia, patient was started on
Vancomycin/Levaquin.
.
On the floor,patient feels comfortable at rest without SOB.
Denies recent cough, fevers/chills, rhinorrhea.  Has not had any
brbpr, no dark stools, no nausea, no dysuria, no swelling in the
legs.  Does note he went for check up and had mild infection at
sternum incision for which he completed a course of keflex.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
PET CT [**2129-8-10**]: FDG-avid LUL large 49x40mm lung lesion is seen
highly concerning for lung cancer. There are FDG-avid
prevascular lymph nodes, as follows: 27 x 19 mm and 18x14mm.
There is a prominent lymph node in the left peritracheal area
measuring 18x12mm (not FDG-avid) and non-specific.
.
Bronchoscopy [**2129-8-22**]: obtained tissue for pathology which
revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma (stage IIIa)
.
[**2129-9-9**]: left VATS and lymph node biopsy to complete staging work
up. No pleural metastases were noted but there were bulky level
6 lymph nodes, which were positive for metastatic carcinoma on
frozen sections; final pathology showed poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis histologically
similar to the prior lung sample.
.
[**9-/2129**]: Started cisplatin and VP-16 as well as radiotherapy as
neoadjuvant treatment before a definitive surgery
.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:
Emphysema
Bipolar disorder
Patello-femoral syndrome
Squamous cell lung carcinoma (as above)
Pulmonary embolism/DVT in [**11/2129**]
Afib/aflutter
.
Left VATS with biopsy of peri-aortic lymph node [**2129-9-9**]
Left thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node
dissection, and buttressing of bronchial staple line with
intercostal muscle [**2129-12-20**]
Subxiphoid pericardial window [**2129-1-11**]

Social History:
Lives with wife at home.  75 pack-year smoking history, quit [**2-10**]
yrs ago, drinks 3 glasses of EtOH/week and denies use of illegal
drugs

Mother died of pancreatic cancer, father had Parkinsons.  No
other history of cancer or blood clotting disorders

Imaging
TTE [**2130-2-3**]:
1. There is borderline left ventricular hypertrophy.
2. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is  normal, with
an  estimated LVEF of 55-60%.
3. There is subtle septal flattening in systole in one off-axis
view , which can be consistent with right  ventricular pressure
overload, but is nondiagnostic
4. The right ventricle is top normal in size.
5. The right ventricular systolic function is normal.
6. Tricuspid valve appears structurally and functionally normal.
 Mild-moderate regurgitation is seen.  Mild-moderately elevated
PA systolic pressure, estimated at  47 mmHg above RA pressure.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
8. The inferior vena cava is normal, with normal respirophasic
movement indicating normal right atrial pressure.
9. No prior [**Location (un) 2274**] report available for comparison. Discussed
result w/ Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 30186**]. Albeit not classic for acute PE,
clinical correlation is advised.
.
CTA [**2130-2-3**]:
-Acute pulmonary emboli in the right middle lobe, into segments
of the right lower lobe.
-Status post left upper lobectomy.
-Extensive peripheral groundglass and air space disease
throughout the right lungand in the superior segment of the left
lower lobe, with the appearance of earlyconsolidating pneumonia.

-Unchanged pretracheal adenopathy.
-Small pericardial effusion.
.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2130-1-10**]: Findings: A large pericardial
effusion, with attenuation characteristics of bloody or
exudative fluid has developed, impinging on the right atrium and
right ventricle, suggesting cardiac tamponade. Severe
consolidation in the post-operative left lung, extending from
the superior segment to the upp
