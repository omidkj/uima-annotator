Admission Date:  [**2117-10-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-15**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented from
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital status post a non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction.

Over the past couple of weeks, the patient has been very
tired (according her daughter) and wanted to stay in bed a
large amount of the time.  On the morning of admission, the
patient reported that she did not well and wished to stay in
bed.  In addition, she was very weak and felt nauseated.  The
patient's primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**] who prescribed
a suppository for nausea.

On the afternoon of admission, the patient became
increasingly nauseated, vomited, had a rasping and wheezing
to her breathing, and became diaphoretic.  The patient denied
any pain at this time.  The patient's daughter subsequently
called an ambulance which transported the patient to the
outside hospital.

At [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital, the patient's troponin was 75.4, her
creatine kinase was 2621, and her CK/MB was 3045, and AST was
509.  A chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema.  The
patient was started on aspirin and a nitroglycerin drip.  At
that time, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further medical management of her
myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Arthritic left hip.
4.  Prolapsed bladder and uterus.
5.  Benign cyst removal from the right shoulder.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Toprol-XL 50 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Aricept 5 mg by mouth q.h.s.
3.  Detrol 10 mg by mouth twice per day.
4.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her husband
and daughter (who is the primary care giver).  The patient
denies any tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed her temperature was 98 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 122/63, her heart rate was
88, her respiratory rate was 28, and her oxygen saturation
was 96% on 4 liters.  In general, a pleasant and frail female
in mild respiratory distress (using accessory muscles).
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Neck examination revealed jugular
venous pulsation to the level of the jaw at 30 degrees.  Lung
examination revealed diffuse crackles throughout the lung
fields to the apex bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  A 3/6 systolic murmur.
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ on the
right.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ on the left.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed her white blood cell count was 15.4,
her hematocrit was 38.2, and her platelets were 209.  Her
prothrombin time was 12.6, her partial thromboplastin time
was 22.8, and her INR was 1.  Her sodium was 143, potassium
was 4.6, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea
nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 1.3, and her blood glucose
was 175.  Her calcium was 9.3, his phosphorous was 5.6, and
her magnesium was 2.3.  Creatine kinase was 3499.  Troponin
was 16.78.  The patient's stool was occult-blood positive on
rectal examination on admission.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission
revealed sinus tachycardia at 96 beats per minute, axis at
approximately 30 degrees, 1-mm ST elevations in V1, ST
depressions in V3 through V6, I, II, and aVL consistent with
posterolateral MI; Left ventricular hypertrophy.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:
Based on the present history, it was probable that the
patient's myocardial infarction had been occurring for
>12 hours before she presented to the outside hospital.

Based on the clinical course and wishes of the family a
conservative strategy was adopted and  cardiac catheterization
was planned. Medical therapy with aspirin and a beta blocker was
initiated.  The patient was subsequently started on an ACE
inhibitor and statin.

During this admission, her blood pressure medications were
titrated to avoid demand ischemia.  Follow-up examinations were
consistent with critical aortic stenosis and the family was
requested to reconsider an invasive approach but they remained
opposed to catheetrization or surgery.

(b) Myocardium:  An echocardiogram was performed on the
patient during this admission.  At that time, she was found
to have critical aortic stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.4 cm2.

(c) Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry
throughout her admission.  On the evening of [**2117-10-12**], the patient had an hour-long episode of atrial
fibrillation associated with hypotension and decreased oxygen
saturations. This resolved spontaneously and did not recur after
increasing dose of beta-blocker.

2.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was started on an ACE
inhibitor.  Her beta blocker was titrated up for hypertension
and rate control.

3.  DEMENTIA ISSUES:  The patient had a history of recent
moderate Alzheimer's disease.  She was continued on Aricept
throughout this admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Critical aortic stenosis.
2.  Status post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Mitral regurgitation.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Arthritic left hip.
8.  Prolapsed bladder and uterus.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Donepezil 5 mg by mouth q.h.s.
2.  Tolterodine 2 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Metoprolol 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Docusate 100 mg by mouth twice per day as needed (for
constipation).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to have home hospice services.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary
care physician as needed.
