Clindamycin / Ceftazidime

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased secretions and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:

54 y/o female with PMH sig for tracheal stenosis s/p multiple
dilations, recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission [**2102-6-16**] during which a
T-Tube was placed. She had a flexible bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2101**] showing a significant amount of granulation tissue
build-up. On advancing to the distal limb of the T-tube, it was
noted that the patient had a significant amount of granulation
tissue build-up but leaving an approximately 6-mm airway. It was
noted that distal to this build-up of granulation tissue, the
patient had patent distal airways.
.
Pt presented on this admission with increased tracheal
secretions and DOE over prior 2 days. Denies
PND/orthopnea/f/c/night sweats/Chest pain. No SOB @ rest. Pt
admitted to MICU where flex bronch revealed severe tracheal
narrowing (4mm) at the distal end of the T-tube. No hemoptysis.
Pt underwent rigid bronch with placement of tracheal stent and
was started on Levaquin for tracheitis. Pt now with no
complaints and states that she feels much better. Still has
productive cough which is near baseline.

CXR: Tracheal stents in similar position to the recent CT of the

trachea.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT trachea/chest: High-grade narrowing of the airway lumen just
below the inferior aspect of the tracheostomy tube, with
subsequent patency below this level.  It is uncertain whether
this is due to granulation tissue and/or retained secretions.
Disruption of the posterior wall of the tracheal stent in its
inferior portion. Patchy ground-glass opacities within the right
apex and superior segment of the left lower lobe, most likely
due to infection or aspiration.  Attention to these areas on
followup CT scan may be helpful to ensure resolution.  Although
the observed findings are most likely due to granulation tissue,
tumor involvement cannot be fully excluded and direct
correlation with findings at bronchoscopy is therefore
suggested.

Bronchoscopy: High grade fibrosis beneath the inferior part of
tracheostomy tube.  Bx: Lung, endobronchial biopsy:
1. Squamous metaplasia with regenerative epithelial change.
2. Acute and chronic inflammation with ulceration.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26280**] is a 54 y/o female with h/o tracheal stenosis s/p
T-tube placement, Type 2 DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who
presented with increasing stridor and bronchoscopy showing 4 mm
luminal narrowing distal to T-tube.
.
1. Tracheal Narrowing: Shortness of breath was likely due to
granulation tissue and inflammation seen at old tracheal stent
site, as well as increased secretions.  The pt was initially
stabilized with rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement.  Two
days PTA the pt went to the OR for more permanent T tube
placement without event.

2. Increased tracheal secretions: This was believed to be
secondary to tracheitis, given the elevated white count and left
shift on admission.  Sputum culture revealed strep pneumonia.
The pt was treated with Levaquin 500 mg po qd for 7 days.  The
pt was continued on her inhaled steroids and nebulizers with
good effect and dyspnea resolved.

3. Anemia: The pt has a history of anemia per records, but no
clear work up.  There is an unclear etiology.  Iron studies ewre
drawn and are likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease.


4. DM2: The pt was continued on a humalog insulin slide scale
only during her stay, as her PO status was questionable until
her final two days in house.  At discharged she was restarted on
her oral hypoglycemics.  Her finger sticks were generally well
controlled.
.
5. Nausea: Throughout her stay nausea was a recurrent problem
for Ms. [**Known lastname 26280**], especially after receiving anesthesia for her T
tube placement. This was eventually controlled with prn Anzemet,
Ativan, Zofran, and Phenergan in different combinations.

6. HTN: We continued the patient's home dose of Lisinopril
throughout her stay.
.
7. Dyslipidemia: We continued the patient's home statin
throughout her stay as well.
.
8. Hypothyroidism- We continued the patient's home dose of
synthroid throughout her stay. Her TSH was normal.

9. Dispo- Ms. [**Known lastname 26280**] was discharged to her home with her new
Ttube in place and all of her previous home services reinstated.
She will follow up with interventional pulmonology in [**2-17**] weeks
for re-scoping.
