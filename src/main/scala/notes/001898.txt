CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Internal carotid artery stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old female
with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia
(with critical stenosis of the of the right internal carotid
artery of 80% to 99%) who was admitted for stenting and for
angiography.

A preoperative computerized axial tomography of the head on
[**2196-4-19**] was negative for any major vascular and
territorial infarction but was positive for heavy
atherosclerotic calcifications within the cavernous portions
of the internal carotid arteries.

A subclavian angiography, as well as carotid and cerebral
angiography, showed proximal left subclavian disease,
hypoplastic left vertebral artery, tortuous right
brachiocephalic artery with a full 360-degree loop in the
common carotid artery and right subclavian artery.  There was
an 80% calcified lesion at the origin of the internal carotid
artery and a tortuous right common carotid artery.  Due to
the tortuosity of her vessels, angioplasty and stent of the
right internal carotid artery was unsuccessful.  Of note, a
small type A dissection of the proximal carotid artery from
the sheath position occurred during the procedure.

The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
observation after the procedure.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   No fevers or chills.  No chest pain.
The patient denies any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
or lightheadedness.  She also denies abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Hypertension.
 2.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 4.  Right shoulder surgery.
 5.  Hysterectomy.
 6.  Bilateral vein stripping and ligation.
 7.  Right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm repair.
 8.  Coronary artery disease with an inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2183**] and a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in
[**2192**].  In [**2193-12-23**], coronary artery bypass graft times
two with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery and right internal mammary artery to first
obtuse marginal.  She was admitted most recently in [**2195-10-23**] for chest pain.  A catheterization at that time
showed patent grafts.
 9.  Class III congestive heart failure with biventricular
pacemaker and an ejection fraction of 20%.
10.  Gastrointestinal bleed with urgent colectomy in [**2194-9-22**].
11.  Chronic anemia.
12.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of 1.3 to 2).
13.  Peripheral neuropathy.
14.  Peripheral vascular disease and claudication.
15.  Neurogenic bladder.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (At home she is on)

 2.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. twice per day.
 3.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 4.  Neurontin 600 mg p.o. three times per day.
 5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day.
 6.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. three times per day (recently increased
from twice per day).
 7.  Aldactazide 25 mg/25 mg p.o. once per day.
 8.  Humalog sliding-scale.
 9.  NPH insulin 55 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 32 units
subcutaneously q.p.m.
10.  Ciprofloxacin 250 mg p.o. twice per day (started on [**2196-4-27**] for a urinary tract infection).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any tobacco history.  She has
occasional alcohol.  She lives with her husband and her
daughter.  She has occasional [**Hospital6 407**]
services.

FAMILY HISTORY:   No family history of coronary artery
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the
patient's temperature was 99.8, blood pressure was 132/73,
heart rate was 96, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen
saturation was 98% on room air.  She was a pleasant, obese,
elderly woman in no acute distress.  Obese neck, difficult to
assess neck veins.  She had bilateral carotid bruits (left
greater than right).  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally anteriorly.  The heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  Distant heart sounds.  The abdomen was obese, soft,
and nontender.  She had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in
her extremities.  She had warm extremities with trace
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  She was alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  Motor strength was [**4-25**] in all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 12.2 on admission, hematocrit was 44, and
platelets were 286.  INR was 1.2 and partial thromboplastin
time was 24.  Sodium was 137, potassium was 4.3, chloride was
92, bicarbonate was 30, blood urea nitrogen was 45,
creatinine was 1.9, and blood glucose was 150.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient remained stable throughout her
hospital course.  She was given heparin six hours after the
sheaths were removed.  Aspirin and Plavix were added to her
regimen.  She had neurologic checks every two hours, which
were stable.

The patient's creatinine bumped to 2.1 but again trended down
to 1.9.  She was also given post catheterization intravenous
fluids with Lasix as well as Mucomyst for its renal
protective affects.

The patient's hematocrit status post catheterization drifted
down to 37.1, but she remained asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  She was discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with [**Hospital6 3429**] services.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2578**], and with her neurologist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cerebral atherosclerosis.
2.  Native coronary artery disease.
3.  Subclavian carotid and cerebral angiography unsuccessful.
4.  Attempted angioplasty and stent of the right internal
carotid artery requiring critical care observation overnight.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. twice per day.
 2.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. twice per day.
