Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Normal descending
aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Mildly thickened aortic
valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated at 4.0cm. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.6-1.8 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).


POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a wello
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is trace valvular aortic valve regurgitation. The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
HISTORY: Left upper extremity edema. Evaluate for DVT.

No priors are available.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**]
of the left
internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic veins
demonstrate
normal flow, compression, augmentation, and waveforms. The
cephalic vein is
not identified. Due to the swelling within the subcutaneous
tissues, the more
distal aspects of the brachial veins are difficult to evaluate.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
