History of Present Illness:
86 M with CABG, CHF EF 25% with BiV ICD/pacer, AFIB,
diet-controlled DM, R ear melanoma, here with confusion,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough for several hours. His son [**Name (NI) **]
noticed that his father sounded confused and disoriented on the
phone today, and he had been normal in mental status earlier
today and yesterday. He entered his father's house and his
father was looking up at the ceiling and his speech was making
no sense, so his son called an ambulance to take him to the
hospital. Abdominal pain was described as moderate, sharp and
dull, and in lower quadrants. Diarrhea characteristics/color
could not be described, but was little in volume and rare
frequency. Cough was productive with sputum of unknown color.

dizziness, no leg swelling. He has no sick contacts, no recent
travel, and is compliant with all medications and
salt-restricted diet. He is on home O2 2L nc, but has never been
diagnosed with a lung disease per patient. He used to smoke
cigars for 5 years, but quit decades ago, and he never smoked
cigarettes in his life.
.
In the ED, he had a fever to 104, WBC 17.6 with 0 bands, lactate
2.3, ABG 7.48/31/89. RIJ central line was placed, received 4L NS
with 1L out, received levo/flagyl. CXR showed RLL opacity, UA
was positive. CT head was negative, CT abd was negative for
acute process or bleed.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD s/p CABG in [**2089**]
2) CHF with last [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**11-29**] showed EF<20%
3) h/o Afib, now with AICD/pacer
4) BPH

VS: T  97.9  99/47 / 82 / 20 / 100% shovel mask
GEN: A&Ox3, speaks clearly, pleasant
HEENT: JVD difficult to assess for RIJ line, mild LAD, OP clear,
dry mm
LUNGS: Rales in L base, rales and cardiac wheezing in R base,
both [**11-28**] way up
HEART: RRR, 3/6 SEM radiating up, S3
ABD: Moderately distended, firm, ND throughout
EXTR: L inguinal hernia easily reduced, soft, no erythema or
edema. No c/c/edema, 2+ DP bilaterally.
NEURO: [**3-29**] motor throughout


Pertinent Results:
.
Radiology
[**12-24**] CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular cephalization consistent with
slightly worsened fluid overload as compared to yesterday.
Otherwise grossly unchanged appearance.
.
[**12-24**] CT Abd w/o contrast: No evidence of colitis or
diverticulitis (noncontrast). Bilateral dependent atelectasis
and additional possible infectious consolidation at the right
lung base. Gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, incompletely
assessed on this noncontrast study. Additional US could be
performed on a nonemergent basis. High atherosclerotic burden of
abdominal aorta and major tributaries.
.
[**12-22**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Extensive periventricular and deep white matter hypodensities
consistent
with chronic small vessel infarcts.
.
[**12-22**] CXR: Perihilar fullness and perivascular haze with
increased opacity in the right lower lung zone. Findings are
consistent with failure with possible focal consolidative
process in the right lower lung.
.
[**12-22**] [**Month/Year (2) **]: EF 30% LA mod dilated, RA markedly dilated, no ASD by
doppler. Mod symm LVH, mod global LV hypoK. No mass or thrombi,
no VSD. RV dilated w/ depressed systolic fx, mod dilated asc
aorta, no AV vegetations. Minimal AS, trace AR. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

AP supine and erect views of the abdomen show no distention of
bowel in the imaged areas. The lower pelvis is excluded from the
examination. There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification
extending from the iliacs into the pelvic arteries. Larger
calcific ring shadows in the left upper abdominal quadrant could
be a combination of colonic diverticula with residual barium or
smaller arterial aneurysms and calcified left renal mass as
evaluated on recent abdomen CT, [**2103-12-23**].
