Brief Hospital Course:
Her medical ICU course is summarized by briefly by problems:
1. resp failure - pt was treated with levofloxacin initially
(later changed to ceftriaxone/azithromycin [**2-3**] rash) for
community acquired pneumonia and high dose intravenous steroids
for asthma exacerbation.  Direct florescent antibody testing
showed infection with influenza A.  Pt's pulmonary status
improved and she was extubated on [**2140-1-12**].

2. GI bleeding - after transfer to ICU she was noted to have
bright red blood from NGT.  It did not clear with several
hundred mL of lavage and pt eventually became hypotensive
requiring pressors and several liters of fluids.  Emergent EGD
was performed on [**1-9**] showing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear with evidence
of blood in fundus.  Hemostasis was achieved after epinephrine
injection.  Serial hematocrit were stable during the remainder
of the ICU course.  Pt required 3 units of pRBC.

3. Hyperglycemia - shortly after initiation of high dose
steroids pt's blood sugars were elevated requiring insulin gtt.
Levels were well controlled following insulin drip and
eventually euglycemia was maintained after transition to sliding
scale insulin.

Pt was transferred to the medical floor on [**2140-1-13**] for
continued care.  Her medical issues as mentioned above were
resolved.  At the time of dictation she has good oxygen
saturation (95% 2L), Hct is stable (42), and her blood sugars
are in the 130's.  However, post extubation she exhibited
confusion and agitation consistent with delirium.  She has not
been communicative dispite Japanese interpreter.  Pt has
required tube feeds via dohoff secondary to delirium.  In
addition she has required soft restraints and anti-psychotics
for agitation.
