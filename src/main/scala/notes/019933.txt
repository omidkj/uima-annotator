Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 48 yo male with history of Type I DM,
hypertension, and ESRD s/p living unrelated transplant [**8-31**] who
presented to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital on [**2-7**] with DKA.  He was
initially found by his mother at his home nauseous, vomiting,
and unable to maintain adequate po intake.  On arrival to the
OSH his BS was 500's.  He was admitted to the ICU for treatment
of DKA on an insulin gtt as well as sepsis.  He received a dose
of vanc in the ED and was started on zosyn.
.
He was lethargic on presentation which worsened in the setting
of receiving his home pain and antianxiety medications, so on
[**2-8**] he was intubated for airway protection.  On [**2-8**] his pH
dropped to 6.9 and bicarb was 15 so he was started on a bicarb
gtt with improvement in his pH.  His hospital course was also
complicated by acute kidney injury with his most recent BUN/Cr
of 77/4.6 (baseline Cr 1.7-2.0).  Prograf level was noted to be
elevated.  Renal was consulted and he underwent a transplant
ultrasound which was normal.  He was briefly off the insulin gtt
on [**2-8**], however his sugars climbed back up and he was placed
back on the insulin gtt.  He was also noted to have a trop bump
to 0.28 with EKG showing no acute ischmic changes.  TTE was
performed which showed EF of 60-65%, but did show a focal wall
abnormality.  Cardiology was consulted who recommended treating
him emprically for CAD once DKA resolved.  He was tachycardic in
the 100's so he was started on IV lopressor.  Additionally he
has a leukocytosis to 19.6 and CXR showing a LLL PNA so he is
being treated for HAP with zosyn and vanc.  He was on PS 5/5
prior to transfer and his main barrier to extubation was mental
status (per report he gets agitated and does not follow commands
so hasn't been able to be extubated).
.
On arrival to the MICU he was intubated and sedated.  He no
longer had the insulin gtt running, but did have a bicarbonate
gtt.
.
Unable to obtain a ROS as the patient is intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 48 yoM with PMH ESRD s/p renal transplant
[**8-/2190**], IDDM, HCV, chronic pain, who was admitted to the ICU at
[**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from saints hospital for managment of
diabetic ketoacidosis.

# Diabetic ketoacidosis/Insulin dependent diabetes: Patient
initially presented to [**Hospital **] hospital with DKA after 1-2 days
of nausea and vomiting and inability to tolerate PO intake. At
saints hospital, he was treated with an insulin drip, and the
anion gap closed and he had been transitioned to basal and
parandial insulin at the time of transfer. Following transfer,
he re-developed hyperglycemia with anion gap and the insulin
drip was resumed until the anion gap closed. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted who assisted in management of insulin regimen while in
hospital. After transfer to the medical floor, patient reported
food and fluid restriction prior to admission with a targed
finger stick glucose of 70 (which had been set by the patient).
He was seen by nutrition and counseled on diabetic diet and
appropirate glucose targets. He was normalized on a
basal/prandial insulin regimen and discharged with close follow
up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was reluctant to return to the [**Last Name (un) 387**] as an
outpatient but agreed to take their phone number and make an
appointment if he changed his mind.
.
#  Acute kidney injury/ESRD s/p living related transplant:
Baseline Cr is 1.7-2.0.  Cr elevated at [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] Hospital with
creatinine here initially 4.3.  Patient was reportedly oliguric
at [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] Hospital, but making urine at the time of transfer.
FeNa was calculated at 2% suggesting prerenal etiology, he was
treated with intervenous fluids and creatinine returned to
baseline. US of renal transplant was unremarkable. The renal
transplant team consulted and felt his ARF may be due to a
combination of ATN from the DKA and PNA as well as tacrolimus
toxicity.  Tacrolimus level was high on admis
