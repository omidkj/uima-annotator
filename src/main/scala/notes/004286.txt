[**10-29**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - Normal esophagus. Stomach:
Multiple superficial non-bleeding ulcers were found in the
stomach body, fundus and antrum at various stages of healing.
Prior bicapped ulcer was seen in proximal body- no evidence of
active or recent bleeding. Visible vessel still noted in ulcer.
Additional visible vessel noted in fundus. Nonbleeding.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.

[**10-30**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - Normal mucosa in the
esophagus.  Normal mucosa in the duodenum.  Blood in the fundus.
Ulcer in the fundus. Visible vessel was seen in the fundus
without clear surrounding ulcer. A clot was adherent to the
vessel and there was stigmata of recent bleeding. Five clips
were placed with good hemostasis. No other sources of bleeding
were seen.

[**2111-11-2**] Colonoscopy - Ulceration, friability and erythema in the
terminal ileum (biopsy), Ulceration, friability and erythema in
the splenic flexure, at approximately 70 cm compatible with
colitis, possibly ischemic (biopsy), Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to cecum
Pathology: Terminal ileum: Active ileitis with ulceration and
granulation tissue; Cecum: Within normal limits; Transverse:
Ulceration with granulation tissue; No granulomas, viral
inclusions, or dysplasia seen.

Urinalysis [**10-29**] - small blood, 100 protein, moderate leukocytes;
0-2 red blood cells, >50 white blood cells, moderate bacteria,
[**4-13**] epithelial cells

Urine Culture [**10-29**] - >100,000 Klebsiella, sensitive to all
antibiotics tested

Brief Hospital Course:
*) GI bleeding - The patient was admitted to the intensive care
unit and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on hospital day
#1 that demonstrated multiple old ulcers, two visible vessels in
the stomach but no active bleeding.  No interventions were
performed.  After an episode of hematemesis on hospital day #2,
a second esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed that showed a
vessel in a fundal ulcer with stigmata of recent bleeding.  This
vessel was clipped x 5.  While in the emergency department and
ICU, the patient received a total of 8 units of packed red blood
cells (last on [**10-31**] - hospital day #3), subsequently, her
hematocrit was stable.  She was transfered out of the intensive
care unit to the floor on hospital day #3.  She underwent a
colonoscopy on hospital day #5 that demonstrated an area of
colitis supicious for ischemic colitis; pathology showed
nonspecific findings that, according to GI, were most consistent
with ischemia.  A vascular surgery consult recommended no
intervention at this time.  Throughout her admission, she was
maintained on Protonix 40mg 2x/day and sucralfate.

*) Urinary tract infection - the patient was given a 7 day
course of Ciprofloxacin for the positive urinalysis on
admission, urine culture grew Klebsiella sensitive to all
antibiotics tested, including Cipro.  Completed 5 days in the
hospital, will receive 2 final days as outpatient.

*) Hemodialysis - the patient received ultrafiltrate
hemodialysis while in the hospital.  Given her heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia, no heparin was used during dialysis.  Used
citrate for clotting.

*) H. Pylori - Given reported positive H. pylori assay from
outside hospital and incomplete course of clarithromycin and
amoxicillin from last admission (planned course 2 weeks, actual
course 8 or 9 days), the patient was again started on a planned
one week course of the same antibiotics.  She had one day in the
hosptial and is to receive the final 6 days as an outpatient.
