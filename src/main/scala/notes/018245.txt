Past Medical History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of chronic pancreatitis and pseudocyst
development.  He underwent a cyst jejunostomy with Roux-en-Y in
[**Country 4194**] in [**2177-2-24**] and was hospitalized following this for
acute on chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation.  He was
given TPN and supportive treatment while awaiting maturation of
the pseudocyst and
potential surgical intervention. During that admission a CT of
the abdomen/pelvis was reported to show a 16 x 8.6 x 16cm
multi-loculated cystic mass essentially replacing the entire
pancreas.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and

management.  It was determined that this lesion was inoperable
due to encasement of the blood vessels.  He underwent EUS and
had an FNA [**2177-9-11**], which demonstrated atypical cells,
concerning for a mucinous neoplasm.  He underwent ERCP on
[**2177-9-17**] which showed malignant cells consistent with
adenocarcinoma.  Tissue biopsy has not been feasable due to the
location/nature of the mass.
.
Other Past Medical History:
- [**2170**] - cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis and
subsequently developed a pseudocyst.
- [**2-/2177**] he was reported to have undergone cyst jejunostomy with

- Hypertension
- Splenectomy secondary to trauma, [**2146**]

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2177-11-2**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2177-11-2**] CT A/P: Large multiloculated known cystic neoplasm
centered within the expected region of the pancreas, with
replacement of the entire normal pancreatic parenchyma and
extension into all of the adjacent organs, that overall is
stable in both extent and size since examination from
[**2177-10-26**]. Associated biliary dilation and obstruction with
nonvisualization of the distal main portal vein, splenic vein
and SMV. No new cystic areas that would be concerning for new
abscess formation.
.
[**2177-11-3**] CXR: No evidence of acute process.
.
[**2177-11-4**] head MRI:
1. Sequelae of microvascular ischemia.
2. No evidence of intracranial lesions to suggest metastatic
disease.
.
[**2177-11-7**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
