History of Present Illness:
71 year old female with history of AF on coumadin, CHF with EF
35%, t2DM on insulin, CAD/PVD s/p multiple stenting and
interventions presents with 4 days of dark stools.  She has been
stooling about 3x/day for these past 4 days, accompanied by a
decrease in appetite and headaches.  1 day prior to admission,
she began to feel increasingly dizzy and weak, with the onset of
chills but no documented fevers.  She was unable to walk today
on her own and was instructed to be taken to the Emergency Room.
 She denies any recent weight loss, hematemesis, hematochezia,
bruising/mucosal bleeding, chest pain, or palpitations.  No
recent NSAID use.  She does endorse shortness of breath with
minimal activity, no different than her baseline.  She also
states that while someone comes to her house every week to check
her INR, no one had come this week and she missed her check
(confusion with not hearing the doorbell when VNA arrived).  She
was supposed to have it checked this Friday.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.0, 88/60, 57, 20 and 97% on
RA.  Labs notable for BUN 132, Cr 2.1, WBC 20.1 (N 86, 0 bands),
Hb 5.9 / Hct 19.0 (re-check 17), INR 4.1.  U/A large blood, mod
bact, trace leuks.  Patient was given 1 unit FFP, 2 units pRBCs,
vit K 10mg IM, and acetaminophen x1 for headache.  She was seen
by GI who recommended reversing the INR, PPI drip, and NG lavage
(which patient refused), and blood cx's.  She was sent to the
ICU with an 18g in R foot and 22g in R hand. No other available
peripheral access. Vitals on transfer: 97.1, 105/64, 72, 16 and
100% on 2L.

In the ICU, she is hemodynamically stable and is pleasant and
conversive, visiting with family.  She still has a headache, but
has not had a melenotic stool yet.

Pertinent Results:
EGD ([**2184-4-8**]): Erythema and erosion in the stomach body
compatible with gastritis. Diverticulum in the unlcear -
somewhere between the second and fourth part of the duodenum.
Just proximal to the diverticulum a large necrotic area was seen
on the side wall of the duodenum. The full extent could not be
visualized. There was fresh and old blood pooling throughout the
duodenum with no obvious source. With extensive washing this was
confined to the regiion between the second and fourth portions
of the duodenum. There were several large clots in this area
preventing full visualzation of the underlying mucosa. Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-4-10**] Final Report

INDICATION: Recent GDA embolization. Assess for duodenal wall
ischemia.
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging post-oral contrast medium was performed
from the
lung bases to pubic symphysis. Intravenous contrast was not
administered due to renal impairment.

FINDINGS: The majority of the oral contrast had passed through
the duodenum at the time of imaging. A 2.3 x 3.1 cm duodenal
diverticulum is present at the junction of D3 and D4 (series 2,
image 35). Oral contrast is retained within the diverticulum
with evidence of layering. No proximal obstruction is
identified. No intramural air is present and there is no
significant stranding around the duodenum. Embolization clips
are present in the gastroduodenal artery. .
Non-contrast imaging of the liver, spleen, pancreas are normal.
The
gallbladder appears distended and hyperdense. The increased
density is likely related to vicarious excretion of the contrast
from the embolization procedure. The renal cortex also appears
dense again likely related to delayed excretion of the contrast
from the embolization procedure. A 17-mm nodule is present in
the left adrenal gland with mean Hounsfield units of -100.
Features consistent with a myelolipoma. The right adrenal gland
is normal. Extensive colonic diverticulosis is present.
PELVIS: No small or large bowel obstruction. Diverticulosis as
noted above.
Review of the lung bases demonstrates right-sided linear
atelectasis with
pleural thickening. Minor pleural thickening is also present in
the left
base. Cardiomegaly is noted.
Bone review is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: There is a duodenal diverticulum at the junction of
D3 and D4.  The duodenal wall appears normal.
