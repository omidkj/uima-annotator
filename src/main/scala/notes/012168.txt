Admission Date:  [**2160-10-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-10-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2095-6-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
male with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who presented
after some chest discomfort on a flight from [**State 108**] on
[**2160-10-1**].  His pain spontaneously resolve; however, on
[**2160-10-13**], at approximately 8 p.m. he developed
chest tightness which was [**9-12**] radiating to the right arm.
He had diaphoresis at this time.  No shortness of breath.  He
was unable to sleep throughout the night secondary to this
tightness, and he took some Rolaids without relief.  At
approximately 5 a.m. the following morning, on [**2160-10-14**], he took Pepcid, also without relief.

He subsequently presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency
Department at approximately 9 a.m.  An electrocardiogram
there showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 111 with left
axis deviation minus 38, ST elevations in I, aVL, V2 through
V5, the reciprocal changes of ST depression in III and aVF
consistent with acute injury in anterolateral pattern.  He
was given nitroglycerin, Aggrastat, heparin, metoprolol,
aspirin, and sent via Med-Flight to the [**Hospital1 190**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications prior to admission
were)
1.  Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Diovan.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 80/12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Aspirin, nitroglycerin drip,
metoprolol, heparin drip, Aggrastat.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco use, ethanol use
or intravenous drug use.  He is married with four children
and nine grandchildren.  He lives independently.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother died of a myocardial infarction at
unclear age.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6, heart
rate of 110, blood pressure 111/79, respiratory rate of 24.
The patient was well-appearing, in no acute distress, alert.
HEENT examination was unremarkable.  He was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  His neck was supple.  His
carotids were 2+ without bruits.  It was difficult to assess
jugular venous distention at that time, possibly up to the
level of the jaw.  On cardiac examination he had a rapid rate
with a regular rhythm, a 1/6 systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border, and a notable S3.  His abdomen was
obese, soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds.  His
extremities at the time of admission to the Coronary Care
Unit revealed he had right groin sheaths in with an
intra-aortic balloon pump in place.  His pulses revealed
right dorsalis pedis was 2, posterior tibialis was 1.  Left
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis were 1 and palpable.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  At the time of admission the
patient had laboratories from the outside hospital.  His
first laboratories at the [**Hospital1 188**] were white blood cell count of 14, hematocrit 38.7,
platelets 279.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization
and further evaluation.

At the time of cardiac catheterization he was found to have a
codominant system with his left circumflex having no
significant disease, his right coronary artery which was
codominant with the left circumflex had mild disease with 20%
proximal middle and distal lesions.  His left anterior
descending artery had a total proximal occlusion which
received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a
stent was placed.  After nitroglycerin and diltiazem
treatment, TIMI-III flow was obtained.

At the time of catheterization, his left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure was noted to be 37, and pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 33.  His cardiac output was 4.3,
cardiac index of 1.9, systemic vascular resistance of 1504.

Given the nature of his infarct and pressures noted during
catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  He
was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further
management.


Post myocardial infarction, the patient's creatine kinase
peaked at 7746.  His balloon pump was weaned on [**2160-10-17**], and removed.  A cardiac echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 35% with a mildly dilated left atrium
and right atrium, and moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal, anterior and apical
akinesis and hypokinesis.  Due to the low ejection fraction
and apical akinesis, the decision was made to anticoagulate
the patient.  He was therefore started on Coumadin for
long-term anticoagulation.

The patient responded well to mild diuresis with intravenous
Lasix, as he was found to be significantly volume overloaded
after cardiac catheterization.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged to home on
[**2160-10-21**].

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He was to follow up with cardiologist,
Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) 3320**] on [**2160-10-22**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
 4.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
 5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.
 7.  Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 8.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 9.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. for 30 days.
10.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. to be adjusted appropriately
based on INR.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Myocardial infarction.
