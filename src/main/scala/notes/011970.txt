History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is an 84 year old former smoker with a history of
diabetes mellitus, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and CHF (EF 50-55%)
who was admitted on [**10-16**] with one month of increasing dyspnea,
lower extremity swelling, and increased abdominal girth. His
dyspnea was exertional and occurred with mild activity such as
walking across his kitchen. In addition, he reports a cough
productive of yellow brown mucus without hemopytysis. He saw his
PCP for these symptoms on [**10-10**] and at that time had his home
lasix increased to 160 [**Hospital1 **]. It was his cough and wheeze were
likely cardiogenic, with a possible concomitant upper
respiratory tract infection. With further questioning, he does
appear to have been non-compliant with a low-salt diet, with
recent soup intake.
.
His dyspnea was significantly worse the day of admission,
leading him to call EMS.
.
On review of systems, he reported orthopnea but denied any
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest or abdominal discomfort,
palpitations, weight gain, change in  medications. He denied
fevers, chills, sweats, or known sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] did have some
loose stools, without other GI symptoms such as nausea,
vomiting, hemetemesis or melena.

[**10-16**] TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Moderate CHF, worsened compared to prior study ([**2197-10-10**]).
Cardiomegaly.

[**10-16**] EKG
Ventricular pacing with probable underlying atrial
fibrillation. Compared to the prior tracing there is no
significant change

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Congestive heart failure, systolic, acute on chronic:
     The patient's vital signs in the field were: heart rate
120, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation 80% on RA improving to 92% on a non-rebreather mask.
EMS gave the patient lasix 80mg IV and 1 spray of nitroglycerin
with reported improvement. In the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, he
was initially normotensive at 117/65 but subsequently his blood
pressure decreased to 95/39, at which time he was a given a
500cc fluid bolus and sent to the MICU. His chest film showed
evidence of pulmonary edema. He was given Combinebs with
improvement in his wheezing. There was question of consolidation
on his chest film, so he also received levofloxacin 750mg.
     In the MICU, the patient received an additional dose of
lasix 20mg IV, with decreased blood pressure to mid80's
subsequently. He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis to relieve
respiratory distress; reportedly 5L were removed with
improvement in his respiratory status subsequently. He was able
to be weaned from non-rebreather to room air and then
transferred to the floor. On the floor, he noted a continued
cough but no longer felt dyspneic. He believed that his lower
extremity edema was improved. He will continue oral lasix. His
ACEI and digoxin were held in the setting of renal failure and
can be restarted as an outpatient by his outpatient providers.
His aldactone can be restarted at his next outpatient visit on
[**10-24**].
.
2. Pneumonia:
     The patient's chest film showed no clear infiltrate, but he
did have cough and leukocytosis. As he seemed to be clinically
improving in the setting of antibiotics, levofloxacin was
continued for a 7 day course. His last dose will be [**10-21**].
.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine was
elevated at 3.3 from his prior baseline. His fractional
excretion of urea was less than 35%, suggestive of a pre-renal
etiology of the kidney failure, likely due to poor perfusion in
the setting of CHF. His creatinine improved with diuresis,
consistent with this hypothesis and was 2.8 the day of
discharge. As his creatinine remained elevatated above his
baseline (Cr 2.3 [**5-22**]) he ACEI will continue to be held and can
be restarted as an outpatient.
.
4. Ascites: The patient had known cirrhosis, with etiology
thought to be due to cardiac in etiology or NASH. He underwent a
therapeutic paracentesis wi
