Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Right Superior MCA embolus -> L hemiparesis ([**2162-8-26**]);
Bladder Cancer, High-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, s/p
TURBT ([**2162-8-26**])

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-8-26**]: s/p Transurethral resection
[**2162-8-26**]: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Admission with intubation, central venous line
placement, arterial line placement
[**2162-9-7**]: G-tube placement by IR

History of Present Illness:
85 year old right-handed [**Month/Day/Year 595**]-speaking male history of
hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previous
hemorrhagic CVA (s/p craniotomy), and recent diagnosis of
bladder cancer. Was off anticoagulation (Coumadin) since ~
[**2162-8-6**] secondary to hematuria, wet macular degeneration and
scheduled surgery. Underwent transurethral resection of bladder
cancer for hematuria on [**2162-8-26**]. Per medical records the
patient's blood pressure was 210 systolic pre-operatively and he
received hydralazine, with a decrease in systolic blood
pressures to 150-160. Post-procedure his blood pressure
increased again to 200/95 and his EKG was concerning for
ventricular bigeminy. He was treated with esmolol 10 mg, 20 mg
and 30 mg IV respectively, followed by labetolol 10 mg IV and
lidocaine 100 mg IV with improvement in his blood pressure and
ventricular ectopy. He was also noticed to have increased
shortness of breath and oxygen requirement and had a CXR which
showed pulmonary edema. At 4:15 PM the patient was noted to have
left sided face/arm and leg weakness, right gaze deviation and
aphasia. He previously was following commands in English and per
his brother was conversant with him in [**Name (NI) 595**]. A code stroke
was called 4:39 PM. He underwent a STAT head CT which was
negative for hemorrhage. CTA was showed a likely superior
division MCA embolic stroke. His NIH Stroke Score was 23 upon
arrival of the stroke team. Given the patient's previous history
of hemorrhagic stroke, surgery that same day and hypertension he
was felt to not be a candidate for TPA. The neurosurgical
service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and determined that there was no
indication for intraarterial TPA or mechanical clot retrival.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and upon arrival there was
noted to be aphasic with right gaze preference and no motion of
his left lower extremity. He was moaning and moving his right
arm and leg. The patient was intubated for airway protection.

Transferred to floor care on [**9-1**].
