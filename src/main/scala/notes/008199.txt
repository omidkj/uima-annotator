Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**6-7**] for acute abdominal pain,
nausea and vomiting. A CT scan performed in the ED showed:
"Extensive pancreatitis with findings consistent with
hypoenhancement of  the head, uncinate and a portion of the body
of the pancreas. This is  concerning for necrotizing
pancreatitis. Adjacent extensive edema of the duodenum". Lipase:
1556.
The patient was admitted to the ICU.

Neurologic: pain was controlled with dilaudid PCA. On HD2 the
patient became very agitated and combative overnight (likely DT)
needing restraints. CIWA scale was started. He continued to
require significant amounts of benzodiazepines until HD7. A head
CT was obtained to r/o intracranial pathologic processes as a
cause for waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] responsiveness, which was negative.
His mental status kept improving throughout his hostpital stay.
By HD 14 he was able to be transferred to the floor.

Cardiovascular: HTN, controlled with metoprolol 20 mg Q4H,
clonidine patch 0.2mg and enalapril. Had 3 episodes of SVT which
resolved with adenosine and carotid massage. He remained stable
from the cardiovascular point of view for the rest of his
hospital stay.

Pulmonary: on HD3 the patient's O2 requirements increased and a
CXR showed small lung volumes and b/l pleural effusions which
remained unchanged on his f/u CXR on HD5. ABG showed mixed
respiratory/metabolic acidosis. His pulmonary function
subsequently improved and he was weaned off O2.

GI/Abdomen: the patient was made NPO with strict bowel rest. TPN
was started on HD4. The patient experienced diarrhea and stool
Cx were sent and came back negative for O/P and C.diff. A RUQ US
was performed on HD3 and was negative for cholecystitis.
CT scan on HD9 showed: "Interval new non-occlusive thrombus in
the main portal vein, and splenic vein". The patient was
therefore started on a heparin drip.

Nutrition: the patient was made NPO with strict bowel rest. Diet
was advanced when the patient's mental status cleared and his
abdominal pain subsided.

Renal: a foley was placed on HD1 to allow monitoring of urine
output. Required D5W boluses to maintain normonatremia. His
foley was d/c'd on HD12 and the patient was able to void.

Endocrine: Type II DM at baseline, was put on ISS [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
recs.

ID: developed bandemia and fever on HD6, BCx were sent,
meropenem was started. On HD8 vanc/cipro/zosyn were started for
HAP. His BCx were repeatedly negative.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient was discharged home with VNA for INR
and BG monitoring. A follow up appointment with his PCP was
scheduled for INR check and coumadin dosing. He will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks. The patient is currently beeing
followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for DM management. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
