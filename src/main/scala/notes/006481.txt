History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54 year old gentleman with HTN, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**], as well as systolic
and diastolic heart failure (EF had been as low as 20% but last
known to be 30%), who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] between
[**Date range (1) 24418**] for congestive heart failrue, [**Last Name (un) **], and venous catheter
induced bacteremia who came today for rash and weight gain.
During last admission, pt was found to have new inferior HK.
Workup was complicated by significantly worsening [**Last Name (un) **], and LHC
were deferred. He also finished two weeks course antibioitics
for IV catheter induced bacteremia with no evidence of
vegetation on [**Last Name (un) **]. He was aggressively diuresed, and discharged
home on torsemide and dobutamine gtt. Since coming home, pt was
noticed to have worsening pruritis and a new rash. The rash was
maculopapular and patchy, erythematous, pruritic with scratch
marks. Pt was started on prednisone 40 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg
q6h and keflex 500 q8h, without much improvement. Besides the
rash, pt complained of NYHA class III symptoms, feeling "extreme
fatigue" with DOE from minimal ambulation within the room,
positive orthopnea and PND. He also noticed a ~ 4 lbs weight
gain in the past week, although his weight is unchanged from
last discharge.
On interview this afternoon, pt denies SOB at rest, chest pain,
n/v/diarrhea. He denies any changes in his diet, and reports
compliance with his medications. His weight today is 211.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PERTINENT STUDIES
CXR (portable) [**12-7**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received
a
new PICC line.  The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.
 The course of the line is unremarkable.  There is no evidence
of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Otherwise, unchanged radiograph with borderline size of the
cardiac
silhouette, left pectoral pacemaker, and absence of acute lung
changes.

Chest US [**12-8**]
Complex fluid anterior to the ICD device which may represent a
hematoma;
however, an infection at this site cannot be excluded with
ultrasound.

ECHO (TTE) [**12-10**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-25%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Mildly dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis -
the basal inferior and inferolateral segments have relatively
better function. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may
better assess for valvular vegetations.

CT Chest [**2195-12-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate left lower lobe opacity with volume loss and
partial collapse of the left lower lobe bronchi, consistent with
lower lobe collapse(atelectasis).
2. Anterior component of atelectasis is slightly hyperdense,
likely
representing moderate amount of superimposed parenchymal lung
hemorrhage.
3. Moderate left intermediate density pleural effusion without
evidence of
hemothorax.
4. Mild pulmonary edema.
