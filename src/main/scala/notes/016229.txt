CXR ([**2184-8-13**])
Here is atelectasis at the lung bases. There is stable
cardiomegaly. There
is stable prominence of the right hilum, most likely combination
of pulmonary
artery and calcified right hilar lymph nodes. There are no focal
pulmonary
consolidations. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
.
CXR: ([**2184-8-14**])
CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is stable fat-containing incisional hernia
2. There is a stable small right adrenal adenoma.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis throughout the abdominopelvic
vasculature, which
cannot be further assessed due to lack of intravenous contras
.
CTA Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Appearance of the abdominal aorta is unchanged, with chronic
aortic
dissection which is unchanged from the prior study of [**2179**].
