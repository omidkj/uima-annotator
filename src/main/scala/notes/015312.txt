COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast [**2116-9-28**].
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Since the prior examination,
there has been interval development of bilateral lower lung lobe
air space consolidation primarily along the bronchovascular
bundles, most prominently at the right lower lung. There is
moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated
subsegmental atelectasis. The heart is normal in size. The liver
is unremarkable. There are no focal liver lesions or biliary
ductal dilatation identified. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
and adrenal glands are normal in appearance. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast normally. There is no
evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The stomach and
intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal in
appearance and caliber. There is no pathologically enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The visualized
aorta is normal in caliber.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Since the prior examination,
there has been interval improvement in the diffuse bowel wall
thickening throughout the colon. A segment of thickened bowel
remains which most likely is within the terminal ileum. However,
the bowel wall thickening within the large bowel has resolved.
There has been interval increase in the amount of intrapelvic
free fluid, although no focal fluid collections or abscess is
identified. A Foley is seen within an otherwise collapsed
bladder. The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. There is
diffuse subcutaneous fat stranding consistent with anasarca.
There is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval resolution in the degree of colonic and sigmoid
colon wall thickening has resolved, however a small segment of
what looks to be terminal ileum is now thickened. There is
interval increase in the amount of intrapelvic free fluid but no
focal fluid collections or abscesses.
2. Bilateral lower lung lobe pneumonia, right greater than left.
Moderate- sized bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2116-10-11**]
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2116-10-11**] at 11:53 and
is compared with a prior radiograph of [**2116-10-8**]. Cardiac size
remains unchanged. Mediastinal contour is also unremarkable.
Right-sided pulmonary infiltrates appear to have increased,
particularly in the right base. There also is an increase in the
left base with a left pleural effusion. Ill-defined infiltrate
is developing in the left upper lobe. The patient has been
extubated. A right-sided IJ line is in unchanged position.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent multifocal airspace disease, which appears more
widespread with extension to the left upper lobe. Left pleural
effusion increasing since prior examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
#TTP-HUS: Upon admission, the pt was diagnosed w/ TTP-HUS given
her thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia (with schitocytes), and
renal failure.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The hematology
and transfusion medicine services were consulted and started on
plasmapheresis ([**10-4**]).  She underwent a total of 8 sessions of
plasmapheresis (the last on [**2116-10-12**]) with good therapeutic
response.  Her platelet count returned to [**Location 213**] levels and
eventually her hematocrit stabilized as well, though she still
anemic (23.8) and with evidence of hemolysis on the day of
discharge (LDH 381 and haptoglobin 22).  The pt's renal failure
resolved with the therapy (peak creatinine 1.4 and discharge
creatinine 0.8).  She never had mental status changes during
hospitalization.  The etiology of the TTP-HUS was not determined
during her stay.  It may have resulted from E. coli
0157:H7-associated TTP (Shiga toxin was negative).  It could
have been due to Idiopathic-TTP, though ADAMTS13 activity was
only mildly depressed.  She identifies no precipitant foods,
specifically denies eating raw spinach, undercooked meat, or
drinking tonic (quinine) water.
.
#Respiratory Distress: on the second day of plasmapheresis the
pt developed respiratory distress, requiring intubation.  The
cause of her respiratory distress was thought to be due to
volume overload or acute lung injury from the plasmapheresis.
Imaging was consistent with both of these possible diagnoses.
As well, the pt began spiking temperatures with the
plasmapheresis therapy.  These fevers were thought to be the
result of transfusion reactions; however, because of her tenuous
state and chest imaging suggestive of pneumonia she was started
on a course of levofloxacin empirically (sub
