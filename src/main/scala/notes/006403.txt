Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
sob, hyponatremia

BiV pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old woman with recent onset atrial fibrillation on
coumadin (s/p unsuccessful cardioversion), hypertension/LVH,
type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6 on [**10-18**]), moderate aortic stenosis,
left bundle-branch block, prior tobacco use, diastolic and
systolic CHF s/p multiple admissions, hypothyroidism, and prior
traumatic brain injury ([**2157**])p/w worsening LE edema, increasing
DOE, and found to have new hyponatremia to 109 from 125 on
[**2181-6-1**].

Of note, she was recently discharged on [**2181-5-6**] with CHF
exacerbation/new afib/renal failure. TTE that admission showed
dilated LV with depressed EF and moderate-severe mitral
regurgitation, and PAP were mildly elevated (32-34 mmHg). This
was presumed due to her tachyarrythmia. The severity of aortic
stenosis could not adequately be assessed. She had a
cardioversion and was discharged in NSR, but appears to have
gone back into afib shortly thereafter. She is on amiodarone,
digoxin, and coumadin.
.
Her dry weight is 138 pounds, and patient reports gaining 12
pounds over the past two weeks. On [**2181-5-24**], she had been told to
hold her home lasix (20mg PO BID) because her weight was
decreasing and she was felt to be clinically dry with low BP's.
Then, because she was having increasing weight/edema/DOE, she
called her cardiologist who advised her to restart lasix 20mg
and hold home lisinopril. Patient was still complaining of sx
and advised to increase lasix to 40mg daily. She was also c/o
nausea, told OK to hold digoxin and coumadin, but to come in on
Monday AM for lab testing. Found to have sodium of 109 and
referred to ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.3, P 101, BP 115/78, R 20,
95% on RA and then 99% on 2L NC. Patient had two sets of labs to
confirm her new hyponatremia to 109. She also had a CXR that
showed mild CHF. No medications were given in the ED. Cardiology
and nephrology were consulted. Her hematocrit was noted to be
slightly lower, but guaiac was negative. Her INR is 3.9.
.
Upon speaking with the patient and her son, 5 days ago patient
had onset of fatigue, weakness, DOE, low UOP, which has been
progressing to the point where she only has the energy to sit up
and eat. She denies CP, denies angina. She does endorse
intermittent nausea, +vomiting on Saturday. Constipated x 2
days, but passing flatus, no abdominal pain. No blood in stool,
no black stools. Son also notes she has been increasingly
confused, with memory difficulty. She denies any new neurologic
deficits.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Imaging:
CXR:
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged. Mild prominence of the
central
pulmonary vasculature is noted as well as small bilateral
pleural effusions, consistent with mild CHF. Unchanged left
retrocardiac atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Unchanged
orthopedic intramedullary nail in the right
humerus.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild CHF.

Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %) with inferior akinesis, septal dyskinesis and
apical akinesis/dyskinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere (lateral
base moves best). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened.

There is an echogenic structure associated with the right cusp
(see clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) that is likely due to cusp thickening/deformation
or prominent Lambl's excrescence (generally an incidental
finding); cannot definitively exclude vegetation. This echogenic
structure was not seen in the prior study but the aortic valve
was not as well visualized in the prior study.

There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-5**],
left ventricular systolic function appears more depressed. The
septum is now dyskinetic. Right ventricular systolic function
appears slightly more depressed. Echogenic structure asosciated
with aortic valve as noted above.

MRI head & C-spine: No definite evidence for acute intracranial
pathology


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83788**] is a 72-year-old woman with recent onset atrial
fibrillation on coumadin (s/p unsuccessful cardioversion),
hypertension/LVH, type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6 on [**10-18**]), moderate

less than two weeks (though likely in last week based on
history). Likely hypervolemic in nature, given history and exam.
