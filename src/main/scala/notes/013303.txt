ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the prior hospital course,
dictated on [**2110-11-5**].  The patient was not
discharged on the 15th according to plan.  Instead, he was
transferred from the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit to
the surgical [**Hospital1 **] on [**2110-11-6**] to continue to evaluate the
patient for tachycardia.  He was started on Levofloxacin for
pneumonia on [**2110-11-6**].  He spiked a temperature to 101.4 on
[**2110-11-7**] and a chest x-ray at that time showed a stable left
lower lobe opacity with a worsening right lower lobe opacity.
Sputum cultures from that time were growing out Klebsiella
and Staph aureus.  The patient was started on Vancomycin on
[**2110-11-7**] in addition to his Levofloxacin. The patient again
spiked a fever on [**2110-11-9**] to a temperature of 101.0.  Repeat
sputum cultures were sent and repeat chest x-ray showed no
change.  He was continued on Levofloxacin and Vancomycin and
his white blood cell count at that time was 14.3.  On
[**2110-11-10**], the patient remained afebrile and his white blood
cell count came down but he had an episode of respiratory
distress from large amounts of secretions in his trache.  He
was transferred at that time from the surgical [**Hospital1 **] to the
neurologic step-down unit.  The patient had a repeat swallow
study on [**2110-11-12**], which he did not pass and so he was placed
on aspiration precautions and made n.p.o.

On [**2110-11-11**], the patient remained afebrile and his heart rate
and blood pressure were better controlled.  His trache tube
was changed on that same day.  On [**2110-11-13**], he remained
afebrile.  Vital signs were stable and white count was 13.4.
At this point, he was deemed stable enough to be transferred
to a high care long term facility.
