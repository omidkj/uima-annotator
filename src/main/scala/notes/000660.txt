Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 year old woman with a h/o CAD, CHF and AFib
presenting with bright red blood per rectum.  She was watching
TV on wednesday when she felt a strong urge to go to the
bathroom and passed bright red blood, followed by maroon stools.
 In the last several weeks, her INR had been low and she had
been instructed to take 5mg instead of 2.5 mg of coumadin
2/nights per week.  Her INR remained low, and since [**1-7**] she
had been taking the double dose 3 nights per week.  This
occurred 4 more times before she arrived at the OSH ED. She had
a similar episode one year ago when diverticulitis was noted on
colonoscopy.  She denies hematochezia, no dizziness, no
vomiting. She has had some slight abdominal pain that has been
intermittent and sharp in the lower quadrants. No fever or chest
pain. She denies constipation.
.
At the OSH her INR was corrected with 2U FFP and a colonoscopy
was performed [**2157-1-21**] which showed blood in entire colon with
diverticulosis, active bleeding from diverticular opening
treated with epinephrine and endoclip. She says she has not had
a bloody BM since prior to her colonoscopy. She says she
received 3U of blood as well.  When she was given FFP prior to
the colonoscopy she had a reaction, her entire face swelled up
and she had difficulty breathing. Her Hct fell after transfusion
and she was transferred here for further evaluation and
treatment of her unstable lower GI bleeding


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65 year old woman with history of CAD and Afib
on coumadin transferred for treatment of an unstable GI bleed in
the setting of an elevated INR to ~3.5.
.
-GI Bleeding.  The most likely source is recurrent bleeding from
the diverticuli visualized on colonoscopy at the outside
hospital.  Prior to transfer to our institution, her coumadin
had been stopped and she had been given Vitamin K and 2U FFP to
reverse her INR, however she continued to have active bleeding,
was given 3U PRBCs, and was transferred here for further
evaluation and possible surgical intervention.  After
stabilization in the MICU, she had no futher episodes of
bleeding, and following the transfusion of 2 additional units of
PRBC, her HCT was 29 and slowly trended upward to 33.5 over the
next 3 days.  Repeat colonoscopy revealed several diverticuli in
the distal colon/sigmoid region, consistent with the previous
report, but none were actively bleeding and no interventions
were undertaken.
.
- Atrial Fibrillation.  The patient remained in atrial
fibrillation during the admission with several episodes of rapid
ventricular response with heart rate elevations to the 140's.
Notably, this occurred while she was not receiving her
metoprolol because of concerns over possible hemodynamic issues
should her bleeding recur.  Once her hemodynamics proved stable,
her metoprolol was restarted and titrated upwards to 50mg PO TID
in order to control her heart rate.  Her coumadin was held
during the admission given the risk of recurrant bleeding.
However, she was restarted on her aspirin and plavix given her
multiple cardiac stents in place.
.
-CHF.  Diuresis was held during most of the admission over
hemodynamic concerns, however, she ultimately began to have
signs of volume overload including pedal edema, pulmonary
crackles, and dyspnea on exertion so her home regimen of
furosemide 120 PO QD was restarted.
