History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with CAD, CHF, COPD, DMII, presented to PCP's
office yesterday complaining of increased daytime somnolence,
DOE in past couple of days (although son states a month).  In
her PCP's office she was also noted to be feeling poorly with
dyspnea on exertion after walking several steps.  Her son also
reported that she has been getting salt putting it on her food.
Her dose of lasix was increased from 40mg to 60mg and a Chem7
was done which showed an elevated bicarb.  Her PCP referred her
to ED with concern for resp acidosis.  Patient difficult to get
a history from given bipap, although she is also a poor
historian per the son.  She denies chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, diarrhea.  In her PCP's office
she noted increased PND, orthopnea but I was unable to elicit
this history.  On previous admission in [**2136**], her pCO2 was noted
to be in the low 60's - unclear what baseline is, however, as
this was also an admission for COPD exacerbation.
.
ED: CXR without infiltrate or edema.  ABG was 7.29/76/151 and
7.31/73/59.  She was given a dose of steroids for concern of
COPD flare.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, 84 year old female with CAD, CHF, COPD, DMII, presented
to PCP's office 2d ago complaining of increased daytime
somnolence, DOE in past couple of days, though family reports
symptoms have been more longstanding. Because of DOE with a few
steps in PCP office and Chem7 was done which showed an elevated
bicarb, she was sent ED with concern for resp acidosis. Pt. was
admitted to ICU for BIPAP after gas showing acidosis of
7.29/76/151 in ED. In a previous admission in [**2136**] had pCO2 of
65 in the setting of COPD exacerbation, and elevated bicarb. has
been longstanding per OMR. CXR was clear on admission.
.
Pt. initially given IV steroids/azithro for COPD exacerbation in
ICU, but withdrawn as resp. acidosis at baseline. Pt. stable in
ICU, hydrated for ARF, and transferred to floor on [**8-18**] with
baseline respiratory function and mental status.  She continued
to be stable on the floor and was discahrged the next morning.

1.  Resp Acidosis - appears to be chronic given pCO2 of approx
70, pH 7.31 and bicarb elevated at 33.  Will check ABG after
trial of bipap.  Could also consider whether patient may benefit
from bipap at night.  Pt. to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
as outpt.
.
2.  ?COPD flare - initially given solumedrol iv q8, standing and
prn Albuterol/Atrovent Nebs, Azithromycin and bipap.  Patient
was not very wheezy on exam, and steroids/abx. were withdrawn
quickly as pt.'s respiratory status was determined to be
longstanding.
.
3.  CHF - Patient has a history of CHF, but does not appear
clinically volume overloaded on exam.  Suspect that increased
resp symptoms more likely COPD exacerbation.  BNP checked and
elevated at 1300.  Will resume increased lasix dose of 60mg po
qday as per PCP.
.
4.  CV: continued beta-blocker, afterload reduction with ACEI,
and lasix at 60mg dose.   cardiac enzymes were negative with no
EKG changes from prior.  Continue ASA.
.
5.  CRI - Creatinine 1.4 appears to be baseline. Avoid NSAIDs.
.
6.  Depression - Continued sertraline.
.
7.  Diabetes - Did not require insulin or oral hypoglycemics.
.
