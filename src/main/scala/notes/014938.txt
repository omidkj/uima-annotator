History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with history of advanced dementia (questioned
by family) and meningioma s/p radiation who presents
unresponsive since yesterday afternoon.  History obtained from
family.  She is minimally verbal at baseline, ambulatory without
a cane, able to eat and drink on her own.  For the last two
weeks she has been less active, with increased urine output, and
reduced interaction with her family.  Over the last week she
stopped ambulating and had reduced appetite/po intake.  Most
recently yesterday she had only one ensure in the morning.  In
the early afternoon she was so lethargic she was unable to sit
upright.  Her family believed her to be extremely fatigued and
put her to bed.  This morning she was still unarousable and she
was brought to the ED.
.
Pt is unresponsive, but family denies any recent fevers, rigors,
patient complaints, cough with sputum production, abdominal
pain, nausea, or change in BM.  Other ROS were unable to obtain.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.4 87 118/69 18 98% NRB on
arrival.  GCS was 9.  She did not open her eyes, respond to
pinch.  She responded only to pain from needlestick.  There was
inital concern for code stroke.  CT head was showed meningioma,
unchanged from prior with no new abnormality.   After laboratory
abnormalities were noted (glucose 695, Na 161, Cr 1.4) she was
given 10 units insulin regular and 1500cc NS.  At time of
transfer vital signs were HR 93  BP136/87  RR24  O2 sat 96%RA,
and she was moving her extremities and opening her eyes to her
name.
On the floor,  pt is responding to mildly noxious stimuli, opens
her eyes to voice.  She was breifly hypotensive to the high 80s
but responded to 1L NS bolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18915**] is an 84yo F with a history of olfactory groove
meningioma that presents with mental status changes in the
context of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient presented with a glucose of over
600 and profound mental status changes.  There were no ketones
in the urine concerning for DKA.  She has no established history
of diabetes, but has been maintained on high dose dexamethasone
to control her cerebral edema from the known meningioma, so she
is effectively diabetic.  She developed HONK in the setting of
steroid-induced hyperglycemia and likely restricted access to
water given her dementia. She was admitted to the ICU and was
aggressively rehydrated for hypernatremia, and was started on an
insulin drip with subsequent resolution of her hyperglycemia
within 24 hours.  She was transitioned to a subcutaneous
basal/bolus insulin regimen on HD 2 and was transferred to the
floor on HD3. No acute triggers for her hyperglycemia were
noted- her CXR, blood and urine cultures were negative on
admission.  Her glucose remained high on the floor, with QID FSG
running in the 200-350 range.  Her lantus was slowly uptitrated
with the hopes of transitioning her to a single injection daily.
 While tapering her steroids was initially considered, after
speaking to her neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], it was decided to
continue her decadron at her previous dose of 4mg [**Hospital1 **], as she
has significant cerebral edema related to the meningioma that
would likely worsen in the event of a taper and lead to further
neurologic deficit.
.
# Hypernatremia - Her corrected sodium 167 on admission.
Calculates to 7.9 L deficit.  This was likely secondary to lack
of po intake, dehydration, osmotic diuresis.  Patient was volume
resucitated, and that achieved better control of her sodium.  At
the time of discharge, her sodium was 141.
.
# Altered mental status:  The patient suffered from a likely
acute delirium on top of a chronic dementia.  Her acute
unresponsiveness was related to her hyperosmolar state, which
recovered with appropriate treatment.  She does have baseline
dementia, which after speaking to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and [**Location (un) 1131**] OMR
notes, was thought to be related to XRT therapy for her
meningioma.  She experienced a very rapid decline in function
since [**Month (only) 404**], becoming increasingly reliant on her children for
her ADLs and IADLs. She was at her baseline mental status at the
time of discharge- oriented to person, but not place or time.
.
#. Goals of care: Patient was receiving hospice care at home at
the time of admission, however, she remained a full code
throughout the hospitalization which was confirmed with her HCP.
A family meeting was set up to discuss these discrepancies,
though it was canceled by the family due to scheduling
conflicts. The primary team was unsure as to what her overall
prognosis is, so the patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] as an
outpatient to further discuss the treatment plan.
.
#. Elevated liver enzyme tests:  She had an uptrending
transaminases, LDH, and AP.  She remained
