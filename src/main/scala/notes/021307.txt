History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 y/o female with PMH significant for HCV/ESLD, h/o

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI hemorrhage- The
patient was admitted for melena, likely secondary to an upper GI
bleed. She received a total of 2 U PRBCs upon admission with
Lasix following the transfusion. She was started on Protonix IV
bid on admission. An abdominal u/s in the ED demonstrated a
patent TIPS. Her hematocrit remained stable overnight and she
was planned for endoscopy the following morning. She was quite
encephalopathic upon admission and refused to take any of her
medications, including lactulose and rifaximin.  Due to the
encephalopathy and mental status, the patient was electively
intubated prior to the EGD on [**2167-12-19**], without any
complications. An EGD on [**2167-12-19**] showed portal gastropathy only
without any evidence of active bleeding. There was no evidence
of varices. She was extubated successfully the following day on
[**2167-12-20**] and her respiratory status has been stable since on room
air.  Since her EGD she was without further episodes of BRBPR or
melena.  Her HCT was slowly downward trending and on [**2167-12-25**]
she received one additional unit 1u PRBC with an appropriate HCT
increase to 28.9.  Haptoglobin was also checked and found to be
<20, consistent with either slight hemolysis or could be
attributed to underlying liver disease.  Otherwise, most likely
has subacute bleeding as a chronic issue secondary to
gastropathy or hemorrhoids.  Upon discharge, was sent to an
extended care facility with instruction to transfuse for any HCT
less than 25, and to check a CBC every other day.

# HCV Cirrhosis with AMS - Known to have h/o hepatic
encephalopathy, was not tolerating lactulose/rifaximin so NGT
was placed.  Given lactulose with improvement.  She later
self-discontinued the NGT and subsequently tolerated oral
medications.  She was continued on rifaximin & lactulose and her
mental status returned to baseline.  Was also restarted on low
dose Lasix and Aldactone, which she tolerated well prior to
discharge.

# Hypernatrema - Thought to be [**2-13**] decreased oral intake and
dehydration.  Initially she was corrected with free water
boluses with her tube feeds.  After removal of the NGT, she was
given IV D5W for correction given that she was unable to take in
enough oral hydration to correct it herself.  Over several days,
she was slowly corrected and the day of discharge had a sodium
level of 140.  Upon discharge, instructions were given to her
extended care facility for monitoring or her sodium levels, as
well as instructions for correction based on the current level.

# Acute renal failure with Chronic Renal Insufficiency -
Creatinine at recent baseline (1.7-2.0), and admitted with
creatinine 1.9.  Unclear etiology, but originally thought to be
likely secondary to end stage liver disease.  Increased BUN may
be secondary to GI Bleed.  Also may be elevated from baseline
given free water deficit.  Later improved to baseline after
treatment of free water deficits.  Upon discharge, his
creatinine was 1.3.  Extended care facility given instruction to
monitor creatinine and dose diuretics appropriately.

# COPD - Admitted at baseline without evidence of acute flair,
and clear pulmonary exam.  Was intubated due to AMS, but was
later successfully extubated, as described above.  The morning
of [**12-23**], had acute onset wheezing, thought to be most likely
due to volume overload in the setting of increased free water
rather than acute flair.  Was treated with IV Lasix and
albuterol nebulizers with symptomatic improvement.  Once fluid
repletion was done more gently and home diuretics were
restarted, she had no further episodes of dyspnea.
