HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman who
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2110-4-28**] complaining of some discomfort suprapubic, nausea
and vomiting.  She had a 1??????-week recent history of dysuria,
pain and burning when she urinated, suprapubic pain, and had
been in contact with her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had
been seen in an outside hospital emergency room on [**2110-4-21**]
and received antibiotics but she did not take these and the
subsequently saw her primary care physician two days later,
and was prescribed Cipro but she didn't take that because of
some reported allergy.  The follow-up results of those urine
cultures actually was negative.  On [**4-25**] she was seen also
in an emergency room for bladder pain, and then a urinary
tract infection was seen at that time on her urinalysis.
Keflex was started, which again she didn't take.  She did get
some Pyridium as well and that actually improved some of her
symptoms, and then she subsequently developed nausea and
vomiting.  She was noted to have slightly altered thinking
and ended up coming into the Emergency Department but refused
tests and IV.  In addition to this she had a remote history
of bipolar disorder and was deemed in the emergency room as
incompetent to leave and was hospitalized therefore.

On further review of systems it turns out she had a 30-pound
weight loss in the last six months from poor appetite,
chronic constipation requiring frequent Fleet enemas, and
multiple trips to the primary care physician but refused [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
colonoscopy which was recommended.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Bipolar disorder.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3. Chronic pelvic pain.  4. Femur
fracture.  5. High blood pressure.  6. Urinary tract
infections.  7. Chronic bladder pain.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Lipitor.  2. Lopressor.  She
was not on lithium prior to her admission and per the family
she evidently had stopped taking it on her own.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No previous abdominal surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She did not have any tobacco history,
although she did have one drink per day of alcohol until
about two months prior to her admission.  She lives with a
male partner with a history of verbal abuse .

ALLERGIES:  Levofloxacin gives a rash, question of chest
pain; ampicillin gives a rash; Bactrim gives a rash.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted and placed on a 1:1 sitter
for safety, was n.p.o. on intravenous fluids.  She initially
refused work-up, including abdominal imaging and was seen by the
psychiatry staff.  She subsequently developed lower abdominal
pain and a
surgical consultation was obtained.  A nasogastric tube was
placed and approximately two liters of dark brown fluid was
drained.  A Foley catheter was placed as well and left lower
lobe pneumonia was diagnosed.  She was started on ceftriaxone
on the third hospital day.

A subsequent CT scan showed a small bowel obstruction with a
right inguinal hernia without bowel wall thickening, free fluid
or
air, and the hernia seemed to be the cause of the
obstruction.  The patient was brought to the operating room
with the findings actually of a right femoral hernia.
Perioperative she had to be reintubated in the operating room
for precipitous drop in her saturations.  The operation was
on [**2110-5-1**].  They did not find any evidence of a bowel
ischemia or infarction, however the right femoral hernia was
incarcerated and the cause of the small bowel obstruction.
Thus she had undergone an exploratory laparotomy, a small
bowel resection, and a femoral hernia repair.

Postoperatively she was followed by the psychiatry team and
by the primary care team.  Initially she had a Swan-Ganz
catheter and eventually that was changed over to a
triple-lumen catheter.

Her postoperative course was significant for difficulty
weaning off of the ventilator and her antibiotics had been
broadened in the setting of her operation to ceftazidime,
Flagyl, as well as fluconazole.  Cultures from sputum were
the only positive growth and that was yeast, Enterobacter and
Klebsiella.  All of these bacteria were sensitive to the
antibiotics that were used.  Her antibiotics were changed
several times during her postoperative course.  Meropenem and
gentamicin were the subsequent antibiotic regimen that she
underwent and she received a full 14-day course of these.
Also, her perioperative course and postoperative course
involved multiple bronchoscopies with lavage and pulmonary
toilet and multiple cultures being sent.  This was for
ongoing fevers, difficulty weaning from the vent and
essentially a worsening picture on her multiple x-rays,
worsening pneumonia in the left middle and lower lung zones,
and bilateral patchy opacities.

The infectious disease team was consulted because no
significant improvement was made in her lungs based on their
x-ray appearance and based on her ventilator dependence,
despite being on excellent antibiotic coverage for the
bacteria that was grown.  They recommended a tissue biopsy
from the thoracic surgeons.  Thoracic surgery was called and
the patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
procedure on [**2110-5-22**], which subsequently grew out no
bacteria.  Antibiotics were stopped and she did have an
approximately 14-day course or maybe slightly longer, and she
continued to intermittently have a difficult time weaning off
the ventilator.  Some of this was believed to be an anxiety
component and eventually she did tolerate a tracheostomy
collar.  A tracheostomy was placed after it was clear that
she was unable to wean off the vent, and discussions were
held with the family for improved pulmonary toilet and for
pulmonary rehabilitation.  A tracheostomy would be the best
avenue, and she had that placed percutaneously at the bedside
in the intensive care unit.  Eventually the patient was
transferred to the medical intensive care unit.  A chest CT
and VATS revealed no evidence of neoplastic disease, which
was a concern given the lack of improvement in the x-rays.
The patient eventually had a speech follow up with a
Passy-Muir valve which was successful and she was able to
speak.  She had a postpyloric tube placed by interventional
radiology and tolerating tube feeds at goal, which was 70 an
hour with the aim to gradually wean off tube feeds as she can
eat and be off the ventilator obviously.

The patient has ongoing requirements for excellent pulmonary
toilet, chest physical therapy encouragement, has been out of
bed multiple times and will thusly need physical therapy
however.  The medical intensive care unit team is following
her currently and the patient will be going to a
rehabilitation center.  On [**2110-5-28**] her tracheostomy was
changed to a #6 Shiley cuffless tracheostomy because she was
having some intermittent obstructive type symptoms with the
previous tracheostomy, and since then she had had no
problems.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Ativan 0.5 to 2 mg p.o. IV q. [**2-23**] p.r.n.

4. Dilaudid 0.5 IV q. 3-4 hours p.r.n.
5. Colace 100 p.o. q.d. p.r.n. per her feeding tube.
6. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. through her tube or with valve
in place swallowing.  This will be held for heart rate less
than 55 and systolic blood pressure of less than 100.
7. Pepcid 20 mg through her feeding tube b.i.d.
8. Dulcolax suppository q. day p.r.n.
9. Erythropoietin 20,000 units subcutaneous once weekly.

FOLLOW UP:  She will have outpatient follow up with her
primary care physician and also with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks
from discharge.
