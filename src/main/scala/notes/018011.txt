History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 y/o M with PMHx significant for spinal
stenosis with multiple discectomies ~4yrs ago c/b wound
infection, Afib on coumadin, CHF EF 25-30%, HTN, who presents
from rehab and transfered from OSH for neck pain, R sided
weakness, and concern for osteomyelitis. Pt states that he has
had increasing neck pain for the last 1-2d, with increased
weakness in his right arm and leg. He states that he is able to
walk several steps at a time at baseline, but that he has been
unable to walk at all. His outside hospital CT was concerning
for osteomyelitis.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's VS were 98.4 84 96/70 16 98%
RA. Exam was significant for inability to lift right arm above
30' as well as weakness with right hip and knee flexion. OSH CT
was reread by [**Hospital1 18**] radiology, who noted destructive process
centered at the C6-C7 intervertebral disc space, concerning for
disciitis / osteomyelitis. MRI was ordered for further
evaluation. The patient was seen by ortho spine, who recommended
admission to medicine with plans for possible OR early next
week. VS prior to transfer were 97.7 97 18 117/94 96 with 4L NC.

.
Currently, the patient reports [**7-17**] pain in his neck, radiating
into the bilateral arms. He endorses 2 days of worsening neck
pain and weakness on the right side. He also reports occasional
blurred vision. He endorses nausea and vomiting earlier today.
He also endorses urinary incontinence, which is long-standing
but has been slightly worse recently. He also endorses having a
cough recently. Denies fevers or chills.

PATHOLOGY:
C6 Vertebral body [**2201-1-25**]:
1.  Bone, C6 vertebral body, excision (A): Fragments of viable
and non-viable bone and cartilage.
Granulation tissue.  No definitive evidence of osteomyelitis.
2.  Intervertebral disc, cervical, excision (B): Fibrocartilage
with degenerative change. See note.
Fragments of viable and non-viable bone and cartilage.
Note: In part 2, there is a detached cluster of neoplastic
cells, favored to be neoplastic epithelial cells, present.  As
this cluster of cells is present on another level, it is present
in the tissue block.  Given the apparent lack of a history of
neoplasia, as well as the appearance of this cluster of cells on
the slide, it is favored to be a contaminant from another case.
(Discussed with Pathology and felt to be a contaminant from
another sample).

IMAGING:
