Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **]/MICU/SICU.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19388**] is an 81-year-old
man recently discharged from [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2113-9-6**] after a 27 days hospitalization.  Recent
hospitalization was for a mitral valve replacement and a
tricuspid valve repair, which resulted in a prolonged
and PEG tube placement.  Additionally, during that
hospitalization, he developed a right sided loculated
effusion for which he underwent a videoscopic thorascopy for
removal.  Of note, he was sent out on a course of Vancomycin
for MRSA positive sputum culture on [**2113-8-22**].
Since the discharge from [**Hospital1 69**]
four days ago, Mr. [**Known lastname 19388**] has had ongoing respiratory
complained of shortness of breath with purulent sputum.  He
was cultured.  On [**2113-9-9**], he developed leukocytosis to 14.
Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin were added empirically for
gram-negative coverage after a culture grew gram-negative
rods.  On [**9-10**], the day of admission, he had
increasing vent requirements.  ABG at that time revealed
7.25, 71, and 75 on 70% FIO2.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.  In
the emergency department, he was noted to have a cuff leak,
which was subsequently repaired.  Additionally, he was
bronchoscoped by CT surgery revealed only mural secretions.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history revealed the
following:  Father died of a myocardial infarction at the age
of 59.  Mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior to the CT surgery, he lived alone in
[**Location (un) **], NH.  The patient has positive tobacco use four
packs per day for 37 years.  He quit 35 years ago.  Alcohol
use about ten beers per month.  He denies any other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  Pulse 85, blood pressure 135/86, oxygen
saturation 97%, temperature 99.1.  On the vent he was in a
pressure-support mode with pressure support of 8, PEEP of 5,
and FIO2 of 50%.  GENERAL:  The tracheostomy was in place.
He was alert.  He nodes to answers questions.  HEENT:
Unremarkable.  LUNGS:  Coarse breath sounds throughout, left
greater than right.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular,
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  G-tube was
in place.  Colostomy bag was in place.  Urostomy bag was in
place.  BACK:  No CVA tenderness.  EXTREMITIES:  Lower
extremity had 1+ edema.  SKIN:  2 cm elliptical purpuric
lesion in the left cheek; venous stasis changes lower
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission were significant for a
white count of 13.1, hematocrit 29.5, platelet count 244,000,
INR 3.3, BUN 45, creatinine 0.8.  Gas shortly after admission
revealed the pH of 7.45, pCO2 44, pO2 of 74.  Chest x-ray
revealed bilateral lower lobe opacities, greater on the right
than the left, which had been increased compared to the prior
study.  The patient was status post thoracotomy, bilateral
pleural effusions, greater on the right than on the left.
There was cardiomegaly with mild edema.  CT of the chest was
done in the ED, which revealed large right lung
consolidation, bilateral fluid collections, left greater than
right.  Fluid collection has enhancing walls and empyema
could not be excluded.  Compared to the prior study, the
consolidation on the right is more extensive, but the fluid
collection had decreased in size, although remains loculated.
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation at 73, normal axis, QRS, 0.125 with
borderline left bundle branch block.  ST depressions in V5
and V6.  No Q waves, no changes from old.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU given
that he was on the vent.

PULMONARY:  The patient's pulmonary status was believed to be
complicated that he had infiltrates on chest x-ray and CT, as
well as pleural effusions.  It was concerning that he had had
a VATS and drain of loculated effusion approximately a week
prior to admission, however, this seemed to have
reaccumulated on the right and additionally he developed a
new effusion on the left.

Our differential at the time of admission included that this
was due to pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or post
pericardotomy changes.

The rehabilitation facility from which he came was called and
results were obtained for sputum culture.  He had grown
Serratia, which was sensitive to Levaquin.  Because of this,
the Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone were discontinued.  He was
maintained on only Levaquin.  At the time of discharge, he is
on the sixth day of Levaquin and he needs to continue a
two-week course.

Additionally, because he was fluid overloaded on examination,
there was concern he was in congestive heart failure.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed
normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

The patient was started on Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and
Lasix 60 mg b.i.d. with the goal of this therapy was to
offload fluid from him since he was clearly fluid overloaded
on examination.

Cardiology consultation was obtained to ask if the patient
might have a post cardiotomy syndrome or be in CHF.
Cardiology team could give no definitive answer, but
recommended diuresing the patient to see if the pulmonary
status did not improve.

The long-term plan for the patient is as follows:  He will
receive two weeks of treatment with Levaquin for presumed
pneumonia.  Although there is some speculation that the
positive sputum culture was merely a colonizer.
Additionally, he will be put on Lasix for the next two weeks
with the goal of diuresing at 500 cc to a liter a day.  Two
weeks from now he will have a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], or any other pulmonologist who is available to
see him in two weeks.  At that appointment, he will be
reassessed.  If his pulmonary status is not improved with
treatment for pneumonia and diuresis for fluid overload,
consideration will then be given for performing a diagnostic
thoracentesis or possibly giving a trial of Prednisone for
post cardiotomy syndrome.

The decision was made not to do diagnostic thoracentesis on
him in house, because the INR was therapeutic and if were to
stop his Coumadin, he would have to be put on Lepirudin
rather than heparin since he has a history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.  The thinking was that before anything such
as this would be done, he deserved a trial of antibiotics and
diuresis.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was maintained on a therapeutic
level of Coumadin.  He is being discharged on three a day and
the INR on the day of discharge is 2.2.  Additionally, the
Digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg q.d. to 1.25 mg q.d.
because the heart rate was in the low 40s.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As mentioned above, continued
Levofloxaci
