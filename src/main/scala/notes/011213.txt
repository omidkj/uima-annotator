Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2104-9-4**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] is a 74 year old male smoker with history of HTN,
COPD, questionable left kidney mass s/p left partial nephrectomy
for questionable renal cell ca., diverticulosis, chronic
polyposis, hiatal hernia repair, enlarged prostate with recently
elevated PSA, CHF, mitral regurg., mental retardation, legally
blind, who presented on [**9-1**] with hematemesis.  The history is
limited secondary to patient's mental retardation, however as
per group home, patient was in his USOH until the a.m. of
admission when he was noted to have several episodes of emesis
with bright red blood.  It is unclear, however, whether the
patient had hemoptysis and then emesis, or just hematemesis.  He
was simply found s/p bloody emesis.

Per caretaker, the patient is without previous history of GI
bleed.  No fevers/chills, abdominal pain.  Denies change in
bowel or bladder habbits.  He does describe mild URI symptoms
over the week prior to admission.

During the month prior to admission he had been hospitalized
twice at [**Hospital6 **] for pneumonia, suspected
aspiration but not conclusively documented.  Swallow study at
[**Hospital1 18**] last week suggested possible microaspiration.

Briefly:  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
hemodynamically stable, with hct of 38, INR 1, but continued
hematemesis.  He was sent to the ICU for workup of UGIB.  An NG
lavage had coffee grounds, not cleared with 750 cc NS.  A CXR on
admission appeared to suggest a L hilar mass, but it was a poor
film.  The patient was transferred to the floors for further
workup as he remained hemodynamically stable with stable
hematocrit.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with
ST-T wave abnormalities. Right axis deviation - consider left
posterior
fascicular block or possible biventricular hypertrophy. Clinical
correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR [**9-1**]: 1.  Question of mass in the left hilum.  Recommend PA
and lateral chest radiograph to further evaluation.  2.  Large
hiatal hernia.

CXR [**9-2**]: Evidence of fairly marked background emphysema.  No
evidence of cardiac failure.  No focal pulmonary lesion, i.e.,
no evidence of a carcinoma. The NG line tip is in the upper
portion of the stomach and should be advanced.

CT thorax [**9-3**]: Multiple moderately enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes, several prominent R hilar lymph nodes.  Subcarinal lymph
node.  Images limited secondary to motion artifact.  Partially
calcified irregular density in R apex with architectural
distortion.  Several <5mm pulmonary nodules.  1 calcified
granuloma in minor fissure.  Moderate emphysematous changes.
Patchy ground glass opacities b/l, no consolidation.  Small b/l
pleural effusion and enlarged heart c/w CHF.  No masses in L
hilum.  Oseous structures unremarkable.  Active TB vs.
malignancy.  Recommend 3 month interval chest CT.  Large hiatal
hernia with dilatation of esophagous and thickening of lower
esophageal wall.

EGD: Findings:
Esophagus:
 Lumen: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the
Z-line to 35cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 32cm
from the incisors.
 Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding 3 x 1 cm ulcer was
found in the distal lower third of the esophagus. There was no
stigmata of recent bleeding. Cytology samples were obtained for
histology using a brush. Cold forceps biopsies were performed
for histology at the lower third of the esophagus.

Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding erosions were noted in the
antrum. A single non-bleeding 1cm ulcer was found in the stomach
body.
 Other  Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at
the stomach antrum and stomach body.

Duodenum: Normal duodenum

Impressions: Ulcer in the distal lower third of esophagus
(cytology, biopsy)
Ulcer in the stomach body
Erosions in the antrum (biopsy)
Medium-sized hiatal hernia

Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg twice daily
Advance diet as tolerated.
Follow-up cytology results and treat for candidiasis with
fluconazole if positive.
Follow-up biopsy results
If positive for H pylori, treat with triple regimen

Additional notes: Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] should have repeat upper endoscopy
in [**1-1**] months to document healing of esophageal ulcer and repeat
biopsy to rule out Barrett's esophagus. The attending was
present for the entire procedure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] is a 74 year old male with history of renal cell
ca., possible prostate ca with enlarged prostate, elevated PSA,
history of hiatal hernia repair, who presents with hemoptysis as
well as hematemesis, and a question of a hilar mass.

1) Hematemesis:  Pt underwent EGD which revealed ulcerations and
erosions in the esophagus and stomach which were subsequently
biopsied (results pending at this time of dictation).  He was
started on Protonix 40mg PO BID as well as sucralfate QID and
will have his biopsies followed up by his PCP for potential [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
pylori treatment.  Pt has been tolerating oral feedings without
incident and his HCT was stable throughout his hospital course.

2) CAD: Unclear history.  EKG on admission with ST depressions,
but cardiac enzymes were negative.  His ASA will be held on
discharge and will be restarted per discretion of his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
resumed his other anti-hypertensive medications without
incident.

3) Latent tuberculosis: Chest CT performed on [**2104-9-3**] revealed
an irregular, partially calcified granuloma as well as 5mm
granulomas.  A pulmonary consult was obtained and it was
recommended to follow these granulomas with serial CT scans,
recommended next CT to be in approximately 6-8 weeks.
