Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF:  This admission was felt to be consistent with the
patient's prior admissions for pulmonary edema, with a CXR on
admission c/w frank congestive heart failure.  She was diuresed
while still in the ED, and while she was in the CCU.  The
evening of admission, she was 1-2 liters negative, with
acceptable ABG's on pressure support, and so was extubated.  She
was slightly hypotensive after that (systolics in the 80s) and
was placed on dopamine for a day (the hypotension was felt to be
secondary to aggressive diuresis.)  Once the dopamine was
discontinued, her regular medications were slowly restarted.
She was placed back on her lisinopril and restarted on her
carvedilol.  She was continued with Lasix prn for a goal 500 to
1000 cc negative per day (she usually responded to lasix 40 mg
IV).  The evening of [**2132-3-27**], she became acutely short of
breath, tachypneic to 34 and with O2 sat 92% on room air
(earlier in the day had been 98% on room air).  She was wheezing
on exam, CXR c/w pulm edema, and was given an ipratropium neb
and Lasix 40 IV.  She responded well to this.  Because of her
severe mitral regurgitation, she was also begun on a nitrate,
Imdur 30 mg po qd, which should be given at night because her
ACE should be given in the morning.  She tolerated the addition
of these medications well.  She was also changed to twice daily
dosing of her Lasix (as it seemed that her shortness of breath
episodes have been occurring at night.)

2. CAD:  Her troponin was mildly elevated on admission, but was
not as high as it has been in the past, and she had no worrisome
EKG changes.  She has refused CABG in the past.  It was not felt
that her episodes of pulmonary edema are related to ischemia.

3. Pneumonia:  She was febrile to 101 the evening of [**3-27**], and
was pan-cultured.  Her UA was negative.  Her CXR showed a
retrocardiac opacity, and she was begun on Levaquin for a 7 day
course (renally dosed at 250 mg daily).

4. Renal:  Her creatinine was elevated to 1.8 on admission, and
had come down to 1.1 by discharge (baseline mid 1's.)

5. Heme:  Her platelets were very high at over 1,000 on
admission, and came down to the 600s by discharge, which is
around her baseline.  Her hematocrit was 37 on admission and
dropped 9 points that day, which is what has happened for her
last 3 admissions.  It is unclear why, as her hematocrit should
go up with diuresis.  She received 2 units of PRBCs throughout
her stay, and her hematocrit was stable at 31 by discharge.  Her
baseline is in the high 20s to low 30s per our records.

6. Code status: On her prior admissions here, the patient seems
to have indicated that she wanted to be a DNR/DNI, and there was
some confusion about this because it was reversed while she was
at the nursing home.  Her son [**Name (NI) 9464**] was very clear that she is
a full code, and once she was extubated we discussed this with
her.  She feels that she wants to be intubated if it is for a
short period of time (such as this current episode), but would
not want to be intubated for an extended period of time.  She
realizes that with her significant CHF and MR, these episodes
will become more frequent, and that she will likely come to a
point where she doesn't want to be intubated again, if even for
a short time.  However, she currently states that she wants to
be a full code, as she has a good quality of life at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab and is not ready to be a DNR/DNI.  This was confirmed with
her son.
