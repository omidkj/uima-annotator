Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
69F with DM, CAD, PVD, HTN, multiple MIs (most recently [**8-/2198**]),
and AF recently hospitalized for treatment of bilateral heel
ulcers, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal pain, guaaic
positive stool and hypotension SBP 80s. Per notes, pt was in
USOH at [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab when noted to have decreased UOP last
3 days (<120ml last 24 hours). She had episode of CP 4-5 days
ago for which CXR was obtained which revealed mild pulmonary
edema. This was being treated with lasix IV with uptrending Cr
2.3->2.7. NGT also placed for TFs approx 4 days ago for
decreased PO intake (albumin 1.7) and she was subsequently noted
to have N/V/D x 3 days. She was also transfused 2 units [**9-21**] for
HCT 25 and started on fluconazole for funguria. Today, she was
noted to have guaiac positive stool so was sent to OSH for
possible GIB. Of note, she has been on Primaxin and Xyvox for
MRSA and VRE in bilateral heel ulcers and was noted to have
downtrending PLT ?->70K->40K.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], she was guaiac positive with troponin 0.4 and a
positive UA. CT abdomen revealed a distended gallbladder with
layering gallstones but no other signs of cholecystitis. SBP 80s
so LIJ was placed and she was started on dopamine and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of possible sepsis. She was
given 2L NS, CTX 1G, Flagyl 500MG, Zosyn 3.375GIV, VANCO 1G.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96.7 100 81/56 20 99%2LNC. She was
started on levophed with improvement in SBP to 100s and improved
mentation to AAOx3. BP 86/47 2 hours after arrival on
0.3mcg/kg/min levophed so neo was added at 2200. She received
Vancomycin 1g, Zofran and 3L NS. Surgery was consulted for
abdominal pain and recommended serial exams and cx. Labs
remarkable for pancytopenia with PLT 30K, WBC 12K, lactate 4.7,
Cr 2.6, Na 129, HCT 30, Trop 0.39, INR 1.7 and positive UA.  VS
prior to transfer:95 99/69 13 94% 2L NC
.
On the floor, she feels "unwell" but unable to be more specific.
Reports left sided abd pain, difficulty breathing and endorses
recent nausea and dry heaves as well as diarrhea but unable to
state how long.  Denies cough, increased LE pain, fever, or
chills.

OSH Imaging
[**9-19**] OSh CXR: No intestinal obstruction. Some gaseous distension
of stomach. Mild CHF with vascular congestion.
CT abd/pelvis: moderate bilateral effusions, distension of GB,
layering stones, no wall thickening, no free air or fluid,
diffuse SC edema in chest wall and abdominal wall
CXR: loculated R pleural effusion/pleural thickening at R base
KUB: No intestinal obtruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F with CAD s/p CABG [**2189**] and MI x [**5-6**] and [**2198-8-5**], HTN,
PVD, bilateral heel ulcers on impinem and linezolid, and [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH with vasopressor dependent shock, likely
multifactorial.

#. Shock/Hypotension: Differential diagnosis included septic,
hypovolemic, cardiogenic shock. Cool extremities and recent CP
with pulm edema on CXR and CVP 20-24 most consistent with
cardiogenic shock. Patient also developed worsening hypoxia and
increased O2 requirement which was exacerbated with laying flat.
It is possible she had recent MI when c/o CP several days prior
or worsening CHF related to transfusions received several days
prior. Dobutamine was attempted for inotropy but hypotension
worsened on max levophed and uptitrated neo. She was also
treated with Dapto/PO Vanco/Zosyn/Fluconazole for possible
infectious sources such as skin/osteo given heel ulcers which
probe to bone, C difficile/colitis with recent diarrhea, UTI
with positive UA, and line infection with PICC in place. Lack of
leukocytosis and fever argued against infectious cause. Guaiac
positive stool in the setting of thrombocytopenia make slow GIB
a possible source of hypotension as well although HCT remained
stable. UOP remained low and pt maxed out on 4 pressors as above
with progressive hypotension MAPs in 40s-50s in addition to
altered mental status and hypoxia requiring nonrebreather. Her
daughter and HCP was called to discuss prognosis and pt was made
DNR/DNI with focus on comfort care and she expired several hours
later.

#. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema and cardiogenic
shock. Started on bipap with no improvement.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to myelosuppressive effects
of linezolid and imipenem +/- sepsis +/- GIB/consumptive
process.
.
#. Anemia/Guaiac positive stool: Likely secondary to GIB +/-
myelosuppression as above.  HCT stable.

#. Abdominal pain: Most likely secondary to ischemia in setting
of poor florward flow but covered for infectoius sources with
zosyn as well.  CT A/P without contrast did not demonstrate
acute pathology.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Likely related to volume overload and anasarca
as appears total body hypervolemic.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **] on [**Last Name (un) 2091**]: Unclear baseline. Likely prerenal secondary to
CHF and decreased forward flow vs ATN from sepsis. Urine Na<10.

.
#. Heel ulcers: On chronic abx and probe to bone so likely has
undergoing osteo. Covered with abx as above.

# Code: Full then changed to DNR/DNI
