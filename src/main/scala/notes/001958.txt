Brief Hospital Course:
GI: Ms. [**Known lastname 106373**] had intermittent bleeding from a duodenal ulcer.
She was placed on telemetry and on [**Hospital1 **] protonix and her
hematocrit was followed several times per day. She underwent 3
endoscopies in an effort to secure hemostasis. However, her
ulcer was so large and had an adherent clot, that it was not
possible to properly determine what was under the clot or to
cauterize it. Her vitals remained stable despite having
continued bleeding evidenced by several OB positive stools and
hematocrits that fell to 25. Although she was transfused 6 units
over a 3 day period, it was felt that her [**Hospital1 4532**] and aspirin
could not be discontinued in light of her recent placement of
bare metal stent. When she developed subjective lightheadedness
and her pressures fell to systolic 90's she was transferred to
the MICU.

In the MICU she underwent a procedure with interventional
radiology to sclerose the bleeding duodenal vessel. Upon
transfer to the MICU, her [**Hospital1 4532**] and aspirin was stopped and she
was transfused more PRBCs to maintain her hematocrit above 30.

Pt then transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]. Her HCT was stable in the low 30s.
[**Hospital Unit Name **] and [**Hospital Unit Name **] resumed. Sulfacrate and high dose PPI resumed.

Musculoskeletal: She had a total knee replacement 2 weeks prior
to admission and was prophylaxed with lovenox which was
discontinued shortly before this hospitalization.

Pulmonary: Ms. [**Known lastname 106373**] has COPD and was admitted to this service
on oxygen via nasal cannula. She underwent a brief steroid
taper. Her dyspnea resolved with fluticase and albuterol
inhalers and nebulizer treatments. Her oxygen was weaned to room
air, which she tolerated well.

Upon [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] transfer, she had two episodes of SOB which responded
to both albuterol/atrovent as well as diuresis. She was
subsequently weaned off O2.

Cardiology: Ms. [**Known lastname 106373**] has CAD s/p stent placement which was
medically managed with [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, BB, and captopril.
Her BB and captopril were discontinued during her acute bleeds
and then restarted once she was stable.
