History of Present Illness:
75 year old gentleman with cardiomyopathy, LVEF 25%, prior CABG
and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**]
hospital with severe and acute shortness of breath.  Prior to
arrival he had been having increasingly short of breath over a
month period but it acutely worsened [**7-8**].  On presentation to
outside hospital, he was hypoxic with SaO2 at 70-88%% on 6 L.
He was treated with lasix IV, NTP, enalaprilat, and biPAP with
improvement in dyspnea.  After he improved clinically he
continued with slowed heart rates as low as the 30-40 range
while sleeping, with pauses 3-5 seconds in atrial fibrillation.
He reports that he had two unsuccessful cardioversion attempts
within the past month due to atrial fibrillation.  Due to the
ongoing rhythm disturbances, he was transfered for further
cardiac evaluation.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2112-7-12**]  1:50:18 PM

Baseline artifact. Probable atrial fibrillation with controlled
ventricular response. Left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction delay. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with
late R wave progression may be related to axis or myocardial
infarction. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= XX %). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital with bradycardia and was
evaluated by electrophysiology and decision was made to place
ICD/pacer due to heart failure.  On [**7-13**] he was taken to the
cardiac lab for placement and generator was placed however they
were unable to advance leads. See procedure note for further
details.  He was then referred to cardiac surgery for epicardial
lead placement.  He underwent preoperative workup and continued
to be treated with lasix for volume overloaded and beta blockers
continued to be held due to slow ventricular rhythm.  On [**7-15**] he
was brought to the operating room for epicardial lead placement
via throacotomy.  See operative report for further details.  He
was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
management.  That evening he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
On post operative day one he had decreased urine output with
increased creatinine and was started on dopamine with improved
output however creatinine continued to climb with peak 3.2,
acute kidney injury, but then progressively decreased.  He was
started on coumadin for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
 He remained in the intensive care unit on dopamine.  On post
operative day 5 he was weaned off the dopamine, creatinine
continued to improve and he was transferred to the floor.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge home with
services on [**7-21**] with creatinine back down to 1.8 and plan for
INR check [**7-22**] with further dosing by primary care.  Additionally
due to blood pressure he was unable to be started on carvedilol
and valsartan.  His diuretic was stopped due to fluid balance
negative and no evidence of overload.  Discussed with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and plan to re evaluate as outpatient.
