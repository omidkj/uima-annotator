Service: SURGERY

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with past medical history of interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis on 3L home oxygen, COPD, hypertension, CKD
Stage 4 (baseline Cr 3-3.5), hypertension, severe peripheral
artery disease s/p multiple [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] procedures, osteoarthritis
who presented with respiratory distress. The patient had
recently been admitted to [**First Name3 (LF) **] Surgery [**2175-2-8**] for his
ongoing iliac artery aneurysm that has been difficult to
intervene upon. He presented this morning with chief compliant
of lower back pain in addition to progressive shortness of
breath for one day.

Per the patient's wife at his last pulmonary office visit
([**2175-1-9**]), the patient at baseline spends most of his day in
bed, getting up only for meals and doctor's appointments. He
uses 3L NC supplemental oxygen at home but intermittently, when
he should be using it continuously. He develops exertional
shortness of breath even with minimal activity. He had been in
his otherwise normal state of health, but complained of sudden
onset lower back pain in the evening prior to admission. He
eventually asked to go to the ER as a result. He was not having
much trouble breathing at that juncture.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were [**11-8**] abdominal pain from
chronic, HR 62, BP 195/86, RR 48, pOx 80 on room air with
respirations at 42 /min. He was triggered and immediately put on
non-rebreather, then BiPAP. During this time, the patient was
visibly tachypneic, speaking two word phrases only. CXR showed
LLL pneumonia so he was given zofran 4mg, Vancomycin 1 gram and
Ceftriaxone 1 gram for HCAP. He was also given duonebs. Prelim
CXR impression by radiology was bibasilar opacities likely
represenative of chronic fibrosis and bronchiectasis with
thoracoabdominal aortic ectasia again noted.

His respiratory distress subsided significantly and he was
transitioned to Venturi face mask (35%). ABG was 7.47/26/323/19
on CPAP. He also received morphine 4mg IV for pain relief and
albuterol/ipratropium nebs. On physical exam, reportedly no JVD
or pitting edema, no CHF history. As he is a significant
vasculopath, blood cultures could not be obtained and Chem 10
was too hemolyzed to run. One of his two PIVs blew and had to be
replaced. Chem panel was performed on the floor with Na 137, K
4.5, Cl 106, BUN 34, Cr 3.2 (baseline 3.0-3.5), HCO3 17, Glc
143. Other labs showing Troponin 0.14, CK-MB 4, Lactate 2.7.

On transfer, afebrile, HR62, BP 195/86, RR20, 100% on Venturi
face mask (35%). His wife is with him in the [**Name (NI) **] and he was
confirmed full code.

ECG also performed showing NSR at 60 bpm with PR prolongation
(226 ms), IVCD (QRS 108 ms), QTc 472 ms, leftward axis,
non-specific inferior ST-T changes similar to prior ECG.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient was examined at bedside. He was
speaking complete sentences, appeared comfortable although
respiratory rate in high 20s. Patient was complaining of [**7-9**]
mid-line lower back pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2175-2-20**] CTA torso: 1. Type B dissection of the thoracic aorta
extending into the abdominal aorta
terminating superior to the level of the aortobiiliac stent.
Dissection is seen involving the origin of the celiac axis and
SMA. The right renal artery is coming off the false lumen with
hypoenhancement of the right adrenal gland and kidney compared
to the left.
2. Slight interval increase in size of right hypogastric artery
aneurysm. Stable left hypogastric artery aneurysm.
3. Slight interval increase in right popliteal artery aneurysm
compared to previous angiogram from [**2172-4-3**].
4. Patent superficial femoral artery to below-knee grafts.

Brief Hospital Course:
84-year-old male with past medical history of oxygen-dependent
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, hypertension, CKD Stage
4, hypertension, severe peripheral artery disease s/p multiple
[**Last Name (un) 1106**] procedures, osteoarthritis who presented with acute
onset back pain.

Acute Issues:

# Low back pain: Type B Dissection) Patient presented to the ED
with acute onset lower lumbar back pain. Given known history of
[**Last Name (un) 1106**] issues and elevated blood pressure, some concern for
[**Last Name (un) 1106**] process. CTA of the torso showed a type B aortic
dissection. [**Last Name (un) **] surgery was consulted and transferred the
patient to the Surgical ICU for further monitoring and tight
blood pressure control. Initially on IV medications. He was
transfered to his PO medications and transferred to the VICU for
further care. Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] remained HD stable since transfer the
the [**Known lastname 1106**] service, with good blood pressure and heart rate
control, and no further episodes of back pain.
