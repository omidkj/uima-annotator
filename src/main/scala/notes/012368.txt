CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2141-3-16**]): Comparison is made to [**2-6**], [**2141**]. The patient is status post sternotomy. The tip of the
central venous line terminates at the cavoatrial junction in a
similar location. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
unchanged. The lungs are clear. However, there is evidence of a
small right subpulmonic effusion, new since the prior study.
There is also similar fullness of the pulmonary vessels
bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension.
.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation with somewhat rapid ventricular
response. Since the previous tracing of [**2141-2-13**] atrial
fibrillation is a new rhythm. The rate is somewhat faster.
Otherwise, no significant change.
.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT PORT ([**2141-3-17**]): [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color,
and pulse Doppler examination of the right femoral vessels was
performed. Markedly turbulent, increased flow is seen in the
right femoral vein with arterialization of the venous waveform
demonstrated on pulse Doppler examination. There is a large
groin hematoma measuring at least 18.5 x 7.9 x 8.3 cm.
.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT ([**2141-3-18**]): Grayscale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral artery and vein
were performed. Again demonstrated is pulsatility of the right
common femoral venous waveform with markedly elevated velocities
of 180 cm/s consistent with an arteriovenous fistula.
Redemonstrated within the right medial groin is a heterogeneous
collection measuring at least 8.9 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm. These findings
are consistent with a hematoma which appears more organized than
on prior exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU service for close
observation. At the time of admission to the ICU, the patient's
SBP was stable ~100. There was concern for sepsis, [**2-16**] to an
indwelling dialysis line, and the patient was covered with
Vancomycin. He had a h/o of GIB in the past but his Hct remained
stable and no evidence of active bleeding on exam. His BP
responded to a 500cc bolus and remained stable. He was noted to
be in an atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, requiring max
diltiazem gtt and IV lopressor at one time.  He was transitioned
over to diltiazem and lopressor PO. With improvement in his
rate, his blood pressure remained stable. The patient was noted
to have a R groin hematoma, thought to be [**2-16**] to line attempts
on admission. U/S revealed an AV fistula. Vascular Surgery was
consulted and recommended holding pressure and repeating
ultrasound.  Repeat u/s following day showed no flow.
.
He remained hemodynamically stable and was called out to a
monitored telemetry bed on the medical floor. There, a history
of preceding diarrhea was elicited. Stool samples were sent for
C Diff toxin assay, which returned positive on [**2141-3-22**]. The
remainder of his workup remained negative, including blood
cultures, chest X-ray, and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. His presenting
hypotension was presumed secondary to hypovolemia from C Diff
associated diarrhea. He was started on PO Flagyl, with good
symptomatic response. He was discharged with plans to complete a
2 week course.
.
He continued to be followed by the renal dialysis team and
received dialysis on a MWF schedule. He was continued on
Nephrocaps and received Epogen at dialysis. A temporary left
internal jugular dialysis catheter was placed on [**2141-3-22**]. This
was changed to a permanent tunnelled line on [**2141-3-28**].
.
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor twice daily for a
recent history of gastrointestinal bleed. For this reason, he
was not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation. He received
subcutaneous heparin three times daily for DVT prophylaxis.
