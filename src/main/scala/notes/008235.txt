CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old male with
a history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital initially with increased shortness of
breath/congestive heart failure and ischemic ST depressions
in leads V2 through V6 (1-2 mm).  He was immediately
intubated for impending respiratory failure and transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] for a cardiac
catheterization, where no acute lesions were found, but
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 45 was noted, prominent
V waves consistent with mitral regurgitation, a cardiac index
of 2.79, and a cardiac output of 6.09.  He was admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit for [**Location (un) **] diuresis and ventilatory
support until volume overload improved.  He was also noted to
be in atrial flutter upon admission to the catheterization
laboratory, but was in normal sinus rhythm upon arrival to
the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft times five ([**2176**]). All
native vessels are occluded.  Had a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, had saphenous vein
graft to the OM3, posterior descending artery and an
saphenous vein graft to the ramus/OM (occluded).
3.  Also history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/asbestosis.
4.  History of diabetes.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Obesity.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Vitamin B12 deficiency.
9.  Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg po q.d.
2.  Lasix 80 mg po q.d.
3.  Imdur 60 mg po q.d.
4.  Metoprolol 150 mg po q.d.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d.
6.  Lipitor 40 mg po q.d.
7.  Calcium 250 mg po q.d.
8.  Vitamin D 125 units q.d.
9.  Multivitamin.
10. Rosiglitazone 2 mg b.i.d.
11. Aciphex 20 mg po b.i.d.
12. Salmeterol.
13. Albuterol.
14. Ipratropium.
15. Ferrous sulfate.
16. Flovent 220 mcg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his girlfriend.  [**Name (NI) **] not
smoked cigarettes in 22 years.  No alcohol use since his
coronary artery bypass graft.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general, he was
mildly agitated, intubated, obese.  Vital signs: Temperature
98.  Heart rate 70-80 in normal sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure
124-162/62-80.  Respiratory rate 12-13.  He was saturating
100% on the ventilator.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae
edema bilaterally.  Moist mucous membranes, intubated.  Neck:
Obese, jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, distant S1, S2, unable to appreciate
murmurs.  Pulmonary:  Decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Abdomen:  Obese, nontender, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  1+ edema, dopplerable dorsalis pedis/ posterior
tibial pulses.  Right groin without hematoma nor bruit.
Skin:  Erythema on the lower abdomen.  Right lower
extremities with no pustules or petechia.  Neurological:
Sedated, intubated, withdrawals to pain.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 8.7,
hematocrit 29.0, platelet count 162,000, INR 1.2, sodium 139,
potassium 4.7, BUN 40, creatinine 1.7, platelet count
233,000.  Troponin 9.3, CK 89, MB not done.  Arterial blood
gas:  7.39/53/117.  Venous gas 68%.  Chest x-ray
demonstrating no pneumothorax, congestive heart failure, Swan
appropriately placed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70-year-old male with history of
coronary artery disease, status post five vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2176**] with three patent grafts, and an
ejection fraction of approximately 20-30%, history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (FEV1 approximately 32% of
normal), presenting with decompensated heart failure,
intubated at outside hospital with ST depressions anteriorly,
transferred for catheterization and found to have high
filling pressures, however, no culprit lesions.  Transfer to
the Coronary Care Unit for care of diuresis.

Patient was diuresed with Natrecor drips, Lasix drips, with
some improvement of volume overload state.  His Coronary Care
Unit course, however, was complicated by ongoing respiratory
failure in the setting of severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  Also complicated by recurrent
tachyarrhythmias and rate related ischemia in the setting of
atrial flutter.  While the patient's rate was adequately
controlled and he was diuresed significantly, his respiratory
status remained tenuous given his significant underlying
disease.  On [**10-28**], a family meeting was obtained and
the decision to withdrawal care was made at that time.

On [**2187-10-29**], at 10 o'clock in the morning, the
patient was found to be not breathing and unresponsive.  His
pupils were fixed and dilated.  He had no breath sounds and
no heart sounds.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure.   The patient's family
was present at the bedside.
