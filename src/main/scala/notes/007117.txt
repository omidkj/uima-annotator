History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 34yo woman with history of complicated
migraines, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease, DM, hypercholesterolemia,
asthma, and stroke in [**12-20**] who came to the ED on [**2110-9-2**] for
evaluation of headache, and left sided chest pain.   She was a
questionable historian and much of the following history was
obtained from prior records.
.
During late [**Month (only) 205**] she experienced heat exhaustion and was
admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 68352**] Hospital in [**Doctor First Name 26692**].  At
discharge she developed pain, erythema, and swelling on the
dorsum of her right wrist (the site of her IV).  She was
prescribed po keflex as an outpatient.  Her symptoms persisted
and she was admitted to [**Location (un) 60883**]Hospital on [**2110-7-18**] for thrombophelbitis/cellulitis. She complained of nausea,
vomiting, and abdomimal pain. She experienced no fevers, chills,
headache, SOB, or cough.  She was started on IV Vancomycin and
IV clindamycin.  Her symptoms improved though did not completely
resolve.  She was switched to PO Augmentin (7 day course 875 po
BID) and discharged on [**7-20**].  During her hospitalization
she was also found to be anemic, with no evidence of a "gross
bleed."  Her anemia work-up was deferred to her PCP.
.
She went back to the hospital at the beginning of [**Month (only) **]
because her wrist symptoms had not completely resolved.  She was
given IV vancomycin and prescribed Linezolid.  She [**Month (only) 20227**]'t
afford the medication and was switched to an unknown dose/course
of levaquin.
.
Despite numerous antibiotics, she notes the persistence of mild
erythema, pain, and swelling of her left wrist.  She lives in
CT, and denies any recent outdoor hikes, camping, or tick bites.
  She came to [**Location (un) 86**] to visit her sister whose husband was
recently injured in [**Country 2451**].  On Saturday she experienced an aura
of flashing lights and developed an intense migraine.  She tried
taking an extra dose of neurontin but it didn't help.  She was
able to sleep,but notes ongoing nausea, vomiting, and
photophobia.  The migraine pain has been localized mainly on the
right side, throbbing, and currently feels as if her eye is
"going to [**Doctor Last Name **] out."  According to the neurology note she
developed R-arm heaviness a few hours after the onset of her
headache. Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 36665**]'t comment when asked about this.
Her symptoms persisted and on Monday she developed left upper
chest and upper back pain.  She [**Last Name (Titles) 20227**]'t describe the pain
further. She denied any sensory changes, motor changes, numbness
or tingling.  She has no neck pain, facial droop, or slurred
speech.
.
She came to the ED on Tuesday ([**2110-9-2**]) after her sympoms didn't
improve.  She has had minor migraine relief with dilaudid and
phenergan. During her time in the ED, she noted ongoing constant
left sided chest pain, which is not affected by breathing.  At
6:00 am on [**2110-9-3**] she developed fever (103), tachycardia (141),
and shaking chills. An EKG was done and showed no ST changes and
one set of cardiac enzymes was negative. She was given 1 gram IV
Vanco, had an LP that was unimpressive.  A PICC was placed due
to difficulty establishing access.  She was given 2 liters of NS
and was transferred to medicine.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she was tachycardic (108), afebrile,
and 96% on room air.  She was lying in the dark, looking mildly
uncomfortable in bed.  She was a poor historian and somnolent
througout the interview. She required frequent reminders to stay
on subject and often responded inappropriately to questions.
Her major complaints were right sided migraine and left upper
chest and back pain.  She also states that her left wrist
continues to be mildly painful.  Shortly after the interview,
she developed shaking chills, tachycardia (130), and fever to
103. Blood cx and ABG were drawn, tylenol was given, and ice was
applied.  She was given on 1 L normal saline.
