Service:


This is a 75-year-old patient with end-stage lung disease
from sarcoid with pulmonary fibrosis on 3 liters of home
oxygen and chronic prednisone and recent hospitalization here
for worsening sarcoid versus CHF, for which she underwent
diuresis, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] ED to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**4-13**] with worsening shortness of breath and
was evaluated by the Intensive Care Unit in the Emergency
Room.  At that time, she was comfortable, had stable O2
saturations and so she was admitted to Medicine Night Float
to the Medicine wards.

Over the early hours of her hospitalization, the patient had
declining mental status and worsening hypoxia, and work of
breathing.  She was evaluated by her pulmonologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 217**], who felt that if aggressive care was
indicated, she should get a trial of noninvasive ventilation,
diuresis, and possible thoracentesis as she had a large left
effusion and also by the CHF team, who felt she should have a
Natrecor diuresis with the addition of Lasix and rate
controlled with diltiazem.

After discussion with the family between the [**Hospital1 **] attending,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 665**] and the pulmonologist, the patient was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.

ALLERGIES:  Ampicillin caused a rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, she had a
temperature of 99.8, sats dipping to the low 80s, and
respiratory rate up to 35, blood pressure of 100, and heart
rate of 104 in atrial fibrillation.  Physical exam was
notable for the inability to follow commands or communicate
effectively and accessory muscle use.  Facial surgical scars
from skin cancer therapy and an irregularly, irregular
cardiac exam obscured by rhonchorous respirations with rales
and squeaks and poor air movement, grunting abdominal
respirations, multiple skin tears, ecchymoses, and actinic
keratoses, venous stasis changes, and substantial lower
edema.

Please see OMR for laboratory studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit and placed on noninvasive mask ventilation.  She
was continued on her antibiotics, nebulizers, and steroids,
as well as nesiritide and Lasix.  Diltiazem was given for
rate control.  Patient was minimally responsive throughout.
Discussion was held to see whether she should have better
access obtained through the central line and arterial line.
Family decided to avoid any procedure, which could cause
discomfort.  Patient was maintained on noninvasive
ventilation until the rest of the family and a minister could
arrive.

At that point, Morphine was titrated up.  Her mask
ventilation was discontinued and she died surrounded by her
family at 21:20 on [**2113-4-14**].  An autopsy was declined.
