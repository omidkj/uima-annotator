Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH with vfib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with PTCA to RCA


History of Present Illness:
58F with history of MIs and strokes from antiphospholipid
syndrome/protein C deficiency, called EMS for [**9-21**] CP Saturday
evening. EMS found pt lying on deck with intact sensorium;
admitted to not taking any meds for last month or so [**1-13**]
insurance problems. C/o nausea as well as constant, sharp chest
pain. EKG in the field c/w Inf STEMI, BP 96/50, bolused 2L NS
and gave ASA. En route to [**Hospital3 3583**], pt c/o severe
headache and then became unresponsive. V-fib on monitor, shocked
once with 200J and return of SR but did not wake up. Intubated
in [**Hospital 46**] Hosp ED, subsequently received 4 shocks for VF
followed by 2 min CPR, then apparently polymorphic VT which was
defibrillated, then SB with pulse, then polymorphine VT again
and defibrillated resulting in no pulse, CPR continued, next
rhythm check showed asystole. She was briefly paced
transcutaneously and then regained sinus brady. Stable enough
for CT head--no ICH--but had asystolic arrest in scanner. Epi
and atropine regained sinus brady. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]; by
report, she was on lidocaine and amiodarone drips, but these
were discontinued by the time she arrived at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] Cath lab, briefly lost pulse, required epi and
dopamine. RCA found to be occluded with thrombus, treated with
PTCA. Received heparin and integrilin gtts, transferred to CCU
on dopamine.

Past Medical History:
COPD
Coronary Syndrome X--arterial spasm, diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**]
Protein C deficiency & antiphospholipid antibody
-- "4 or 5" MIs ~15 years ago, one of which led to prolonged (1
month) hospital stay at [**Hospital1 2025**]
-- stroke with minimal R sided deficits--family says pt
complains of "clumsiness" in R hand
Cardiac History:
MI x5?
Percutaneous coronary intervention: unclear

Social History:
Divorced, lives with son. Daughter nearby. Was working in the
family business, a deli, and coordinating weddings prior to
event.

Pertinent Results:
EKG:
pre-hosp: SR STE II, III, aVF with STD in I, aVL, V3-V6; TWI in
I, aVL, and V1-V6
arrival at [**Hospital1 18**]: similar, consistent with inferior infarction
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal akinesis of the inferior wall and inferior septum. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with inferior wall and right ventricular
myocardial infarction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
CARDIAC CATH: LMCA: no sign. dz. LAD: no sign. dz. LCX: no sign.
dz. RCA: TO distal at [**Doctor Last Name **]. PTCA to distal RCA.

HEAD CT from [**Hospital 46**] Hosp: Encephalomalacia in right post
parietal cortex, diffuse atrophy, lacune in left insular white
matter and in left paraventricular white matter. No ICH. No
masses or midline shift.

[**8-19**] ECG
Sinus rhythm. Prolonged QTc interval. Q waves in the inferior
leads with
minimal ST segment elevations. Prior inferior myocardial
infarction.
ST segment depressions in leads V1-V5 with T wave inversions
through lead V6
which may be due to myocardial ischemia. Low QRS voltage in the
limb leads.
Compared to tracing #1 acute injury pattern in the
infero-posterior leads is
no longer present. There is some persistence of anterior
myocardial ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
58F with hypercoagulable syndrome, apparently not taking
coumadin, presents s/p asystolic arrest and POBA to RCA.

.
# CAD/Ischemia: STEMI leading to cardiac arrest,  treated with
PTCA; suspect due to hypercoagulability rather than plaque
rupture as no other apparent CAD. And multiple MI's in past as
well as one CVA at young age. Pt. had previously been prescribed
warfarin for this condition. Pt. was extubated on the day after
admission and bridged to 2 days of therapeutic INR with heparin
drip.  Lipid panel was not suggestive of atherosclerotic
disease. She continued to complain of chest pain but her ECG was
not concerning and it was determined that her pain was probably
secondary to the chest compressions she recieved. She did not
have DOE or chest pain on exertion at time of d/c. She was
discharged with strict instructions to continue her warfarin and
have her INR checked and followed up by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5311**]. Pt.
was advised repeatedly of the need to quit smoking especially
given her propensity to clot. She voiced understanding of this
and stated that she would quit.
.
# Pump: She initially had low BP requiring pressors, but by the
second day of admission her BP had improved to baseline of SBP
90's and she was weaned off pressors. She initially had some
oxygen requirement which was thought secondary to pulmonary
edema but this resolved with autodiuresis.
.
# Rhythm:
Pt. had episode of v-fib as well as pulseless VT and two
episodes of asystole at OSH, had minimal NSVT on the night of
admission, NSR for the rest of her admission.
.
# Respiratory failure: intubated for apparent hypoxic failure
after cardiac arrest at OSH. Extubated the day
