History of Present Illness:
This is a 46 year-old Greek-speaking female with a history of
asthma, morbid obesity, DM2, and HTN who presented to the
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**9-26**] with severe bilateral calf pain (RLE
[**9-6**], LLE [**6-6**]) progressing over 3d and increasing SOB x 1 day.
The patient presented to the OSH where she had negative
bilateral LENIs, however, CTA showed large bilateral segmental
PEs. She was started on heparin gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible embolectomy. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was
admitted to the MICU, where VS: AF, HR 102, BP 148/88, RR 18,
94% on 4L NC. Patient complained of mild SOB and persistent calf
pain. She was continued on heparin gtt. EKGs were without
evidence of acute ischemia, but evidence of new TWI in V1-V3.
She had 3 sets of cardiac enzymes negative. TTE was performed.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, with O2 sats in the
low- to mid-90s on 6L nasal cannula. She was transferred to the
floor in stable condition.
.
The patient denied any F/C, HA/ dizziness, CP, palpitations,
cough, hemoptysis, abdomenal pain, n/v/d/constipation, dysuria,
weakness/ numbness/ paresthesias, or swelling in extremities.

IMAGING:
.
[**9-27**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w primary
pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism). Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global
systolic function (LV EF 60-65%).
.
OSH Imaging: CTA - Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with
mild leftward bowing of interventricular septum.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 46 year-old female with asthma, morbid obesity,
DM2, and hypertension transferred from an outside hospital with
bilateral segmental PEs.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism: The patient was transferred from the
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital with bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli
noted on CT scan. The etiology of this was felt to be secondary
to patient's smoking history (of note, she reports quitting 9
days before admission) and morbid obesity (BMI 50). The patient
has an up-to-date negative cancer screening (mammogram, Pap,
colonoscopy), no history of prolonged travel, and no trauma or
recent injuries that may have precipitated this. Upon transfer
cardiac enzymes were negative x 3 and the patient was ruled out
for MI. EKG showed evidence of minor ST elevations in V1-V3,
consistent with PE. TTE showed evidence of right heart strain
with increased right-sided pressure, right free wall
hypokinesis, pulmonary hypertension, and moderate TR. The
patient, however, was hemodynamically stable and therefore was
not felt to be a candidate for thrombolysis. Bilateral LE
Doppler US were negative for evidence of blood clots, and it was
felt that IVC filter was not indicated at this time. The patient
was placed on high flow oxygen (6L by NC) to maintain oxygen
saturations < 90% and was monitored on telemetry with no
evidence of arrhythmias. The patient was continued on a heparin
gtt, and started on a bridge to coumadin on [**9-27**]. Lovenox was
tried on [**9-28**] for a bridge, but discontinued on [**9-30**] when the
patient developed a rash. (Rash was treated well with Atarax prn
and began to resolve upon discontinuing lovenox.) The patient
was resumed on coumadin, and reached therapeutic levels on [**10-2**].
The patient was discharged on [**10-3**] maintaining oxygen
saturations in the mid-90%s on RA (likely bsaeline) without any
symptoms of dyspnea. The patient was set up with VNA services to
check INR upon discharge with coumadin management to be done by
her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] workup will be performed as an
outpatient.
.
# DM2: The patient takes outpatient glyburide and metformin with
poor glycemic control, usually in the 200s. The patient has been
reluctant to take insulin in the past given fear of
administering injections. While in-house oral agents were
initially held in favor of an insulin sliding scale. She was
restarted on oral outpatient medicine prior to discharge.
Diabetes management is closely followed by PCP.
.
# HTN: The patient's outpatient nifedipine was held initially
given concern for hemodynamic instability with PE; however,
blood pressure was well-controlled for remainder of admission
with SBPs in 110s-120s without additional agents so nifedipine
was not restarted. This may be re-started by the patient's PCP.
(ACEI may also be considered given the patient's history of
diabetes.)
.
# Depression/Anxiety: The patient was continued on her
outpatient regimen of aripiprazole, fluoxetine, and klonapin
prn.
.
# Tobacco: the patient was continued on a nicotine patch while
inhouse.
.
# Asthma: The patient was continued on outpatient Advair and
albuterol nebulizers prn.
.
# The patient was discharged on [**10-3**] in good condition,
afebrile, VSS, ambulating well and tolerating po well. She was
discharged with VNA services to check INR upon discharge, with
coumadin to be managed by the patient's PCP.
