History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65783**] is an 84-year-old woman with a history of COPD,
schizophrenia, DM, HTN, and colon cancer, and recent admission
to [**Hospital1 18**] for gastroenteritis, who presents today from a group
home with a report of altered mental status.
.
Pt felt good on discharge from the hospital until the morning of
admission, when (as per the care givers) she slept much longer
than normal, and was not "acting normal." She did not wash
herself or get dressed. She also had difficulty doing her finger
stick and seemed confused about how to use her glucometer. She
was able to speak and walk normally. When she did not improve,
her care givers called EMS. According to EMS, her FS glucose was
217 at that time.
.
On arrival in the ED she was febrile to 101.3, tachycardic to
the 110's, hypotensive to 85/32, respiration rate of 35, and
sating 84%. She was given IVF and O2. At that time it was noted
that she was not responding appropriately to questions or
following commands. She was also noted to be falling to the R
side. A neuro consult was called and she was sent to head CT.
Ultimately, head CT and neuro exam were normal. A chest x-ray
taken at that time showed a left lower lobe infiltrate. Her labs
were notable for a WBC of 13.3 with 92% PMN, BNP 70, and WNL
ABG. She was started on azythromycin, ceftriaxone, combivent
nebs, solumedrol, and tylenol and given a total of 2L NS. She
was admitted to the MICU for observation given concern for
respiratory failure
.
On admission to the MICU her temperature was 96.5, pulse 104, BP
123/52, respiration rate 22, satting 91% on 4L. On questioning
she was oriented to person and time. She complained of SOB on
questioning but denied that this is any different from her
normal level of SOB. She reports DOE and occassional cough. She
says that she has coughed up blood in the past, but not
recently. She reports smoking 2.5 packs of cigarettes per day
for many years, but cannot recall how many. She also says that
she gets occassional chest pain, but none today. She generally
gets chest pain when walking. She reports a few days of
diarrhea, but cannot recall how long or how frequent. She denied
bloody diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 65783**] is an 84-y/o woman with COPD, DM2, HTN,
SCZ, colon cancer, and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for
gastroenteritis, who originally presented from a group care home
with fever, diarrhea, altered mental status, and was found to
have community-acquired PNA.
.
# COPD exacerbation w/ PNA: Pt w baseline COPD presented with
altered mental status, fever, hypoxemia (baseline SaO2 of 92% on
RA, on admission 88% on 4L), and respiratory distress. Found to
have leukocytosis (WBC=13) and LLL infiltrate on CXR
Met SIRS criteria, so admitted to the MICU, but quickly
stabilized with hydration and was then transferred to the floor.
She was treated with ceftriaxone 1g IVq24hrs x 5 days for
community-acquired PNA and azythromycin 250mg POq24hrs x 5 days
for question Legionella given PNA and diarrhea. Urinary antigen
for Legionella returned negative. She was then switched to
levofloxacin 750mg PO daily for an additional 2 days, for a
total of 7 days of abx treatment. On admission, she was also
started on methylpred 125mg IVq8 then switched to PO 60mg
prednisone because she clinically did not need IVs, which was
then tapered as her condition improved. She was continued on
home nebs with fluticasone, ipratropium, albuterol, and
salmeterol throughout her stay. Pt afebrile, hemodynamically
stable and with baseline oxygenation on discharge.
.
# Diarrhea: Likely secondary to acute stress from
PNA/respiratory distress. Legionella antigen negative. C. diff
was also considered given rece
