Imaging:

CXR on admission:
An endotracheal tube lies with its tip approximately 4 cm from
the carina. An NG tube lies with its tip below the diaphragm
although the tip is not
visualized on this study. There is increased opacity at the
right base with homogenous opacification consistent with a
pleural effusion. This makes assessment of the right lung base
difficult. There are air bronchograms evident in the right lower
lung; however, this may be related to either compressive
atelectasis or pneumonia

CT Abdomen:
1. Endotracheal tube is seen 5 cm above the carina. The right
internal
jugular line is seen with the distal tip in the proximal
superior vena cava.  The nasogastric tube is seen coiled with
the tip within the antrum of the stomach.
2. Complete opacification of the right lower lung lobe with a
moderate-sized pleural effusion. There is a smaller
consolidation and tiny pleural effusion at the base of the left
lung.
3. No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic source of infection. There
is
perinephric stranding seen around the right kidney as well as
free fluid
within the pelvis from likely from aggressive hydration or poor
nutritinoal status.
4. Several hypodensities seen bilaterally and a soft tissue
density lesion
seen in the inferior pole of the right kidney. This right kidney
lesion can be further evaluated with ultrasound after the
patient's acute clinical condition resolves.

CT Chest:
1. Endotracheal tube is seen 5 cm above the carina. The right
internal
jugular line is seen with the distal tip in the proximal
superior vena cava.  The nasogastric tube is seen coiled with
the tip within the antrum of the stomach.

Pertinent labs on discharge:
Hemoglobin 7.5 Hct 22.6. Final urine culture on [**2180-4-11**] was
negative for growth.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 y/o M with Stage IV CKD (Cr 4.5), HTN, DM2, p/w
weakness & SOB x 3 days, found to have RML/RLL PNA and acute on
chronic renal failure, transferred for consideration of urgent
hemodialysis.

#. Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Patient arrrived intubated and sedated
on mechanical ventilation.  He was treated initially for
community acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone,
but switched to vancomycin and cefepime as he did not intially
improve.  Urine legionella antigen was positive and antibiotics
were narrowed to levofloxacin. His WBC count continued to rise,
infectious disease was consulted and coverage was broadened to
tigecycline on [**2180-3-31**].  He was extubated initially on [**2180-4-3**],
but became acute hypoxic due to mucous plugging and suffered PEA
arrest.  He was emergently reintubated, and put back on the
ventilator.  On [**2180-4-7**], he passed a spontaneous breathing trial
and was extubated without complication.  His white count trended
down to 12 on transfer to the floor.  He was continued on
levofloxacin with a planned total course of 21 days (Day #15 at
discharge).

# Cardiac Arrest: On [**2180-4-3**] patient was extubated, became
acutely hypoxic and suffered PEA arrest.  Chest compressions
were started promptly, he received epinephrine, atropine and
received one electrical defibrillation for ventricular
fibrillation.  He received adenosine for SVT, then switchedinto
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Restoration of sponteous
circulation was achieved in 8 minutes.
He was give amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an infusion at
1mg/hr for six hours, then 0.5 mg/hr for 18 hours.  His rate was
stable in the 80s.

#. Sepsis: On hospital day 2, patient became progressively
tachycardic and hypotensive responsive to fluid boluses and
briefly required norepinephrine.

#. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On arrival patient had
increased BUN and
