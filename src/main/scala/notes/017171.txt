Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic cerebral angiogram

History of Present Illness:
62 year old man with CAD in [**2138**] s/p RCA stenting, depression,
and alcoholism who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2143-7-24**] after a
witnessed fall down stairs while intoxicated. Patient was unable
to recall the fall and denied LOC. CT findings demonstrated a
subarachnoid and left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Patient was also found to have alcohol withdrawl and
thrombocytopenia.

Patient was initially admitted to intensive care under the
Neurosurgical service. ETOH withdrawl was treated with Ativan.
Cerebral bleeds were stable on CT although mental status has
waxed and waned. CT torso showed emphysema and a 5mm RLL nodule,
fatty liver, soft plaque in the descending aorta causing 40%
stenosis, 50% stenosis of the right common iliac artery.
Hematology was consulted for thrombocytopenia who felt that it
was most likely secondary to bone marrow suppression.

The patient was transferred to medicine for further managment of
his thrombocytopenia and alcohol withdrawl.  Vitals signs upon
transfer to medicine: BP-106/59, HR NSR in 60's 98% RA. He was
alert and oriented x3 and able to recount the events leading to
his admission. He was drinking while staying at his sister's
house and slipped at the top of the stairs and fell down the
entire flight. Currently denies pain, headache, tremor,
palpiations, diaphoresis. He is anxious to leave the hospital.

STUDIES:

[**7-23**] CT head
1.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and
suprasellar cistern.
2.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe in the
vertex and tiny punctate focus in the body of the right corpus
callosum.

[**7-23**] chest Xray: The lungs are well expanded and show a left
lower lobe mild patchy opacity, likely Atelectasis.  The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Partially imaged
is an anterior cervical fusion device. No displaced rib
fractures are noted.

[**7-23**] CT Cervical Spine: No acute fracture or malalignment.
As above, there is no acute abnormality.
However, there is circumferential lucency about the paired
screws in the C5 and C6, but no the C4 vertebral body, and, in
the absence of previous studies, loosening is a consideration.
Also noted is significant bilateral neural foraminal narrowing
at the C5/6 and C6/7 levels, with possible exiting neural
impingement.

[**7-24**] CT c/a/p:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute fracture.  Mild stranding in the subcutaneous
tissues overlying the left gluteal muscles.
2.  Fatty liver.
3.  5-mm right lower lobe nodule needs followup in 12 months if
the patient is low risk for malignancy and followup CT in six
months if the patient is high risk for malignancy.
4.  Diffuse calcific and non-calcific plaque causing 40%
narrowing of the
distal descending thoracic aorta, 50% stenosis of the celiac
artery and 50% stenosis of the right common iliac artery.

[**7-24**] CT head
IMPRESSION:
1.  Slight increase in size of the small parenchymal hemorrhage
at the left pareitovertex [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction.
2.  No significant short-interval change in the amount or
distribution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly in
the right basal cisterns.

[**7-24**] Cerebral angiogram
No aneurysm no apparent etiology to subarachnoid and parenchymal
hemorrhage.  Incidental notes include an infundibulum at the
origin of the left posterior communicating artery.

[**7-25**] CT head: stable hemorrhages, note made of left
frontoparietal subdural hygroma

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **]  is a 62-year-old man with CAD in [**2138**] s/p RCA
stenting, depression, and alcoholism who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2143-7-24**] after a witnessed fall down stairs, developing a
subarachnoid and left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.


ACTIVE ISSUES THIS HOSPITALIZATION:

1. Intracranial bleed: Patient sustained but a traumatic
subarachnoid hemorrhage and a left parietal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage during his fall. He was admitted to
the neurosurgical ICU for q4H neuro checks and SBP control <
140. His left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage remained
stable on CT and his neuro exam remained non-focal. He did not
require surgical intervention. Patient was started on Keppra for
seizure prophylaxis. Upon transfer to the floor, his neuro exam
remained unremarkable and he was evaluated by PT and OT, who
recommended he make a visit with cognitive neurology. Patient
will follow up with Neurosurgery in 4 weeks. He will obtain head
CT prior to appointment.

2. Thrombocytopenia: Patient was noted to have low platelets,
with initial values in the 60's and a nadir in the low 40's.
Heparin-based products were held and patient received
pneumoboots for DVT proph
