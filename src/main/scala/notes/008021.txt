Pertinent Results:
[**2133-11-26**] TTE
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal severely hypokinetic anterior,
[**Last Name (un) **]-septal and lateral wall and akinetic apex.. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Improved left ventricular global and focal LV systolci
function with inotropic support.
2. Preserved RV systolci function
3. A partial annuloplasty band is visualized in the mitral
postion. Well seated and stable with good leaflet excursion.
Trace to mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8751**] by PHT = >2 cm2.
4. No left to right flow could be demonstrated on the IAS with
CFD.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred in from outside hospital and underwent
cardiac catheterization, due to coronary artery disease cardiac
surgery was consulted.  On [**11-26**] he went to the operating room
and underwent a CABG x 4, MV ring, PFO closure.  See operative
note for full details.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support
with epinephrine weaned off on POD1.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight. Baseline creatinine was 1.6 and peak creatinine post
operatively was 2.3.  His renal function was slowly improving at
the time of discharge. The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 the
patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **] rehab in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions. Of note, the patient needs
repeat CT chest to f/u on pulmonary  nodules in 6 months.
