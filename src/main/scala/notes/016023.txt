HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old gentleman
with a 6.3 cm thoracoabdominal aneurysm, who has extensive

The patient now is admitted for endovascular repair of his
thoracoabdominal aneurysm.

right and left renal arteries in [**2097**]; small-cell carcinoma
of the parotid gland, status post chemotherapy and radiation;

left upper lobe on [**2100-1-18**] and right lower lobe
superior segmentectomy on [**2100-2-9**]; history of
hypertension; history of peripheral vascular disease; history
of carotid stenosis; history of depression; history of
abdominal aortic aneurysm; history of hyperlipidemia; history
of being a 96-pack-year smoker - has not smoked in 2 years;
history of COPD with an FEV-1 of 42%; history of chronic
kidney disease, stage II to III.

ALLERGIES:  Univasc; Lipitor; vitamin E; Ambien.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Vicodin 5/500 b.i.d., hydralazine
50 mg q.i.d., albuterol 90 mcg q.i.d., fluoxetine 40 mg
daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily, metoprolol
75 mg t.i.d., simvastatin 80 mg daily, ipratropium/albuterol
18/103 mcg 2 puffs q.i.d., fluticasone 110 mcg puffs b.i.d.,
isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg daily, Ultram 25 mg daily,
Flexeril 10 mg at bedtime.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired and has a former history of
alcohol abuse and former tobacco use. He has not smoked since
___________ and previously had 96- to 100-pack-year smoking.
He lives in [**Location 149**] and has been in [**Location (un) 86**] for 2 or 3 months,
staying with friends in [**Location (un) 2030**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for [**Location (un) 499**] cancer - his mother at
the age of 43 and his brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer at the age of
37.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  97.2; 67; 18; blood
pressure 102/68; O2 sat 97% on room air. GENERAL APPEARANCE:
No acute distress. HEENT:  Exam was unremarkable. There was
no lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm,
with a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border. LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:
Unremarkable exam. EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema.
NEUROLOGICAL: Exam is nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service for prehydration prior to anticipated endovascular
repair on [**2103-1-29**]. The procedure was cancelled
secondary to the patient's elevated creatinine of 2.7. The
renal service was consulted. The impression was that they do
not feel that the patient was in ATN or had
glomerulonephritis based on the urine slide. AIN is possible
in the setting of new antibiotics with minimal WBCs on the
urine. There is concern that the renal ultrasound shows no
flow in the left kidney and there is no flow on it either on
[**2102-12-22**]. There most likely is a vascular etiology to
worsening renal function with possible prerenal etiology.
Urine lytes __________ suggest prerenal, but this was after
1.2 L of fluid. Recommendations at the time were to monitor
the creatinine, continue IV fluids, do a nuclear isotope
scan, monitor the LDH, hold off on surgery, and hold the
lisinopril.

His preoperative chest x-ray demonstrated small left lower
lobe changes. The pulmonary service was requested to review
the films and assess for increased respiratory risk for
planned procedure. They felt that this should not put him at
any increased risk from a pulmonary complication and would
continue his current COPD regimen.

The patient was continued on an IV bicarbonate drip and fluid
resuscitated with a steady improvement in his creatinine,
which on admission was 2.7, and by [**2103-2-2**] it was
1.4. The patient proceeded to angio for endovascular repair
of his thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The patient had an EVAR
with a TAG and coil embolization of the celiac artery. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the PACU in stable condition.

Postoperatively, the patient was weaned off of his vent. He
was followed by the pain service postoperatively. He was
transferred to the unit on [**2103-2-3**] for blood
pressure control and he was extubated at that time. His nitro
was weaned on postoperative day #1, and his diet was
advanced. His IV fluids were Hep-Locked. Subcu heparin was
instituted, and the patient was transferred to the SICU for
continued monitoring and care. His lumbar drain was
discontinued. His renal function continued to improve. On
postoperative day #2, there were no overnight events. Pain
was adequately controlled. His IV fluids were Hep-Locked.
Ambulation was begun, and physical therapy was requested to
evaluate the patient for discharge planning. The patient's
creatinine remained stable at 1.6 with good urinary output.
When medically stable, the patient will be discharged to home
with services for monitoring of his blood pressure.
