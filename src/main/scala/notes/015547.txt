Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87 year old
female with a past medical history of hypertension, coronary
artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
who was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
from an outside hospital with pneumonia complicated by a
myocardial infarction and sepsis.

The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**]
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-10-3**] with shortness of breath, cough
and pneumonia.  She then had an episode of hypotension in the
Emergency Room and was resuscitated with fluids.  She was
transferred to the floor, where she began complaining about
chest pain.  She had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
at [**Hospital3 3834**], where she received digoxin and
Lopressor.  With that, she became hypotensive again with
systolic blood pressure in the low 70s.

The patient's electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm
with nonspecific ST changes and a chest x-ray was significant
for a left lower lobe infiltrate.  Her cardiac enzymes were
elevated, with a CPK of 163, MB 12.3, index 7.5 and troponin
4.  An echocardiogram showed mitral regurgitation and left
ventricular ejection fraction of 70%.  The patient was
treated in the Intensive Care Unit with heparin and a
nitroglycerin drip.  She was given ceftriaxone but continued
to be hypotensive and was started on a Dopamine drip.

Swan catheterization was performed as well and showed a
cardiac output of 10 and systolic vascular resistance of 300.
The patient was then transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival here, the patient continued to
be hypotensive and required the use of multiple pressors,
including Dopamine, dobutamine and vasopressin.  Cardiac
enzymes continued to rise.  Her electrocardiogram was
significant for ST depressions in anterior and lateral leads.

The patient's respiratory status worsened as well.  The
patient was consulted extensively by the Medical Intensive
Care Unit team and refused intubation.  She also voiced her
desire to avoid resuscitation and intubation.  The [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, her daughter [**Name (NI) 14880**], confirmed the
patient's will.

The patient remained unintubated, on pressors and
antibiotics.  Over the course of the next 24 hours, she
continued to have chest pain and shortness of breath and was
made "Comfort Measures Only" per her and her family's
request.  Since [**2125-10-6**], the patient remained on
antibiotics, off pressors and on a morphine sulfate drip for
comfort.  She remained hypotensive over her course of stay in
the hospital.

DISPOSITION:  On [**2125-10-7**] at 1:15 p.m., the patient
had a cardiac arrest and died.  The chief cause of death was
a myocardial infarction and immediate cause was cardiac
arrest.  Time of death was 1:20 p.m. on [**2125-10-7**].
