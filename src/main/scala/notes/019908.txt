ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:  Parkinson's disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Legally blind with macular degeneration and retinitis
pigmentosa.
Chronic bronchitis.
Tracheobronchitis.
Tracheobronchomalacia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Additionally upon admission,
this is a 41-year-old man who had a difficult extubation
three years ago after hand surgery and was diagnosed with
tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has since had six stents
placed with a good initial result until larger stents were
needed.  The patient now has a tracheostomy and has no
significant relief with his last stent placed, which was in
[**2140-5-14**].  He now presents for a definitive
tracheobronchoplasty.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's preoperative CBC and BMP were
all stable, and the following labs were obtained.  CBC, white
blood cell count 8.8, hemoglobin 10.4, hematocrit 31,
platelets 210, serum sodium 142, potassium 4.0, chloride 107,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 6, creatinine 0.9, blood glucose 106,
calcium 8.1, magnesium 1.9, and phosphorus 4.1.

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO VANCOMYCIN, MORPHINE
SULFATE, DILAUDID, PENICILLIN, AND DARVOCET.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**8-3**], the patient went to the OR for
a removal of a previous stent and placement of a
tracheostomy.  The patient had tolerated the procedure very
well removal of the stent and went to the floor on
postoperative day one, had no problems, and was in no acute
distress.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and
was kept NPO overnight for a next morning swallow study.  The
patient was recommended to have a p.o. diet that was regular
consistent with solids and thin liquids; medications should
be hold with liquids.  The patient had a stable postoperative
course after the stent removal and was taken again to the OR
on [**8-7**], for definitive tracheobronchoplasty.  The patient
again tolerated the procedure very well, was transferred to
the ICU postoperatively, had no issues in the ICU, and was
again stable.  He was on a trachea mask for his oxygenation,
which was stable.  He had one episode of elevated temperature
while in the ICU.  He was C. Diff negative.  The patient had
epidural for pain control.  He was weaned off his trachea
mask.  His chest was clear to auscultation.  He had a
bronchoscopy on [**8-9**], that showed some fluid and mucus in
his airways, with copious secretions.  The patient did well
on the floor, had no untoward events.  After his
tracheoplasty his thoracotomy wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  His chest tube was removed on postoperative day 2.
He was restarted on his Sinemet on postoperative day two.
The patient had been on linezolid since first postoperative
day of his removal of the stent placement for what seemed to
be some copious and purulent secretions.  The patient was
allergic to vancomycin and that is why he was on PO
linezolid.  His Foley was discontinued on postoperative day
2.  We continued to follow cultures.  On postoperative day
two of his tracheobronchoplasty, the main issue was pain
control.  The patient initially had an epidural and then was
switched to a PCA for pain control.  The patient had a
Fentanyl PCA, because again he had multiple different
allergies to different pain medications.  He was
bronchoscoped again on [**8-11**], which showed some severe
malacia of his distal airways.  He still had some copious
purulent secretions and the trachea tube was seen to be in
accurate position and his floor course was good.
Neurologically, he was intact.  Cardiac, the patient was
regular rate and rhythm, but his chest had some coarse
rhonchi throughout bilaterally.  The patient had a central
line previously and that was discontinued.  The patient again
was bronchoscoped on [**8-12**], showing that trachea tube is
in good position.  He had a moderate amount of secretions and
on the left with some moderate malacia.  On the right he had
more severe malacia and some thick secretions.  The patient
was weaned to a smaller trachea tube and he was switched to
p.o. pain medication on postoperative day 4.  Again, all the
while he remained on linezolid.  The patient again was
bronchoscoped on [**8-13**], showed copious secretions on the
right side and the left which looked clear.  The trachea was
seen again to be in good position.  The patient had his
central line discontinued on the fifth postoperative day, had
a peripheral IV established and had a chest x-ray, where his
lungs looked pretty clear.  The patient was up mobilizing,
walking around, and desired to go outside.  His pain was
better controlled per the nursing staff.  Again, he had been
started previously on his Parkinson's drugs.  On
postoperative day 6, he was doing well.  His wounds again
were clear, dry, and intact.  He had less rhonchi.  He was
switched to a Fentanyl patch of 100 mcg and the patient did
well.  On postoperative day 7, the patient again had his
trachea tube changed to a number 6 Portex cuffless trachea
and had a bronchoscopy again that showed a moderate amount of
secretions on the right side.  The left was clear and some
other purulent secretions on the right.  The patient was
discharged on [**2140-8-15**], to stay in a hotel until [**2140-8-17**],
which is a Thursday.  He was to return again for bronchoscopy
and then return the following Monday on [**2140-8-22**], to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**] before going home to [**State 4565**].  Multiple calls were
made to the pharmacy in [**State 4565**] with respect to payment
for linezolid and they were awaiting and the case manager was
awaiting a call back from the medical director to ensure that
the patient would be covered for his PO linezolid when he
went home.  The patient went to a hotel on p.o. pain
medications, went out on antibiotics, specifically linezolid
and he was to restart all his prior medications, which
includes medications with respect to his Parkinson's disease,
GERD, and some other medications he took.  Previously
mentioned other past medical histories, the patient was MRSA
positive, hence the antibiotics.  He also had some left
sciatica.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] on
[**2140-8-22**].

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to a hotel.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to ad lib his
activity and diet.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  His medications are his previous home
medications along with the linezolid and a Fentanyl patch for
pain.
