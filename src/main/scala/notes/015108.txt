Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. Significant aortic stenosis is present
(not quantified). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Aortic stenosis (not quantified)

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-9-25**],
the findings are similar.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2136-10-18**]
12:48 PM
Final Report: Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has
apparently increased in size, although positional differences
may contribute to this apparent change.  Cardiac silhouette is
difficult to assess due to partial obscuration by the effusion.
Small-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion appears
similar to the prior study. Diffuse haziness within the imaged
portion of the upper abdomen suggests the possibility of
ascites, a finding that has been documented on prior abdominal
ultrasound of [**2136-10-8**].

Radiology Report VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of
[**2136-10-12**]
Final Report
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: A video oropharyngeal swallow study
was
performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow team.
Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered. There were
moderate-to-severe
residuals with all consistencies of liquid. While clearing the
residuals with thin liquids, there was penetration from the
residuals in the piriform sinuses. Penetration cleared with
coughing. There is no obvious aspiration visualized. Of note,
the patient was very fatigued from just a few swallows.
IMPRESSION:
1. Penetration from the residuals in the piriform sinuses.
2. No evidence of aspiration.
3. For complete report, please see speech and swallow note in
OMR.

Radiology Report ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT Study Date
of [**2136-10-8**] Final Report: The liver demonstrates no focal or
textural abnormality. There is no biliary dilatation. The common
duct measures 4 mm. The gallbladder does not contain stone.
There is no significant gallbladder wall thickening. A
moderate-sized abdominal ascites is present. The spleen measures
11 cm.  Normal hepatopetal flow is present within the portal
vein.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction. Moderate
abdominal ascites.




Brief Hospital Course:
Readmitted from ER [**9-24**] to CVICU for mgmt of CHF/fluid
overload. Pleural effusions noted. Fever and leukocytosis with
malodorous stools revealed C. diff. He was also noted to have a
pseudomonas UTI , rising creatinine. C. diff proved to be toxic
and he underwent total abdominal colectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**9-29**] and returned to OR  for ex. lap for mesenteric bleeding on
[**10-1**]. He was unstable and required multiple pressors to support
hemodynamica status. He slowly weaned from pressors. During his
post-op recovery he had bilateral chest tubes placed to drain
recurrent pleural effusions. After they were drained he slowly
weaned from the ventilator and was eventually extubated.  After
extubation he had a post pyloric feeding tube placed because he
failed a swallow examination. Also during this period he was
treated for acute on chronic renal failure and for
hypernatremia. On [**10-18**] he was noted to be desating he became
bradycardic, hypotensive and went into respiratory arrest. The
family deferred intubation  and he expired.
