Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 yo F with h/o PAF on coumadin who presents with
BRBPR and LLQ pain X 3 days. Her symptoms began Friday night
when she began to experience BRBPR with minimal amounts of loose
stools. This was associated with crampy LLQ > RLQ pain. Denies
n/v, melena, fevers. + chills. These symptoms continued until
Monday when the blood became less brisk with an increase in the
amount of loose stools. She attempted to keep well hydrated over
the weekend but began to feel increasingly lightheaded to the
point that she felt she may pass out if she stood up too
quickly. The pt has had BRBPR in the past [**2-20**] hemorrhoids but
reports those past episodes were not nearly as significant and
not accompanied by abdominal pain. She was recently started on a
baby ASA 1 week ago and also reports that her lasix dose was
increased 2 weeks ago. No recent antibiotics. Denies recent
change in diet, including increased ingestion of leafy, green
vegetables. She went to see her PCP today who noted her SBP to
be in the 90s (usual baseline 140s) and referred her to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt AF, BP 97/49, HR 61. Rectal exam significant only
for small amounts of dried blood in the vault, NGL was negative.
Labs were significant for WBC 15.2, Hct 43.5, BUN 31, Cr 2.0,
lactate 1.4, and INR 17.1. A CT abd/pelvis was significant for
pancolitis. She was given 2 units FFP, 10 mg IV vitamin K,
protonix 40 IV X 1, levaquin 750 mg IV X 1, flagyl 500 mg IV X
1, and a total of 3 L IVFs. Repeat INR 2.6. She remained
hemodynamically stable and did not have any episodes of BRBPR in
the ED in spite of having several BMs. She was then admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
ROS otherwise only positive for stable DOE. She is unable to

Brief Hospital Course:
# Bright red blood per rectum- Evidence of pancolitis on initial
CT, stool studies significant for c diff colitis.  Bleeding
stopped once INR was corrected.  GI was consulted and suggest a
colonoscopy in about 4 weeks, after colitis has had time to
improve.  Follow up scheduled with GI, VNA to check INR and hct
3 times per week.
.
# C Difficile colitis: Diarrhea improved on Flagyl, planned 14
day course.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Coumadin restarted prior to discharge
without GI bleed.  She was discharged on approx [**1-20**] the dose of
coumadin she was on prior to admission.  VNA to check INR 3
times per week.  Nutritionist saw pt to eduated re: food
restrictions while on coumadin.
.
# Falls/imbalance- Patient had a fall while in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU
overnight, and hit her head (likely on an open cabinet door
adjacent to the toilet), requiring 3 stitches for a laceration.
A CT head was obtained immediately after and showed no acute
hemorrhage. There had been no significant events on telemetry
and no indication of pacemaker malfunction. A CT spine was
obtained and the read showed no fracture, and her C-spine was
cleared. Approximately 12 hours later, a nurse observed the
patient to be extremely unsteady on her feet, somewhat
tremulous, and not as easily conversant as prior. A second CT
head was obtained and was negative for edema or new subdural.
The patient was observed overnight on fall precautions and there
were no further events, and her mental status was at baseline.
The attending radiologist later re-read the C-spine study and
notified the team that there was possible cervical cord
compression.
.
# Cervical Cord compression w/o radiculopathy: Possible C6-C7
cord compression based on CT cervical spine. No associated
neurologic deficits. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended
myelogram for further assessment. The family and patient chose
not to have the CT myelogram done.  They stated that they would
never opt for surgery, and if that was the only recommendation
to come out of CT myelogram, they felt there was no use for the
study.  Neurosurgery team confirmed this was in fact the case.
Family is aware that if symptoms develop, falls increase from
weakness, or any other concerns for symptomatic cord
compression, and they should see PCP immediately to discuss CT
myelogram and possible decompressive surgery.
.
#CKD, stage III: Pt in ARF at admission, resolved to baseline
creatinine of 1.3
.
#Chronic systolic heart failure: Past EF 20% per family, however
recent echo in [**2133**] with EF > 60%.  Pt was continued on
isosorbide, metoprolol, lasix.  Lisinopril was held as pt
noticed that she had a chronic cough that had resolved during
the hospitalization while off of Lisinopril.  Plan is to hold
off on restarting, note any cough symptoms at home, and follow
up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 weeks to discuss whether Lisinopril could in
fact be cause of cough.  Also will need to discuss whether
alternative [**Last Name (un) **] needed.  Digoxin was held at request of family.
No recent CHF exacerbations, most recent EF >60%, and pacer
interrogations show atrial fibrillation despite therapuetic
digoxin levels.  They asked to stop this because they were
concerned that it may be the cause of the patients chronic
diarrhea.  They are aware that they will need to follow up with
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding need to restart digoxin.
