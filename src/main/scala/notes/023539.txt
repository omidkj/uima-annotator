Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19130**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-8-23**] after a fall at her
[**Hospital3 **].  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic surgery
service and found to have a right hip fracture.  She was
admitted, consented, and prepped for surgery.  On [**2180-8-23**] she
was taken to the operating room and underwent a right hip
hemiarthroplasty.  She tolerated the procedure well, was
extubated, transferred to the recovery room, and then to the
floor.  On the floor she was seen by physical therapy to improve
her strength and mobility.  On [**2179-8-27**] she was seen by
speech/swallow evaluation and recommended a thin liquid with
moist ground solids and meds creshed with purees.  Geriatrics
was consulted for help in the post operative periods as Ms.
[**Known lastname 19130**] was refusing to take food.  The decreased oral intake was
thought to be due to delirum and dementia. On the day of
discharge she was taking good PO intake and was up out of bed
and into a chair most of the day.

The rest of her hospital stay was uneventful with her lab data
and vital sings within normal limits and her pain controlled.
She is being discharged today in stable condition.
