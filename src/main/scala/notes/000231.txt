Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, aspirin desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 68 yo M with history of asthma, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and AS who has had 3-4 days of crescendo angina.
The patient reports that starting on Friday afternoon he began
to have substernal crushing chest pain/tightness. This pain was
persistent and improved with rest, but persisted for the
duration of the day. He did not have shortness of breath,
dizziness or lightheadedness with this episode. The pain
recurred several more times over the weekend, usually resolving
with rest. The pains required him to stop the participitating
activities (working, dancing, snowshoveling). After chest
tightness on Monday, the patient called his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] recommended
going to the ER if the pain persisted, but if not, then the
patient was to come to the PCP's office in AM. The patient
reported to the PCP's office on tuesday AM. He was found to have
ST depressions and mild troponin elevation. Thus the patient was
sent directly to the ED (instead of the scheduled stress test).
The patient was given plavix 600 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg,
metoprolol 2.5 mg x2 IV and started on heparin gtt with bolus.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for aspirin
desentization.
.
On arrival the patient has no chest pain or dyspnea. He reports
no current symptoms including no chest pain, no shortness of
breath, no dizziness. He is hungry.
.
On review of systems, he has intermittent cough and occasional
dyspnea on exertion x last 5 months. Also patient has been
having exertional left leg pain over the last few months. He
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
.
Initial vitals at the OSH were not recorded, but BPs by EMS were
164/88, HR 74, RR 16, 02 98%.

Sinus rhythm.  Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave

The ST-T wave changes could be due in part to left ventricular
hypertrophy but are nonspecific and clinical correlation is
suggested
No previous tracing available for comparison


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with unstable angina no CP free for >12 hours who
presents as transfer for aspirin desentization prior to cardiac
catherization.
.
ACS: the patient presented with chest pain consistent with
unstable angina, mild troponin elevation and ECG changes make
NSTEMI more likely. Given ST changes and mild troponin
elevation, the likely cause of the chest pain was CAD.  Heparin
gtt, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin were started.  The
patient was desensitized to aspirin as below.  He was taken to
the cath lab.  The large dominant LCX had mild non-obstructive
disease proximally. The small non-dominant RCA had a 90%
proximal stenosis. Two bare metal stents were placed, with good
result.  He will continue full dose ASA and Plavix x 1 month and
low dose ASA 81 mg thereafter.
.
Aortic stenosis/sclerosis: By history it was unclear whether he
had aortic stenosis vs aortic sclerosis.  On catheterization
there was no transaortic pressure gradient.  Despite this, valve
area on echo was 1.0-1.2 cm2.
.
Aspirin desentization: Patient reported an asthmatic reaction to
aspirin. Aspirin desensitization was undertaken with
premedication with singulair and prednisone. The patient
subsequently tolerated 325 mg aspirin daily without evidence of
bronchospasm or other adverse reaction
.
Hypertension: The patient was initially hypertensive and was
treated with low-dose nitro gtt.  This was transitioned to
metoprolol after ASA desensitization was complete.  Patient
continued to be hypertensive with SBP ~200.  An ACE inhibitor
was added, and SBP fell to 140-150. Further optimization of BP
was deferred to PCP.
.
Hyperlipidemia: Lipids were well controlled on labs at OSH.
High-dose atorvastatin was started for NSTEMI, to continue
indefinitely.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Aspirin allergy
Non-st elevation MI

Secondary: hypertension


Discharge Condition:
Improved, no chest pain


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a heart attack and were desensitized from
aspirin.  You also had a stent placed in one of your coronary
arteries.  Thus you are on new medications for your coronary
artery disease.

Your new medications include:
Aspirin, plavix, lisinopril and lipitor 80 mg.
You are not taking simvastatin for now.

You must take plavix for at least one month, but DO NOT stop
taking it until speaking with a cardiologist.  Additionally you
should never
