Brief Hospital Course:
Shortly after her procedure, the patient experienced some left
sided chest pain at which point sublingual nitroglycerin was
administered without effect and an EKG was performed which was
essentially normal. She remained in the PACU overnight for
observation and received 40mg IV lasix for fluid overload on
CXR. She was brought the floor in stable condition and
maintaining her oxygen saturation well. She ultimately received
3 sets of cardiac enzymes which were negative. After this
episode, her pain was actually significantly improved and she
did very well. She was started on her home medications on POD 1
and advanced to clears. On POD 2 she was tolerating clears well
and was advanced to a regular diet. By POD 3 she was tolerating
this well and her pain was under control, she was discharged in
stable condition on a regular (nissen modified) diet with close
follow up.
