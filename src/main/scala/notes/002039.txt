Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Healing abdominal wound s/p right colectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p right hemicolectomy and a right inguinal
herniorrhaphy.
s/p Small bowel resection, drainage of a
pelvic abscess, debridement of the anterior abdominal wall in
the left lower quadrant and an ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
The patient initially presented with a positive Hemoccult.
Following which he underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a
cecal mass with high-grade dysplasia. On [**2135-5-5**] he underwent
an extended right colectomy and a right inguinal hernia repair.
His postoperative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak.
 A drain was placed on [**5-16**] and the patient was D/Cd on [**5-20**].
The patient developed fever to 100.4 and was readmitted on [**5-21**]
with a RLL pneumonia.  He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn
but continued to have recurrent fevers.  He was evaluated by
hematology for a WBC ct. >150K, they stated this was due to a
leukomoid reaction on top of his underlying MDS.  On [**5-21**] he
developed SOB which CXR revealed to be due to CHF he was
diuresed with Lasix.  On [**5-30**] he had a ex lap with small bowel
resection, drainage of pelvic abscess, debridement of abdominal
wall and ileostomy.  Post-op he was admitted to the SICU for
management of his low urine output/ARF.  Repeat imaging has
revealed that the abscess has decreased in size.  He was
transferred out of the SICU on [**6-4**].  His improving CHF,
decreasing WBC, and absence of fevers have enabled the patient
to be surgically cleared and his care has been transferred to
medicine.

Brief Hospital Course:
ID:
While on the medicine service the patient remained afebrile and
his white blood cell count continued to decrease.  He completed
an 18 day course of vancomycin to treat sputum cultures which
grew oxacillin resistant staph aureus.  He also completed a 14
day course of zosyn.His abcess grew beta lactamase positive
Bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
The patient's antibiotics were then discontinued and the patient
remained afebrile without leukocytosis until [**6-14**] when pt
developed a temperature to 101.9.  CT imaging of his abdomen
revealed multiple abcesses and thus the patient completed a 5
day course of IV vanc/cipro/flagyl/fluconazole during which time
his abscess resolved without the need for drainage by IR.

Cardiovascular:
While recovering from surgery the patient developed congestive
heart failure.  An echo was performed and it demonstrated no
significant changes since his last echo in [**2131**].  The patient
has a history of hypertension and was continued on lisinopril 40
mg qd.  He quickly responds to Lasix for chest pressure d/t CHF.

Volume Status:
At first the patient had a great deal of anasarca with an
albumin of 2.2.  The patient responded well to IV lasix and upon
discharge his peripheral edema was much improved.  His albumin
on D/C remained at 2.2, with a goal of 3.0.

Nutrition
The patient has had a long convalesence marked by poor po intake
resulting a low albumin which contributed to his peripheral
edema. In order to address this the patient's po intake was
supplemented with TPN in order to ensure adequate calories.  TPN
was supplemented with standard electrolytes, 10U insulin, 10mg
zinc, and 40mg Famotidine.  On D/C, we are holding Phos and Mg
until these electrolytes normalize.

Pulmonary: CT scan of the thorax on [**6-15**] revealed bilateral
pleural effusions, bilateral  lower lobe atelectasis and small
percardial effusion. Using incentive spirometer. The patient's
pulmonary status improved with gentle diuresis along with the
use of incentive spirometer.

Anemia: The patient last received 1 U pRBCs on [**6-6**] with
appropriate bump in HCT. From then on his HCT remained
approximately 30. His anemia was believed to be secondary to his
myelodysplastic syndrome.

ITP: The patient has a history of ITP and was thus continued on
20 mg of prednisone qod with an increase to 20 mg qd when the
patient was febrile to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  Hold all
heparin.

Dispostion: Since his fever on [**6-15**], the patient has remained
afebrile and continues to improve.  He has been cleared by both
physical therapy and general surgery to begin acute physical
therapy and rehabilitation.  He is clear for transfer to [**Hospital 7825**] center in Woodburne.
