History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29876**] is a 74-year-old gentleman with multiple medical
problems who
underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2166-6-12**]
complicated by a sternal dehiscence and sternal wound infection
requiring sternal debridement omental flap and skin graft
followed by pectus advancement flap. This was complicated by a
large abdominal incisional hernia and persistent drainage tracks

along the sternal wound. His incisional hernia has grown in size

since his omental harvest and he has undergone further
debridements of his draining sinus tracts as well as bone
excision for persistent osteomyelitis. Additionally, he comes in

with a right scrotal mass which is consistent with a
spermatocele.

On chest exam, he has a visibly pulsatile heart underneath a
sternal skin graft with 2 drainage tracts, one on the right side

of the flap and one on the left side of the flap with
granulation
tissue. He has no neck, axillary, groin, or supraclavicular
adenopathy. He has got very distant breath sounds but, there are

no wheezes or rales. His heart is regular rate and rhythm
currently. On abdominal exam, he has a large, herniating
incisional hernia with reducible bowel. He has no tenderness,
rebound, or guarding. His rectal exam is heme negative. He has a

4 x 6 cm mass in his right scrotum and no inguinal bulges
consistent with a hernia can be appreciated. His extremities are

warm with pitting edema +1

POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-11

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt.[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by reintubation after
surgery for respiratory failure.  Neurologically he had some
confusion post-operatively and a non-contrast head CT was done
on POD 7 to rule out any acute bleed or stroke and it was
negative.  On discharge he is on PRN Haldol and no pain
medication.  Cardiovascularly he was stable in sinus rhythm
throughout his hospitalization.  He is on Lopressor 100 [**Hospital1 **].
From a pulmonary standpoint he had respiratory failure and
hypercarbia post-op.  He did not tolerate a ventilatory wean and
a tracheosotmy was performed on [**8-26**].  A bronchoscopy at that
time showed copious white secretions.  Trials of pressure
support were unsuccesful.  A CTA of the chest on [**8-19**] was
negative for a PE. His CXR on [**8-31**] shows bibasilar atelectasis
and a small l. pleural effusion.  He had routine return of bowel
function and is tolerating goal tube feeds and 1 liter of free
water a day via Dobhoff tube which is post-pyloric on film. His
renal function is at baseline with a creatinine of 0.7 and he is
getting PRN lasix to maintain euvolemia.  He had no venous
lines, a foley catheter and a dobhoff tube.  He is on ten more
days of Linezolid for a history of being MRSA positive with a
sternal wound infection and chronically draining sinus.  He also
has MRSA in his sputum.  He was on a course of Levofloxacin and
Vanco for Citerobacter in his urine and MRSA in his sputum.  His
most recent urine culture was preliminarily negative and he is
c. diff negative.  Hematologically he has been stable but he was
anemic and required PRBC transfusion on 2 occasions.  He was
started on iron and epogen.  His HCT is stable at 30.  He is
being maintained on Heparin for anti-coagulation.  He had a RUE
U/S which showed no DVT. He requires tight blood sugar control
and will need QID finger sticks until his NPH regimen is
titrated to goal.
