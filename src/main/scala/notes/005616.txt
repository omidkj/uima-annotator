Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
male who has a history of diabetes mellitus and was in good
health until [**2133-9-9**] when he presented to [**Hospital6 3873**] with right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  He
underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**9-10**] that
showed a gangrenous gallbladder.  On postoperative day one he
had a non ST elevation myocardial infarction and was started
on aspirin, Lopressor and Lisinopril.  He was also found to
be in congestive heart failure and diuresed.  He subsequently
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2133-9-14**], which
showed the right coronary artery to have 80% stenosis, left
circumflex with 95% stenosis and left anterior descending
coronary artery with 80 to 90% stenosis.  He was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus while at [**Hospital6 3873**], but with diet controlled diabetes at home.
2.  History of gout.
3.  He is status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction
on [**2133-9-11**].
4.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gangrenous
gallbladder on [**2133-9-10**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a former
smoker having smoked one pack per day for fourteen years, but
quit forty years ago and he drinks beer occasionally.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a pleasant, well developed, well
nourished male in no acute distress.  Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2.  Heart rate of 69.  Blood pressure
116/60.  Respirations 18.  Oxygen saturation 99% on room air.
HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Upper and lower dentures.
Neck is supple with no JVD.  No bruits.  Carotid pulses are
2+ bilaterally.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm without
murmur.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Laparoscopic wounds are healing well.  Extremities showed no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He is right hand dominant.  His
left [**Doctor Last Name **] test is negative.  His dorsalis pedis pulses are
1+ bilaterally.  Posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Radial artery pulses are 2+ bilaterally.  The neurological
examination shows him to be alert and oriented times three
and is grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17,
hematocrit 37.2, platelet 588,000, PT 13.7, INR 1.3, sodium
136, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 27, BUN 24,
creatinine .8, blood glucose 131.  Liver function tests were
all within normal limits.  His admission chest x-ray showed a
__________ in the right hemidiaphragm with question of
effusion on the right side.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  Over the following days he continued to
have an elevated white blood cell count in the 16 to [**Numeric Identifier 6085**]
range and thus his bypass surgery was delayed.  He had
cultures sent with urine and blood cultures both being
negative.  Because he did have this persistent white count
there was some concern that this could be residual from his
gangrenous gallbladder and that the surgical team was
consulted.  He did receive an abdominal CT scan, which showed
fluid in the gallbladder fossa, which may signify an abscess.
He then had the fluid aspirated by ultrasound with ultrasound
guidance and it was sent for culture and sensitivity with
gram stain.  The fluid showed 1056 white cells with [**Pager number **] red
blood cells and 95% PMNs.  His gram stain eventually was
negative as was the culture.  The infectious disease service
was also consulted and they felt that the Flagyl and Levaquin
were adequate coverage and he was therefore continued on the
antibiotics.  Over the following four days his white blood
cell count progressively decreased and on the day prior to
surgery was 11.4000.  The remainder of his laboratories were
within normal limits and he was prepared for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  On [**2133-9-25**] he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times three to the left internal
mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, endoscopically harvested saphenous vein
graft to the right coronary artery and another endoscopically
harvested vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The surgery was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
PA-C as assistants.  The surgery was performed under general
endotracheal anesthesia with the cardiopulmonary time of 85
minutes and cross clamp time of 54 minutes.

The patient was transferred to the CTIU intubated and sedated
on Propofol with two atrial pacing wires and two mediastinal
chest tubes.  Throughout the operative night the patient was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated without incident.
On the morning of postoperative day one the patient was
slightly hypotensive and did require neo-synephrine drip.  He
also was noted to have elevated blood sugars and was started
on insulin protocol.  He remained in the Intensive Care Unit
through postoperative day number three as he did require an
insulin drip to control blood sugars.  He was started on
postoperative day number three on sliding insulin scale and
he was able to be transferred to Far Two.  He was begun with
aggressive physical therapy and continued to progress well.
His pacing wires were discontinued without incident as were
his chest tubes.  It was felt at this point that he is ready
to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE EXAMINATION:  His lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen had positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities showed no edema.  His wounds are
clean, dry and intact and his sternum is stable with his
clips in place.

DISCHARGE LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 7.1,
hematocrit 26.6%, platelet count of 302,000, sodium 137,
potassium 5.0, chloride 98, CO2 27, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1,
blood glucose 145.  His liver function tests are all within
normal limits.  Discharge chest x-ray showed small bilateral
effusions with minimal atelectasis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft times three with left
internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, endoscopically harvested
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and
endoscopically harvested saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopresor 25 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. times seven days.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po b.i.d. times
seven days.
6.  Percocet one to two tabs po q 4 hours prn pain.
7.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. prn.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
four weeks.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13175**] in four weeks and with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in four to six weeks.
