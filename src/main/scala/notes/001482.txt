Chief Complaint:
Tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, with tracheal stenosis dilated with 10mm scope,
right brochus intermedius stent removed, LUL orifice dilated w/
4mm baloon


History of Present Illness:
78 yo woman with h/o idiopathic tracheobronchial malacia with
tracheostomy tube placed over 2 years ago, s/p left main stem
bronchus stent (c/b bronchial tear causing pneumomediastinum)
and s/p right main stem stent (which was removed and replaced
with silicone stent on [**4-16**]). Also had repositioning of [**Last Name (un) 295**]
trach tube repositioned in [**4-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well.

She was admitted to RIH [**6-15**] with fever, fatigue, and diarrhea.
She was previously treated with antibiotics as an outpatient for
tracheobronchitis. Was found to have C. diff and was treated
with flagyl. Was treated for 2 weeks with diflucan for yeast in
sputum and urine. Spiked temp on [**7-8**] and BCs (from line only)
and central line tip grew pansens pseudomonas. Line resited
[**7-9**]- lt subclavian. Zosyn started [**7-8**] and has been afebrile
since. Patient has been stable with occasional episodes of
bronchospasm that responds to nebs, vent support, and ativan.

She was fist bronched early in course where per report they
found dynamic airways, some airway edema, and stent in Lt main
stem and in trachea. Treated with steroids with small
improvement. Bronch repeated [**7-1**] when realized that right main
stem stent had likely migrated into trachea. Therefore, she was
sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy and possible stent replacement.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 yo woman with idiopathic tracheobronchial malacia with a
migrated right main stem bronch stent here for bronchoscopy.

1. Tracheobronchial malacia.  Bronched on  [**7-13**] am.  Notable for
a tracheal stenosis superior to stoma which wad dilated with a
10 mm scope.  Right stent in trachea removed.  Severe
granulation tissue bilaterally.  LUL was ballooned, now 4mm.
Continue atrovent, prn albuterol, prednisone (dose decreased).
Changed to decadron in anticipation of [**Last Name (un) **] stim test which was
ordered for [**7-14**].  Of note, steroids had initially been started
in [**2156**] for history of PMR.  Has been on them since then given
the pulmonary issues.  Will try to wean them as tolerated and
can be further titrated as an outpatient.

2. VENT- Tried PSV but RR decreased to [**3-16**] so back on PCV. Sats
OK and stable.  Consider trial of trach masks if tolerates. NIF
was max 20, then 12 ? deconditioned.

3. C. Diff- Recheck stool for c. diff, although toxin may still
persist. Continue flagyl while on Abx. If diarrhea doesn't
improve may need to consider po vanco. Followed. Had increasing
WBC to 20, but no inc stool output, fever, chills, and on
steroids. Spoke w/ resident at RIH - will follow

4. Pseudomonas Line infection- On zosyn day 5. line re-sited
[**7-9**]. Rechecked blood cultres times one were negative to date.
Culture if spikes. Follow fever/WBC.

5. HTN- continued on  BB, ACEI

6. CAD- continue BB.

7. hyperchol- cont zocor

8. Anemia- check iron studies and guiac stool. Has been in high
20s at OSH and got at least 1U PRBCs during that admission. T &
S.  S/p 1 unit of pRBCs on [**7-13**] with appropriate bump.

9. CHF- EF 45%. Continue lasix 40 qd. Strict I & O. resume
cardiac/low salt diet.

10. Depression- On zoloft

11. FEN: Watch fluid status given the history of CHF.

12. T/L/D- left sublcal place [**7-9**]. PIVs.

13. PPX- PPI, sq heparin. RISS while on prednisone.
