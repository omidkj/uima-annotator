Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, diaphoresis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
PCI to RCA

History of Present Illness:
74F with hx of recent right TKR on Lovenox presents with STEMI.
She states that around 4:30am, she had been up watching TV and
didn't feel herself. She walked to the bathroom and found
herself very pale and diaphoretic. She started feeling dizzy and
nauseous. BP checked by the nurses and found to be 60/40 with a
heart rate of 40. EMS was called and on arrival, did EKG that
showed 2mm ST elevations in II, III, aVF. She was given ASA
325mg and NTG x 1 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival to the
ER, she received 600mg plavix and was started on integrillin and
heparin gtts. Vitals were stable at 12/69 with heart rate of 98,
satting 96% on 2L. Of note, pt only notes slight chest pressure
on the way the hospital. In the ER, she was noted to have
transient Wenckebach, with heart rate of 42.
.
Pt was take to the cath lab, arriving at 6:15am. There she was
found to have a totally occluded RCA and a cypher stent was
placed. LVgram showed an EF of 55%. right heart cath showed RA
mean of 17mmHg, RV 47/11 with end diastolic of 20mmHg, PAP 46/18
(33) and wedge of 23; CO 3.11 (CI 1.74)
.
On arrival to the CCU, pt felt well, no chest pain, shortness of
breath, pain.
.
On ROS, pt denies PND, orthopnea, lower ext swelling. She
normally exercises daily, swimming one mile per day (but not
since [**Month (only) 404**] due to her knee). She wears O2 at night due to
sleep apnea and chronic hypoxia due to her hernia (lung did not
expand following her hernia surgery). Also with recent pain in
right ankle, treated as cellulitis with keflex and then
ceftriaxone when it failed to improve. now much better

Pertinent Results:
Initial EKG (at 5:30a) demonstrated NSR at 65 bpm, normal axis,
prolonged PR, ST elevations in II, III, and aVF (4mm in III, 3mm
in II and aVF) with 1mm ST elevation in V1, ST depressions in I,
aVL. Right sided EKG showed 2mm ST elevation in V4
.
EKG following cath showed NSR at 80, nl axis, small Q waves in
III, aVF
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**12/2129**] demonstrated:
LA is normal in size. No ASD or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Mild
symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No AR. MV appears structurally normal
with trivial MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] mitral valve prolapse. Mod PA systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2130-4-25**] demonstrated:
LVgram: EF 55%, mild MR
[**Name13 (STitle) **] normal with modest calcification
LAD: modest calcification with mild luminal irregularities
LCx: non-dominant vessel with mid-segment 80% lesion in AVG
RCA: dominant vessel with mid-segment 99% lesion with noted
thrombus s/p 3.0 x 18 cypher stent; final residual was 0% with
normal flow
.
L groin US [**4-25**]:
Communicating with the left common femoral artery, there is a
2.1 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm pseudoaneurysm that contains two-third of
thrombosed clot with a one- third residual lumen with flow. A
0.3 cm neck is visualized communicating with the common femoral
artery.
.
L groin US [**4-27**]:
Scans through the left groin now show a residual hematoma
measuring 2.4 x 2.8 x 1.1 cm. There is no flow within the
hematoma, and there has been complete thrombosis of the
previously shown pseudoaneurysm.
.
RLE US [**4-25**]:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst within the right popliteal fossa.
.
TTE [**2130-4-29**]:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with basal
inferior hypokinesis (EF 50-55%). The other segments appear to
contract well, although they are only visualized in the
short-axis view. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal hypokinesis
of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.  IMPRESSION:
Mild regional left and right systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Technically limited study. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2130-1-9**], left and right ventricular regional
systolic dysfunction are new.


Brief Hospital Course:
74F with hx of HTN who presents with dizziness, diaphoresis and
nausea found to have acute inferior STEMI due to totally
occluded RCA now s/p cypher stent. Course c/b groin hematoma.
.
1) CAD/STEMI: The patient initially had symptoms of dizziness,
diaphoresis, nausea, she was found to be hypotensive and EMS was
called. The initial EKG demonstrated ST elevations in inferior
leads II, III, an aVF.  A right sided EKG showed ST elevations
on V4r indicating a likely RV infarct.  She was given ASA,
plavix, heparin and integrillin and taken urgently to the cath
lab.  She was found to have 2VD with a 90% lesion in the distal
LAD and a 95% occlusion of the mRCA. A cypher stent was deployed
to the mRCA lesion.  She was monitored in the CCU given risk of
hypotension and bradycardia following RV infarct.  She was
asymptomatic following catheterization.  She remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was continued on ASA and plavix
which she will need for 1 year.  Her integrillin was stopped due
to a groin hematoma as discussed below. Once her groin hematoma
stablized she was restarted on lovenox.  The patient has a know
allergy to lipitor and crestor, therefore, she was started on
pravastatin as this statin has a lower occurence of side
effects. She tolerated this well. Initially her
antihypertensives were held in light of her low cardiac output
and recent wenckebach.  When her cardiac profile improved, she
was restarted on her beta-blocker, aspirin, and plavix. She has
an outpatient appointment with her cardiologist to follow up.
.
2) Groin hematoma:  Post-cath the patient was noted to have a
left groin hematoma so her integrillin was stopped.  A stat
groin US showed a small 2x2cm pseudoaneurysm that was [**1-14**]
thrombosed.  A pressure dressing was applied and her hematoma
remained stable.  Her hematocrit was stable at 24 (down from
baseline of 35), the patient refused transfusion. A second groin
US showed no flow in the pseudoaneurysm and complete thrombosis.
A residual hematoma was noted and stable.
