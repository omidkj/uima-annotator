Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST
Interval development of multiple predominantly upper lobe,
poorly defined
nodules, some of which demonstrate central lucency, possibly
reflecting
cavitation or a bronchogram given motion artifact. The
differential diagnosis
includes invasive Aspergillus, nocardia, and septic emboli.
Striking, diffuse, bilateral dependent areas of ground glass
opacity which
spare the anterior/nondependent portions of the lungs and are
associated with
bronchial dilation. The distribution is suggestive of ARDS,
which may
complicate infection. Diffuse atypical infection and drug
toxicity are also in
the differential diagnosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was treated in the ICU for difficulty maintaining adequate
oxygen saturation.  Pt's family chose to make patient DNR/DNI
