CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2178-3-1**]): The patient has had median
sternotomy. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Mild
interstitial abnormality, if acute, could be due to mild
pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No free air is seen below the diaphragm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to the vascular surgery service.
He received a dose of Mucomyst in preparation for planned
angiography on HD #2. However, he began to feel "ill" and
nauseated, though he did not have any emesis. This was
associated with diaphoresis and lightheadedness. He stood to
walk to the bathroom, but felt worse and rang for the RN, who
found the patient with a heart rate in 180s and SBP in the 60s.
An ECG was performed, and showed a wide complex tachycardia with
RBBB morphology. Cardiology was called, who recommended DCCV.
Patient was loaded with amiodarone 150 IV x 2 without effect. He
was then successfullly cardioverted with 150 J and transferred
to the CCU.
.
In the unit, a repeat ECG showed NSR with an underlying LBBB &
frequent PVCs. He denied chest pain, SOB, n/v, or diaphoresis.
He remained somewhat hypotensive, but was mentating well. He was
started on pressor support. He was also continued on his regimen
of ASA, Plavix, and pravachol. B-blocker and ACE-I were
initially held for hypotension, but were gradually introduced
after pressors were weaned off. Cardiac biomarkers were
monitored and were mildly elevated, thought to represent strain
secondary to his tachycardia vs cardioversion. A primary
ischemic event was thought unlikely. He was monitored on
telemetry, which initially showed frequent PVCs with several
runs of hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic NSVT. However,
the frequency of his PVCs and NSVT rapidly decreased within the
first several days of hospitalization.
.
He was evaluated by the electrophysiology service on HD #2, and
taken for an EP study on HD #3. A VT ablation was attempted, but
was unsuccessful. He was taken back to the EP lab on HD #4 for
placement on an ICD, which he tolerated well. He was discharged
home on HD #5 in stable condition with plans to follow up for
peripheral angiography at a later date.
