ANESTHESIA:  General.

HISTORY:  This elderly male with significant comorbidities of
severe coronary artery disease, having had an acute episode
with stenting in [**2108-1-9**], now on Plavix, and
additionally having a chronic course of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
which is requiring large steroid doses, presented to the
emergency department in transfer from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, having
had a history of approximately 2 weeks of lower abdominal
pain, which got dramatically worse during the night, awakened
him from sleep.  His wife took him to the [**Name (NI) 8125**] Hospital where
he was generally unstable.  They immediately determined that
they would transfer him to [**Hospital1 **] after a CAT
scan revealed that he had massive free air.  The patient also
is quite obese.  He additionally had a large epigastric
hernia which was resulting from his sternotomy from previous
cardiac surgery.  This, under CT, had evidence of the
transverse colon being in it, but it did not appear to be
incarcerated.  The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] appeared to be opened prior to
surgery.  There was little inflammatory reaction, but a large
amount of air in the retroperitoneum as well as in the
abdomen.

At surgery he was found to have a fecal peritonitis, with
ruptured abscess in the descending colon.  There was
obviously a ruptured diverticulitis, which had created a well
walled off abscess that extended up the descending colon
mesentery, into the splenic hilum.  Consideration was to do a
diverting transverse loop colostomy. However, the size of the
abscess was rather dramatic and attempting to drain this
laterally we actually got feculent material out of it, actual
fecal matter and so therefore it was felt that we really
needed to resect this area.  With that the left colon was
mobilized.  This abscess extended all the way up in the
splenic hilum, and in the course of mobilization of the
splenic hilum had some bleeding, ultimately necessitating
splenectomy, although initially we tried to control this with
argon beam and packing.  Because the left colon was still
involved, the patient had the left hemicolectomy, with the
sigmoid colon transected at the region of the high rectum,
mid-sigmoid area, which was free from any inflammatory
process.  Because of the large abscess the colon was actually
removed along the colon itself to avoid injury to the
ureters.  The abscesses were drained out diffusely.  Upon
coming around to the middle colic artery, taking down the
left branch of the middle colic, we got into good bowel with
no more abscess.  At that point it was decided we would
transect and pass the specimen off.  Turning back attention
to the splenic hilum, it was bleeding and therefore, he had
the splenectomy additionally.

Additionally, the patient had a recurrent ventral hernia with
Marlex mesh, which was actually intraperitoneal, attached to
the left lateral costal margin.  This was excised and fascia
was mobilized, so that we could actually effect epigastric
closure primarily.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Under adequate general
endotracheal anesthesia, following a 4 liter bolus with
central line getting therapy getting a CVP up to 4, the
patient was brought urgently to the operating theatre, where
he was placed under general anesthesia.  A midline incision
was created and upon entering the abdomen and observing the
incredible amount of retroperitoneal process, this was
extended superiorly and inferiorly to allow complete midline
incision.  The patient had a significant obesity, making this
exposure difficult.  At this point then attention was turned
to the large amount of pus in the left gutter.  The mid
descending colon actually had a rather prominent hole in it,
which was perforated  on the mesentery.  The mesentery
perforated freely into the abdominal cavity.  This large
abscess cavity extended up along the descending mesentery,
and into the splenic hilum retropancreatic as well.  Based on
that it was elected upon trying to drain this that we were
going to be unsuccessful, once we recognized all the fecal
matter that was in it.  Based on this the sigmoid was
identified and found to be without any inflammation in the
midportion and distally.  It was transected with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] at
that point, we simply took colon out along the level of the
secondary arcades, through most of the way up around the
left.  Attempts at mobilizing the splenic flexure and
draining this retroperitoneal abscess up around the pancreas
yielded some bleeding off the inferior pole of the spleen, as
well as behind the spleen.  This was initially controlled
with argon beam and packing, as the colectomy was completed.
Vascular pedicles were controlled throughout the case with 2-
0 silk ligatures in continuity, followed by 2-0 silk suture
ligature to the vesse
