History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 82 y/o M with h/o acute cholecystitis on [**6-17**]
which was accompanied by a STEMI epsiode.A cholecystotomy tube

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the West 3 service on [**2-6**] and kept
NPO, on IVF with a foley for UOP monitoring, and on unasyn with
IV pain control. His home meds were started and he was placed on
an ISS for blood sugar mgmt. He had an abdominal US which
showed: Gallbladder sludge. Evidence of air within the
gallbladder lumen; may be result of prior procedure. Air was
also seen in the gallbladder on CT from [**2165-7-19**]. No biliary
dilatation.
 - [**2-8**] his foley was d/ced and he voided. His diet was advanced
to a clears, diabetic diet.
 - [**2-9**] his IVF were heplocked after adequate PO intake.
 - [**2-10**] his ranitidine was changed to IV PPI. He also was
restarted on IVF and got a 500 cc IVF bolus for concern for c
diff and increased WBC with decreased UOP. His Unsyn was
switched to zosyn and vancomycin.He had a CT of the abdomen and
pelvis which showed: Findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis,
with associated bile leak causing large hepatic sub-capsular
biloma, with adjacent secondary inflammation of the ascending
colon and hepatic flexure.
 - [**2-11**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] had his CCY with biloma drainage. He was then
Admitted to TICU post-op. OR: 3500 LR, 7 PRBC, 4 FFP, 1 PLTs/
[**Age over 90 **] F EBL 3500. PACU: 2 FFP, 2 PRBC. total of 3 Liters bolused
post-op for low UOP. Given addition 2 PRBC in ICU. L axillary
line ([**Last Name (un) 18821**]). Bedside echo performed, demonstrates poor EF
without evidence of fluid overload.
- [**2-12**]: Transfused 1 unit PRBCs, started on dobutamine gtt for
low SBP despite levophed. On serial echos, EF and volume
overload worsening. Renal consulted, feels CRRT not currently
indicated. JP#2 with high output and HCT down - HCT on JP fluid
pending.
- [**2-13**]: s/p transfusion 1 unit platelets for platelets 79, bumped
to 98. RIJ cordis switched to dialysis catheter. Packed by ENT.
Cardiology recs: consider swan, transfuse hct > 25. Renal:
volume status acceptable, plan CVVH 'shortly'. Bedside echo
showed mildly improved cardiac function.
- [**2-14**]: Off pressors in AM. CPAP 5/5. Vanc 17 in AM(holding), PM
Vanc=15. Nutrition consult for TF's (likely to start [**2-15**]).
Renal: trial of lasix goal 1 L negative over 24 hr, lasix gtt
started. bedside Echo: fluid overloaded EF~35%. ENT
cauterized/packed epistaxis.
- [**2-15**]: Abx changed to levo/flagyl/vanc per ID recommendations,
started albuterol/atrovent MDI for wheezing. Good diuresis, but
worsening cardiac output; bolused with albumin with improvement.
Lasix gtt stopped, CXR much improved.
- [**2-16**]: Extubated. ID recommended changing antibiotics
meropenem/vancomycin (-[**2-21**]). Levo/flagyl d/c'd ([**Date range (1) 75508**]). No
HSQ, aspirin, plavix, or TFs today (TFs likely to start
tomorrow) per primary team. D/c'd insulin gtt. Vanc trough 16.5.
KUB pending for abdominal pain.
- [**2-17**]: SCH started. Off albuterol. changed protonix to
famotidine. Auto-diuresing (goal 1.5 L negative). HD line
d/c'ed. Dobhoff placed, written to start TF's when post-pyloric.

- [**2-18**]: IR-guided post-pyloric DHT placed, Na increasing, so
free water DHT flushes initiated (250ml 6). Pt delirious;
started on zyprexa. Diuresing w/ lasix, with worsened metabolic
acidosis. 500ml free H2O given via DHT. Continued agitation,
started zyprexa. Metabolic acidosis improving, but hypernatremia
worsening.
- [**2-19**]: discontinued diuresis. Started standing tylenol and
oxycodone, off zyprexa, cont'd seroquel, changed famotidine to
omeprazole per [**Female First Name (un) **] recs. Sent urine cx as part of delirium
work-up. Free water in all meds and flushes, and stopped NaHCO3
and increased free water flush via Dobhoff to Q4H from Q6H for
hypernatremia. (Renal aware and OK with that.) IV Lopressor
changed to metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Had [**Month (only) **] UOP but Foley kinked,
improved with opening.
- [**2-20**]: free water flush q6h from q4h. PT consult; OOB/IS. d/c
a. line. Home dose lantus 15 qAM. Vanc decreased to 750 for
trough of 19. Decreased standing oxycodone to 5Q6H and dereased
IV dilaudid. Dobhoff self dc'ed. Replaced, TF's held until AM
when can be positioned post-pyloric. Started D5W@50 and required
D50 for hypoglycemia as he is on lantus.
- [**2-21**]: Transferred to floor under Dr. [**Last Name (S
