**FINAL REPORT [**2176-3-11**]**
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2176-3-11**]):    No MRSA isolated.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2176-3-9**] 11:35 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Essentially unchanged size of the large left temporal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
2. Interval mild increase of peri-hemorrhagic edema, with
increase of the
effacement of the left lateral ventricle. A new 2-mm rightward
shift of
midline structures.
3. No new hemorrhage or developing hydrocephalus.

Final Attending Comment:
The wedge shaped configuration of the hypodensity in the left
parietal lobe suggests that this represents hemorrhagic
transformation of an infarct.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2176-3-12**] 3:31 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-10**], the Dobbhoff tube
and pacemaker device remains in place. Moderate enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette is again seen without evidence of
vascular congestion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85751**] is an 84 yo man with a history of hypertension,
Diabetes, and CAD who presented with altered mental status and
hemorrhage on outside CT scan.

NEURO/Ischemic Stroke:
The patient was initially treated with dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis.  While his CT scan was notable for a large left
sided parenchymal hemorrhage, repeat CT scans revealed this to
be an infarction of the left MCA with subsequent hemorrhagic
conversion.  Dilantin was discontinued.  The patinet was
restarted started on plavix given his cardiac stents and for
continued stroke prevention.  Although his stroke was likely a
thrombolic event, no additional anticoagulation was considered
in light of his hemorrhage.

The patient's mental status improved significantly.  He was
initially fluently aphasic with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 86107**]
speech but retained comprehension.  He has right sided weakness
which vastly improved. Of note, the patient was legally blind at
baseline and did not blink to threat on exam. While his speech
output has improved significantly, he continues to have a
prominant fluent aphasia with dysarthria (also possibly related
to his edentulous state).  He was cleared by speech and swallow
for a diet of nectar thickened fluids and pureed solids. He
should continue to undergo speech and physical therapy.  He is
enrolled in a dysphagia study at [**Hospital1 18**] under the direction of
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Doctor Last Name **].  He is scheduled for follow up in the neurology
clinic in [**Month (only) 547**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

CADIOVASCUALR/Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia:
The patient's antihypertensive regimen was initially held in the
setting is his stroke.  He was initially agressively hydrated
and in the setting of his diminished EF, he did require
subsequent diuresis with good results. His home antihypertensive
regimen was reinstituted over the course of his hospitalization
with the exception of his Nifedipine as the patient could not
take continuous release pills (all medications were to be
crushable).  He was started, instead, on diltiazem at 30mg TID
and this can be uptitrated as needed for blood pressure control.
 Alternatively, the patient may resume Nifedipine 60mg daily
once he is able to take whole pills.
The patient's lipid panel was within goal range and no changes
where made.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and no events were seen.
There was a noted increase in troponin without EKG changes and
relatively flat CK.  This was felt to be related to
subendocardial ischemia and renal failure.  No interventions
where made.

ENDOCRINE/Diabetes:
The patient's A1C was 7.0.  During this hospitalization, he was
treated with sliding scale insulin and routinely required
upwards of 10units of insulin daily.  Standing insulin was not
started in the setting of his transition from tube feeds to oral
diet but oral hypoglycemic agents should be considered.

PULM/Tachypnea:
The patient was noted to be tachypneic with rales.  Chest x-ray
was without evidence of infection or effusion, no frank CHF.  It
was felt his tachypnea was related to volume ove
