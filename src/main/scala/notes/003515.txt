History of Present Illness:
HPI:
71 y/o female with PMH significant for for severe diastolic
dysfunction, atrial fib, severe PVD with chronic LE ulcers, and
CAD admitted through the ED with hypoxia. Pt had a recent
admission to the MICU [**Date range (1) 32718**]/5 for septic shock (presumed [**3-10**]
LE ulcers). She was in her normal state of health until this
morning when she appeared very lethargic when trying to get out
of bed. Her oxygen saturation was found to be 60% on room air at
[**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life. Pt was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where her sat
was 85 to 100% on a NRB with a ABG of 7.30/63/161. She was
started on CPAP of 10 which she tolerated well for approximately
20 minutes. However, she then became hypotensive to 78/40 so
CPAP was discontinued and she was put back on a nonrebreather.
After a 500 cc bolus, pt's SBP increased to around 90. Her Sats
came up to 94-100% on 4L NC. Pt states she has had productive
cough x 5 days. Otherwise ROS neg for f/c, HA, stiff neck, abd
pain, d/c/n/v.
.
In ED, received vanco, levofloxacin, flagyl, solumedrol 50mg,
tylenol

Brief Hospital Course:
71f w/ extensive PMHx, including recent admit [**Date range (1) 32718**]/5 for
septic shock (presumed [**3-10**] LE ulcers) who presents from Rehab
with hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis and transient hypotension.

1. Hypoxia:

This was most likley secondary to bronchitis/mucous plugging.
Her hypoxia resolved with bringing up a mucous plug, and her
oxygen saturation remained appropriate with minimal supplemental
oxygen.  She was weaned from 2L nc to room air.
Her chest film on admission revealed stable chronic interstitial
lung disease, with no evidence of acute PNA or CHF. h/o [**Month/Day (2) 105496**],
ILD. transient hypoxia over hours. Pt's sat already up to 99% on
2L NC.
.
2. Fever/leukocytosis: possible sources include LE ulcers, and
pulmonary. UA neg. She recently completed 2week course of
vanco/ceftaz/flagyl for her ulcers.  Over course of hospital
stay, trimmed abx down to just levo/vancomycin for presumed
bronchitis since she has a hx of MRSA.  She got a PICC line
placed on [**6-7**] and will complete a 10 day course of Vanc/Levo for
prsumed bronchitis vs bacterial pneumonia.
She was seen by [**Month/Day (2) **] while in house, and continued her
routine dressing changes and wound care. There was no evidence
of wound infection at this time.
.
3. Hypotension - Overall, this was transient, and likely
secondary to decreased preload in the context of positive
pressure ventilation.  Thereafter, she remained normotensive,
and required no further hemodynamic support.  There was no
evidence of sepsis, and her [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test showed no evidence of
adrenal insufficiency.
.
5. DM - She was continued on glargine and RISS
.
6. Pain - She was continued on fentanyl patch, prn oxcodone, and
gabapentin.
.
7. Asymmetric leg swelling: She has a hx of severe PVD and
chronic venous stasis.  LENI was negative for DVT.  Asymmetric
leg edema is likely from her chronic venous change.
.
8. Access - She got a PICC line placed in the right arm on [**6-7**].
.
9. PPx - PPI, hep SC
