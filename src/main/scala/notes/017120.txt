Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
femoral line


History of Present Illness:
28 yo F on oral contraceptive pills with 10 day history of
decreased mobility secondary to right ankle sprain, PMH of
asthma, HTN, [**First Name3 (LF) 2320**], hyperlipidemia, and obesity presents with
syncope, pleuritic chest pain, and SOB. On Saturday evening
([**2-25**]), pt had syncopal event associated with diaphoresis, chest
pain, and SOB while walking to the bathroom. Apparently no fall
or head trauma.  She tore a ligament in her right ankle ~10 days
ago causing decreased mobility; she has been ambulating on
crutches. She had been having right calf pain as well, but
attributed it to her ankle sprain.  Otherwise, she had been in
her USOH prior to this event w/o fever, chills, or sweats.
.
Pt found by EMS with BP 90/60. Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt afebrile,
HR 143 (sinus), BP initially 126/52 with O2 sats 94% on 2L NC.
CXR unremarkable. ECG with ?S1, Q3, T3. D-dimer 5958. Right
groin femoral line was placed under sterile technique. Given
concern for PE she was started on a heparin gtt at 10 PM (9500
unit bolus and then 2200 units per hour).  Bedside echo done by
cardiology fellow revealed dilated RV, RV hypokinesis, and no TR
jet.  CTA revealed large bilateral PE in main pulmonary artery.
Her SBP subsequently decreased to the 70's, and she was
therefore intubated.  Pt was started on TPA 100 mg over 2 hrs at
12:40AM and heparin gtt was stopped.  Neo gtt was started;
Dopamine gtt was added when pt lost radial pulse and BP.  She
received a total of 9 liters of fluid.
.
Upon transfer to the MICU, pt was changed from Neo and dopamine
to Levophed. Cardiology team was aware; cath lab activated,
however, it was felt thrombectomy was not indicated given
thrombolysis with subsequent hemodynamic stability. Pt with
episode of vomiting. OGT put to suction.
.
MICU Course:  The pt underwent TPA, was titrated off Levophed.
She was re-started on IV heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-100.  She
was extubated yesterday (Sunday) morning without difficulty,
transitioned to nasal cannula then room air.  Her oxygen
saturations have been stable at 96-99%.  HIT antibody was sent
as the pt had a plt drop from 275 to 147, which has returned
negative.  The pt underwent bilateral LENIs, which revealed a
non-occlusive right popliteal vein thrombus.  Femoral line was
removed. She has a negative HCG.


Past Medical History:
- Asthma, stress and allergen-induced, on Advair, Flonase,
albuterol prn, and Zyrtec at home.  Has never required oral
steroids or been hospitalized for asthma.
- HTN, on lisinopril.
- [**Name (NI) 2320**], on metformin.
- Hyperlipidemia, on Tricor.  Per pt report, total cholesterol
160, TG wnl.
- Obesity
- OCP use with Kariva for past 8-9 years w/o prior
complications.
- Recent torn right ankle ligament (10 days ago) with decreased
mobility since, on crutches.
- s/p cholecystecomy, no complications.
- s/p salpingectomy for tubal cyst, no complications.


Social History:
Denies past or present Tob, EtOH, or illicit drug use.  Lives
with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] children.

Family History:
No known h/o clotting or PE.  However, two sisters with h/o
bleeding problems: one s/p cholecystectomy and the other with
uterine bleeding necessitating hysterecomy.  Father with [**Name2 (NI) 2320**],
s/p quadruple bypass.  Mother with h/o breast CA.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: Tm: 100.6 Tc: 100.6 BP: 136/67 P: 108 RR: 19 O2sat: 96%
RA. I/O 1007/2210 -1.2L
General: Pt is an pleasant, obese, Caucasian female in NAD.
Breathing comfortably on RA.
Skin: Large ecchymoses on forearms bilaterally at sites of
PIV's.
HEENT: Sclera anicteria, conjunctiva pink.  EOMi.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharnyx erythematous secondary to ETT, no thrush
or exudates.
Neck: Supple.  No JVD.
Pulm: CTAB, no rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.
Cardiac: RRR, normal S1,S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abd: Soft, obese, NT, ND.  NABS.
Ext: Warm and well-perfused.  2+ edema in R LE, 1+ edema in L
LE.  Mild calf tenderness on R, no calf tenderness on L.  No
palpable cords.  No clubbing or cyanosis.  2+ pedal pulses.
Neuro: Awake, alert, and oriented.  No focal deficits

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
ECG: sinus tach, rate 140, borderline RAD, nl intervals,
S1,Q3,T3, no ST-T changes.
.
CXR [**2-25**]: No consolidation.
.
CTA [**2-25**]: There are large proximal filling defects present
within both the right and left main pulmonary arteries extending
into
segmental branches of the right lower lobe, right middle lobe,
left lower lobe, and left upper lobe consistent with massive
bilateral pulmonary embolism. The right upper lobe segmental
branches are poorly visualized, also possibly suggesting embolic
involvement. There are patchy peripheral opacities in both the
right and left lower lobes most consistent with atelectasis. No
pneumothorax is present. The airways appear patent to the level
of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
.
LENI's [**2-26**]: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] demonstrate normal
compressibility, augmentation, flow, and waveforms within the
common femoral, superficial femoral veins bilaterally. A small
partially occluding clot is seen within the right popliteal
vein. The left popliteal vein is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombus.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 28 yo F on oral contraceptive pills with 10 day h/o
decreased mobility secondary to ankle sprain, asthma, HTN, [**Name (NI) 2320**],
hyperlipidemia, and obesity admitted for bilateral massive
pulmonary emboli c/b hemodynamic collapse.
.
1. Bilateral massive pulmonary emboli: She had several risk
factors for developing PE, including OCP's, decreased mobility x
10 days secondary to right ankle sprain (with concomitant right
calf pain for several days), and obesity. It was complicated by
shock. She got TPA, was weaned from pressors and was
hemodynamically stable. Gt heparin Drip and coumadin for at
least three days until discharged on Coumadin. Her goal INR is
2.0-3.0.  SHe will need anticoagulation for 6 months. LENI's
revealed non-occlusive right popital thrombus. She was advised
not to continue oral contraceptivs, abd that she should find
another acceptable contraceptive measure as she should ot get
pregnant while on coumadin. Her O2 sat was int he upper 90's on
dicharge and she did not require oxygen.  Counseled to use
alternate contraception (OCPs held) and to avoid pregnancy while
on coumadin.  Will need out patient evaluation for underlying
hypercoagulable states (in addition to those above), as this
would potentially affect long term management.
.
2. Thrombocytopenia: Hemodilution. She was HIT negative. her
platelet count returned to [**Location 213**] before discharge.
.
3. Asthma: She was continued on beclomethasone, fluticasone, and
ipratropium and albuterol MDI's.
.
4. Hypertension: Her lisinopril was restarted once she was off
pressors.
.
5. [**Location 2320**]: She was monitored with FS QID and treated with Insulin
drip in the ICU, which was switched to SC insulin. Her Metformin
was restarted prior to discharge.
.
6. Hyperlipidemia: She continued her home anti cholesterol
medication.
