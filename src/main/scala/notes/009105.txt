[**2182-12-2**] CT C Spine : No fracture or traumatic malalignment.

[**2182-12-2**] Head CT : 1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Large subgaleal hematoma at the right parietal vertex with
associated soft tissue swelling/laceration.

[**2182-12-2**] Chest CT : Airways are patent to subsegmental levels
bilaterally. Note is made of moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no
pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion. In the right upper lobe is
a pleural
abutting lateral 7 x 7-mm pulmonary nodule (2:28). Small nodules
are also
seen in a perifissural distribution on the right (2:32). There
is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The heart and great
vessels are unremarkable. There is no mediastinal or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

[**2182-12-2**] CT Torso : 1. Thoracic vertebral fractures at T9-T11
with anterolisthesis of T10 and tiny retropulsed fracture
fragments at T10 level. MRI recommended to assess for cord
injury or epidural hemnatoma.
2. Pulmonary nodules in the right lung as above. In a patient at
low risk
for pulmonary malignancy, recommend followup with dedicated
chest CT within six months. If high risk, followup chest CT in
three months.

[**2182-12-2**] MRI Spine :
1. Moderate spinal cord compression at T10-11 due to mild
retropulsion of the fracture T11 vertebral body, mild anterior
subluxation at T10-11, and small posterior epidural hematoma
from T9 through T11. Apparent edema in the distal spinal cord.
This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in at approximately
2:30 pm on [**2182-12-3**].
  2. Posterior element fractures from T9 through T11 are better
visualized on the preceding torso CT scan.
  3. Edema suggestive of disruption of the intervertebral disc
at T10-11, with disruption of the posterior longitudinal
ligament at this level. Edema in the interspinous ligaments from
T8-9 throgh T11-12.
  4. Partially visualized and incompletely evaluated spondylosis
in the
cervical and lumbar spine.
  5. Mass effect on the bladder base, possibly due to an
enlarged prostate, partially visualized and incompletely
evaluated.

[**2182-12-5**] CXR :
  There has been interval removal of an
endotracheal and orogastric tube. Midline surgical staples are
seen. A
spinal fixation device is seen projecting over the midline.
Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Rapidly
increasing bibasal opacification may be atelectasis but
pneumonia is qually plausible; correlate clinically.  No
pneumothorax.







Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83880**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room and admitted
to the Trauma ICU with a T10 fracture of the inferior facets
with anterior subluxation and a T11 compression fracture.  His
MRI showed mild cord compression and his exam showed [**5-5**]
strength in both lower extremities.  He was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2182-12-3**] for fusion. (See Op note for exact
details).  He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
ICU in stable condition and extubated.  He had panic attacks and
anxiety post op and required sedation to maintain log roll
precautions and keep him calm.  He eventually required
reintubation as he was hypoventilating. During this period Xanax
and suboxone were found in his belongings.  He was treated with
Morphine for pain and Ativan and Haldol for anxiety and
delirium.  Eventually he was extubated on [**2182-12-4**] and was able
to cough and deep breath and use the incentive spirometer.

He spiked a temperature on [**2182-12-4**] to 101.6 and his Chest Xray
showed a left lower lobe consolidation.  He was subsequently
treated with Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and kept in the ICU
for an additional day for pulmonary toilet.

On [**2182-12-6**] he was transferred to the Trauma floor where he began
to make good progress.  His anxiety was under control as was his
pain.  His appetite began to improve and he continued pulmonary
toilet with no temperature spikes.  He was evaluated by the
Physical Therapy service and found to have good balance,
adequate strength and gait.

Following removal of his occipital staples he was discharge to
home on [**2182-12-9**] with VNA services for cardiopulmonary assessment
and physical therapy.
