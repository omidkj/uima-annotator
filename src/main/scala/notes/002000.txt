Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic Paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with repeated admissions
this month for AMS who was admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for
confusion after a fall and found to have UTI and bil DVT and is
now transffered to us primarily for continuous EEG monitoring
d/t continued AMS.
.
At baseline pnt is mostly wheelchair bound, but is able to walk
a few steps with a walker and transfer independently, mentates
normally and is able to care for her affairs.
.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**] ON
[**2109-1-24**] for UTI and became delirious at that point.  However,
her delirium did improve and she was alert and oriented upon
discharge. transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2109-1-23**].  She was
at for less than a day, at which point she was transferred back
to [**Hospital3 1196**] with altered mental status where
she was discharged on [**1-26**] back to rehab. Details of this
[**Month/Year (2) **] are unclear. She then presented [**2-6**] to [**Hospital3 **]
from nursing home due to a fall which she said was [**3-14**] to
neglecting to lock her wheelchair when she was trying to get off
it.  She fell backwards and sustained a occipital scalp
hematoma, there was no loss of consciousness, no incontinence,
tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**] or limb movements.  Per nursing home report, the
patient was confused after the fall.
.
At [**Hospital3 **] was reported to have intermitent confusion with
peridos in which she is able to converse and cooperate. Kepra
was started overnight for ? of seizures.  Today she became
progressively more lethargic to the point of awakening only to
noxiuous stimuli.  Noncontrast head CT showed atrophy but no
acute findings. MRI scan was limited d/t movement and showed
[**Known lastname 1007**] matter findings consistent with multiple sclerosis, but
could not absolutely r/o infarction. EEG show generalized
slowing and some high-amplitude sharp activity which was felt to
be consistent with an encephalopathy, although seizure could not
be ruled out. All centerally acting medications including
baclofen and keppra. She was  given IV acyclovir empirically on
day of transfer. LP was performed prior to transfer, initial and
showed: gluc 63, prot 47, gram stain neg, RBC 2140 1st tube 20
4th tube, no xanthrchromia, WBC = 5, 5.
.
.
She also reported increased swelling bilaterally in her lower
extremities over past few months left > right, limiting her
mobility.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, headache, focal numbness or weakness. LENI
demonstarted DVT in the left common femoral and proper femoral
veins +  clot was also seen in the right common femoral vein.
She has no family or personal h/o DVT. She denied any CP or SOB.
VQ scan was was interpreted as very low probability for
pulmonary embolism. Echo showed mild-mod TR and minimal PHTN
(28mmHg) w/o RV strain. IV heparin was started + coumadin. Then
reversed for LP and IVC filter was placed.
.
Also UTI was diagnosed per dirty UA, patient received 3 days of
ciprofloxacin which was stopped d/t AMS. Unkown if positive
cultures.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2109-2-12**]):
1. Large pelvic masses that are mainly composed of soft tissue
but have some cystic components within them.  Bilateral
hydronephrosis is detected secondary to external compression of
the ureters by the pelvis masses.
Omental caking and peritoneal seeding are seen along with
malignant ascites. These findings are most probably related to
primary ovarian carcinoma.
.
2. IVC filter is well positioned, filling defects that are
compatible with
DVT are seen in the right common iliac vein. The right external
iliac vein is obliterated. Filling defects are seen in the left
common femoral vein and left superficial femoral vein. The left
iliac veins are not well visualized.
.
Paracentesis ([**2109-2-14**]): Technically successful ultrasound-guided
diagnostic paracentesis Preliminary Reportwith 850 mL of clear
serous fluid removed. No immediate complication. Cytology
consistent with adenocarcinoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for [**Month/Day/Year **]: 58 year old F with Multiple
Sclerosis with repeated admissions this month for AMS who was
admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for confusion after a fall and
found to have UTI and bilateral DVTs transferred for continuous
EEG monitoring d/t continued AMS found to have widespread
ovarian cancer.
.
Active Problems:
.
# AMS/Delirium: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy given
marked improvement with antibiotics and EEG consistent with
generalized encephalopathy and no e/o seizure or epileptiform
activity. She was initially A/O x0, arousable but minimally
verbal, only responsive with echolalia. After initiating
appropriate antibiotic therapy for enterococcus UTI, her mental
status rapidly improved. There was initially concern for
bacterial/viral meningitis/encephalitis and LP was performed at
[**Hospital3 **]. CSF showed Tot Protein 47, Glucose 63, RBC 2140
(Tube 1), RBC 20 (Tube 4), likely representativ
