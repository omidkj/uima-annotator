Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
catatonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
51M w/ hx of depression, remote suicide attempts and OCD
presented to ED on [**1-8**] with c/o being nonconversant. He was
being weaned off abilify over the past 3 weeks due to
"drowsiness", and 3 days ago the patient's mother, with whom he
lives, noticed that he was pacing the floor, a behavior that is
unusual for him, but otherwise was at his baseline which is
fully functional and independent in ADLs. The next morning
however he became nonconversant and minimally responsive to
verbal commands. After contacting his psychiatrist, his mother
brought the patient to the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96RA
.
He was evaluated by psychiatry who felt his symptoms were due to
aquired catatonia in the setting of a mood disorder and weaning
off abilify. They noted that in the ED he exhibited mutism,
hypokinetic behavior, echolalia/echopraxia, posturing and
decreased eye blink. He was placed on section 12 and bed search
was initiated. However he became agitated yesterday afternoon
when he was ready to be transferred to an outside facility. He
was given ativan but eventurally required 4 point restraints.
Restraints were kept in place overnight, removed this morning,
but then replaced due to concern for fall risk as he would not
remain in his bed. His CK was noted to be trending upward, and
the ED requested that he be admitted to the MICU given possible
need for ativan drip, rising CK, and high risk for NMS.
.
Last vitals in ED: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96%RA. Just prior to
admission he was noted to be drowsy, with his last benzo dose of
ativan 2mg, midazolam 5mg at 1130hrs, and total of 20mg ativan
given during ED course. ED records noted his head CT was
negative for hemorrhage, mediastinum appeared widened on AP CXR,
and initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia with normal QTc
interval.
.
On arrival to the MICU patient was conversant, but remained
mildly agitated.
.

IMAGING:
[**1-10**] CT HEAD TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained
through the brain. No contrast was administered.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. The mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are clear. There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air
cells. Sphenoid sinus septations insert anterior to the carotid
grooves.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect. Correlate
clinically to decide on the need for further workup.
.
[**1-13**] CXR HISTORY: Catatonia and worsening rhonchi. Suspect
pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2194-1-12**]:11 p.m.
There may be a new consolidation at the base of the left lung
denoted by the appearance of air bronchograms, pneumonia until
proved otherwise. Top normal heart size, unchanged. Pulmonary
vascular engorgement is present, but there is no clear edema or
appreciable pleural effusion. Mediastinal widening due to fat
deposition is longstanding.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3776**] is a 51 year old male with history of depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and coronary artery disease
(CAD) who was admitted for catatonia and course was notable for
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] catatonia and agitation.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUES:
# Catatonia: He was seen by psychiatry and they felt that his
catatonia was most likely due to recent weaning from abilify
with exacerbation of underlying mood disorder (depression with
psychosis). In ED, patient exhibited agitation requiring 4 point
restraints for prolonged course, and 20mg lorazepman total. ECT
was entertained as a possible intervention for catatonia, and
was initially deferred as his catatonia resolved with standing
antipsychotics (haloperidol 10mg [**Hospital1 **], with ativan 1mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Unfortunately, although his catatonia improved, Mr. [**Known lastname 3777**]
psychosis did not continue to improve with haloperidol from
[**Date range (1) 3778**], and ECT was deemed necessary. He was scheduled to
begin ECT on [**1-18**], and medical clearance was obtained, but
unfortunately Mr. [**Known lastname 3776**] could not be consented for the
procedure and health care proxy authority for his mother was not
formalized. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 3779**] remained in [**4-6**] point restraints during
his floor stay.

# Leukocytosis/Fever/Pneumonia:  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 3779**] was noted to have
difficulty with secretions on [**1-12**] after recieving ativan for
agitation. CXR on [**1-13**] [**Month/Year (2) 3780*
