Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 86666**]
before CPB.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including milrinone
0.25mcg/kg/min, levophed 0.15mcg/kg/min.
RV mild global hypokinesis.
LV EF 25 to 30% on inotropes. There is mild improvement in
overall contractility of the LV>
The aortic bioprosthesis is well seated and functioning well and
the residual peak and mean 25 and 15 mm of HG.
Thoracic aorta is intact.
Mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2143-3-15**] for preoperative workup.  He
was cleared by dental.  He underwent cardiac catheterization and
coronary angiography which revealed normal coronary arteries.
Pre-operative echo revealed EF 10-20%, consistent with chronic
systolic heart failure.  Aortic valve area was less than 0.5
square centimeteres.  Chest CT was performed and revealed no
significant ascending aorta calcification. He was brought to the
operating room on [**2143-3-18**] where the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 27mm Mosaic ultra porcine tissue valve.
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Ejection
fraction did improve to 30% post-operatively.  Vancomycin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis given the duration of
his preoperative stay.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamics were maintained with
vasopressin, levophed and milrinone.  Hemodynamics improved and
all drips were weaned.  He did develop new onset atrial
fibrillation just prior to surgery.  He was started on
amiodarone for this, as well as anti-coagulated with coumadin.
Coreg and ACE inhibitor were initiated given the history of
heart failure.  The patient desaturated to the low 80s while
sleeping.  Sleep medicine was consulted.  The patient was unable
to cooperate with informal sleep study while inpatient.  It is
recommended that he follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1137**] of [**Location (un) 8117**],
NH as an outpatient.  In the meantime, it is recommended that he
be treated with home oxygen at 4LPM while sleeping.  He was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.  The patient did not have a
primary care physician at the time of admission.  We have spoken
to the daughter, and she will arrange for a PCP on discharge.
Coumadin/INR will be managed by cardiac surgery until the
patient arranges for PCP.
