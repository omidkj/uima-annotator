HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status
post coronary artery bypass graft), congestive heart failure
(with an ejection fraction of 35%), hypertension, and known
abdominal aortic aneurysm who was admitted for a workup of
his aortic aneurysm in the setting of ongoing abdominal pain.

The patient reports initial imaging of his aneurysm
approximately one year ago with an approximate diameter of 3
cm at that time.  For the past two months, the patient has
been complaining of some bilateral lower quadrant/suprapubic
abdominal pain that has been crampy and intermittent with no
associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, fevers,
chills, or weight loss.

A computerized axial tomography of his abdomen on [**2147-1-12**] showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4.5 cm X 5.8
cm; which was increased in size since one year ago.

Over the last several weeks, the patient has had persistent
intermittent abdominal symptoms, but no acute exacerbation.
After a discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] yesterday
morning, the patient was admitted to the hospital for blood
pressure monitoring and repeat computerized axial tomography
given his ongoing symptoms and possible symptomatic abdominal
aortic aneurysm.

The patient denied chest pain, but he did note some chronic
dyspnea.  No cough.  No orthopnea.  No lower extremity edema.
The patient does reports a history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease which is unlike his current symptoms.  No peptic
ulcer disease or gallstones.  The patient reports having had
a prior colonoscopy which was negative (by report).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 2.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft at [**Hospital6 1708**] in the early
[**2123**].
 3.  History of congestive heart failure (with an ejection
fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in [**2146-12-26**]).
 4.  Status post ventral hernia repair.
 5.  History of osteoarthritis.
 6.  Hypertension.
 7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 8.  Asbestosis.
 9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  Status post bilateral corneal surgeries.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies; question of a reaction
to PERCOCET.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Triamterene 75 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Mevacor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Zestril 10 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Atrovent inhaler as needed.
5.  Azmacort inhaler as needed.
6.  Theophylline.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.  He drinks
approximately two to three drinks per week.  He has a history
of prior tobacco, but he has quit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 93, his blood pressure
was 125/64, and his pulse oximetry was 99% on room air.
General appearance revealed the patient was
comfortable-appearing and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous
membranes were moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  There were
bilateral surgical pupils.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The
neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant first heart sound
and second heart sound.  No murmurs.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft and obese.
He had a vertical periumbilical scar.  He had some mild
tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic area.  There was no
rebound or guarding.  There were active bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed he had prominent varicosities
with no edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 6.8, his
hematocrit was 42.2, and his platelets were 239.  His INR was
1.1.  Sodium was 142, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 105,
bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine
was 1, and his blood glucose was 98.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computerized axial tomography
of the abdomen revealed a 5.8-cm X 4.5-cm in diameter
abdominal aortic aneurysm which was unchanged from prior.
There was no evidence of extravasation of contrast.  There
was also a thrombosed aneurysm involving the left renal
artery which was also unchanged.  The patient had extensive
bilateral pleural plaques which were chronic.

An electrocardiogram on admission revealed a normal sinus
rhythm at 94 beats per minute, with some intraventricular
conduction abnormalities.  Left axis with occasional
premature atrial contractions.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient with a history of
coronary artery disease.  He was continued on his aspirin and
his ACE inhibitor.  It was unclear why he was not on a beta
blocker, but this might be secondary to bronchospasm in the
setting of his known pulmonary disease.  He also has a
history of congestive heart failure but appeared well
compensated and was continued on his ACE inhibitor.

For blood pressure control, the patient was initially started
on a Nipride drip after placement of an arterial line.  He
remained on the Nipride overnight with a goal systolic blood
pressure of 120 to 130.  The Nipride was weaned off as we
increased the dose of his lisinopril to 40 mg by mouth once
per day and started him on Norvasc at initially 5 mg and then
10 mg by mouth once per day.

2.  VASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient with a known abdominal
aortic aneurysm with persistent abdominal pain.  By history,
the patient's abdominal symptoms had not acutely worsened.  A
repeat computed tomography scan of his abdomen was
essentially unchanged.  He was evaluated by Vascular surgery who
felt that his abdominal pain was not related to his abdominal
aortic aneurysm per se, and that he would best benefit from
an elective outpatient stenting procedure within the next
several weeks.

3.  RENAL ISSUES:  Given the addition of an increased ACE
inhibitor, his triamterene was discontinued.  His potassium
was within normal limits during this hospitalization.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  Regarding the patient's chronic
abdominal pain, it was unclear whether this was secondary to
his aortic aneurysm.  He does have a history of
gastroesophageal reflux disease; although, he stated that his
symptoms now were different.  Also considered peptic ulcer
disease.  Of note, there was no other bowel pathology noted
on the computerized axial tomography.  The patient's liver
function tests were within normal limits.

On the morning of discharge, the patient had no appreciable
abdominal pain or tenderness to palpation.  He was discharged
on a dose of Protonix.  It was possible his gastroesophageal
reflux disease symptoms could be worsened by his
theophylline.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as scheduled.
2.  The patient will initiate Norvasc and go out on a higher
dose of lisinopril.
3.  The patient was also instructed to stop his triamterene.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Lovastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Flovent 110-mcg inhaler 2 puffs inhaled twice per day.
4.  Atrovent inhaler 1 puff inhaled q.4-6h. as needed.
5.  Theophylline (as previously dosed).
6.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Norvasc 10 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
8.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.

As noted, the patient was to stop his triamterene.  The
patient also instructed to minimize his use of alcohol, as it
may effect his blood pressure.
