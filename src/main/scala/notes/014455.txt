Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Left hip intertrochanteric fracture, hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Hemiarthroplasty with #9 cemented stem, 46-mm bipolar head with
+5 mm neck.
-Open reduction internal fixation greater trochanter.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85-year-old woman with h/o critical aortic
stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2, peak gradient 74), dCHF with exacerbation
in [**10/2142**] c/b paroxysmal atrial fibrillation now on amiodorone,
NSTEM versus demand ischemia ([**10/2142**]) on aspirin and Plavix
(both stopped on [**4-6**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of
hip fracture and hypotension.

Per OSH report, patient had a mechanical fall on Saturday night
in which she landed on her left side. She says that she lost her
footing and fell backwards (this report was confirmed with
patient's daughter). She presented to OSH where x-ray showed
evidence of L-hip intertrochanteric fracture. At OSH, patient
was evaluated by orthopedics. She was initally hypotensive to
SBPs 80s and got bolused in ER and admitted to the ICU (getting
NS at 100 cc/hr), so far has gotten 1L normal saline. SBP at
time of transfer 92/43, HR 72, satting 96-97% 2L. No pain, so
not getting any meds. Per report, patient is AAOx3 and stable.
For access, she has 2 PIVs (20 gauge and 18 gauge).

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Currently patient endorses no leg pain, shortness of breath,
chest pain or pressure. She says she feels well except when she
is moved in bed, when her left leg hurts her. She has a rash on
her left chest for several weeks, which is improving. ROS
negative for diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, joint pain,
melena, bright red blood per rectum, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or
hematemsis. She has had mild nausea with no emesis since
arriving from OSH.

Past Medical History:
- critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2) on echocardiogram [**2141**]
- diagnosed initially in [**10/2142**]
- congestive heart failure with grade 3 diastolic dysfunction
(with evidence of LVH on EKG from OSH)
- NSTEMI [**10/2142**] ?demand ischemia, no intervention
- hypertension
- chronic back pain
- status post cataract surgery
- status post cholecystectomy

Social History:
Lives at home by herself. Daughter is very involved. Does not
smoke or drink. Walking with walker at baseline. Able to take
care of ADLs. Mostly confined to household activities.

Family History:
Positive for diabetes. Sister died from uterine cancer.

Imaging Studies:
.
Left hip x-ray ([**4-7**]):
Very limited exam due to technique. Mildly displaced and
impacted
intertrochanteric fracture of L femur with superior displacement
of distal
fragment is redemonstrated. Severe L hip joint DJD without
dislocation of
femoral head. Evaluation of lateral femoral condyle deformity
limited and of uncertain chronicity. No definite new fracture.
Probable diffuse bony
demineralizaiton.
.
Chest x-ray ([**4-7**]):
Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular
engorgement have
worsened indicating progressive cardiac decompensation. Left
lower lobe
remains severely consolidated. Whether this is due to lower lobe
collapse or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Heavy
calcification in the heart that could be due to severe aortic
stenosis and mitral annulus degeneration respectively would
require a lateral view for localization.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**4-8**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
apical aneurysm and near akinesis of all segments except for the
basal inferolateral wall. The septum is hypokinetic. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis. Symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic stenosis. Based on [**2138**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic
(angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical
intervention has been shown to be beneficial. The left
ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the
patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibotor or

CT orbit, sella, and IAC without contrast ([**4-8**]):
Bilateral soft tissue masses centered within the external
auditory canals most likely represent keratosis obturans, more
advanced on the right. Additional differential considerations
include cholesteatomas. More aggressive etiologies such as
squamous cell carcinoma are unlikely.

apparent disease. The LAD had a 20% proximal stenosis and a 40%
