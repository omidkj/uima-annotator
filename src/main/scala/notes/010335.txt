Imaging:
Head CT([**9-3**]):
IMPRESSION: Small focal extra-axial hematoma overlying the right
frontal
lobe. Two tiny foci of acute hemorrhage within the right frontal
lobe may be
subarachnoid versus punctate contusions. No associated mass
effect.

C-Spine CT([**9-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or subluxation of the cervical spine.
2. Extensive levels of moderate-to-severe canal stenosis. A low
grade injury may result in spinal cord injury. Therefore, if
there is concern for cervical spine cord injury, an MRI of the
cervical spine should be obtained for further evaluation.
3. Emphysematous changes at the lung apices.

Right Hand Plain Film([**9-4**]):
IMPRESSION: Apparent soft tissue injury to right hand as above.
No embedded
radiopaque foreign body. Left hand intact. Underlying
degenerative changes asabove.

Head CT([**9-4**]):
No significant expansion of known right frontal extra-axial
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
77M on coumadin for a-fib was admitted to ICU s/p fall with
small R frontal SDH. His INR was 2.2 and reversed with FFP, VIT
K, and Profeline 9. His subsequent Head CTs were stable and pt
was transferred to the floor in which he tolerated adequate PO
and voided appropriately. He worked well with PT, who initially
felt that he would be best suited for immmediate services in a
rehabilitation unit. However, upon re-evaluation and discussions
with the patient's daughter and wife, it was determined that the
patient was safe to be discharged home, providing that he use a
walker for gait, and had assistance with stairs. The family
vehemently requested that he be discharged home, rather than to
a rehab facility.

Througout his hospital course, his neurological exam remained
non-focal. However, the patient has chronic R foot drop, which
remained unchanged.

The patient was discharged home with home PT services on
[**2193-9-7**].
