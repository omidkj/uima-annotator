TEE:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
2. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is  not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-12**]+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
Chest PA and LAT:
Comparison made with the prior film of [**12-10**].  Allowing
for
differences in technique and probably patient position, there
has been no
significant change since the prior chest x-ray.  Bilateral
pleural effusions are again seen, with fluid noted in the major
fissure on the lateral film.  The patchy bronchopneumonia,
particularly in the right middle and lower zones are again seen.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M p/w CAP, was in MICU, diagnosed with afib, now
transferred to floor. PMH includes DM II (diet-controlled), HTN,
HL and asthma. afib is the active issue now
.
Pnumonia: was admitted to the MICU for sepsis leading to
hypotension. initially on broad spectrum abx which were later on
narrowed down to PO levofloxacin after cultures were found to be
negative. he was treated with 10 days of levoflox. he had bil
pleural effusion R>>L. we had decided to tap the pleural
effusion if the pt had not responded to levoflox therapy.
however, his satts were fine, wbc nl, no fever. so we did not
tap the effusions. he was weaned down to room air. he was also
given albuterol puffs.  The etiology of the pleural effusions
was not confirmed, but thought possibly related to transient
heart failure in the context of new AF/RVR.
.
Afib: diagnosed with afib w/ RVR during this admission. Echo
showed enlarged LA and MR. we thought this might be a newly
diagnosed afib or a PAF (especially in the setting of large LA).
pt was started on metoprolol initially which did not control the
rate and hence was replaced with diltiazem 360 ER qd. metoprolol
was added. he continued to have tachycardia. EP was consulted.
his TEE was neg for thrombi. he underwent cardioversion. was
back in sinus rhythm with normal rate. was placed on coumadin
for antocoagulation.  TSH was normal and electrolytes were
monitored/repleted as necessary.
.
#HTN: continued on losartan 75 qd
.
#Hyperlipidemia: continued on atorvastatin 80 qd
.
#DM: pt's daughter gives h/o DM controlled with diet only. no
h/o anti diabetic meds use in past. was put on RISS and diabetic
diet.
.
PPX: on coumadin, bowel regimen
.
FEN: cardiac, diabetic diet
.
Code: full

Will need follow up of INR levels as well as assessment of long
term anticoagulation needs, depending on maintenance of SR vs
recurrence of AFib.  He should also have follow up of pleural
effusions with subsequent evaluation if they do not resolve.
