Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: The pt is a 85 F with h/o CAD s/p MI w/ stent [**2142**],
COPD on home O2, HTN, sz d/o p/w dyspnea, chest pain for several
months.
.
Chest pain/Dyspnea: On admission the differential diagnosis
included stable angina vs. NSTEMI vs. CHF vs. pulmonary embolism
vs. pneumonia vs. GI pain. The patient had elevated troponins on
cycling, 0.16 and 0.19, though negative CK-MBs no dynamic EKG
changes. Also, the patient's symptoms have not been evolving
over several months. CXR on admission demonstrated a possible
left retrocardiac opacity. Initially the pt was started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and
levofloxacin, for possible nosocomial pneumonia. CTA
demonstrated no pulmonary embolus. The CT did demonstrate small
bilateral effusions and small bilateral lower lobe opacities,
atelectasis vs. effusion. Given the CT findings, the patient's
treatment for possible pneumonia was discontinued, though
[**Year (4 digits) 1378**] was continued for UTI, as described below. A TTE was
performed which demonstrated an LVEF of 45-50%, mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral
regurgitation, similar to prior studies.
.
Given the the patient's work-up, her dyspnea/chest pain is most
likely associated with failure or CHF. Her elevated troponin
levels could be representative of either process. She was
continued on aspirin throughout her admission. She was started
on a low-dose statin. A beta-blocker was not started on
admission given borderline pressures. She was started on a
low-dose metoprolol on hospital day #2. At the time of discharge
she was asymptomatic. Given her heart failure, she should be
started on a ACE-I as an out-patient if her pressures tolerate
it.
.
UTI: The patient had a urinalysis suggestive of UTI as described
in the HPI. At the time of discharge her urine cultures were
negative. She is to be discharged on [**Year (4 digits) 1378**] to complete a
ten-day course.
.
COPD: She was continued on nebulizers as needed.
.
hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home synthroid
throughout the admission.
.
FEN: She was placed on a regular heart healthy diet throughout
the admission. She had no evidence of aspiration.
.
ppx: Heparin held given her allergy. She was placed on
pneumoboots. No need for a ppi given she was on a po diet.
.
Code status: DNR/DNI
