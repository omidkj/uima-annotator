History of Present Illness:
58 yo with PMH morbid obesity ?CMP w/ EF 40-45%, afib/flutter on
amio at home, COPD, OSA, IDDM, tonsillar CA s/p chemo/XRT [**12-22**]
with PEG. He was feeling generally well in his USOH and was
witnessed falling to his bathroom floor in AM [**1-9**]. His son
performed CPR until EMS arrived and found him in VF arrest
(down-time <5 min). He was intubated in the field was converted
out of VF with 1 shock, then transported to [**Hospital6 **]
where he was given lidocaine 100mg x 1 in the ED and started on
amiodarone drip.
.
His cardiac enzymes were negative and his electrolytes were not
derranged; His other labs were simply notable for a low hct of
27.1.
.
[**1-10**] midnight he was found to be in Vtach and was defibrillated
x 3 "with transient response;" he was kept on amiodarone drip.
He again went into pulseless VT and CPR was performed; he
received lidocaine 100mg x 1 with good response; he was then
started on lido drip at 2mg. He then had another VT event which
was resolved by repeat lidocaine bolus and increasing drip to
3mg. The lidocaine drip was stopped today as per EP
recommendations.
.
As per verbal report (not seen in notes) He has gone into
sustained monomorphic VT 6 times with 2 episodes converting to
VF; he was successfully defibrillated out of VF x 2. He was
cardioverted out of VT x 4. He is transferred here for further
management.

Physical Exam:
T BP 120/66 HR 81 (sinus) RR 14, 98%
Gen: Intubated, sedated, morbidly obese. Opens eyes to command
CV: RRR no m/r/g; decreased heart sounds
Pulm: clear anteriorly

Pertinent Results:
EP study showed scar and many foci were ablated with some
success, but residual foci.
.
cardiac cath had LAD stenosis and bare metal stent was placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 58 yo with PMH significant for morbid obesity, atrial
fibrillation, tonsillar CA s/p chemo/XRT, found down with
ventricular fibrillation with several episodes of recurrent VT
s/p VT ablation.
.
# Cardiac
1. Rhythm: Pt with VF and recurrent monomorphic VT (RBBB
superior morphology). Changed to an altered morphology and some
polymorphic variation s/p 1x ablation.  EP study on [**1-14**]- Several
different morphologies of VT were noted, generally not
well-tolerated hemodynamically which limited the ability to map
the arrhythmia.  A substrate based ablation was performed which
modified but did not completely eliminate the VT.
Post-ablation, the pt was treated with metoprolol, amiodarone,
and mexilitine.  Post-ablation, the pt continued to have
occasional episodes of VT including poorly tolerated spells.
Many of these were associated with increased catecholamine
states such as reducing the amount of sedatives he was receiving
but they did not well respond to increased beta blockade.
BEcause of the concern re: ischemia contributing to the episodes
of arrhythmia, the pt underwent cardiac catheterization (see
below).  Following stent placement, there was a marked reduction
in the amount of arrhythmia the pt was having.  On [**2156-1-30**] the
pt suffered a Vtach arrest/PEA.  Agressive resuscitative
measures were performed but the pt had persistent and recurrent
arrhythmia that was not hemodynamically tolerated and did not
respond to repeated attempts at defibrillation.  ECG during
brief sinus rhythm during code did not demonstrate ST elevation
or any evidence of acute stent thrombosis.  Code was called
after 30 minutes.  Pronounced dead.
.
2. CAD: Reduced EF, and findings at EP study consistent with CAD
(regional scar), although cardiac enzymes persistantly negative.
Medically treated with ASA, BB, plavix, statin, ACEI.  Had cath
and bare metal stent to prox LAD which markedly reduced the
amount of arrhythmia he was having.
.
3. Pump: LVEF now 30% with 1-2+MR and mild PAH.   Treated with
furosemide for diuresis.
.
# Altered mental status: likely was ICU/sedation induced
delirium.  Head CT without bleed or infarct.  Remained confused
but improved by time of death.
.
# Infection: Patient had E. coli UTI which was treated with 7day
ceftriaxone. MRSA PNA being treated with vancomycin treated with
15 days. Treated with ceftaz for  moraxilla and pseudomonas PNA.

.
# Diarrhea: Likely secondary to antibiotics. decreased with
immodium. c.diff neg x 4
.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated and extubated during
hospitalization. Monitored for hypoxia (h/o pulmonary edema,
pna, OSA).  Thick secretions still ([**1-13**] parotid after surgery);
improved on humidified oxygen. saline nebs.  CPAP at night
.
# Diabetes: Treated with SSI and NPH [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Tonsillar Cancer: tonsillar CA s/p 3x cisplatin ([**2155-11-3**],
[**2155-11-24**], [**2155-12-15**]) and XRT (finished [**12-22**]).  Had good
prognosis according to Oncologist:Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19101**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19102**].
.
# Pressure ulcers: 2 small spots on back and under pannus which
do not look infected. Treated with air bed, Zinc, vit c, wound
care.
.
# FEN/GI:  Tube feeds.
