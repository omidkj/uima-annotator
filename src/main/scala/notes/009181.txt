increased his peak flows to about 300, and his oxygen
saturations came up to 95% on room air.  He did require
nebulizers as frequently as every 90 minutes while in the

possible allergic component.

peak flows rising to 480.  The patient was saturating 96% on
room air and did not experience dyspnea with exertion.  He
was discharged to home on a prednisone taper as well as
inhaled steroids and a short-acting and long-acting beta
agonist inhaler.
