History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman who has had a persistent
cough for several
years. Recently, she was admitted on [**2201-1-16**] to
[**Hospital 2079**] Hospital with progressive dyspnea and cough and was
felt to have a right upper lobe pneumonia. She was treated with
antibiotics and subsequent CT scan demonstrated no resolution of
the opacity. She underwent extensive biopsies of the lesion
including the right exploratory thoracotomy with all pathology
negative. Workup with MRI and PET showed no evidence of
metastasis. The right upper lobe lesion was FDG avid. The
patient was transferred postoperatively from [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation
and
treatment.

RADIOLOGY
[**3-8**] CT Chest: 4.2 x 7.5 x 7.3 cm mass within the right lung
apex which has findings consistent with invasion of the
mediastinum with loss of fat planes at the esophagus, trachea,
and superior vena cava.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.9
cm.
Multiple pleural-based mass lesion in the posterior right pleura
measuring up to 2.8 cm in maximal dimension.
Small right pleural effusion. Small pleural air anterior to the
right middle lobe.
Lytic lesion in the L1 vertebral body suspicious for metastatic
disease.

[**3-8**] CXR:  Dense opacification at the right lung apex, possibly
with mild volume loss. No pneumothorax detected.

[**3-9**] CXR: Endotracheal tube tip is seen in standard position.
Two right chest tubes remain in place. There is a moderate right
pleural effusion. There are postoperative changes with right
shifting of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and widening of the
mediastinum and right hilum. Left lower lobe atelectasis is
unchanged.

[**3-10**] CXR: Postoperative widening of the upper mediastinum and
right hilus are essentially unchanged due in part to fluid
loculation. Pleural fluid is also collected at the apex where
there is partially resected right lung. I see no definite
pleural air collection although I would assume some is present.
Left lung is grossly clear. Skinfold should not be mistaken for
a left pneumothorax. Heart size top normal, unchanged. Two right
pleural drains in place.

[**3-11**] CXR: Appearance of the chest is essentially unchanged
compared to one-day prior. Post-operative widening of the upper
mediastinum and right hilus are unchanged, likely due to fluid
loculations. A band of pleural fluid crosses the right upper
hemithorax, with a more lucent area superiorly that could be
overexpanded lung or pleural air. A true upright chest
radiograph should be obtained to differentiate between the
possibilities, looking for a fluid level. Two right pleural
drains are in unchanged position. Small, dependent right- sided
effusion is stable. Left lung is clear.

[**3-12**] CXR: The two right chest tubes have been removed in the
meantime interval with subsequent marked increase in right
predominantly apical but also basal pneumothorax. The pleural
effusion is grossly unchanged. The postoperative right
mediastinal shift is again demonstrated. The right lower lung
atelectasis is present.

[**3-12**] CXR: AP and lateral chest views obtained with patient in
sitting upright position are analyzed in direct comparison with
two preceding chest examinations of [**3-11**] and [**2201-3-12**], the latter approximately seven hours earlier. On the next
previous study, the right-sided chest tubes had been removed and
a pneumothorax occupying the upper third of the hemithorax was
identified. On the present study, two new chest tubes have been
placed and appear in rather similar position as on the chest
examination of [**2201-3-11**]. A smaller apical air-fluid
level remains but the pneumothorax seen earlier has markedly
improved. The left chest remains unchanged and is within normal
limits.

[**3-13**] CXR: Comparison with [**2201-3-12**], the two right chest
tubes have been removed. There is persistent shift of the
trachea and mediastinum towards the right. There is a large
air-fluid level in the right apex, with smaller air-fluid levels
within the right apex. There may also be a basilar component of
this right pneumothorax. There is increased prominence of the
pulmonary vasculature within the left lung and probably a small
left pleural effusion.

[**3-13**] CT Chest: Status post right upper lobe resection. Large
right apical hydropneumothorax. Ill-defined soft tissue and
fluid density is seen within the mediastinum tracking
subcarinally likely post-operative, residual tumor cannot be
excluded.
Mucus plugging of right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with
complete right middle lobe and near complet
