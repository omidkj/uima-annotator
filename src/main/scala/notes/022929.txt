REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: Acute GI Bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84 y/o female with a couple of weeks of maroon colored stools,
mid-epigastric pain of similar duration, that prompted visit to
her PCP today, who referred her to the ED.

She has noticed that she maroonish/red blood during bowel
movements, but sometimes can feel sensation of blood when
walking, not on the toilet. She has not had diarrhea, but has
had an increase in bowel movement frequency up to 3 a day
sometimes. There is no description of dripping blood.

In the ED, initial VS:  15:55 7 97.4 73 149/53 18 97
Her hematocrit was found to be 20 here, down from near 30 at
last check in [**2196-2-7**]. By report, she has been
hemodynamically stable. She endorses some SOB but this is not
acute, and she has not experienced any chest pain.

She had a NG Lavage in the ED that was negative, though bile was
not returned. There was maroon stool on digital rectal exam. She
was given pantoprazole 40mg IV x1, 2L of normal saline. The case
was discussed with GI on call, with plan for scope in the
morning given her hemodynamic stability.

She is accompanied by her son.

Currently in the ICU, she is pain free.

ABDOMINAL CT SCAN:[**2196-9-2**]
1. Segment of distal and terminal ileal wall thickening and
enhancement,
suggests enteritis; infectious vs inflammatory vs ischemic
etiology.
2. Bilateral breast calcifications again seen, for which
correlation with
mammography recommended.

Hct at discharge was stable at 32.9.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:

1. GI Bleeding: Likely lower GI bleed given maroon colored
stools from either divercula or AVM and less likely upper GI
bleed given negative NG lavage.  However, cannot rule this
etiology out.  Surgery and GI were consulted in the ED.  Pt was
placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], made NPO except medications for possible
EGD/colonoscopy by GI, and serial Hcts were followed.
Abdominal CT showed some ? of colitis; thus GI recommended
starting pt on ciprofloxacin and flagyl. The patient was
transfused 2 pRBCs with appropriate response in his hematocrit.
During MICU stay, pt remained hemodynamically stable.  Pt
transferred to medicine service on [**9-3**].  GI to dictate whether
study to be done as inpatient vs. outpatient.  Also sent
yersinia and stool cultures.

2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Transfused 2 pRBCs with appropriate
bump in hematocrit.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: Likely secondary to hypovolemia.
Improved overnight after fluid resucitation.

4. Atrial fibrillation: In NSR on admission to ICU. Not on
warfarin.

5. CAD: Most echo with EF of 60%, though prior MIBI estimated
45%. Monitored for signs of volume overload with blood
transfusions.

6. GERD: IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] while ? UGI bleed.

7. Depression  offer support; no acute inpatient management.

8. Hypothyroidism: Checked TSH given amiodarone. Pt not on
levothyroxine. TSH elevated and FT4 low.  Likely will need
replacement.

PPX: PPI, Pneumoboots, bowel regimen
ACCESS: PIV  18g x2
CODE:  DNR/DNI

Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 98106**] was subsequently transferred to the regular floor
on [**9-3**].  At time of transfer, she was pain-free, had no acute
complaints, was hemodynamically stable with HRs in the 60s, BP
of 108/39, 94% RA.
She was started on Ciprofloxacin/Flagyll for empiric coverage
given her CT findings and GI suggested colonoscopy/endoscopy as
outpatient.  The patient had an uncomplicated floor course with
refusal of multiple medications including antibiotics and
laxatives.  At the time of d/c she had not yet stooled, however,
she had no rectal bleeding and her abdomen was not
uncomfortable.
It was thoughts that many of her sxs were due to hypothyroidism
and she was discharged on Levothyroxine.
Her Cr improved to baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a diagnosis of blood in your stool.
While in the hospital, we gave you some blood transfusions to
bring your blood counts back up to normal.  They stayed within
the normal range after that.  We aren't sure exactly where the
bleeding was coming from - one possibility is that because you
