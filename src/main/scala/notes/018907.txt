RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2124-12-20**] 1:02 PM
CT OF THE NECK WITH CONTRAST: The subcutaneous soft tissues of
the anterior neck are swollen with diffuse fat stranding
thickening and ill defined imaging of the fasical planes. The
process extends from the level of the clavicular heads to the
angle of mandible, and is more prominent on the right side.
Blurring of the fat planes between the anterior strap muscles
with increased asymmetric soft tissue infiltration both anterior
and posterior to the hyoid bone is noted, again largely right
sided Some suggestion of small ~1 cm fluid collections posterior
to the right submandibular gland and adjacent to the right
portion of the hyoid bone are found. Soft tissue stranding
extends to the right carotid sheath, blurring the fat plane.
However, both the internal jugular and carotid vasculature
within the neck enhance normally, with no evidence of filling
defects or irregularity.

The patient is intubated, likely accounting for a large amount
of fluid secretions within the nasopharynx, oropharynx, nasal
cavity, and right inferior maxillary sinus.

The base of the brain is unremarkable. No suspicious bone
lesions are found. Lung apices are clear.

IMPRESSION: Marked edema and stranding of the soft tissues of
the anterior neck as described, more prominent on the right
side, most consistent with cellulitis/fasciitis in light of the
provided history of infectious signs and symptoms. Possible
small, early fluid loculations adjacent to the right
submandiblaur gland and right portion of the hyoid bone.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
NECK,SOFT TISSUE US PORT  [**2124-12-21**] 12:48 PM
COMPARISON: CT scan from [**2124-12-10**].

ULTRASOUND OF THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE NECK: There is edema of
the strap muscles, which is slightly more conspicuous deep neck
soft tissues above the hyoid, without any discrete fluid
collections.

IMPRESSION: Edematous changes within the strap muscles in the
soft tissues of the right neck, without any discrete fluid
collections. Results were discussed with the covering resident
after the study was performed.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admited to the General Surgery service under Dr.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and placed in the SICU. IV Antibiotics were started
(Vanco, Zosyn, Clindamycin).  ENT was consulted who agreed with
IV Abx and following the patient wihtout surgery if unless her
condition worsened.  ON HD 2 the cellulitis was improved and
vent weaning began. On [**12-22**] decadron was started to help with
laryngeal swelling per the reccommendation of ENT; NG tube
placement was unsuccessful. There continued to be improvement in
the  neck swelling/erythema and airwayu swelling.  Pt was
extubated on [**12-23**] without event.  On [**2124-12-24**] the patient was
started on a full liquid diet and transfered to the floor with
continued improvement of her clinical course.  The antibiotics
were continued.  A PICC line was placed on [**2124-12-24**].  The
morning of [**2124-12-25**] the patient was found to be in rate
controlled AFib.  Given her rate control, multiple
comorbidities, and return to NSR, we opted not to anticoagulate.

There was worsening of the patients baseline anemia (HCT lowest
22.4).  This anemia of acute disease was observed; given no
signs of hypovolemia, we opted not to transfuse.

On [**2124-12-26**] the patient was tolerating a regular diet, was
afebrile, and had no signs of cellulitis.  She was discharged to
back to her Nursing Home to finish a 14-day course of
Vanco/Zosyn. Clindamycin was stopped [**2124-12-25**] per ID
recommendations.
