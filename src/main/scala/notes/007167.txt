Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
Pericardial tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm on [**2195-4-14**].
Pericardiocentesis on [**2195-4-16**].


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year old gentleman with a recently diagnosed very
large abdominal aortic aneurysm. He moved from [**State 4565**]
approximately five years ago.  Many of
his records are there and unobtainable.  In [**2179**], he apparently
had a cardiac arrest.  He survived that and underwent
angioplasty and stress testing since then.  He has also had two
carotid endarterectomies approximately 10 years ago, again
details are unknown.  A year ago, he had evidence of
pericardial effusion that required a pericardiocentesis at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital.  The etiology to this is unknown.

Past Medical History:
HTN, MI, COPD, kidney stones, smoker, hypothyroidism, not on any
of his medication.


Social History:
He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.  He lives alone.  Son
[**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 86148**]) is HCP and closest relative.


Family History:
No family history of premature coronary disease or sudden death.


Physical Exam:
Admission Baseline:
He was alert and oriented.
His weight is 135 pounds.  His blood pressure: 130/80, Pulse is
50/min. Neck supple.
No carotid bruits.
Palpation of the heart reveals normally placed PMI, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Respiratory effort is
adequate.
 Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was
nontender.  I did not feel for his aneurysm.  Extremities showed
no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Distal pulses are absent.
Inspection and palpation of skin is normal.  The gait and muscle
tone are normal.

Echo ([**4-16**]):
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a large pericardial effusion. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling. There is also
inconsistent very brief right ventricular diastolic collapse.

Compared with the images of the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2195-4-2**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased
and there are echo signs for early tamponade (however, estimated
right atrial pressure is low, which indicate low circulatory
volume. This may accentuate the echocardiographic signs of
tamponade).

Repeat echo ([**4-16**]):
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-16**],
large pericardial effusion is no longer present.

CXR ([**4-16**]):

IMPRESSION: Interval extubation without complication. Persistent
prominence of the cardiac silhouette related to known
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Four days before AAA repair, Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] had a thallium stress
test at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital which found no evidence of ischemia
or infarct and borderline left ventricular systolic function
with an ejection fraction of 50%. He was aymptomatic at
admission on [**2195-4-14**] and underwent AAA repair the same day,
which was complicated by an episode of hypotension/bradycardia
responsive to requiring some atropine and neosynephrine, IV
fluids, and two units of PRBCs. He was kept intubated overnight
and extubated the next morning. TSH done post procedure was 99
uIU/mL with T4 4.4ug/dL. Known hypothyroid but he had apparently
stopped taking his medications.

On [**4-16**], patient developed shortness of breath, BNP 784,
diuresed with IV lasix with some improvement; required 2L O2.
Echo was obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from
[**4-2**] with possible tamponade physiology. Cardiac enzymes were
also cycled for vomiting. Troponins were 0.05/ 0.06/ 0.07. Known
to have pericardial effusion preoperatively.  BNP 784, diuresed
with IV lasix with some improvement; required 2L O2. Echo was
obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from [**4-2**]
with possible tamponade physiology. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended percardiocentesis and deferral of further
diuresis.Cardiology was consulted and recommended
percardiocentesis and deferral of further diuresis. Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**]
was given gentle IVF to limit tamponade physiology and taken for
pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement. During the
procedure, he breifly became hypotensive and bradycardic,
responsive to 500 cc bolus; thought to be vagal episode at
sheath insertion. RA mean 6mmHg, RVEDP 8, wedge 12. BP 140 > 87
> 140s. HR 70s > 40s > 70s. Removal of 460 cc serous fluid.
Repeat ECHO afterwards with improvement.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] arrived at the CCU with no complaints. No chest pain.
