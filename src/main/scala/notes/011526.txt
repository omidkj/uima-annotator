HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old gentleman
who was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2147-2-5**]
with a one week history of increasing shortness of breath and
generalized edema with associated symptoms of bilateral arm
pain.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed left main severe three vessel coronary artery disease
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
2.  Status post cardiac arrest ten years ago.
3.  History of rheumatic fever.
4.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
5.  Anxiety.
6.  Psoriasis.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Obesity.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and lives with wife.
Denies tobacco use and admits to rare ETOH use.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Corgard 20 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lasix 10 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lipitor.
4.  Norvasc.
5.  Coumadin.
6.  Aspirin.

LABORATORY:  Preoperative laboratory data significant for a
hematocrit of 38.7, a BUN of 15 and a creatinine of 0.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] preoperatively for his coronary
artery bypass graft.  The patient underwent an ultrasound of
the carotids which showed a 60% right internal carotid artery
stenosis, an occluded left common and left internal carotid
artery.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2-7**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a coronary artery bypass graft times three,
[**Doctor First Name 4796**] to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal; saphenous vein graft to PDA.  In the
Operating Room, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
perioperatively due to the patient's low ejection fraction.
Please see operative note for further details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on
Milrinone and Levophed infusion.  The patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day
zero, continuing on Levophed and Milrinone with adequate
cardiac output.

On postoperative day number one, the Milrinone was weaned,
however, the patient's cardiac output decreased and it was
felt that he was not tolerating the weaning of the
medication.  The patient was returned to previous dose and on
postoperative day number two, the Milrinone was again weaned
and successfully discontinued by evening of postoperative day
number two the patient maintained adequate cardiac output and
index.  The Levophed was weaned to off.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was started on
Lasix.  The pulmonary artery catheter was removed.  Chest
tubes were removed without incident.

On the evening of postoperative day number three, the patient
had a 42 beat run of ventricular tachycardia.  At the time
the patient was asymptomatic with a stable blood pressure.
The patient was given two grams of magnesium and an
Electrophysiology Service consultation was obtained.

Recommendations were made to start the patient on low dose
beta blocker and plans were made for an Electrophysiology
Service study due to the patient's low ejection fraction and
ventricular ectopy.

The patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection
fraction of 30%, dilated right and left atrium, moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one to two
plus mitral regurgitation and one to two plus tricuspid
regurgitation.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit and continued
without any further ventricular tachycardia.  The patient
tolerated his low dose beta blocker, however, the patient
occasionally had episodes of bradycardia with rates in the
30s to 40s while asleep.  The patient was asymptomatic from
this.  This seemed to improve over the course of the next few
days.

On postoperative day number six, the patient's pacing wires
were removed without incident.  The patient was taken to the
Electrophysiology Laboratory for Electrophysiology studies
which were negative for any inducible ventricular
tachycardia.  It was felt at this time that the patient was
not a candidate for an AICD.  The patient's hematocrit was
noted to be 25; he was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part
of the hospital.  He began working with Physical Therapy.  In
the evening of postoperative day number seven, while the
patient was asleep, the patient was noted to have a period of
bradycardia with an approximately 4.5 second pause.
Electrophysiology Service was again re-consulted and it was
felt that the patient was asymptomatic and that the episodes
were only happening while the patient was asleep and there
was no further intervention required.

The patient continued on a heparin infusion for
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  Coumadin was
restarted.  By postoperative day number nine, the patient was
cleared from Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate 500
feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty.  By
postoperative day number ten, the patient's INR still
remained low in spite of three doses of Coumadin.
Discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] were had and it was decided to
discharge the patient to home on subcutaneous injections of
Lovenox with continued Coumadin therapy until the patient's
INR was therapeutic.

Of note, the patient had a TSH checked during his arrhythmia
work-up.  TSH was noted to be elevated at 7.4 and it was felt
that no therapy was needed but it would be recommended that
the patient have his TSH rechecked again in one month.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Temperature maximum 98.6 F.; pulse
84 in atrial fibrillation; blood pressure 104/62; respiratory
rate 16; room air oxygen saturation of 98%.  White blood cell
count 5.7, hematocrit 26.1, platelet count 378.

Sodium 140, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 25, BUN
13, creatinine 0.8, glucose 89.  The patient's PT is 14.1 and
INR 1.3.

Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented times
