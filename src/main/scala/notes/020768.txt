was without focal complaints. He denied chest pain. An EKG
showed LBBB that was old with no ischemic changes. A chest x-ray
showed a retrocardiac opacity. UA showed occasional bacteria and
was otherwise negative. Labs were notable for INR of 1.4,
hematocrit of 31.6 (near recent baseline), with white count of
9.9 (at baseline) and 4% bands. Platelets were 198. Other labs
notable for normal electrolytes, creatinine of 1.1 (up from
recent 0.6) and BUN of 21 (up from recent [**11-12**]). Tbili was
normal, with ALT of 18 and AST of 40. Albumin was 2.9. Lactate
was 2.2. The patient was treated with hydrochlorthiazide (for
reasons not clear), levofloxacin (for presumptive pneumonia),
and given potassium, Tylenol, and Zofran. In addition he
received 3.5 liters of intravenous fluids for drop in systolic
blood pressure to 80s, per report. He was started on a D5 drip.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2155-11-19**]
FINDINGS/IMPRESSION: Overall, this examination appears
unchanged. There is
cardiomegaly with prominent interstitial markings which appear
improved.
Relative increased left basilar opacity could represent
atelectasis, however infection cannot be entirely excluded. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is
tortuosity of the aorta.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2155-11-20**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower
extremity.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2155-11-21**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is a
marked
improvement with regression of the pre-existing signs indicating

overhydration. Unchanged enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
No pleural
effusions, no interval appearance of focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 81-year-old man with history of insulin dependent
diabetes, coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy,
likely metastatic pancreatic cancer by CT scan presented with
confusion, found with FSBG of 22, and admitted to the MICU on D5
drip.

In the MICU, patient's mental status quickly cleared once blood
sugars normalized.  Hypokalemia also quickly resolved as
insulin/blood sugar was corrected.

Patient was noted to be hyoxic on transfer to the floor.  His
CXR was initially concerning for pneumonia and he received a
dose of levofloxacin.  Repeat CXR was more consistent with
pulmonary edema; he had received 3 L of IVFs in the ED.  His
hypoxia resolved with Lasix.  CXR PA and lateral on the floor
showed resolution of pulmonary edema and no infiltrate.  His
levofloxacin was discontinued.  Upon discharge, he was satting
in the mid 90s on RA, even with ambulation.

He was discharged to home with hospice on his home medications
EXCEPT his Lantus was discontinued.  In 24 hours, he had only
required 2 units of Humalog.  For discharge, he was started on
metformin extended release 500 mg daily, to be increased to 1000
mg daily if his blood sugars remain >200 after 1 week.
