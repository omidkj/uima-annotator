History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28650**] is a 65 yo male with ulcerative colitis and
cirrhosis from NASH on the liver transplant list who was
transferred from [**Hospital 11066**] Hospital after presentation on the
evening of [**4-5**] for increasing abdominal distention and 13 lbs.
Weight gain over the past 3 weeks. In the ED at [**Hospital 11066**]
Hospital, T 97.8, BP 165/91, HR 82, spO2 99% on RA. He was given
Lasix 80 mg IV and Morphine 4 mg IV x 1. BG 439. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to our ED, T 98.9, BP 144/78, HR 104, RR 28, SpO2 96%
on RA. Patient was found to be confused and CT head was
performed. A paracentesis was attempted but unsuccessful due to
inability to penetrate the subcutaneous tissue. Patient was
treated empirically for SBP with Vancomycin 1 gram and Zosyn 4.5
gram.
.
On arrival to the floor, he passed an unquantified "large
amount" of bright red blood from his rectum. The aide states
that she did not visualize any stool in the toilet and only
blood. At the time of this interview, patient does not recall
what prompted him to go to the hospital. He states he feels
fine. He denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, SOB, or any
episodes of BRBPR at home.

Past Medical History:
-HTN
-DMII - takes insulin at home, diagnosed [**2168**]
-Cirrhosis - diagnosed by biopsy in [**2168**], thought secondary to
NASH, c/b ascites and LGIB s/p TIPS [**2176-12-3**] and s/p ablation of
three grade I esophageal varices
-S/p tonsillectomy
-Ulcerative colitis dx [**2176**] (thought to be the cause of LGIB)

Social History:
Lives alone, wife died in [**2168**]. Smoked for 33 yrs X 1ppd and
quit [**2160**]. Does not drink alcohol, no drugs. He has two
daughters who visit him frequently. Retired in [**1-/2177**], formerly
a vice president in manufacturing.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Bl Cx, Urine Cx - negative
Sputum ([**4-7**]) - MRSA
.
.
CARDIOLOGY:
EKG - Sinus tachycardia with monomorphic ventricular premature
beats. Left axis deviation. There may left atrial abnormality.
(A wave appears bifid in  lead II). Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2177-1-16**] ventricular premature beats are now seen.
Other findings are similar.
.
.
RADIOLOGY:
.
CXR ([**4-6**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. The
previously noted right lower lobe opacity has now resolved.
.
Abd U/S ([**4-6**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusion of TIPS and portal vein.
2. Cirrhosis, ascites and splenomegaly.
.
Abd U/S ([**4-19**]):
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Patent TIPS with velocities as described above. Globally,
these have
overall increased relative to the prior exam.
2. No flow within the left portal vein, as previously. Remainder
of hepatic
vasculature is patent.
3. Moderate ascites.
.
TIPS REDO ([**Date range (1) 26511**]):
Portal venogram, angioplasty of TIPS to 10 mm, thrombolysis of
TIPS and portal vein with angiojet, placement of infusion
catheter within
TIPS, angioplasty of portal vein to 12 mm. The patient is to
return tomorrow for reimaging following TPA infusion tonight.
Plan to possibly embolize existing large gastric varix at that
time.
.
KUB [**4-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to ascites. Within this
limitation, non-
specific bowel gas pattern.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, Mr [**Known lastname 28650**] is a 65M w DM2, Ulcerative Colitis and
cirrhosis [**2-3**] NASH s/p TIPS c/b portal hypertensive colopathy
and esophageal varices, admitted w confusion, weight gain,
abdominal distention, found to have TIPS occlusion, which likely
precipitated the ascites accumulation c/b SBP and hepatic
encephalopathy, with hospital course further c/b BRBPR s/p MICU
stay.
.
# Hepatic encephalopathy: likely from acute processes
(infection, TIPS occlusion, possible UC flair, hepatic
encephalopathy).  Improved after re-opening TIPS and treating
SBP.  Also continued lactulose and rifaximin with good effect.
.
# TIPS occlusion: On admission, patient had an ultrasound with
doppler which showed occlussion of TIPS and portal vein. Patient
went to IR and was intubated for the procedure. Underwent
angiojet, TPA, and dilation. After the procedure he was
extubated, became agitated and saturations were low, he was
re-intubated for concern of protection of airway. He underwent a
CTA of the chest to r/o PE as cause of hypoxia which showed no
PE and significant atelectasis. He was admitted to the MICU.
The CT also demonstrated likely infiltrate consistent with
pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin/cefepime then switched
to vancomycin/cetriaxone with good effect.  Upon leaving the
MICU he was stable on nasal cannula.  He was also continued on a
heparin gtt with good effect.  He was transitioned to lovenox
which was initially well tolerated but eventually resulted in
thrombocytopenia (drop to 20 from baseline of 50-70).  Given
this it was felt that the risk of bleeding was too great with
the lovenox and the patient was discharged without
anticoagulation.  Of note, his auto-anticoagulation is much
higher at this point than on admission (INR now 2.9 and 1.9) .
There was discussion on the inpatient service of a potential
retrialing of the lovenox as an outpatient as well as frequent
ultrasounds.
.
# SBP: Patient had a paracentesis on admission [**4-6**] which showed
4600 WBC (83%PMN) consistent with SBP, he had been treated
empirically with CTX.  He was given vancomycin/CTX for both
pneumonia and SBP for which he was to complete a 10 day course.
.
*GIB: Pt develop BRBPR likely [**2-3**] combination of portal
colopathy, UC in setting occluded TIPS with increased pressures.
Hct dropped from 36 to 23, received 5 units PRBCs in total.  His
Hct stabilized thereafter. Colonoscopy done showed impro
