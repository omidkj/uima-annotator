History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 y.o male with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% and ICD who
presented to [**Hospital6 **] with epigastric chest
pain and shortness of breath. At [**Hospital1 487**], he was found to have
a left bundle branch block that was not known to be old and as
such was taken to the cath lab. The LBBB was later noted to be
old, however during cath he was noted to have a total occlusion
to the OM2 as well as 2 tight lesions in the RCA. Of note, the
patient had been found to have inferior septal ischemia on a
stress test during outpatient workup.
In the cath lab, the patient subsequently developed acute
shortness of breath, at which point he was given 100mg of lasix
and started on a nitroglycerin drip. His symptoms did not
improve, at which point he was intubated and an intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed through right femoral access. He also
received angiomax and 300mg of clopidogrel. A swan was placed
which showed elevated pulmonary artery pressures and wedge
pressures between 37-44. Laboratory exam at [**Hospital1 487**] was
significant for Na 129, K 4.1, BUN 53, Cr 1.3, hemoglobin 16.6
and platelets of 135. Her PT was 19.4 and INR was 1.8. Dig level
of 0.8, and cardiac enzymes significant for CK of 135, MB of 7
and Troponin of 0.08 which was negative in their reference
range.

Review of systems could not be obtained due to intubation.

STUDIES:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-10-30**]
Large right upper lobe opacity is consistent with a right upper
lobe collapse. The NG tube tip is in the distal right mainstem
bronchus. The aortic balloon pump tip is 2.4 cm from the aortic
arch. ET tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carina. Swan-Ganz catheter
from inferior approach is in the main right pulmonary artery.
Left transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in the standard
position in the right ventricle. There is moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly.  Left perihilar and left upper lobe opacities
could be atelectasis or infection. There is gastric distention.

There is mild shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the
right side.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2182-10-31**]

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15
%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.5 cm2). The aortic stenosis is likely the
"low flow/low gradient" type. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT Ab/Pelvis [**2182-11-13**]
1. Findings suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. More
focal small nodular opacities within the lungs as described
above may represent focal regions of underlying
pneumonitis/pneumonia, possibly aspiration related in this
patient with distal trachea secretions. Small right simple
pleural effusion. Follow up CT chest in [**4-13**] months recommended
to confirm nodular opacity resolution.

2. No definite source of infection noted within the
abdomen/pelvis. No
biliary ductal dilatation.

3. Moderate sized right piriformis collection, probably
intramuscular
hematoma, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation
(infected collection cannot be excluded).

4. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aorta and
coronary
tree. Cardiac enlargement dilatation of both the left ventricle
and left
atrium.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2182-11-21**]
1.Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
free of
angiographically-apparent disease.  The LAD was heavily
calcified with
mild luminal irregularities.  The LCx had a short total
occlusion in the
mid CX into the OM2 which filled via collaterals from the OM1
and LAD.
The RCA had severe diffuse calcific diesease with calcific
70-80%
stenoiss in the proximal vessel, distal 50% stenosis adn 99%
calcific
stenosis at the RPDA/RPL bifurcation.
2.Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
presures with RVEDP 13 mmHg and PCWP 12 mHg.  The cardiac index
was
preserved at 2.6 l/min/m2.  There was mild systolic hypotension
SBP 87
mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PCI of RCA lesions with rotablation and DES via R
radial
approach and balloon pump support
5. Unsuccessful PCI of the OM.
6. Secondary prevention of CAD
7. Plavix 75mg daily for 12 months
8. Monitor for signs of left leg ischemia
9. Follow creatinine and HCT

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI to RCA with rotablation and IABP support.
3. Unsuccessful PCI of the OM.
4. Successful removal of IABP.

ECHO [**11-25**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
with near akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior, and
inferolateral wall. The anterior wall and anterior septum
contracts best, but are hypokinetic. Global systolic function
