Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
abnormal stress test

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-6-4**]  Aortic valve replacement (23 mm ON-X mechanical)
Coronary artery bypass graft x1 (left internal mammary artery >
left anterior descending) and pericardial patch closure
aortotomy


History of Present Illness:
54 year old male has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and known CAD s/p proximal LAD drug eluting stent in [**2124**] at
[**Hospital6 1708**]. Since that time he has been having
yearly stress tests. His most recent ETT
is from [**2131-5-24**]. This was remarkable for ST depression
and anteroseptal, apical and inferior ischemia which was not
present last year. He has also had a recent echo which has
showed a calculated valve area of 0.8cm2 and a peak aortic
gradient of 75mmHG. He was referred for right and left heart
catheterization to further evaluate. He was found to have ostial
LAD disease prior to old stent, as well as mean gradient of
30-35 mmHg across the AV w/ calculated [**Location (un) 109**] ~1.4 cm2. He is now
being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization and an
aortic valve replacement.

Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

right cusps appear fused.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).

Normal biventricular systolic fxn.
Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**].
There is a prosthetic aortic valve which is well-seated, with no
AI or leak.
Residual mean gradient = 10 mmHg.
Other parameters as pre-bypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
and underwent aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass
graft and pericardial patch surgery.  See operative report for
further details. In summary he had:
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm Onyx mechanical valve,
serial number [**Serial Number 89300**].
2. Coronary bypass grafting x1 with left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending coronary artery. His CARDIOPULMONARY
BYPASS TIME was 113 minutes with a
CROSS-CLAMP TIME of 92 minutes. He tolerated the operatin well.
He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics. Post
operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit for
post operative management. In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, woke neurologically [**Serial Number 5235**] and was
extubated without complications.  He remained hemodynamically
satble and was transferred to the floor on post operative day
one. Anticoagulation was initiated for mechanical aortic valve
protection, betablockers for heart rate management, and lasix
for gentle diuresis.  All tubes lines and drains were removed
per cardiac surgery protocols.  Physical therapy worked with him
on strength and mobility. The remainder of his post operative
course was uneventful and on POD4 he was discharged home with
visiting nurses
