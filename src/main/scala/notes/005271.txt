Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p unwitnessed fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right sided Craniotomy for Evacuation of Subdural Hematoma


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 yo woman with multiple medical problems,
including CAD s/p CABG and valve repair about 5 years ago. Since
then, she has been maintained on warfarin. There is also the
question of A-fib. She has a h/o breast CA and is s/p lumpectomy
about 10 years ago. Lastly, she appears to have mild baseline
dementia. She lives with her adult son [**Name (NI) **], upon whom she is
reliant for advanced ADLs.

The patient was in this state of health until the afternoon of
[**12-12**]. At that time her son was preparing to take her out when he
heard a loud thud upstairs. He came to find the patient down,
but
still alert. Of note, it seems she had at least [**11-18**] falls in the
past several months. She was taken to [**Hospital6 **]. There
she abruptly complained of a severe HA, and, shortly thereafter,
became obtunded.

A head CT showed a Right fronto-temporal-parietal SDH, about 2cm
in maximal thickness with layering suggestive of acute on
chronic
components. There was also evidence of subfalcine herniation
with
about 1.4cm of MLS. There was also evidence of uncal herniation
on the right. Patient was intubated and received 10mg Vitamin K
and 1 unit of FFP. Pt then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Here, we repeated a CT which was largely unchanged. I had an
extensive discussion with her three sons about the risks and
benefits of drainage, including the fact that she is unlikely to
have a full functional recovery, even if the operation is
performed. Whereas one of her sons opted to make her
comfortable,
the other two decided they wanted to do everything possible, so
the decision was made to proceed with the case.

Patient recived Profyl 9 prior to surgery. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
the operation this evening without complications. A post-op CT
showed full evacuation of the SDH and significant improval of
MLS

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**12-12**]
Similar appearance of acute on subacute R SDH/EDH. 2.3 cm L
subfalcine
herniation, 1.4-cm L shift at 3rd ventricle, L temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
entrapment,
early R uncal hernation.
Old R parietal infarct.
No fx or new hemorrhage.

CT Head [**12-12**]:
1. Expected post-operative changes status post right subdural
hematoma
evacuation with significantly improved mass effect. There is no
acute
hemorrhage.
2. Hypodense area in the left parietal infarct- indeterminate
chronicity and uncertain nature-No remote priors are avaialble
for comparison. Consider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] for better assessment if not
CI; if CI, followup with CT Head without and with contrast.

CT Head [**12-13**]:
Status post evacuation of right frontoparietal subdural hematoma

and craniotomy with persistent pneumocephalus and small subdural
collection as described in detail above with persistent
effacement of the sulci and midline shifting towards the left,
slightly smaller since the prior study measuring approximately
7.6 mm, previously 8.4 mm. Continuous followup with CT is
recommended until obtained a complete resolution of the hematoma
and pneumocephalus.

MRI Head [**12-14**]:
Small right frontal lobe acute infarction. Otherwise no
significant change
compared to the prior CT from one day prior. Changes status post
evacuation of a right hemispheric subdural are again noted.
Stable extra-axial collections bilaterally

MRI C-Spine [**12-15**]
There is loss of disc height from C4 through C7. No cord
contusion is seen. There are disc osteophyte complexes from C4
through C7 with mild central stenosis. Foramina are difficult to
evaluate due to motion artifact. There is no evidence for cord
contusion, epidural hematoma or compression fracture. There is
no evidence for ligamentous injury.

CXR [**2153-12-23**]

The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial
junction,
unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bilateral
opacities
mostly focusing in the perihilar and lower lobes are unchanged.
It might
represent a combination of pulmonary edema and potentially
present infectious process in particular in the lung bases and
should be correlated clinically.
No interval worsening of pulmonary edema is demonstrated, but on
the other
hand, no interval improvement has been seen.

TTE [**2153-12-25**]
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
borderline systolic function. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
