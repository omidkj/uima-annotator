Admission Date:  [**2146-4-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2146-4-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2088-11-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEUROMED

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the previously dictated
discharge summary.

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  1.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient's
neurological examination improved slightly to the point that
his eyes were open and he appeared to be awake, although he
did not track visual stimuli including examiner's faces.  His
pupils still remained round and reactive to light.  He did
have oculocephalic and corneal reflexes.  He again had little
to no spontaneous movements of his extremities but there was
noted to be some withdrawal on the right side to noxious
stimulation as well as some minimal withdrawal on the left
leg to noxious stimulation.  As a result of the appearance of
the MRI which showed bilateral watershed infarcts, there was
some suspicion for potential endocarditis causing multiple
embolic events.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed
no vegetations consistent with endocarditis.

Given the history of the positive blood cultures, this was
felt necessary to rule this out and after the TEE was done
this was felt not likely to be the diagnosis.  These infarcts
are presumed to be from an episode of hypotension during the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course in which his systolic blood
pressures dipped down to 70.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned before, the patient had
been cardioverted from A flutter to normal sinus rhythm on
Amiodarone.  He will continue on a daily maintenance dose of
Amiodarone.  He had no further events of A flutter. The
patient had cardiac enzymes done to rule out myocardial
ischemia as being the cause for atrial flutter and these did
not suggest any myocardial ischemia.

The patient was on a multitude of blood pressure lowering
medications including Clonidine, Norvasc, Lasix, Enalapril,
and metoprolol.  He was eventually switched over to simplify
the regimen to just labetalol and Enalapril and probably
could increase the doses of those medications should his
blood pressure not stay well controlled under systolic blood
pressure of 160 or less.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient still remains ventilated and
had received a tracheostomy on [**2146-4-20**].

4.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
placed on Lasix standing 20 mg b.i.d.  However, it was
noticed that his BUN to creatinine ratio was rising on the
order of 30 or above.  Furosemide was discontinued to allow
the patient's fluid status to re-equilibrate.  Initially this
was done to try to prevent any fluid overload that would
compromise his ability to come off the ventilator.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As mentioned before, the patient had a
transaminitis which was felt to be due to Dilantin.  His
transaminases have continued to come down and on the day
before discharge the patient's LFTs came down to ALT 107, AST
50, alkaline phosphatase 82, and total bilirubin 0.3.

6.  The patient continues to have an anemia of unclear
etiology.  His crit has been stable in the high 20s.  In
part, this is probably likely due to anemia of chronic
disease; however, iron studies are still pending at this
time.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was being treated for an
aspiration pneumonia immediately that was pansensitive
Staphylococcus aureus.  He finished a course of ceftriaxone
for this.  As mentioned, he had a coagulase-negative
staphylococcal infection in his blood for which he was on
vancomycin for a total of 14 days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: As in the previous discharge summary.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Multivitamins one cap p.o. q.d.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Bisacodyl 10 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. constipation.
4.  Nystatin ointment applied topically q.i.d. to effected
areas as needed.
5.  Enalapril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
10. Labetalol 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
11. Vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12 hours for eight additional
days to end on [**2146-4-28**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up in the stroke clinic
in about two months time.
