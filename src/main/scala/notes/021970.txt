History of Present Illness:
81 yo male with history of dementia, known aspiration with prior
episodes of aspiration pneumonia was transferred from his
residence at [**Hospital3 2558**] to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with altered mental
status, and hypoxemia. There, he was reported to be in 80's on
4L nasala canula and tachypneic to 30's. Of note, he has
reportedly been on levaquin and flagyl for a planned 10d course
since [**2194-2-7**].
.
His ED course was notable for SBP in 80s, tachycardia to 120s,
RR in 30s, afebrile, and sat well on NRB. He had an EKG w/ sinus
tach, Twave flattening diffusely. He remained hypotensive
despite 5L IVF; ultimately a femoral central line was placed and
he was started on levophed. In that setting, he went into rapid
atrial fibrillation; cardioverted -> back to NSR. His infectious
work up was notable for a worsening retrocardiac opacity by
chest film, evidence for UTI with UA demonstrating mod LE, >50
WBCs, and many bacteria. Initial WBC of 14.7 with left shift.
Initial lactate of 2.7. Sodium of 163 (down from 170 at nursing
home records). He was empirically treated with ceftazadime,
levaquin, and flagyl. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

Bl cx [**2194-2-12**] and [**2194-2-13**]:  [**3-28**] MSSA.  Multiple surveillance

Echocardiogram on [**2194-2-17**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic  function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal  wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right  ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The
aortic valve leaflets  (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or  vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude small valvular
vegetations.

Right lower extremity ultrasound on [**2194-2-13**]:
IMPRESSION:  No acute DVT.  Chronic recanalized DVT seen in the
right common femoral vein, which is improved since the prior
study of [**2189-4-7**], as its incompressibility extends from
the right common femoral vein to the proximal superficial
femoral vein bifurcation on today's exam.

Left lower extremity ultrasound on [**2194-2-14**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.

Renal Ultrasound [**2194-2-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate left-sided hydronephrosis.
2.  Multiple simple left-sided renal cysts.

Head CT on [**2194-2-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Ventriculomegaly without definite transependymal edema to
suggest acute hydrocephalus.  Please correlate clinically to
exclude causes of
noncommunicating hydrocephalus.

CXR on [**2194-2-12**]:
AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
There remains a dense retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity as
well as other smaller regions of opacity in the left mid and
lower lung.  Some of these appear slightly worsened since the
prior study.  There is some bronchial wall thickening. Pulmonary
vascularity is overall within normal limits.  No pleural
effusions are clearly seen. Degenerative change of the spine is
noted.
IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity as well as
other patchy left lung opacities which appear slightly worse
since the prior study, could be regions of infection or
aspiration.

Video Swallow Study [**2194-2-21**]:
Patient demonstrated aspiration with thin and nectar-thin
liquids.  Residue was also noted throughout the pharynx with
thicker consistencies, with large amount of secretions.


Brief Hospital Course:
81yo man with history of Dementia, aspiration, pneumonia
presents from nursing home with worsened mental status, hypoxia,
hypotension, and hypernatremia. Found to have MSSA bacteremia,
PNA and UTI with MSSA and enterococcus.
.
1. Sepsis: Pt presented with sepsis likely secondary to
aspiration pneumonia (cx +MSSA) and a UTI (MSSA, enterococcus).
He initially required pressors, intubation for support. Treated
initially w/vanc, zosyn, flagyl and narrowed to nafcillin given
culture data. Pt has history of severe aspiration, requiring
intubation in the past. He was successfully extubated [**2-18**] but
remains NPO given aspiration risk. ID is following for tx
guidance. Will complete 14 day course of antibiotics on
[**2194-2-26**].  All blood surveillance cultures since [**2194-2-14**] have
been no growth to date.  Repeat urine culture showed 10-100K
enterococcus, likely colonization in the setting of foley
catheter.  Foley was changed and repeat urine culture is
pending.
.
2. Hypernatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 97639**] presented to the MICU with an
initial serum sodium of 165. Per conversations with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
is chronically hypernatremic, but likely had exacerbation of his
baseline levels with decreased availability of free water at his
nursing home. He was treated with D5 infusion and free water
boluses and monitored for MS changes. His sodium has stabilized
and he continues with daily free water via NGT and later via
PEG.
.
3. RLE edema-  RLE w/chronic common femoral vv DVT,
recannalized. LLE neg for DVT. No treatment initiated at this
time.
.
4. RUE edema: at site of new PICC placement.  RUE US without
evidence of DVT.  CXR shows PICC in correct site.
.
5. Decubitus ulcers- Pt with chronic decubitus ulcers with
minimal skin breakdown. Per wound care, no change since prior
admission. Was followed throughout his hospital course by wound
care, who is managing his dressings.  Kinair mattress while
inpatient.
.
6. Anemia: baseline HCT high 20s-low30s.  Had received 1uPRB for
HCT drifting down, likely dilutional. Stools were guaiac
negative.
.
7. Dementia: Patient is baseline demented. Per family, no cha
