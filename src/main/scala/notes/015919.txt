HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory:  The patient initially found to be
   stridorous, however improved at the time of transfer.  The
   patient was admitted to the PICU for airway management and
   was given BiPAP p.r.n.  Oxygenation remained stable.
   Heliox was considered; however, was not needed.  The
   patient denied any further difficulty breathing and
   remained stable.  The patient was ultimately weaned to
   room air.  Pulmonary function tests were performed prior
   to discharge.  The patient was continued on Decadron and
   sent home with the prednisone taper.
2. Laryngeal neoplasm:  The patient was found to have a right
   true vocal cord mass, possibly benign polyp versus
   malignancy.  ENT was consulted.  Steroid treatment was
   initiated to reduce airway edema/swelling.  The patient
   was taken to OR on [**2104-11-10**] for excision of vocal cord
   mass.  Findings during surgery were right true vocal cord
   lesion with left arytenoid leukoplakia.  Tissue findings
   sent to the pathology in the office consistent with vocal
   cord polyp.  No evidence of malignancy noted.  The patient
   was kept on strict voice rest, given high dose steroids of
   Decadron 10 mg IV q.8h.  Continued on nebs and remained
   NPO.  At the time of discharge, the patient was talking
   without difficulty.  Diet was advanced and swallowing
   function was intact.  The patient did not demonstrate any
   difficulty breathing or swallowing.  The patient will have
   outpatient followup in [**State 5170**].
3. Diabetes:  The patient was continued on a dose of NPH
   [**12-14**].  Regular insulin sliding scale of the patient was
   held and the patient was tolerating foods again.  Given a
   diabetic diet and glucose remained stable during
   admission.
4. CAD:  The patient was continued on Zocor.  His blood
   pressure remained stable.  Denied any chest pain.
