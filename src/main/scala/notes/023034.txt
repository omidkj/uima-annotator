History of Present Illness:
65yo F smoker with BPD, OSA on CPAP at home, bronchitis/PNA in
past, questionable history of COPD or asthma (no PFTs in our
system) admitted with cough and wheezing x1 week. Per patient
she has had a recent stomach flu and had 2X syncopal episodes
earlier this month. She has also been seen by a neurologist who
prescribed salt tabs and encouraged her to drink more fluids
throughout the day and this helped her syncope. She also was
recently switched from oral medications to insulin for her
diabetic control. Per OMR she refused flu, H1N1, and pneumovax
vaccines this year. Otherwise, she was in her usoh until one
week ago when she developed a cough, URI type symptoms, and
wheezing. This progressed so that today the cought was so bad
she decided to come into the ED.
On arrival to the ED VS: 98.4 85 168/82 16 96 on neb, 90% on RA.
Patient reported chest "tightness" especically when taking a
breath. On exam she had diffuse wheezes bilaterally and
decreased BS bilaterally. A CXR revealed no consolidations or
effusions. BNP was 190. She was given NEbs, mag, azithro for
presumed COPD exacerbation. Because she has an allergy to
steroids (diffuse systemic reaction and worsening of mania)
steroids were held. ET CO2 was 20s and then after adjusting was
36-40. Of note: did not get CTA because of prior contrast
allergy. No heparin started but ed attending was "kicking it
around". At 17:15 she had a temp to 100.9 in the ED and given
lactate elevation her abx coverage was broadened to CTX/Levo.
Blood cultures were sent. Unfortunately, after the CXR her O2
was left off and she desatted into the 80s on RA. She was then
put on BiPAP and was reportedly doing much better on Bipap.
VS on transfer: 89 155/68 19 97% on Bipap 40% 5/5 but will have
to be on 5L to transfer over.
.
On the floor, patient feels fine. Does not feel short of breath
and does not want to use Bipap. she reports having bronchitis
every spring around this time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69843**] is a 65yo F with h/o OSA, DM2, admitted with likely
COPD exacerbation. Her hospital course is outlined by problem
below:
.
#. COPD exacerbation: No PFTs in the system on admission so
unclear whether really has asthma/COPD but has been admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] in past with bronchitis and is smoker so thought to be
most likely explanation of her symptoms. She was treated with
ipratropium and albuterol nebs, fluticasone inh, CTX/azithro
(CTX d/cd on [**2-27**]), and solumedrol 125 mg IV q 8H (weaned to PO
prednisone on [**2200-2-27**]) with significant improvement in her
symptoms. Her oxygen was weaned; at the time of discharge, her
oxygen saturations were 90-92% on room air, and she felt that
her breathing was at baseline. She was encouraged to stop
smoking. She should have PFTs, smoking cessation counseling, and
pulmonary follow-up as an outpatient. She refused nicotine patch
as an inpatient.
.
#. OSA: she refused CPAP while in the hospital.
.
#. DM2: Continued her home dose of long-acting insulin and
covered with a sliding scale; she was discharged to continue her
home doses of insulin.
.
She was also continued on her home medications for her bipolar
disorder, hypothyroidism, and diabetic neuropathy and kept on a
diabetic carbohydrate consistent diet.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 111219**] code status was confirmed with her as DNR/DNI.
