Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity
size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Severe mitral annular calcification. Mild valvular MS (MVA
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present.

2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.

5.The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

6. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2167-3-27**] at 845am.

Post bypass

1. Patient is a paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

3. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. No aortic
insufficiency seen. Peak gradient across the aortic valve is 27
mm Hg and the mean gradient is 11 mm Hg.

4. Mild mitral regurgitation is present.

5. Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2167-3-27**] Ms. [**Known lastname 12330**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue
aortic valve.  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **].  Please see the operative note for details of the case.
 She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in
critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care
unit.  She was extubated on the following day and her pressors
were weaned.  She was drowsy but easy to arrouse. On
post-operative day two her chest tubes were removed.  She was
gently diuresed.  She experienced atrial fibrillation and
converted to sinus rhythm on amiodarone and beta blockers.  On
the following day she was transferred to the
