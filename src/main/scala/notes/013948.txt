Radiology
[**12-13**] CXR: Increased linear opacity in the lower lobe, best seen
on frontal radiograph, concerning for early pneumonia. Calcified
pleural plaques suggestive of prior asbestosis exposure.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo m w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, PVD, and h/o atrial fibrillation
presents with fever, transient hypotension, and atrial
fibrillation. Given hypotension, he was initially admitted to
the medical ICU. Given he remained stable, he was transferred to
the general medical floor. ABx were held because transient fever
thought to be [**1-12**] viral etiology.

# [**Name (NI) **] Unclear etiology. Possible that patient is
preload sensitive and episode of A.Fib precipitated drop in BP.
Sepsis less likely- no leukocytosis, lactate 1.1, cortisol WNL.
Possible component of decreased p.o. intake and low vol status,
2L IVF while inpt. Monitored on telemetery throughout admission.


# Fever- The patient was afebrile on transfer to the floor. The
etiology remained unclear, although a viral illness is most
likely. Although initial CXR showed possible early left lower
lobe pneumonia, this was felt to be less likely, given lack of
corresponding sings/symptoms. He remained stable off
antibiotics.

# Atrial fibrillation- Likely induced by fever. Has a history of
in the setting of stress event. Discussed with primary
cardiologist who recommended anticoagulation.
HD 1: Heparin Gtt started, coumadin started after PTT
therapeutic, d/c on Lovenox until therapeutic on coumadin;
continued rate control with metoprolol; no indication for rhythm
control at this time since it remains unclear if hypotension was
related to onset of afib.

# thrombocytopenia- likely [**1-12**] acute infectious etiology-
improved HD 2. No evidence of medication effect (no recent
changes) although concomitant eosinophilia concerning. No recent
heparin prior to admission

# ARF on CRI- baseline Cr 1.2 in [**5-16**]. Probable prerenal
etiology. Improved w/fluid.

# CHF- likely [**1-12**] fluid resuscitation in the setting of atrial
fibrillation.  CE's (-)x3.

# Anemia- iron studies [**10-16**] show iron deficiency anemia, pt was
started on iron therapy outpt, repeat iron studies [**12-17**] showed
iron improved; last colonoscopy [**1-16**] showed Grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
