Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2168-8-31**], the patient underwent
transduodenal ampullary resection, which went well without
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley
catheter, with CIWA protocol in place for alcohol withdrawal,
and an epidural for pain control.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable.
On POD#1 ([**9-1**]): The epidural was continued for pain control, and
the foley catheter was maintained. IVF were continued, and the
patient remained NPO. Due to an episode of questionable chest
pain, an ECG, CXR, and cardiac enzymes were obtained, all of
which were negative. In the evening, his pain control was split
between an epidural and a PCA.
On POD#2 ([**9-2**]): He was continued on IVF, and due to an episode
of brief mom[**Name (NI) 12823**] unresponsiveness responding well to
supplementary oxygen, cardiac enzymes and CXR were repeated,
which were once again unremarkable. On this day his epidural was
discontinued, but foley catheter was maintained for strict input
and output monitoring.
On POD#3 ([**9-3**]): Due to some concern for erythema around his
incision, he was placed on IV antibiotics (cefazolin). IVF were
continued, and his PCA was maintained for pain control. Due to
severe agitation and signs of withdrawal in the evening, he was
transferred to the SICU for further care.
On POD#4 ([**9-4**]): He continued to display symptoms of withdrawal,
for which the CIWA protocol was employed. His foley catheter was
maintained, and IVF were continued.
On POD#5 ([**9-5**]): He had some continued, but improved symptoms of
withdrawal and agitation. His foley catheter was maintained, and
he was continued on IVF. He remained NPO for diet. His pain was
controlled with intermittent IV dilaudid.
On POD#6 ([**9-6**]): Patient was transferred on the floor from ICU
in stable condition. His diet was increased to clears and was
well tolerated. Small amount of erythema was noticed around
incision without any drainage.
On POD#7 ([**9-7**]): Diet increased to full liquids. Patient
ambulate independently. He was started on IV Cefazolin
empirically s/t redness around his wound was increased and small
fluid collection was palpable on right lateral site of incision.
JP drain was removed.
On POD#8 ([**9-8**]): Patient remained afebrile. Diet advanced to
regular and well tolerated. Right lateral aspect of incision was
open and moist-to-dry dressing was started, patient will
continue to have moist-to-dry dressing at home with VNA. The
patient was discharged home in stable condition.
The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. Electrolytes were routinely
followed, and repleted when necessary. The patient's white blood
count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection. Wound care was performed regularly and thoroughly.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay;
insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. The patient received
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this
stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
