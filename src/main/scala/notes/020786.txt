Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
bilateral saddle pulmonary emboli

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous thrombectomy x2

History of Present Illness:
44 yo F with no previous medical history who is transferred from
an OSH for bilateral saddle pulmonary emboli who is now s/p
percutaneous thrombectomy. She presented to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital this
am complaining of anxiety with hyperventiliation as well as mid
back pain with leaning forward. The pt was noted to be anxious
on exam and breathing in a paper bag and was given 1 mg IV
ativan. An EKG was significant for sinus tachycardia with a
S1Q3T3 and RV strain. An ABG was 7.12/25/120/8/97.8 on a NRB and
the pt was intubated. This was then followed by HR 32 and the pt
was given atropine with improvement in HR to the 50s. A stat
chest CTA was significant for bilateral saddle pulmonary emboli
with thrombus also seen in the more distal branches of the
bilateral pulmonary arteries. Shortly thereafter, the pt was
started on levophed at 4 mcg/kg/hr which was titrated up to 20
mcg/kg/hr and vasopressin 0.04 units/hr for SBPs in the 40s. A
HCO3 gtt was also started at 200 cc/hr for severe respiratory
acidosis on a rpt ABG. She was given 10 units retaplase IV X 1
prior to being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival, labs were significant for Hct 34.2 and ABG
7.03/69/90/20 with lactate of 6.3. The pt was sent immediately
to the OR for percutaneous tPA and thrombectomy. In the OR, a
TEE was significant for massive clot burden in the main PA, R
PA, and L PA with some flow distally. A percutaneous
thrombectomy was performed of the main PA and right PA with
residual clot but flow visualized in the right PA. Levophed and
vasopressin were shut off and she was started on neo at 2
mcg/kg/min and epi gtt at 0.04. She was also given 100 meq HCO3
and was then transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
ROS unable to be performed as pt sedated and intubated. Per her
family, the pt has not had any recent travel and has not
complained recently of shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg
swelling/pain. Of note, the family reports that she is a heavy
smoker and is on OCPs.

Pertinent Results:
Port CXR [**11-23**] - underinflation with elevation of R diaphragm
and bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and
pulmonary vascularity are grossly unremarkable. ETT present in
the trachea above the carina.
.
Chest CTA [**11-23**] - large central saddle pulmonary embolism
present with thrombus seen beyond this central saddle embolus in
the central and more distal branches of both pulmonary arteries.
Scatterred areas of ground glass opacification in both lungs
with some pleural thickening on the right. 3 cm long stenotic
semenet of hte R common iliac artery on the order of 70% with
less than 50% segmental stenosis of the L common iliac artery.
.
TEE [**11-23**] - Pre-pulmonary angiography:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. There is an area of echogenicity in
the right pulmonary artery consistent of pulmonary embolism.
There is limited flow across this area. An area of echogenicity
in the main pulmonary artery cannot be excluded. Unable to
visualize the left pulmonary artery.
8. IVC is dilated.
Post-pulmonary angiography:
1. The area of echogenicity in the right pulmonary artery has
decreased and there is an improvement of flow along the right
pulmonary artery. There is flow along the main pulmonary artery.
The left pulmonary artery remains difficult to visualize.
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**11-23**]): Thrombus is
identified within the right popliteal vein extending proximally.
 However, the superficial femoral vein on the right appears
patent with normal compressibility, waveforms, and augmentation.
Partially occlusive thrombus is identified within the right
common femoral vein. On the left, partially occlusive thrombus
identified within the left popliteal vein.  Otherwise, the left
superficial femoral and common femoral veins appear patent with
normal compressibility, waveforms, and augmentation.
IMPRESSION:  Thrombus identified within the right popliteal vein
with non-
occlusive thrombus within the right common femoral vein.  Likely
thrombus
identified within the left popliteal vein.
.
CTA [**11-24**]: Bilateral pulmonary embolism as described above.
Multifocal opacities/nodular opacities/ and consolidation in the
lungs. Notably, the area of consolidation in the right lower
lobe
appears to have components of ischemia/infarction; less likely
would be a component of pneumonia. Recommend follow up after
clinical treatment to demonstrate resolution of these findings.

Soft tissue stranding in the anterior superior chest,
surrounding the
trachea in the superior mediastinum, and supraclavicular
regions.
.
Echo [**11-24**]: LV unusually small. RV markedly dilated. severe
global RV free wall hypokinesis. abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with RV volume overload. no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal images due to patient being intubated.
The right ventricle appears markedly dilated and moderately to
severely hypokinetic. Pressure overload of the right ventricle.
LV cavity appears small, probably due to compressive effect of
the large RV. LV function appears normal/hyperdynamic.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned above, on arrival to BIMDC labs were significant
for Hct 34.2 and ABG 7.03/69/90/20 with lactate of 6.3. The pt
was sent immediately to the OR for percutaneous tPA and
thrombectomy. In the OR, a TEE was significant for massive clot
burden in the main PA, R PA, and L PA with some flow distally. A
percutaneous thrombectomy was performed of the main PA and right
PA with residual clot but flow visualized in the right PA. Pt
was brought up to the CCU where she was very tenuous with
hypotension requiring quadruple pressors, and multisyste
