Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2106-2-11**]
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty with drug eluting stent

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61412**] is a 60 year-old male active smoker who has not seen
a doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61413**], with no known past medical history, who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital following acute onset of
shortness of breath last night.

He notes that he was laying in bed when he became acutely short
of breath during the night prior to admission. His breathing
became progressively more labored, and he called 911. He reports
associated stomach upset and diaphoresis with the shortness of
breath, but denies N/V. He was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital,
where a CXR was consistent with CHF. His EKG revealed peaked T
waves anteriorly and ST depressions anterolaterally. BNP 1190.
He was administered ASA, Plavix, NTG, Heparin IV and Integrillin
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Of note, per report, Mr. [**Known lastname 61414**] blood pressure dropped
precipitously at the OSH following administration of Metoprolol.
It is unclear what his HR was at that time.

By the sister's account, Mr. [**Known lastname 61412**] has had several episodes of
shortness of breath over the past few weeks. He seems to be
tachypneic at baseline.

Past Medical History:
No known past medical history.

Social History:
He lives with his sister. [**Name (NI) **] is an active smoker, with a 60
pack-year smoking history. Remote history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
No known family history of CAD.

Relevant studies in admission:
[**2106-2-11**] CXR: Note is made of mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal
contours are within normal limits. Note is made of patchy
opacities in the right lower lobe, which can represent early
pneumonia. Opacity overlying the right apex is noted, which can
be due to projection, however, please follow in repeated chest
x-ray. Note is made of mild edema, more prominently on the
right.

IMPRESSION:
1) Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, which probably
representing pneumonia.
2) Cardiomegaly, edema more prominently on the right.
3) Opacity overlying the right apex, which can be due to
projection, however, please repeat the study with better
positioning.

[**2106-2-11**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD had 50%
and 70%
mid vessel stenoses as well as an occluded major diagonal
branch. The
LCX had a 95% hazy OM1 lesion. The RCA had a well collaterized
mid
vessel occlusion.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right
sided
pressures (mean RA 13 mmHg), moderately elevated pulmonary
pressures
(PAD 33 mmHg), and moderately elevated left sided pressures
(mean PCWP
31 mmHg) with a moderately depressed cardiac index (1.9
l/min/m2).
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful stenting of the OM1 with a 2.5x24mm Taxus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] with a 2.75mm Highsail baloon at 18 atms (See PTCA
comments).
  5. Unsuccessful attempt at angioplasty of the totally occluded
D1 and
proximal RCA due to inability to cross the lesions with the wire
(See
PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful stenting of the OM with a Drug Eluting Stent.
4. Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA of the totally occluded D1 and
the
totally occluded proximal RCA.

[**2106-2-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. LVEF 15-20%. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic  regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LVEF
(? multivessel CAD?). Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old male smoker with no significant past medical
history, transferred from outside hospital with CHF and lateral
EKG changes. His hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) CAD: Mr. [**Known lastname 61412**] was taken directly to the cath lab on
arrival. Coronary angiography revealed serial LAD lesions,
totally occluded RCA with collaterals and occluded diagonal felt
to be old, as well as what appeared to be an acute total
occlusion of the OM1. Intervention was performed on the latter
with a drug eluting stent. Hemodynamics revealed RA 11, PA
42/27/35, PCWP 24 and CO/CI 3.01/1.86. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia, LAA, LVH, lateral ST depressions. His cardiac
enzymes were elevated (peak CK 74, Trop 3.08 on admission),
consistent with a NSTEMI felt related to acute OM occlusion. He
was admitted to the CCU for post-MI management and diuresis.

In the CCU, he was started on ASA, Plavix, high-dose Lipitor for
secondary prevention, and ACE. He was also placed on a NTG drip
for a short period of time for tight BP control, quickly weaned
off. An echo was performed on [**2106-2-12**] and revealed severe LV
dysfunction with EF 15-20%, with global hypokinesis, felt likely
mixed cardiomyopathy.

Beta-blockade therapy was initiated on [**2106-2-14**], and ACE therapy
was titrated in hospital. The importance of medication
compliance and smoking cessation was also emphasized, but
continued emphasis and close follow-up will be required as an
out-patient. Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] (cardiology) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1922**]
([**Company 191**]) was arranged prior to discharge. He was discharged on ASA,
Plavix, Lisinopril 10, Coreg 3.125 [**Hospital1 **] and Lipitor 80.
Consideration should be given to titration of beta-blockade as
an out-patient.

2) CHF: As mentioned above, CXR on admission was consistent with
CHF, and PCWP in cath lab was elevated at 24. An echo performed
on [**2106-2-12**] revealed EF 15-20% with global hypokinesis. While in
hospital, he was diuresed with Lasix with parallel improvements
in his CXRs and decreased oxygen requirements. ACE inhibitor
therapy was initiated, and he was discharged on Lisinopril 10 mg
PO QD and a standing dose of Lasix 20 mg PO daily.

3) Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 61412**] was noted to have sinus tachycardia on
admission. Thyroid function studies revealed low TSH at 0.23,
but normal free T4 and T3, felt most likely consistent with sick
euthyroid. Repeat thyroid function studies are advi
