EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE

Date: [**2180-6-21**]
Time: 02:10

The patient is a 25F with a h/o asthma who p/w right sided
abdominal/flank pain that has been persistant since last night.
She describes the pain as constant and not worsened with
urination, but worse with movement. She also reports nausea with
three episodes of vomitting. She denies f/c, dysuria,
diaphoresis, cp, sob. She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] where she had a CT scan, which was positive for a 6 mm
proximal ureteral stone. Her pain was not controlled despite
multiple doses of IV Dilaudid. She also had nausea with
vomitting, which was treated with IV Zofran. She also received
IV benadryl for anxiety. She was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further pain control, possible urological intervention and since
her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2472**], is here. She
endorses diarrhea on Sunday and Monday and a 60 lb weight loss
in the past ~three months, which she attributes to stress from
studying for the MA bar exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initial Urology Course:
25F h/o asthma p/w right sided abdominal/flank pain and found to
have a 6mm proximal ureteral stone, ARF and leukocytosis at OSH

1. Ureteral stone: Likely cause of n/v and leukocytosis. Seen by
Urology who recommends conservative management at this time.
- IVF
- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg
- IV hydromorphone prn pain
- IV ondansetron 4 mg q8h prn n/v

2. Leukocytosis: Likely reactive. U/A mostly bland. Will hold
ABx for now given lack of bands/fever/comorbidities with a low
threshold for starting Unasyn if spikes.
- F/u Bcx x 2

3. Acute renal failure: Worsening sCrt compared to OSH. Evidence
of post-obstructive etiology. DDX includes prerenal causes from
urinary frequency. Urology has seen her in the ED did not think
a surgical intervention for ureteral stone was indicated. Will
following kidney function and electrolytes closely.
- Renally dose medications
- F/U FENA

4. Asthma: Stable.
- Albuterol/atrovent NEBs q6h prn sob/wheeze

5. Anxiety:
- Diazepam 5 mg po renally dosed prn anxiety

6. ADHD: Stable. Will hold dextroamphetamine/amphetamine
(Adderal) for now given worsening renal function.
- Restart Adderal once renal fuction improves.

7. Migraine: Stable. She has not been taking her topiramate
prophylaxis for the past few months.

. FEN: NPO for now and ADAT (given nausea w/ vomitting)
. Access: PIV
. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots for VTE prophylaxis.
. Precautions: None
. Communication: Patient
. Dispo: Pending clinical improvement
. CODE: Full

MICU Course
25 yo woman, with PMH asthma and obesity, with sepsis secondary
to infected ureteral stone s/p ureteral stenting, admitted to
ICU for management of urosepsis, as well as extubation and
post-procedural monitoring.

1. Sepsis: [**1-5**] to UTI given Proteus growing in blood.  Symptoms
improved after stent placed.  Narrowed to cipro once Proteus
sensitivities came back.  CXR negative for intrapulmonary
process.

2. Ureteral stone: Right obstructing stone s/p stent placement
and drainage.  Pain control was initially with morphine then
changed to dilauded .25 mg Q3. Will need eventual stone removal
with urology.

3. Hypoxia: Thought to be secondary to splinting due to pain
from right-sided pain; chronic asthma may also have played some
part. Patient is currently on 2L nasal cannula. Chest x-rays
were performed (see 1. Sepsis) and patient was given asthma
meds. Incentive spirometer should be considered once patient's
pain has decreased significantly.

4. Acute kidney injury: Appeared to be a combination of
pre-renal (FeNA<1, high urine Osm) and obstructive pattern.
Creatinine decreased over
