.
CXR [**3-8**]:
Marked limitations. As best can be determined, there is question
of new opacities in the medial right lung base and at the right
hilar region.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Aspiration is also a
consideration.  Correlate clinically.
.
CXR [**3-9**]:
Right IJ catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. There is
eventration of the left hemidiaphragm with interposition of
colon subjacent to the diaphragm. There is atelectasis at the
right lung base as well as focal consolidation of the right
lower lobe. There is focal consolidation of the right perihilar
region as well. There is little change since the prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 805**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with dementia, DM2, CAD, DVT
s/p IVC filter, and colonic pseudo-obstructions who presents
from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with AMS and was admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.
.
# Septic Shock/Pneumonia:  Patient met SIRs criteria in the
setting of pneumonia with evidence of organ insult (AMS and
ARF).  He was transferred to the MICU where he required 4L nc,
and was started on a 14day course for HAP w/ vanc and zosyn, and
lisinopril held.  He required levophed for pressor support while
in the ICU until his pressure normalized.  He was ruled out for
flue and blood/urine cx were w/o growth.  His fever defervesced
and leukocytosis resolved with treatment.  He was transferred to
the floor where he was weaned off oxygen.  His cough, mental
status, blood pressure, and Cr improved with treatment.  A picc
line was placed for antibiotic management.
-- Please continue vanc/zosyn for hospital aquired pneumonia
-- Please check a vanc trough after 3rd dose of vanc, with a
goal between 15-20
.
# ARF: In the setting of hypovolemia.  His Cr improved with
IVFs.  His medications were renally dosed.  Cr on discharge was
0.8.
.
# Anemia: Patient had a hct drop after receiving ivfs (close to
his baseline prior to hospitalization).  His hemolysis labs: t
bili and hapto were negative.  He was continued on his home
supplements B12/iron.
.
#. Recurrent Syncope: Patient has recurrent syncope due to
presumed vasovagal effects in the context of large BM's and
large hiatal hernia. On this admission, dehydration was avoided.
 His home ace-inhibitor was held and not restarted on discharge
with plan for outpatient follow up.
.
#. Hypertension: Given his presentation of shock, requiring
pressor support in the MICU, patient's lisinopril was held and
not restarted at discharge (please see above).
.
# Diabetes Type II: Patient was continued on a HISS while
inpatient.
