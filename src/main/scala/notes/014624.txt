Service:  PCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 -year-old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times two, a porcine mitral
valve replacement, and class III congestive heart failure.
The patient was recently admitted from [**2122-4-1**] to [**2122-4-7**]
to the Coronary Care Unit East where he received inotropic
support with milrinone for increased creatinine of 2.8.  His
creatinine improved on the milrinone, it was 2.2 on the day
of discharge.  He was asymptomatic during his
hospitalization.  He did not have any shortness of breath,
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
or lower extremity swelling.

During that admission, his Lasix had been decreased from 40
mg [**Hospital1 **], to q day, his carvedilol dose was increased from
3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On [**4-16**], the patient's
Lasix dose had been increased back to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] times three
days for dyspnea on exertion and a weight gain of three to
four pounds.  The patient reports that concurrent with the
weight gain, he has noticed a decrease in urine output over
the past few days prior to admission.  However, he has not
noted any difference in his breathing.

The patient states that he can walk half a mile before he
develops shortness of breath.  He denies any orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, increase in
abdominal girth.  No dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance.  However, his creatinine had been monitored
since his discharge and was found to be 5.2 on [**2122-4-23**].  The
patient was then encouraged to enter the hospital for a
direct admission to the Coronary Care Unit for possible IV
milrinone and Swan Ganz catheterization to assist filling
pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post a coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2102**].  A re-do coronary artery bypass graft
was performed in [**2121-3-26**].  The patient had a
catheterization in [**2122-1-26**] in which he received a stent
to his vein graft to the left anterior descending.
2.  Severe class III congestive heart failure.  On [**12/2121**],
ejection fraction was found to be less than 20%.  He is
status post a porcine mitral valve replacement from [**2121-3-26**].  He is status post a DDD pacemaker which he received in
[**2121-3-26**] for complete heart block after his coronary artery
bypass graft.  He had a revision of his pacer in [**2121-12-26**] performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  A history of atrial fibrillation which occurred post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2121-3-26**].  The patient was
initially started on Coumadin, but was stopped secondary to
hemoptysis in [**2121-7-26**].
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
2.0.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg po q day, Zestril 5.0 mg
po q day, carvedilol 6.25 mg po bid, Lipitor 10 mg q Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, Digoxin 0.125 mg q Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, aspirin 325 mg po q day, amiodarone 100 mg po q day,
Prilosec 20 mg po q day, Flonase prn.

ALLERGIES:  Include penicillin and doxycycline which gives
the patient a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired architect.  He
denies smoking or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient was a
pleasant, elderly gentleman, lying in bed, flat, in no
apparent distress.  Vital signs: temperature 96.3 F, his
heart rate was 70, his respirations were 14, blood pressure
of 78/39.  His baseline systolic blood pressures run in the
70's to 80's.  His oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  dry mucous membranes,
oropharynx is clear, anicteric.  Neck: his jugular venous
pulse was about 8.0 cm.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm, there was a left sided heave, a positive S3, and a
III/VI holosystolic murmur heard at the right and left upper
sternal borders.  Lung examination clear to auscultation
bilaterally, some mild left base wheezing.  Abdomen: soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds were heard, no
hepatosplenomegaly, no ascites.  Extremities: no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 135, potassium of 5.3, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 21, BUN of 129, creatinine of 5.8 with a baseline
of 2.0, glucose 154.  White blood cells 4.7, hematocrit 32.9,
platelets of 131,000.  PT 13.7, PTT 28, INR 1.2.  ALT 21, AST
20, alkaline phosphatase 78, amylase 122, total bilirubin
0.3.  Digoxin 1.2, phosphate 6.6.

An echocardiogram in [**2121-12-26**] showed an ejection
fraction of less than 20%, globally depressed left ventricle,
except for the posterior basal region, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension.  A
catheterization on [**2122-2-14**] showed a wedge pressure of 20, a
pulmonary arterial pressure of 50/16, right ventricular
pressure 44/8, and a right atrial pressure of 10.

Electrocardiogram showed a paced rhythm, no changes noted
from [**2122-1-26**] electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray showed
blunting of the left costophrenic angle, otherwise no changes
from a chest x-ray on [**2122-2-11**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was a 78 -year-old gentleman
with severe congestive heart failure and an increase in
creatinine.  There was little clinical evidence for
decompensation of his heart failure.  The patient was denying
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He had no rales on
lung examination.  He had no increase in O2 requirements.
His physical examination suggested that he was more likely
"dry."

Given his acute renal failure and a creatinine of 5.8, his
Lasix, Zestril, and Digoxin were all held.  A Swan Ganz
catheter was placed to assess his pressures.  His pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was found to be 14, supporting a
diagnosis of prerenal dehydration, not congestion.  He
received supplemental fluid boluses, which reduced his
creatinine slowly.  He had a mild increase in his central
venous pressure with fluid, but no appreciable difference in
his pulmonary wedge pressure.

By 10:00 PM on [**4-25**], his creatinine was 4.5.  He was then
placed on continuous maintenance fluids which brought his
creatinine down to 4.2 at 07:00 AM on [**2122-4-26**].  There were
no signs of heart failure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] agreed with the
Cardiology team that the patient could be discharged on
[**2122-4-26**], as his creatinine continued to decrease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  There were some changes to the
patient's medications while he was in house.  The patient was
started on Cozaar 25 mg po q day instead of his Zestril
admission drug.  The patient was instructed to decrease his
Lasix dose to 20 mg per day from 40 mg at his admission,
starting on [**2122-4-27**] (Monday).  His potassium supplements
were decreased to 20 mEq per day from 60 mEq at admission.
He was instructed to continue his Digoxin dose as well as his
carvedilol at 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **], amiodarone 100 mg q day, Prilosec
20 mg q day, and his Flonase and aspirin.  He was encouraged
to drink six cups of fluid per day.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] in the clinic on
Thursday, [**4-30**].  He will have his electrolytes, Digoxin
level, and phosphate level checked on Wednesday, [**4-29**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Prerenal acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
