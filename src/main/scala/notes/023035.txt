Final Report
INDICATION: 75-year-old male with hypoxia, tachycardia and

history of
bladder cancer status post resection.

EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with and without intravenous
contrast.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to CT of the torso from
[**2102-8-11**] and
[**2099-12-31**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute isolated sugsegmental pulmonary embolism in left lower

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68716**] was admitted to the Urology service after
undergoing the above procedures with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see the
dictated operative note for details. Patient received
perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis and deep vein
thrombosis/pulmonary embolis prophylaxis with coumadin. The
post-operative course was significant for a delayed extubation
(which occurred POD1 in the ICU) and pulmonary embolism noted on
CT scan but not precipitated by any specific change in vital
signs. With the eventual passage of flatus, Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 68717**] diet
was advanced and he was transitioned from IV pain medication to
oral pain
medications.  The ostomy nurse saw the patient for ostomy
teaching.  At the time of discharge the [**Last Name (Titles) **] was healing well
with no evidence of erythema, swelling, or purulent drainage.
His drain was removed and his scrotal edema, which was monitored

daily, was markedly improved. The ostomy was perfused and patent
and the ureteral stents were visible protruding through a pink
stoma. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 60816**] has several
post-operative follow up appointments and was discharged home
with visiting nurse services to further assist his transition
home with ostomy care and continue his [**Name13 (STitle) **] care and INR
monitoring.
