Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for MICU admission: Chronic ventillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid Bronchoscopy for Y-stent placement
Rigid Bronchoscopy for Y-stent removal
Central Venous Line Insertion
Sigmoidoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] (a.k.a. "[**Doctor Last Name **]") is an 86 M with a history of CVA
with chronic right-sided weakness, seizure disorder subsequent
to CVA, hypertension now off meds, CHF with unknown current LVEF
(last 75% in [**2117**]), recent ED visit for urinary retention
secondary to urethral stricture who presents for a planned
admission for re-evaluation of the airways following Y-stent
removal at his last hospitalization on [**2122-3-21**].
.
During his last hospital admission, he was found to have a
post-obstructive pneumonia presumed secondary to partial
tracheal stent occlusion noted on bronchoscopy. The Y-shaped
stent was removed and granulation tissue debrided from the left
mainstem bronchus. He was then discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, where
he has been chronically ventillated (his baseline prior to his
last admission was ventillation only overnight from 10 PM - 6
AM). He is readmitted now for rigid bronchoscopy to assess
airway and determine need for replacement airway stent. Because
he is on the ventillator he requires ICU admission.
.
Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab paperwork, recent active issues include fevers,
thrombocytopenia, edema, diarrhea, and variable mental status.
According to his daughter, his baseline functional status prior
to his last admission was on ventillator at night only, out of
bed to wheelchair in the day though no longer walking (left
"good" leg is too weak to support his weight, though he can move
his foot), living at home with his wife and full-time nursing
aides. He has expressive aphasia since his stroke and at his
best can speak only a few words at a time; recently he has had
significant secretions when the vent is capped so he has not
been speaking, but can nod yes/no to questions and communicate
with facial expressions.
.
ROS: Given aphasia, complete review of systems is not possible.
His aide who is with him and was with him at rehab confirms that
he has had recent watery diarrhea, which has been improving
since Monday. He denies any pain including abdominal pain.
Denies uncomfortable breathing.

Past Medical History:
1) Tracheomalacia, status post stent x 2 with failure secondary

to stent migration. Status post trach revision [**3-27**]. Status
post T-tube removal on [**2115-6-26**]. [**2119-11-9**]: Silicone Y-stent
revision and replacement. Tracheostomy stoma revision.
2) Status post stroke in [**2109**] with TIA; right upper extremity
weakness resulting.
3) Hypertension.
4) Seizure disorder.
5) History of MRSA.
6) Hemorrhoids.
7) Arthritis.
8) Depression.
9) History of CHF.
10) CRI


Social History:
Married and lived at home with wife (also with medical problems)
with full-time private nursing care prior to this recent
hospitalization and stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Forced to retire in
[**2109**] following CVA from his work as businessman (had an Exxon
franchise). Has three children; his two daughters [**Name (NI) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 54905**]
and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54906**] [**Name (NI) 54907**] serve as his co-health care proxies; he also
has a son involved in his care. He has a remote history of
social smoking but never a heavy smoker. No recent alcohol.
Caregivers provide all ADLs. Prior to this admission, he would
occasionally take some puree by mouth for pleasure but TF
provide nutrition.

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION
VS: Temp: 97.7 BP: 128/70 HR:70 RR:21 O2sat 100% on FiO2 0.3
GEN: Appears comfortable, NAD, following commands, nodding head
yes/no
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions though
difficult to visualize back of mouth as patient cannot open
fully
Neck: Supple, no JVD
RESP: Diminished BS at left base, referred ventillation noises,
no wheeze or rales
CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g
ABD: Mildly distended, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly
EXT: Non-pitting edema of feet and right hand (per aide,
unchanged since arriving at rehab). 2+ DP pulses.
NEURO: Able to squeeze hand on left though weak grip. Can move
left foot though very weak. Not moving right side which is
baseline. Facial droop also baseline.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**4-27**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-10-29**], the
multivalvular regurgitation is now seen and there now appears to
be lack of atrial systolic function. In the absence of a history
of systemic hypertension, these raise the suggestion of an
infiltrative process such as amyloid cardiomyopathy.

CT a/p [**4-27**]
1. Proctitis, without evidence of megacolon.
2. Multi-segmental collapse of the bilateral lower lobes, with
foci of ground
glass opacity in the aerated lung, consistent with aspiration or
infection.
There are associated moderate-sized simple pleural effusions.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
4. Nonspecific renal hypodensities might represent cysts though
ultrasound
evaluation is suggested for further characterization when
clinically
appropriate.


Bronch [**4-27**]
Severe granulation tissue formation at distal end of left limb
of the Y-stent. Thick putrulent secretions sent for microbilogy.
Y-stent removed without difficulty.
