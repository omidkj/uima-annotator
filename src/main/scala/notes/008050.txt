Admission Date:  [**2196-11-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2123-7-21**]     Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with
a history of myelodysplastic syndrome that has transformed to
acute myelogenous leukemia, and coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction times two with an ejection
to [**11-1**] for shortness of breath of unclear etiology.
At that time he refused a lung biopsy after diffuse nodular
infiltrates were wound on chest CT and decided to be do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  He was discharged home on home
oxygen and was able to get by, but has noted an increased
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema times one week.
His Lasix dose was briefly increased, but he did not continue
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and hemoptysis (which is
chronic).  He had no chest pain, fevers, chills, night
sweats, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, changes in his
bowel movements, melena, or bright red blood per rectum.

He was admitted for workup of his shortness of breath for
cardiac versus pulmonary causes.  He is now willing to
undergo a repeat bronchoscopy as the lesions on his chest
x-ray have now increased in size.  Despite his reluctance in
the past to undergo a workup of pulmonary process, the extent
of his symptoms at this time have made him inclined to pursue
a diagnostic workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myelodysplastic syndrome with smoldering acute
myelogenous leukemia that was diagnosed in [**2196-2-4**].  He
refused induction chemotherapy.  His code status is do not
resuscitate/do not intubate/supportive care.  His blast count
was 5%.
2.  Diffuse pulmonary disease of unclear etiology diagnosed
by chest CT in [**2196-10-6**] with shortness of breath and
increased oxygen requirement.  He has refused a open lung
biopsy in the past.  A bronchoscopy was negative.
3.  Coronary artery disease with 2-vessel disease; namely,
50% left main and 100% right coronary artery.  He has had two
myocardial infarctions in [**2196-2-4**] and in [**2196-4-5**].
His ejection fraction was 50% on an echocardiogram in [**2196-4-5**].
4.  History of gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to peptic
ulcer disease associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs.
5.  History of bladder cancer, status post tumor excision in
[**2196-4-5**].
6.  History of increased prostate-specific antigen of 8.7.
7.  Hearing loss.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.,
2.  Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Carafate 1 g q.i.d.
7.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and quit smoking 14 years ago
after smoking two packs a day for 25 years.  He does not use
alcohol.  He has three children and two step-children, and is
a retired detective.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is negative for cancer,
leukemia, and coagulopathies.  His mother developed diabetes
in her 80s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed an elderly man who was slightly short of breath at
rest.  He was afebrile with a temperature of 97.6, a blood
pressure of 122/58, pulse of 67, respiratory rate of 24,
satting 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.  His head, ears, nose,
eyes and throat examination was unremarkable.  His lungs were
clear, and his heart was regular with a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the base, and a 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
His abdomen was benign except for a spleen tip that was
palpable 3 cm below the costal margin.  He had 2+ pitting
edema to his knees.  His neurologic examination was nonfocal.
His skin revealed petechiae along his bilateral lower
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories
were significant for a hematocrit of 25.4, platelet count
of 97, and a white blood cell count of 3.5.  His blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine were at their baseline at 38 and 1.
His differential revealed 42% neutrophils, 16% bands,
25% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 5% metas, 3% myelocytes,
4% blasts, and 1 nucleated red blood cell.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His chest x-ray showed an increased
alveolar and interstitial markings bilaterally; especially,
in the left middle and left lower lobe, corny background of
chronic lung disease with question of alveolar hemorrhage
versus multifocal pneumonia versus asymmetric congestive
heart failure.  He also had small bilateral pleural
effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with a congestive
heart failure exacerbation and diuresed around 4 liters with
improvement in his shortness of breath and lower extremity
edema.  There was no change in his oxygen needs, and he
continued at his baseline of 5 liters nasal cannula with an
oxygen saturation in the lower 90s.

He was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells.  He
expressed an interest in further workup of his pulmonary
process found during his last admission when he refused
workup at that time.  A high-resonance CT and echocardiogram
were performed.  His CT revealed worsening diffuse
interstitial an alveolar lung disease with progression in the
left upper lobe, periphery of the right apex and right middle
lobe, as well as in the anterior and lateral left lower lobe.
His differential diagnosis included infection, vasculitis,
bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.  Also noted on
the CT was a slight increase in his bulky mediastinal lymph
node enlargement and increased size in the bilateral pleural
effusions.

The Pulmonary consultation team stated that the lesions seen
on CT could be biopsied by bronchoscopy.  However, his
echocardiogram revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial
hypertension with PAFP of 50 mmHg to 61 mmHg.  This was a new
finding since his last echocardiogram in [**2196-4-5**].  He had
no change in his ventricular function.

As his pulmonary hypertension was so severe, transbronchial
biopsy would be dangerous as an accidental injury to the
pulmonary artery to lead to exsanguination.  Pulmonary stated
that a video-assisted thoracic surgery would be the safest
and best option for diagnosis.  After extensive discussion with
the patient he stated that he did not want aggressive
interventions such as surgical biopsy and understood that this
would mean that the progressive lung process could therefore not
be diagnosed.  GIven the underlying MDS, cardiac disease and
progressive infection the patient wanted the emphasis to be on
supportive care and going home.   Patient understood his
condition was progressive and carried significant risk if he went
home.  Patient decided to go home with supportive care and
supplemental oxygen.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Condition on discharge was unchanged with
ongoing oxygen requirement.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
2.  Pulmonary process of unknown etiology.
3.  Myelodysplastic syndrome transforming into acute
myelogenous leukemia.

4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
