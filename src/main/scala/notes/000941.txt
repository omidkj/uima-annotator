==========
[**2137-6-9**]
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no
filling defects
present within the pulmonary arterial vasculature. The heart is
top-normal in
size. There is no pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal in
caliber and
contour. Scattered vascular calcifications are noted. A
precarinal lymph
node measures 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter (3:46). A right
hilar lymph node
measures 1.8 cm in short-axis diameter (3:51). No pathologically
enlarged
left hilar or axillary lymph nodes are noted. A spiculated
opacity is
present in the left lung apex that is stable compared to
[**2135-5-3**]. A
spiculated opacity located in the right upper lobe is also
stable compared to
the previous chest CT (3:41). Overall, there has been interval
improvement in
scattered areas of peripheral parenchymal opacity. Diffuse areas
of tree-in-
[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities; however, are essentially stable compared to the
previous
examination. There is extensive bronchiectasis within both lungs
and several
areas of mucus plugging, most notable at the left lung base. The
imaged
portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
2. Stable appearance of bronchiectasis involving both lungs with
mucoid
impaction predominately affecting the left lung base.
3. Enlarged mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy and
persistent tree-
in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are relatively stable compared to the previous
examination,
likely representing chronic mycobacterial infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from ED due to worsening shortness
of breath.  She was placed on a non-rebreather mask initially
and placed on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] meropenem based on her history of
Bronchiectasis and fear of pulmonary infection.  Numerous prior
bronchiectasis flares associated with pseudomonal and
non-fermenter, non-pseudomonal infections sensitive to
meropenem.  Second day, patient was weaned to 5L NC (baseline
2.5L NC at home).  CXR showed some increased pulmonary
vasculature thought due to fluid overload, goal to keep her
negative and start on spironolactone due to history of CHF --
however, patient was in good condition and was able to ambulate;
as a result patient was transferred to the floor.

A PICC line was placed, and after consultation with Infectious
Diseases and Pulmonary, the patient was planned to complete a
total of 14 days of therapy with meropenem. On discharge, the
patient was at her baseline oxygen requirement and baseline
exercise tolerance, without fevers or leukocytosis.
