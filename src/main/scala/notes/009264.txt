DEATH SUMMARY:
[**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section
for fetal bradycardia. She expired in her father's arms on
[**2141-6-10**], at the time of 1637, due to trisomy 18, repiratory
failure and complex congenital heart disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  She was born to a 30-year-old
gravida 2, para 1, now 2 woman, whose prenatal screens were
blood type A positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive hepatitis surface antigen negative and Group B
Strep negative. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until
abnormalities were seen on the fetal ultrasound at
approximately 30 weeks' gestation. The abnormalities were a
Dandy-Walker malformation of the brain and a double outlet
right ventricle with a large ventricular septal defect. She
also had some renal pelvis dilatation. The infant was born by
cesarean section. The mother had a tonic-clonic seizure just
prior to the delivery, after anesthesia was administered. The
infant emerged with Apgars of 6 at one minute and 8 at five
minutes.

The birth weight was 1870 grams (less than the third
percentile), the length was 47.5 cm (thirtieth percent) and
the head circumference was 31 cm (fifth percentile).

The infant's physical exam revealed a small for gestational
age infant whose anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. She
was generally dysmorphic. She had positive red reflexes. Her
palate was intact. Her ears were low set with a folded upper
helix. Her sternum had a 3-5 cm central gap with heart
movement easily visible subcutaneously. She was on nasal
cannula with decreasing respiratory effort, breath sounds
coarse and diminished. She had a loud grade 3/6 systolic
murmur at the left sternal border. Femoral pulses were full.
Abdomen soft with visible and palpable loop. She did have a 3-
vessel umbilical cord at delivery. She had a prominent labia
minora. She had generally decreased tone. She had polydactyly
of both hands. The left hand had a second digit in a flexion
contracture. Hands were held in a closed fisted position and
feet were rockerbottom.

COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Respiratory status: She was intubated soon after arrival
    for respiratory distress. She was extubated to continuous
    positive airway pressure on day of life #27 and then
    moved to nasal cannula oxygen on day of life #35, which
    was at the time of her death. At the time of death she
    was on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.  She also received
    some Lasix for congestive heart failure.
2.  Cardiovascular: She had remained normotensive throughout
    her NICU stay. Her cardiac echo on [**5-4**], revealed a
    large membranous ventricular septal defect, a large
    patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional flow, good
    left ventricular function, low to normal right
    ventricular function, a patent foramen ovale and an
    atrial septal defect.
3.  Fluid, Electrolyte and Nutrition Status: She did begin
    enteral feeds by gavage on day of life #3. She advanced
    to full volume gavage feeding by day of life #14. She had
    maximum calories of 27 per ounce Neosure at 120 mL per
    kilo per day by gavage. Her last weight of [**2141-6-9**],
    was 2250 grams.
4.  Renal: A renal ultrasound on [**2141-5-4**], showed mild to
    moderate dilatation of the renal calyces and dilated
    distal ureters.
5.  Genetics and Karyotype: A FISH study was done on [**5-4**],
    and was positive for trisomy 18.  There was not mosiasism
6.  Gastrointestinal status: She was treated with
    phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life #3
    until day of life #7. Her peak bilirubin occurred on day
    of life #4, with total of 11, direct 0.5. Her last
    bilirubin on [**2141-6-10**], was total of 5.4, direct 0.6.
7.  Hematology: She never received any blood product
    transfusion. Her hematocrit on admission was 43. Her
    platelets were 204,000.
8.  Infectious disease status: She was started on ampicillin
    and cefotaxime at the time of admission for sepsis risk
    factors. The antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours
    when the blood cultures remained negative and the infant
    showed no clinical sign of infection.
9.  Neurology: A head ultrasound on day of life #1 was
    significant for sulcal and gyral development that seemed
    slightly less than the norm for a 38 week gestation.
    Linear array films showed interdigitation of the sulci
    and gyri in the midline. This likely reflected absence or
    hypoplasia of the falx. Ventricles were mildly prominent.
    The transverse measure of the left lateral ventricle was
    6 mm. This was approximately double the normal width.
    There was some asymmetry between the right and left
    ventricles. The corpus callosum was present in a very
    large cisterna magna. There may be a mild inferior
    hypoplasia of the vermis.
10. Psychosocial: The parents are both from [**Country 2045**]. The father
    lived in [**State 38104**] for several years and was very fluent in
    English. The mother spoke [**Name (NI) 73071**] Creole and very little
    English.The parents are of the Mormon Faith. They had
    many discussions throughout the infant's NICU stay
    as to herpoor prognosis. This couple also had another
    daughter who 2 years old and healthy.


The infant expired on [**2141-6-10**]. Over the 24 hours prior
to her expiring, she had decreased respiratory effort, increasing
episodes of apnea requiring several episodes of bag and mask
ventilation, that became increasingly refractory to intervention.
Her parents were notified of her grave condition several times
throughout the morning. They arrived and spent some time holding
her and agreed that no further intervention was in her best
interest and she died in her father's arms peacefully.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Term female newborn.
2.  Trisomy 18.
3.  Dandy-Walker malformation variant.
4.  Polydactyly of both hands.
5.  Complex congenital heart disease Double outlet right
    ventricle with a large membranous ventricular septal defect.
6.  Agenesis of the sternum.
7.  Status post hyperbilirubinemia.
8.  Hydronephrosis and bilateral dilated ureters.
