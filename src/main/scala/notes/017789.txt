Admission Date:  [**2145-6-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-6-29**]


Service:  MICU GREEN

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
84-year-old female with a history of severe coronary artery
disease, multiple MIs, type 2 diabetes, congestive heart
failure with an EF of less than 25%, who presented to [**Hospital 4068**]
Hospital on [**2145-6-23**] with a pale cool right lower extremity.
She was found to have elevated CKs at that time and by
arteriography to have an occlusion of her right femoral
artery.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for further care.

Here, the patient underwent a right femoral thrombectomy by
Vascular Surgery.  The procedure was successful in restoring
flow.  However, the patient subsequently was anticoagulated
and developed a GI bleed with a hematocrit drop and transient
hypotension.  Additionally, she had lines placed and had a
new cell hematoma from a IJ and a groin hematoma at the site
of the arterial access.

For the above problems, the patient was sent to the MICU
after having been found to have a postoperative
.................to greater than 50, hematocrit 24.5.  She
was transfused with 5 units of packed red blood cells and 2
units of FFP and heparin and was discontinued.  She then was
transferred to the MICU for further care.

She is demented and has intermittent episodes of delirium but
is able to carry on a coherent conversation at times.  There
is no history of alcohol or drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  On
presentation, the patient had a temperature of 97.9, pulse
82, blood pressure 134/62, saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  General:  She was sleepy but confused.  HEENT:  Dry
mucous membranes.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light, anicteric.  Neck:  Supple.  The trachea was midline.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2,
II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, normal bowel sounds.  OB positive stools.
Extremities:  The right lower extremity had some firmness in
the right calf and Dopplerable pulses and a DP and TP.
Neurologic:  She was lethargic but intermittently arousable
and moving all extremities symmetrically.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On presentation to the MICU, the
patient had the following laboratories:  White blood cell
count 13.6, hematocrit 33.2 after the 5 units of red blood
cells, platelets 186,000.  Her coagulations were 12.8, 57.3,
and 1.1.  Her Chem-7 was as follows:  Sodium 144, K 3.9,
chloride 112, bicarbonate 14, BUN 36, creatinine 1.6, glucose
268, calcium 8.0, phosphorus 6.3, magnesium 1.9.  Her CK was
8,300 and peaked at around 12,000.  Her troponin was greater
than 50.  Her blood gas was 7.29/32/198 with a lactate of
2.8.

EKG showed no ST depressions in V4 through V6.  Normal sinus
rhythm at 89.

Chest x-ray showed a hematoma in the left superior
mediastinum and a U/A from the outside hospital showed
moderate leukocyte esterase and 50-100 white blood cells.

The patient had an echocardiogram which showed small
pericardial effusion near the right atrium, no clot, and an
ejection fraction, mildly dilated LA, moderately to severely
depressed EF of 30%, akinesis at the inferior and posterior
walls, hypokinesis of the inferior septum wall, no masses or
thrombi.  Mild thickening of the aortic leaflets but no
stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] tamponade.

On [**2145-6-27**], the patient had the following labs, her
white count was 8.3.  Her hematocrit 32.5, platelets 150,000.
BUN 28, creatinine 1.0, and total C02 of 20.  Albumin 2.4.
Her U/A showed ten to four times ten to five yeast and a HIT
antibody was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  Ischemia:  The
patient had the ischemic right leg, as previously indicated
with CTAs elevated to a peak of 12,000.  She underwent a
successful thrombectomy with restoration of flow, the
etiology of the thrombus was thought to be an embolic event,
likely from the heart, although it was not seen on
echocardiography.  The patient was initially treated with
heparin which was to be continued after she had the GI bleed
and the hematocrit dropped to 24.  Subsequently Vascular
Surgery recommended that the patient be started on Warfarin
as prophylaxis for further embolic events.  This was done so
on [**2145-6-26**], but it was unclear if this would be
continued given her continued heme-positive stools needed to
be resolved on the day of discharge.

In terms of cardiac ischemia, the patient had multiple
troponins greater than 50, deemed likely from ischemia from
demand given her low hematocrit, severe underlying coronary
artery disease.  The patient was treated with a beta blocker,
aspirin, and Imdur in addition to her Atorvostatin.  She was
not deemed a candidate for cardiac catheterization and again
the heparin was deemed too risky given the GI bleeds and the
falling hematocrit.

In terms of her pump function, the patient showed no signs of
congestive heart failure during the hospital stay and she was
several liters positive without any drop in her oxygen.  She
should be considered for restarting her Lasix and Aldactone
as an outpatient.  The patient had several episodes of
hypotension in the PACU after thrombectomy.  This was likely
due to GI bleed and she had no further episodes of
hypotension or any events during the stay.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had heme-positive stools
and hematocrit dropped.  The etiology of the heme-positive
stools was unknown.  The hematocrit was more or less stable
in the MICU after receiving 5 units of packed red cells in
the PACU.  She was continued only on the aspirin and the
Warfarin for anticoagulation.  She needs her hematocrit
checked one to two weeks following discharge to ensure that
this level is stable.  The patient's stay was also notable
for very small p.o. intake apparently at baseline.  The
patient has a poor appetite and eats minimally, taking pureed
solids.  She was continued on this pureed diet and did fairly
well without any signs of aspiration, although she is
certainly at risk for this.  The patient was also kept on a
PPI.  The patient was also given Boost supplementations for a
low albumin.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a positive U/A at an
outside hospital.  She was treated with six days of
levofloxacin and had no fevers and her white count remained
normal during the hospital stay.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
She continued a regular insulin sliding scale.  Her blood
sugars were fairly well controlled.  In addition, she was
continued on Synthroid for hypothyroidism.
5.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has a history of depression and
was continued on her Sertraline.

6.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has a history of dementia,
questionable delirium and has apparently been bed bound and
delirious at home.  She remained coherent in the Intensive
Care Unit several days prior to discharge.  The patient is
apparently on home hospice care for her coronary artery
disease and dementia at home.  No further intervention was
taken for her neurologic status.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Embolus to the right femoral artery with subsequent
elevations in CK.
2.  Non-ST elevation MI.
3.  Gastrointestinal bleed.
4.  Urinary tract
