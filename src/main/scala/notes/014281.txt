revealed a right upper lobe speculated mass.  A subsequent
computerized axial tomography of the chest again revealed
this right upper lobe mass as well as significant adenopathy.
An outpatient bronchoscopy done at the outside hospital showed
complete obstruction of the right main stem bronchus and 50%
narrowing of the left mainstem.  Brushings were performed on the
RMSt mass, but due to the severity of airway compromise, she was
transferred for further management.

2.  Lung mass.
3.  Intravenous drug abuse.
4.  Question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Uterine fibroids.

with vital signs which revealed the patient was afebrile, her
pulse was 62, her blood pressure was 120/70, her pulse
oximetry was 94% on 3 liters via nasal cannula, and her
respiratory rate was 18.  In general, the patient was a
pleasant female.  In mild distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  The oropharynx was clear.  There was palpable
right supraclavicular node.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lung examination revealed
decreased breath sounds on the right throughout.  Otherwise,
the lungs were clear.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.  Extremity
examination revealed no edema and no calf tenderness.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented.  Mentated well.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was
29.6, her hematocrit was 37.6, and her platelet count was
604.  Her INR was 1, her prothrombin time was 12.5, and her
partial thromboplastin time was 23.9.  Sodium was 138,
potassium was 4.5, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 30,
blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.5, and blood
glucose was 110.  Her calcium was 9.7, her phosphate was 5.2,
and her magnesium was 2.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
brought to the OR for urgent rigid bronchoscopy.  A 12x35mm
silicone stent was placed in the LMSt, and the RMSt tumor was
destroyed with argon plasma coagulation, biopsied, and
eventually a 12x40mm covered Ultraflex stent was placed
achieving patency of the RML and RLL. The right upper
lobe was completely obstructed.

Postoperatively, she was transferred back to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  She did well.  She continued to have an
oxygen requirement of 3 liters.  She was moving improved air
in her right lower lobe.  Her antibiotics were changed from
levofloxacin to clindamycin and was to complete a 7-day
course for a postobstructive pneumonia.

Clinical issues revealed the patient was afebrile throughout
her hospital stay.  Steroids were stopped as it was not
believed there was a bronchospastic component to her
pneumonia.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is a full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Lung mass with biopsies pending.
2.  Complete obstruction of the right main stem; status post
metal stent placement.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Clindamycin.
2.  Nebulizers.
3.  Methadone.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to
[**Hospital3 3583**].  She needs f/u on pathology results, full
