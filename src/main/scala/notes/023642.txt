History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16847**] is 57-year-old man with NSCLC/adenocarcinoma of
lung with metastases to brain, s/p resection ([**2139**] and [**2140**]),
seizure disorder ([**2140**]), CVA ([**2156**]) with residual right-sided
hemiparesis and slurred speech/expressive aphasia presenting
with lethargy and altered mental status.

The patient was sent in from rehab today for increasing lethargy
for the past 4 days since Saturday.  Per the nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient was at baseline interactive and able
to say appropriately verbalize "yes" or "no," interact with
staff, and is typically able to self propel in a wheelchair.  He
does have very limited use of his right arm, but retains full
strength of the left arm, and was able to walk occasionally with
PT.  Laboratory studies including CBC, Chem 7, and urinalysis at
the rehab were within normal limits and vitals were reported to
be normal.  His lethargy was worse this morning and he was sent
to the emergency department at [**Hospital1 1170**] for further evaluation.

The patient's wife notes that she saw him at rehabilitation on
Friday [**2160-4-25**], 4 days prior to admission, and the patient was
noted to be the most alert he has been recently and was also
able to ambulate with a physical therapist.  She reports that on
Friday [**2160-4-25**], he received his routine Botox injection for
muscle spasticity from his stroke, which he has tolerated well
in the past.  However, he had also been receiving low doses of
baclofen at rehabilitation, and received the Botox in
combination with his baclofen.  The patient's wife notes that
the Baclofen had recently been started during his recent
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] with a
subsequent reaction to the medication, including agitation and a
fall.  The baclofen was discontinued.  However, he then was
restarted on baclofen at his rehabilitation facility with a
similar reaction to the medication, and the dose was decreased
to 10 mg TID with the plan to taper his baclofen.  The patient's
wife reports she presented to rehabilitation on Saturday
[**2160-4-26**] to find the patient very lethargic and less
interactive, sitting in his wheelchair and staring into space.
He received a lower dose of baclofen on Saturday [**2160-4-26**] and
the patient's wife notes that on [**Name (NI) 1017**] [**2160-4-27**], the patient's
mental status was worse and he was unable to sit in his
wheelchair.  He was evaluated by the physician at the facility
and his dose of baclofen was decreased to 10 mg qAM, 5 mg qPM,
10 mg qhs.  On Monday [**2160-4-28**], one day prior to admission, the
patient appeared worse, not interacting at all and not eating,
and his Baclofen was discontinued after his AM dose.  He
appeared unwell today as well and was sent from rehabilitation
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.

Of note, the patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] Neurology
Service from [**2160-3-3**] to [**2160-3-11**] for difficulty walking with
worsening ataxia, and worsening encephalopathy.  He was found to
have avascular necrosis of bilateral femoral heads that was
presumed to cause pain with weight bearing.  He was also found
to have an enterococcus UTI and was treated with a 7 day course
of Macrobid.  EEG and lumbar puncture with [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus and Herpes
virus studies were negative.  His worsening mental and
neurologic status was also thought to be due to delayed
radiation induced encephalopathy.  Additionally, he also became
over-sedated and drowsy with vomiting on standing oxycodone,
which improved with PRN oxycodone.  During the hospitalization,
patient also sustained an unwitnessed fall from a chair with
resulting eyebrow laceration, CT head and c-spine done without
fracture.

In ED/Clinic, initial vital signs were:  Temperature 98.7 F,
pulse 91, blood pressure 147/82, respiration 20, and oxygen
saturation at 96% in room air.
His general examination was significant for minimal
responsiveness, squeezes hands, rightward gaze and right sided
weakness which are old per mergency department report.  Patient
was given 1mg IV lorazepam given for questionable seizure and 1
liter of normal saline.  Neuro-Oncology was called and
recommended continued infectious workup and admission to OMED
Service.  Patient underwent CT head and CXR and was admitted for
further evaluation.  Vitals prior to transfer were temperature
99.8 F, pulse 98, respiration 18, blood pressure 138/82, and
oxygen saturation at 95% in room air.
