Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19484**] was admitted preoperatively for IV heparin. Carotid
u/s was negative. She was taken to the operating room on
[**2111-3-17**] where she underwent a CABG x 1 (LIMA->LAD) and MVR (#31
[**Company **] mosaic). She was transferred to the ICU in critical
but stable condition. She was extubated and transferred to the
floor on POD #1. On POD #2, she had atrial fibrillation for
which she was started on amiodarone and restarted on coumadin
(was on preoperatively). She had a CT trachea secondary to
concern for subglottic stenosis seen during intubation. The CT
showed no evidence of tracheal or bronchial stenosis and Diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia. Interventional pulmonology said there was
no intervention necessary. She continued to have rate controlled
atrial fibrillation. She was ready for discharge home on POD #6.
