History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 13304**] is an 86 y/o female
with a history of chronic afib (refusing warfarin) and stable
angina who presented to [**Hospital6 8283**] on [**7-13**]
with 3-4 days of progressive cough and shortness of breath. She
also had some left sided chest discomfort that was associated
with exertion. At the OSH her EKG was reportedly normal however
troponin trend was 0.04>0.18>0.08. Chest X-ray showed findings
concerning for pneumonia and she was started on levofloxacin. An
echo done on [**2157-7-14**] revealed an LV thrombus and EF 27% (prior
62% on Persantine ST [**2157-4-28**]). Thus, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. Vital Signs
prior to transfer were Temp 98.1, BP 118/84, HR afib 80-90's at
rest, 130-140's with stimulation, RR 22-24, O2sat 95-98% on 2L
NC.
.
When she arrived to the cath lab she was noted to be very
dyspneic and was felt to be volume overloaded. She was
transferred to the CCU for further management and diuresis.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable and in NAD. She
notes that she is feeling better. She denied having any pain.
She notes that her breathing has improved.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13304**] is an 86 y/o female with a history of chronic afib
and stable angina who presented to [**Hospital6 8283**] on
[**7-13**] with 3-4 days of progressive cough and shortness of
breath and new dilated cardiomyopathy transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
consideration for catheterization noted to be volume overloaded.


ACUTE ISSUES
# Acute Systolic Heart Failure: She had a reported EF of 60% on
[**2157-4-28**] which was 27% on TTE done at OSH. With her chronic
angina, we suspected coronary artery disease as likely etiology.
The differential also included infectious cardiomyopathy, toxic
cardiomypathy, endocrine dysfunction and stress induced
cardiomypathy.  Patient was initially diuresed with lasix and
metolazone and put out adequate urine.  She was transiently
hypotensive so further diuresis was held.  Given there was a
troponin leak at the OSH (and small elevation initially here), a
cardiac cath was considered to look for CAD as the trigger for
her CHF.  However, there was concern in regards to viability of
her left ventricle, and also as to whether there was a thrombus
present so a cardiac MRI was obtained.  This study found no LV
thrombus and did find viable cardiac tissue.  She was then
prepped for cath with IV steroids and benadryl given her
previous contrast allergy.  Her cath results from [**2157-7-19**] showed
no coronary disease, etiology of acute CHF likely stress
cardiomyopathy/embolism from A fib to coronary/myocarditis. With
improved EF improved 40% making stress cardiomyopathy the likely
etiology of her actue CHF The patient went home on Lisinopril
Metoprolol XL .  She was given 5 pills of 20 mg lasix IN CASE
she starts gaining weight in the interim before her follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**].

#R lower ext pain:  Pt began complaining of R LE pain after
transfer to the floor.  She described it as diffuse and worse
upon lifting her leg.  Her CPK was originally 233 on [**7-18**] and
uptrended to 1366 on [**7-18**].  We had initially started her on
atorvastatin 80 mg daily in house, but d/ced the medication once
she was symptomatic.  Also taken down for LENIs and ABI and
found to have completely intact arterial and venous flow.  On
further examination, a large right upper leg hematoma was
discovered. CPK downtrended to the 500s and her heparin was
d/ced.

# CORONARIES: She has a history of chronic stable angina however
appears to have been getting progressively worse. With slight
elevation of cardiac enzymes concern for NSTEMI however no EKG
changes were noted. Likely etiology of enzymes are demand in the
setting of extreme volume ov
