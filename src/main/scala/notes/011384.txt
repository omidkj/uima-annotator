to TICU for further management.

Neuro: patient was kept off allsedation once initial evaluation
finished, his head ct remain unchanged, however he only regained
minimal movement of upper etremities, mostly withdrawing from
pain. This also has not improved once his medications were
started. Discussions were undertaken with patient's family and
neurorugical service and it was agreed that combination of
patient's poor baseline and significant injury, his chance of
miningfull recover would be minimal.

Cardiovascular:patient blood pressure was controlled initially
with nicardapine drip, and once tube feeding was started, with
oral medications. No concerns no issues

Respiratory: after weanning of sedation, patient had good gag,
however remained poor extubation potential due to his deminished
mental status. His chest x-ray showed miniimal evidence of RUL
and LLL iniltrate consistant with old scaring vs pneumonia. Once
discussion with family was undertaken about patient's condition
and he was made CMO he was extubated on HD #7 and was able to
maintain his airway and saturation.

nutriotion until he was made CMO. no concerns no issues. Patient
had intermitant hypokelimia, hypomagnesimia, hypocalcemia with
was corrected in the usuall fasion

Renal: through his admission patient had good urine output and
renal function

Endocrene: minimal insulin dosing for minimaly elevated BS

Ortho: patient had no spine fx on spine films and c-spine ct
scan, his collar was eventually removed, he was taken off
loggroll precausions.

ID: patient was on certriaxone for his pneumonia and UIT in NH.
in [**Hospital1 18**] he was initialy started on Levofloxacin empiricaly, and

Disposition: multuple discussions took place between patient's
family and mutlispecialty team, It was agreed that patient
