Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Large left intracranial hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extraventricular drain


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 83yo man who was brought to the ED per EMS for
gait ataxia.

In the evening the patient was seen by his PCP at [**Location (un) 7073**]
Station. He was walking with a wide-based, ataxic gait, he then
fell backwards. No apparent injury from the fall on cursory
exam, and he had no specific complaints but seemed confused and
unsteady (per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]).  The T staff called the ambulance and
he was brought to the ED.

In the ED, he was initially, talking, but per notes producing
"word salad". He also complained of a L-temporal headache. He
was diaphoretic per nursing notes. He underwent a CT head that
showed a large ICH (L-post frontal/par/occ)with ventricular
breakthrough. He then started to vomit and became less
responsive. He was intubated around 22.50 and evaluated by
Neurosurgery. No intervention indicated at this point.

He had not been taking the antihypertensive prescribed for him.
He has no other medications.

CT head shows large parenchymal hemorrhage in the L-
parietal/occipital/posterior frontal region; breakthrough into
lateral ventricle.

ECG: sinu tach, 89bpm; no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 83yo man with HTN who was brought to the ED per
EMS for gait ataxia. Initially talking, but became less
responsive and started vomiting. He was then intubated. Exam
shows intact CN (except for blink), otherwise no sensory
response or motor response. CT showed "Large left
parieto-occipital lobar hemorrhage, including extensive bleeding
into the left lateral ventricle." He was seen by neurosurgery
and an EVD was placed on [**11-7**]. Postoperatively, CT showed "No
significant interval change in the extensive intraparenchymal
and intraventricular hemorrhage. Possibly increased subarachnoid
hemorrhage near the right sylvian fissure. Unchanged subfalcine,
uncal, and transtentorial herniation." Blood pressure was
controlled and the patient ventilated until [**11-11**], when the
family arrived to discuss treatment options. During this time,
the patient was tachypnic, even with increasing doses of
propofol. After discussing the grim prognosis with the family,
the decision was made on [**11-11**] to make the patient CMO, which
they felt was consistent with his wishes, and he passed away.
