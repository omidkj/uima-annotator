Right inguinal hernia

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo male who has a complex prior history,
including prostatectomy and inguinal hernia repairs, and
presented with a history of a recurrent hernia in that
region.  It was, however, unclear from exam whether this was
inguinal or incisional and even obtained an MRI, which was
not helpful.  His symptoms were quite definite, and when you
examined him, he definitely had an area that felt like a
herniation in the medial portion of his groin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Operative course uncomplicated. Admitted to Stone 5 for post-op
care. Pain controlled with PCA. Patient reported increased pain,
although appeared lethargic, but easy to arouse. Pain medication
adjusted accordingly. Patient also complained of SOB/Wheeze.
Somewhat relieved with albuterol/atrovent nebs. Noted to have
labored breathing while sleeping. Diagnosed with OSA, but does
not use CPAP at home. ABG obtained. Patient noted to be
acidotic. Transferred to ICU for closer observation on BIPAP(See
ICU course below). Tranferred back to floor after 24hrs in ICU.
Continued on BIPAP & nebs. PO narcoticis minimized. Abdominal
incision intact with staples, CDI. Diet advanced gradually from
sips to regular food as bowel function and abdominal distention
improved. Reported flatus, and eventual loose stools. IV fluid
discontinued. Foley removed. Voided without issue. Medications
switched to oral. Pain well controlled with oral Percocet.

Medical ICU course:

He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2125-11-13**] with respiratory
distress.
#. Respiratory distress: He has a history of asthma and possible
mild exacerbation in setting of URI symptoms of dry cough and
rhinorrhea.  Initial ABG showed he had a respiratory acidosis
which resolved after being placed on BiPap.  He likely had a
combination of asthma exacerbation and decreased respiratory
drive due to sedation and narcotics. Patient started on IV
steroids. Patient was also given nebulizers for wheezing and he
improved significantly overnight and was transferred back to the
surgical team.
