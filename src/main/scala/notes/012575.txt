History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 woman with hypertension and diabetes who was
in her usual state of health until about 3 weeks ago when she
awoke suddenly with shortness of breath. Her husband used his
nebulizer treatments on her to no avail. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] and diagnosed with AVNRT (full hx not entirely clear). At
discharge, the patient continued to feel short of breath,
nausea, and fatigue. She was so tired that she quit her job as a
monitor on a school bus.
.
She presented to her PCP who attempted to diarese her with
lasix, and treated a presumed PNA with ceftriaxone and steroids.
However, she noted decreased urine output and she continued to
feel fatigue and nausea. After 5 days of visiting her PCP's
office, the patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-6**]
with dry heaves and shortness of breath. There, she was given
gram of rocephin, methylprednisolone, and 100 mg of doxycyline.
She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] where she was discovered to be
in ARF with a creatinine of 4.3 up from her baseline of 1.5. She
was transfused 2 units PRBCs O+ blood on [**6-7**] for a hemolytic
anemia. Her creatinine continued to rise to 6.8 and her
platelets to fall, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
plasmapheresis for concern for TTP. Currently, she complains of
mild HA and admits to palpitations and chills. She has several
ecchymosis that she attributes to her last hospitalization

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs from [**6-8**]:
.
9.5 WBC, HCT 31.1, Plt 114, few schistocytes, ESR 53, 2.3
retics,
BUN 140, creatinine 6.8, glucose 154
LDH 1591
Hgb A1C 5.8
.
CT scan at OSH: CHF, small pleural effusions, mild scattered
ground glass opacities, heterogeneous appearance of right lobe
of thyroid gland, left renal cyst.
.
EKG: a.fib with normal axis, normal QRS and QT intervals. No ST
changes or TWI.
.
CXR: AP view. My interpretation. ? small bilateral pleural
effusions and right lower lobe infiltrate
.
peripheral smear: [**2-15**] schistocytes per high power field. + Burr
cells, few platelets
.
[**2118-6-20**] CXR:
There is a dual lumen catheter, which has been tunneled via a
right internal jugular approach, replacing the temporary
catheter, which had been in placed on [**6-15**]. The tip
terminates in the right atrium. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged. The lung volumes remain low, with mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusions are seen.
There is degenerative change at multiple levels of the spine.
.
IMPRESSION: Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Temporary
dialysis catheter has been replaced with a tunneled dialysis
catheter in the interim since the prior study.
.
[**2118-6-20**] Renal biopsy:  The acute changes of thrombotic
microangiopathy are superimposed on considerable chronic
scarring and prominent chronic vascular injury (? chronic
hypertension and or prior episodes of TMA).
Light Microscopy:  The specimen consists of renal cortex and
medulla, containing approximately 15 glomeruli, of which 7 is
globally sclerotic.  The remainder show varying degrees of
compensatory hypertrophy and ischemic change.  Several thrombi
are noted.  Occasional double contours are seen.  Three [**Hospital1 **]
show segmental sclerosis.
.
There is moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy that
appears even worse in the subcapsular zone.  Mild chronic
inflammation accompanies the scarring.
.
Arteries show marked intimal fibroplasia.
.
Arterioles show marked mural thickening, with frequent hyaline
change.  Several show varying degrees of mucoid intimal
hyperplasia and thrombus formation.
.
Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex only,
containing approximately 5 glomeruli, of which 2 are globally
sclerotic.  There is no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, Kappa,
Lambda, or C1q.  2+ C3 is seen along capillary loops and trace
in vessels. Albumin and fibrin (no thrombi) are
non-contributory.
.
Electron microscopy:  Findings will be issued in an addendum.
.
Comment:  The acute changes of thrombotic microangiopathy are
superimposed on considerable chronic scarring and prominent
chronic vascular injury (? chronic hypertension and or prior
episodes of TMA).


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old woman with PMH of DM 2 and HTN who
presented with symptoms of SOB, nausea and fatigue, treated for
suspected pneumonia, who then presented to an outside hospital
with acute renal failure. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with ARF,
hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia for possible
plasmapheresis out of concern for TTP. She was found to have a
hemolytic anemia, however peripheral blood examination and
further workup was not consistent with TTP, and the patient did
not undergo plasmapheresis. The patient required initiation of
hemodialysis for her renal failure.
.
# Acute renal failure: Renal failure in combination with the
hemolytic anemia initially raised the concern for TTP. Smear
showed few schistocytes (although somewhat difficult to
interpret as she had already been transfused PRBCs) consistent
with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  Renal ultrasound was
normal.  ADAMTS13 was sent and was not consistent with TTP as
etiology.  Although she did report diarrhea prior to her
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], stool cultures were negative for E. coli,
campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia, thus HUS also
seemed unlikely.  Autoimmune or drug-induced were also evaluated
as possibilities, however anti-GBM was negative and there were
no medications were clearly implicated.  [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA were negative
in terms of vasculitis workup.  Complement levels were normal.
UPEP showed albumin only, no Bence [**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins.  Renal biopsy
showed global and focal glomerulosclerosis and acute as well as
chronic TMA.  Anticardiolipin Abs were normal and lupus
anticoagulant was negative as potential causes of TMA as seen on
biopsy.  Given her history of poorly controlled hypertension, it
is thought that her renal disease and TMA is likely secondary to
malignant/poorly controlled hypertension.  She was initiated on
hemodialysis and, given results of renal biopsy showing
irreversible changes, outpatient hemodialysis was arranged.  She
was started on phosLo and renagel for phosphate lowering.  A
right tunnelled catheter was placed and venous mapping was
performed for future fistula placement.
.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Initial labs revealed grossly
elevated LDH and haptoglobin <20 and smear as above.
Fibrinogen, originally elevated as acute phase reactant,
normalized (never dropped below 100) and coags remained normal
so as not to suggest DIC.  Appeared to be microangiopathic
process, unlikely antibody mediated. Coombs negative and co
