Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to proximal LAD


History of Present Illness:
82 F admitted [**2-12**] for L total hip replacement. EBL 500cc during
surgery. On the morning of [**2170-2-14**], the patient was noted
to be more hypoxic and lethargic. She was given more IV fluids
for concern of dehydration.
Later during the day sats were dropping to 80%.  She was placed
on a non-rebreather face mask.  She was denying any chest pain.
She had a mild cough, poorly productive.  She had no nausea, no
vomiting, no clear documentation of aspiration.  She appeared
pale.  She was sleepy, but easily arousable and cooperative.
She appeared initially in no acute distress.  Rapid response was
called and the patient was transferred to the ICU for initial
concern of congestive heart failure.

On [**2-14**] had CXR with perihilar lower lobe opacities and LUL
opacity with concern of HF vs. multifocal PNA. Patient's
respiratory status decompensated and repeat CXR showed LUL, LLL,
RML, RLL opacities more suggestive of aspiration PNA,
subsequently patient was intubated that night. Patient was
started on norepinephrine.

Patient was started on ASA, heparin held given drop in HCT. 2
units PRBC being given. On Vanco and Zosyn. Scheduled for RP u/s
to r/o bleed.
.
On arrival to the floor she was intubated and found to be
hemodynamically stable. Floor EKGs showed ST depression in
lateral leads and slow R wave progression. At 9pm was
hypotensive with MAPS to 46 about 1 hour after getting
metoprolol 12.5. EKG unchanged, started on levophed, backed off
sedation.

LABS/STUDIES
Overall EKGs show dynamic T wave changes
EKG: [**2170-2-15**] 4:41 am : nl axis, nl intervals TWI in II, III,
aVF, V5, V6.TWI in AVF and precordial leads are new.
<0.05 STD in lead II, V3-V5.
[**2170-2-14**] at 21:18 STD in lead II,V2-V5,? TWI in III.
[**2170-2-14**] 19:03: TWI II, III, avF, V1, V5-V6, STD in lead II,
V2-V5.

OSH labs: Cr 1.8 from 1.3 on admission to [**Hospital1 **].
WBC 15.3 on [**2170-2-15**] from   7.0 on [**2170-2-14**]
. HCT stable at 32.9 , INR 1.04
BNP: 265
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**2170-2-15**]. The left atrium and right atrium
are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Inferior and inferolateral akinesis consistent with
prior infarction. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve is
tethered with consequent assymetric coaptation of the mitral
leaflets and at least moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation,
directed posteriorly. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
Echo [**2165**]:
LV systolic function is intact with an estimated LVEF of 60%.
Chamber sizes are normal.  There is mild MR and trace TR noted.
PA pressures are normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.
.
ETT:  [**2165**]. For HTN and syncope.
[**Doctor First Name **] with myoview.
In summary this study is inconclusive for myocardial ischemia by
ST
criteria since patient did not achieve 85% of predicted maximum
heart rate. Adjunctive myocardial perfusion imaging at the
workload achieved will be reported separately by [**Doctor First Name **].

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 80 y/o woman with hx alzheimers transfered
