   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2133-7-18**]):
      ENTEROCOCCUS SP..
         IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED FROM AEROBIC
BOTTLE.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
5.There are three aortic valve leaflets. No aortic valve abscess
is seen.
There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve. The
vegetation is attached to the ventricular side of the
noncoronary aortic valve cusp, is irregular in shape, and
measures 0.7 x 1.1 cm in its greatest dimension. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen emanating from under the noncoronary cusp.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but no mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic or tricuspid
valves.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 y.o. female with type 1 DM, ESRD and HCV presents with line
infection and DKA.
.
1) DKA/DM: Etiology likely line infection. Pt has been
bacteremic since [**7-16**].   Pt was given IVF and insulin. DKA
resolved over 36 hours. Pt returned to home regimen of glargine
at night and RISS.
.
2) Enterococcal endocarditis, line infection: Pan-sensitive
enterococcus bacteremia (likely source is Hickman) with moderate
sized vegetation of aortic valve by TTE (exam with new murmur).
Hickman line pulled. Initially covered with levoquin. ID
consulted, recommended PCN and gentamycin X 4 weeks.  (+) for
enterococcus.  TEE showed moderate vegetation, AR and TR, no
abscess.  CT surgery consulted and felt no surgery indicated at
this time.  She will f/u with CT surgery as an outpatient.
-Antibiotics to continue until [**2133-8-17**]
- check gent levels after HD and redose when <1- dose to give
when level <1 is 60mg.
- monitor ECG daily for PR pronlongation no changes seen to date
(aortic root abscess
.
3) Coagulopathy: Pt had extensive bleeding after line pulled.
Thought to be secondary to uremic platelets but coags drawn and
showed INR 3.4. Pt with known hx of HCV however, no biopsy.
Viral load 479,000.  Liver was consulted and will follow up as
an outpatient.
.
4) ESRD: Received HD on T,R,and S. AV fistula not yet mature so
tunneled hickman catheter placed by IR. R carotid artery ws
punctured during procedure however no sequela developed. Patient
will continue on Dialysis Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. She
will have Gentamicin levels checked at all dialysis visits, with
Gemtamicin to be dosed with level < 1 at 60mg.
.
5) CHF: Fluid status managed with HD during this admission.
Restarted ACEI, beta blocker,and statin.
.
6) Diarrhea: During her hospitalization, patient developed
diarrhea in the setting of remaining afebrile. C-diff was
negative times 1 and 2nd c-diff was pending at time of
discharge. However, it was felt that diarrhea likely secondary
to antibiotic effect rather than c-diff. Hence, patient started
in imodium. Once diarrhea resolves- this should be discontinued.
Additionally, if diarrhea continues- further c-diff toxin may
need to be sent.
.
7) HCV: found during workup for renal transplant. Pt was in the
process of having this worked up. Will need biopsy. Pt has never
had abnormal LFT's. Has follow uo with Liver in 4wks.
.
8)Gastroparesis - stable. patient continued on reglan until she
developed diarrhea. Patient's c-diff negative times 1 and 2nd
c-diff pending at time of discharge. Reglan stopped while having
diarrhea, and may need to be restarted (10mg QID- qith meals)
once diarrhea resolves. Tolerating [**Doctor First Name **] diet with sugar free
boost supplements.
.
9) PPx: Protonix, Pneumoboots.
.
10) Access: Hickman,PICC, PIV. Pt has fistula placed on [**7-1**].
Not yet mature.
