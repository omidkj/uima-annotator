Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart cath with cardiac biopsy on [**7-12**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 46**] is a 77yo male with history of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30% [**3-/2134**]), atrial fibrillation (on
coumadin), pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to concern for hypotension
transferred to the CCU for management of CHF.
.
Per report patient was sent in from the nursing home due to
"abnormal labs" though had no focal complaints. He had been
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-29**] with the diagnosis of
DVT/PE, LLE cellulitis and PNA. He was continued on warfarin
(once INR was not supratherapitic) and treated with doxycycline
and levofloxacin with planned 10 day course to be completed on
[**2134-7-5**] for the LLE cellulitis and PNA respectivly. Patient was
sent from the nursing home because of "abnormal labs." No
further history able to be obtained. Patient believes he is here
because of pain in the leg. Overall says he feels OK, with main
concern being leg pain in the left lower extremity. Says
breathing is "good." Denies dyspnea, cough, productive cough,
wheezing, pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills, abdominal pain,
dysuria.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.4 107 91/65 20 98%. Labs were
notable for WBC 22.3, creatinine of 5.0 up from baseline
2.5-3.1; glucose of 42 (received 2 amp of dextrose), INR of 4.1,
despite not having taken coumadin in a week per report.  Patient
was started on vanc/cefepime due to concern for evolving sepsis
vs pulmonary embolus given recent peroneal vein DVT/presumed PE.
(though baseline SBP in 80-90's) CTA was held because of
impaired renal function. A Right IJ central line was obtained
along with two peripherals. Prior to transfer blood pressures
remained in 80s-90s and Norepinephrine was started for pressure
support.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] there was concern for septic shock and he was
started on levophed, gental hydration, and placed on
vanco/cefepime. His WBC remained constant in low 20's. He was
changed to vanco/zosyn and his WBC trended down. His initial
central venous sat was 70 increasing concern for sepsis. He was
evaluated for infection source and his abd U/S and oral con CT
were non-diagnostic. His CXR was concerning for a PNA, worsening
over previous studies. Over his 3 day stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] his CO/CI
worsened and his central venous sat decreaased to the 40's
increasing concern for cardiogenic shock. His MAPs were low and
his pressor was transitioned from levophed to doputamine without
improvement. At this point he was transfered to the CCU for
further evaulation and treatment.

ABX XR [**2134-7-5**]:
Single frontal image of the abdomen shows nonspecific bowel gas
pattern with no evidence of obstruction.  There is no
pneumatosis or free gas. There are numerous seeds in the
prostate unchanged since the most recent. CT of the abdomen and
pelvis.  There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of
bowel obstruction.
.
ABD U/S [**2134-7-5**]:
1. Cholelithiasis and sludge without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
acute cholecystitis.
2. Pulsatile portal vein and distended hepatic veins most likely
related to right heart failure.
.
CXR [**2134-7-6**]:
Considerable consolidation has developed at both lung bases in
the absence of edema or even much vascular engorgement in the
upper lungs, and therefore could be considered pneumonia rather
than asymmetric edema. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Right
internal jugular line ends centrally.
.
HIDA [**2134-7-7**]:
Abnormal hepatobiliary study. Delayed uptake compatible with
hepatic dysfunction. There is initial gallbladder visualization
indicating no acute cholecystitis. The gallbladder does not
respond to a CCK analog (sincalide) indicating gallbladder
dysfunction.
.
CXR [**2134-7-8**]:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-6**], there is continued
globular enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with essentially
normal pulmonary vasculature, consistent with the clinical
diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. The basilar regions are
substantially clear than on the previous study with only minimal
residual atelectatic change.
.
LENIs of LLE [**2134-7-8**]: IMPRESSION:  No deep vein thrombosis in the
left lowe
