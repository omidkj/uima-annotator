Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5831**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, dysphagia, weakness and fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47342**] is an 86 y/o right-handed woman who was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of dysarthria, dysphagia and fatigue,
which her outpatient neurologist found concerning for myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**].

Ms. [**Known lastname 47342**] explained that over the year prior to admission she
had noticed progressive weakness and fatigue, with difficulty
swallowing and speaking, increased napping, and new-onset
dyspnea. Her weakness seemed to develop over her entire body
simultaneously, with no discernable pattern of spread. Symptoms
are somwehat worse as the day goes on, and are not relieved by
resting. She reports increasing dysphagia (solids>liquids) with
a 20lb weight loss since the start of [**2149**]. She cannot drink
through a straw. She has also had to start using a walker since
[**Month (only) 404**]. Prior to begining to use the walker, she had three
falls in the preceding year, including one in which she
fractured her left wrist. Additionally, Ms. [**Known lastname 47342**] reports that
she now naps much of the day, and as a consequence has been
sleeping less at night--with trouble both falling asleep and
staying asleep. She sleeps an average of 5 hours qNight.

Ms. [**Known lastname 47342**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] that shortly before she began to feel week,
she was hospitalized for PNA, in [**2149-2-17**] (I have been unable
to find mention of this in her online medical record). She
thinks she initially recovered from that but is unsure she ever
returned to baseline before she began developing her current
symptoms. On ROS, she admitted to dyspnea on exertion (such as
taking a shower or getting dressed), and occasional dysuria, but
denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, fevers/chills, abdominal
pain, n/v/d, constipation, hematuri, melena and hematochezia. On
Neuro ROS, she admitted to occasional diplopia (horizontal),
which seems to come and go each day, as well as
gait-unsteadiness, but denied vertigo and fasciculations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47342**] was admitted to the neurology service after
progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, facial weakness and
double vision developed over the last 6-12 months.  Based on her
clinical exam (with neck flexor/extensor weakness, bifacial
weakness, on diplopia on upgaze, shortness of breath with
sentences all of which worsened over the course of the day), she
was diagnosed with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  Because of her tenous
cardiac health and the need for anticoagulation, she was
initially treated with 2 course of IVIG and mestinon with mild
improvement of her symptoms.  After consulting with her primary
cardiologist, it was determined that the potential benefits
outweighed any risks for clot, so her coumadin was discontinued
and she completed plasmapheresis x 5.

Her anti-AchR antibodies and anti-Musk antibodies were negative,
suggesting that she has seronegative myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  She had
EMG performed and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**] felt that there was a strong
suggestion of myasthenia.

She intermittently had labile blood pressures and required
uptitration of her blood pressure medication.  In addition, she
developed sustained atrial fibrillation after the 2nd
plasmapheresis cycle and was started on amiodarone on the
recommend
