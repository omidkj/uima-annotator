on [**11-26**].


History of Present Illness:
 44 y/o with h/o left groin synovial sarcoma, cardomyopathy
presents to [**Hospital1 **] with 1 day of Left groin pain and fever to 102
at home. He felt normal until this am when he developed rapidly
worsenging Left groin/LLQ pain. The pain is described as a deep,
dull ache which radiates down the left leg. He has decreased ROM
and increased swelling in the left leg as well. He has a JP
drain in place from last admission which was previously putting
out 200-300cc daily which has decreased to 25cc daily over the
last week. His wound vac was discontinued by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] last
THursday. This am after he was seen by VNA he developed Fever to
102 and rigors. He reports Nausea and vomitting x 2 in the [**Hospital1 **]
ED, non-bloody. No diarrhea.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] was initially diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in
3/[**2139**]. Biopsy on [**2139-5-7**] showed a malignant spindle cell
neoplasm, intermediate grade, most consistent with synovial
sarcoma, predominantly monophasic type. He completed
neoadjuvant adriamycin/radiation followed by resection
of left pelvic the synovial sarcoma on [**2139-9-10**]. The resection
included excision of the left external iliac artery and vein
with a 10-mm Dacron graft reconstruction extending from the
proximal origin of the external iliac to the common femoral
artery. He was
re-hospitalized [**Date range (1) 10578**]/09 with abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting with fluid collection and concern for infection at the
operative site. He was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, and
then discharged to home on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Mr
[**Known lastname 1511**] was again admitted from [**Date range (1) 19287**] for abd pain, fever, N/V
and underwent US-guided drainage of left inguinal seroma
([**2139-10-13**]) Left groin exploration and debridement of lymphocele
and vacuum-assisted closure device placement ([**2139-10-17**]). He was
discharged on Bactrim. He presented again on [**10-18**],
undergoing an additional CT guided drainage and placement of JP
drain with continued treatment with bactrim.
.
Review of systems is otherwise normal. No nightsweats. No
myalgias. Mild sore throat this am. No SOB, cough, chest pain,
palpatations, PND or orthopnea, dysuria or urinary frequency. No

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 44 y/o with synovial sarcoma s/p resection
and multiple drainage of seroma presents with LLQ / left groin
pain and fever.
.
#. Sepsis: Febrile to 105 with mild hypotension despite 6L IVF
recusitation suggestive of sepsis. Location of pain with large
fluid collection makes the fluid collection the most likely
source of infection. JP with suction in place. The presences of
dacron graft in the area is worrisome for possible colonization
of the foreign body. CXR without PNA. UA clean making them less
likely as source of infection. No prodrome to suggest viral
infection. He was continued on vanco and zosyn for broad
coverage. Dopamine weaned. Levophed used briefly and weaned.
Hemodynamically stable upon transfer.
.
# Left groin fluid collection s/p recection of synovial sarcoma.
Followed by Gen [**Doctor First Name **] and plastics while in the ICU. As above,
most likely source of infection. Fluid collection grew 2+ GNRs.
CT was done. It showed a large fluid collection tracking along
the left iliopsoas mu
