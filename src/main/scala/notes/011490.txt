Service: NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In summary, this is an
80-year-old man with past medical history significant for
lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, and COPD, who presented with intractable
emesis, slurred speech, and later obtundation.  He was
initially brought to [**Hospital3 628**], where pneumonia was
diagnosed.  He was intubated for hypoxia and
unresponsiveness, and then was sent to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

Here at [**Hospital3 **], his head CT showed a left cerebellar
infarct.  His INR was therapeutic on arrival at [**Location (un) 620**],
however, when he presented here, his INR was actually 5.2.  A
MRI was done here at [**Hospital1 **], which confirmed
an infarction in the left superior cerebellar territory.  He
was extubated on [**2113-1-26**], and has done well since.
He was transferred to the floor from the ICU on [**2113-1-28**].  He was still on a face mask O2.  He denied any
shortness of breath, and says that he felt well.  In
discussion with his wife and the patient as per his wishes,
he did not want to be re-intubated for respiratory failure.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked one pack per day.  He has no

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant only for cardiac disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the floor, he was
afebrile at 97.2, blood pressure is 166/70, heart rate was
78, respiratory rate was 18, and he was satting 99% on a 40%
face mask.  He was in no acute distress.  He appeared
comfortable.  HEENT examination:  His oropharynx was clear.
Mucous membranes were moist.  His lungs had coarse bilateral
breath sounds with some end expiratory wheezes at the bases.
His heart was irregular with normal S1, S2 with no murmurs.
His abdomen was soft, and extremities were warm.
Neurologically, he was able to follow one step commands.  He
showed two fingers.  He was able to lift up both legs.  He
was able to lift up both arms.  He can answer simple
questions appropriately.  He was fluent, but no dysarthria
that was obvious.  Cranial nerves:  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  He
was able to cross the midline with gaze.  His fundi were
normal.  He had a right facial droop.  His tongue protruded
to the midline without vesiculations.  On motor examination,
he had normal bulk and tone throughout.  He moved his left
arm against gravity.  Weaker on the right upper extremity,
however, he was able to lift it against gravity.  He had less
spontaneous overall movement on the right arm.  His legs:  He
was able to lift both of them equally and hold them up.  He
had very slight weakness on the right leg compared to the
left leg throughout.  His reflexes were 1+ in the upper
extremities.  They seem to be decreased on the right side.
He has an upgoing toe on the right side.  Sensation:  He
withdrew to pain.  It was intact to light touch and
temperature, however, the patient not very cooperative with
this examination.  Unable to really test coordination again
due to cooperativity, had not been able to test his walk.

LABORATORIES:  On presentation to the floor, his laboratories
were a white count of 7.3, platelets of 204, hematocrit 37.4.
His INR was therapeutic, at one point it was complicated with
an INR of 5.2 likely secondary to levofloxacin which was
started for his pneumonia.  Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s. was held
and then his INR drifted down to normal levels.

His levofloxacin after two days was switched to ceftriaxone
and he was also started on clindamycin IV.  He completed 10
days total of levofloxacin plus ceftriaxone and nine days of
clindamycin IV, and his chest x-ray was markedly improved.

His hospital course was complicated only by the pneumonia.
He was very slow to come back appear more alert and oriented,
and after seven days, he was on nasogastric tube feeds, and
eventually a PEG tube was placed on [**2113-2-8**].  He was
started on PEG tube feeds on [**2-9**] a.m. and he has
tolerated those well without complications.

In summary, this is an 80-year-old man with history of
lymphoma, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, who presented with
emesis, slurred speech, and right hemiparesis, who was found
to have a left superior cerebellar artery infarction with
residual deficits.  He has mild ataxia and mild hemiparesis
on the right side with a right facial droop.  He was
evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy team
here, who deemed that he needed acute rehab services.

After discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent out to rehab on
[**2113-2-10**].
