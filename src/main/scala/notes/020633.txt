RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S.

Reason: eval for incr Cr, please eval transplanted kidney only,
plea

HISTORY: 72-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and
transplanted kidney in [**2179**] with rising baseline creatinine.

DOPPLER ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION: The transplanted kidney is in
the right lower quadrant. No renal stones or hydronephrosis is
seen. It measures 12.2 cm in length. No renal masses are seen. A
small 6 mm cyst is seen in its interpolar region.

The resistive indices in the upper pole are 0.81, and in the
lower pole are 0.81 as well. Increased resistance is
demonstrated in the mid pole arterials with low to no diastolic
flow. The main renal artery and [**Year (4 digits) 5703**] in the renal hilum are
patent. Images of the bladder are limited as the bladder is not
fully distended.

IMPRESSION: Increased resistance to flow demonstrated in the mid
pole arterioles of the transplant kidney as described above

WOUND CARE:

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your wound(s).

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your lower or upper
extremities (notably on the side of the incision).

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

GENERAL:

DIABETIC FOOT CARE:

Diabetes is a disease in which high blood glucose levels over
time can damage the nerves, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels.
Diabetes can also lead to decreases in the body's ability to
fight infection. When diabetes is not well controlled, damage to
the organs and impairment of the immune system is likely. Foot
problems can develop and quickly become serious.

With damage to the nervous system, a person with diabetes may
not be able to feel his or her feet properly. Normal sweat
secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the
foot is impaired. These factors together can lead to abnormal
pressure on the skin, bones, and joints of the foot during
walking and can lead to breakdown of the skin of the foot. Sores
may develop.

Damage to blood vessels and impairment of the immune system from
diabetes makes it difficult to heal these wounds. Bacterial
infection of the skin, connective tissues, muscles, and bones
can then occur. These infections can develop into gangrene. The
ultimate result may be the amputation of the foot or leg. If the
infection spreads to the bloodstream, this process can be life
threatening.

People with diabetes must be fully aware of how to prevent foot
problems before they occur, to recognize problems early, and to
seek the right treatment when problems do occur. Although
treatment for diabetic foot problems has improved, prevention,
including good control over blood sugar, remains the best way to
prevent problems.

Diabetics should learn how to examine their own feet and how to
recognize the early signs and symptoms of diabetic foot
problems.

They should also learn what is reasonable to do at home as far
as routine foot care, how to recognize when to call the doctor,
and how to recognize when a problem has become serious enough to
seek emergency treatment.

RISK FACTORS:

These risk factors increase your chances of developing foot
problems and diabetic infections in your legs and feet if you
are diabetic.

Footwear:

Poorly fitting shoes are a common cause of diabetic foot
problems.

If you have red spots, sore spots, blisters, corns, calluses, or
consistent pa
