Pertinent Results:
[**2123-9-30**] Video Swallow
Moderate impairment of swallow as described above. There was
mild penetration and aspiration as described above.

[**2123-10-2**] Head CT
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
of normally midline structures. Specifically, there is no
evidence of brainstem compression. There are numerous foci of
low density in the periventricular and subcortical white matter
of both cerebral hemispheres, many of which are confluent,
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Bilateral thalamic lacunar infarctions are present, which are of
unknown age. Lacunar infarction is also noted in the lateral
aspect of the right lentiform nucleus, age also unknown. Chronic
infarctions are present in the right and left cerebral
hemispheres. Atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted.
The ventricles are normal in size. Both orbits appear
unremarkable. The visualized osseous structures also appear
unremarkable.

[**2123-10-5**] Video Swallow
Moderate residue, mild penetration, and mild aspiration to
improve with the compensatory maneuvers the patient was able to
perform. For a detailed description of the findings and
recommendations, please see the speech pathology report under
CareWeb.

[**2123-10-8**] MRI/MRA
MRI - Acute small infarcts in the right frontal, left posterior
temporal, and right cerebellar regions. Other changes as above
including chronic infarcts in thalami and white matter.
MRA - No significant abnormalities detected on the MRA of the
head.

[**2123-10-6**] CXR
Small bilateral pleural effusions, improved compared to prior
chest radiograph.

[**2123-9-27**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Long QTc interval. Lateral ST segment changes are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2123-9-5**] no
significant change, except for faster rate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 58825**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2123-9-27**] for elective
surgical management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken
directly to the operating room where she underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a 19 Magna pericardial valve and an
ascending aorta replacement with a 24mm gelweave graft.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, she was
weaned off of mechanical ventilation and sedation and extubated.
She was alert, but had difficulty focusing ans appeared
confused. By POD #2 pt was having difficulty swallowing and was
coughing up all boluses and a swallow evaluation was performed
(please see results). On POD #3 pt continued to be confused and
now agitated. In addition she was noted to have hallucinations.
She was started on Halodol and Ativan and a sitter was placed in
the room (sitter remained with the pt during almost entire
post-op course). It was thought pt was having DT's and was
started on Thiamine and Folate. On this day her chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed. Her rhythm converted from
sinus to atrial fibrillation. She was already on Lopressor,
Amiodarone and Heparin was started (eventually coumadin was
started). Pt. continued to remain confused and agitated and was
noted to have a dilated left pupil on POD #5. Head CT was
performed and was negative for acute CVA. Also do to the
confusion pt was having difficulty coordinating the IS. She had
occassional wheezes with decreased breath sounds and needed
aggressive pulmonary therapy and toilet while in the CSRU. On
POD #7 she was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the
telemetry floor. But she did remain NPO and a repeat swallow
study was performed. She did improve but was only able to have
diet advanced to pureed solids and nectar thick liquids. Despite
DT prevention and ativan pt continued to remain agitated and
confused, with difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**] still on POD #9. And was noted
to have a fixed gaze with restricted EOMI laterally. Neurology
was consulted on this day and an MRI was performed on POD #11.
MRI showed several small acute strokes. Neurology noted that
these lesions didn't correlate with symptoms. Neurology thought
that confusion might have been do to Amiodarone causing
supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Amiodarone was d/c'd and symptoms
improved. Pt. continued to have difficulty swallowing and
advancing diet therefor a PEG tube was placed under fluoro on
POD #14. She had another repeat swallow study and was started on
swallow therapy.
Pt. was followed by both physical therapy and nutrition during
post-op course and treated accordingly.
Her mental status cleared and she was advanced on her TF.  She
is being anticoagulated with coumadin and will have daily INR
checks at rehab.  As an outpatient she will have her INR
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13075**].
On POD#18 she was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
