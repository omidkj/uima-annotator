   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-4-2**] 5:15 PM
Reason: please eval for focal infarct / bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p AAA repair POD 19 with mental status changes
and overall decreased mentation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for focal infarct / bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 59-year-old male status post AAA repair,
postoperative day #19, presenting with mental status changes.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Study is limited secondary to motion artifacts.
Allowing for this factor, there is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline
structures or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation
appears well preserved. Basal cisterns are patent. Ventricles,
cisterns and sulci are unremarkable. There are calcifications
within the vertebral and internal carotid arteries,
atherosclerotic in origin. The basilar artery appears tortuous
without definite aneurysmal dilatation. There is opacification
within the visualized superior aspect of the maxillary sinuses
with frothy secretion component. No fractures are identified.
The mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Prominent, tortuous basilar artery without definite
aneurysmal dilatation.
3. Likely maxillary sinus disease. The maxillary sinuses are not
completely imaged on this head CT scan.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
