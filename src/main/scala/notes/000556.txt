Service:  CCU/MED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Here for elective alcohol septal ablation.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 111649**] is a
79-year-old female with a history of heart failure secondary
to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who presents to
the CCU following an alcohol ablation of her septum.  The
patient has had the diagnosis of septal hypertrophy with
outflow obstruction, and cardiac catheterization in [**2144-10-3**] showed mild diagonal disease, severe mitral
regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, severe left ventricular
outflow tract gradient of 100-110 mmHg.  The patient has had
over the last few months worsening dyspnea on exertion,
fatigue with chores, and decreased exercise tolerance.  She
has been followed in the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic by
both Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She
denied any chest pain.  She was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
alcohol ablation, which occurred on [**2145-11-17**].
Subsequently, she was transferred to the CCU team.

In the Cath Lab, alcohol ablation was successfully performed,
with a reduction of her peak left ventricular outflow tract
gradient to 10-15 mmHg (from 100-110 mmHg).  There was also a
limited LCA injection which showed a normal large LCA.
Following her catheterization, she was transferred to the CCU
where she presented essentially denying any chest pain,
shortness of breath.  She had no fever, chills, no urinary
symptoms, no vomiting, and no other complaints with the
exception of feeling tired.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, chronic DDD pacer for complete heart block
placed in [**2140-4-2**], history of endocarditis in [**2140-4-2**], and inguinal node biopsy that was notably benign.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father had CAD (versus HOCM) and her
brother has CAD (versus HOCM).

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  Include hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone at home.  She has two
daughters who are involved in her care; one lives in
[**State 4565**].  She is a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2.  Verapamil 180 mg q.d.
3.  Toprol XL 100 mg q.d.
4.  Fosamax 70 mg q. week.
5.  Wellbutrin 100 mg b.i.d.
6.  Amiloride 5 mg q.d.
7.  Nexium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her heart rate was 64,
blood pressure 94/43.  She was saturating 100% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  In general, she was pleasant and slightly
fatigued but in no apparent distress.  Her eyes were
anicteric.  Her oropharynx was clear without exudates.  She
had a cardiac examination that was significant for regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2, and a III/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border consistent with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Her lung examination was clear
to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes.  Her abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended, with no organomegaly.  Her
extremities had palpable pedal pulses bilaterally.  Her right
groin site was without ecchymosis, nontender, and without
bruits.  Neurologically, she was alert and oriented times
three.  Her cranial nerve examination was grossly intact and
the remainder of her neurological examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Her white blood cell count
was 5.8, hematocrit 38.3, platelets 199,000.  Her INR was
1.1.  Her sodium was 137, potassium 5.0, BUN 29, creatinine
1.2, glucose 92.

IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  On [**2145-11-17**], she had a
transthoracic echocardiogram status post ethanol ablation.
It demonstrated hyperenhancement of the basal septum.  Her
left systolic function was excellent with an ejection
fraction of greater than 65%.  She was also noted to have
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  This was in
comparison to her preablation echocardiogram which again
demonstrated and EF of greater than 65% and left ventricular
outflow tract peak of 36-40.  Her EKG postablation on
admission to the CCU demonstrated DDD pacing at 87 beats per
minute with a left bundle branch block (this is an old
finding).

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIAC:  Ischemia; the patient received an ethanol
ablation which is consistent with a deliberately induced
myocardial infarction.  She had peak creatinine kinases of
868, peak MB 122, peak index 14.1.  She had no ensuing chest
pain following her ablation.  She was maintained on aspirin
at 325 mg q.d.

PUMP:  Her postablation echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of
greater than 65%.  She was maintained on her anticontractile
agents of Toprol XL at 100 mg q.h.s. and her verapamil SR was
slowly tapered from 180 mg to 120 mg q.a.m. upon discharge.

RHYTHM:  The patient is chronically DDD paced.  She had some
episodes of her native AV conduction demonstrated on
telemetry throughout her postablation course.  Upon
discharge, she remained DDD paced with no further issues.

2.  NEUROLOGY:  Sedation was withheld postablation.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three and had no further
issues in this regard.

Overall, the patient did well postprocedure, ambulated well
on postprocedure day number two, and was discharged home with
no further issues.

MEDICATIONS UPON DISCHARGE:
1.  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Verapamil SR 120 mg p.o. q.a.m.
3.  Amiloride 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Bupropion 100 mg b.i.d.
5.  Alendronate 70 mg q. week.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.

Of note, the patient received a flu shot prior to discharge.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up in three months with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] appointment of which has already been
scheduled.  Prior to this visit, she will receive a repeat
transthoracic echocardiogram which has already been
scheduled.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, status
post alcohol septal ablation.
