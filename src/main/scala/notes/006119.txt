History of Present Illness:
82 yo male with history of diverticulitis, CAD s/p CABG, and AVR
on aspirin/plavix who was transferred from an OSH with two days
of fever, N/V and abdominal pain. He had a cataract repair on
Wednesday. On Saturday, he started to feel unwell. He felt
"woozy" and reports poor PO intake with nausea and vomiting.
Also noted to have abdominal pain that was worse when driving
over bumps in the road. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
He denies foley catheter placement during surgery. He denies
prior UTI's. He has not had prior abdominal surgery. He reports
a colonoscopy a few years ago and notes normal daily bowel
movements. His last BM was on Friday. His BP's are typically
greater than 100.
At the OSH, he was febrile, and persistently hypotensive despite
3L fluid. He was exquisitely tender to palpation abdominal exam
with guarding most notably in right lower quadrant. Non-con CT
abd did not reveal any acute abdominal issue. There was concern
for ischemic bowel, so he was given 1 dose zosyn and
transferred.
In the ED, initial VS: 5 98.8 114 98/57 20 94% on RA.
- Labs were notable for lactate 1.5, trop 0.13, and Cr 2.6
- UA w/ UTI
- portable CXR w/o obvious pneumonia; possible mild bibasilar
atelectasis/effusion
- gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult: no need for OR
- noncon CT from OSH: stone, AAA without extravastation, no wall
thickening about gall bladder, no free air or fluid
- blood pressures dipping into 80-90s systolic with HR around
100, sat 96% on 3L O2, afebrile
- Total 5L NS received (3 @OSH, 2 here)
- 20g in right AC, 22g in left AC both from OSH
- Abdominal exam still with severe tenderness to palpation
throughout stay, no rebound or guarding
- foley new from OSH
Vitals prior to transfer were: 101 93/49 20 95% on 2L.

On arrival to the MICU, he is currently nauseated but passing
gas. He reports [**4-13**] squeezing abdominal pain that was initially
over the right side of the abdomen but is now moving to the left
side. He is thirsty but denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.

REPORTS:
CXR: 1.  Vascular congestion could be due to volume overload
(particularly if the patient is receiving volume support). 2.
New left base pneumonia or atelectasis.

ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the septum and inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated,
with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated, normal
functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Puilmonary artery hypertension. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. .

KUB:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of bowel
obstruction or perforation.

RUQ U/S: 1.  Ill-defined hypoechoic area in segment III of the
liver is indeterminate.  This finding would be better evaluated
with cross-sectional imaging such as CT/MRI. 2.  Cholelithiasis
without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis. 3.
Echogenic and atrophic kidneys most likely related to chronic
renal disease.  Bilateral simple renal cysts and non-obstructing
left-sided nephrolithiasis.  4.  Fusiform infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm appears stable to prior exam, however, is better
evaluated on prior CT abdomen.

CXR: Increase in mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The rest of the
exam is unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:
82 year old male with HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG who presents with
four days of fatigue along with two days of fever and abdominal
pain to outside hospital with course complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD,
hypotension, and acute GIB.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#GIB: Patient had moderate volume (~300cc) of coffee ground
emesis on the afternoon of [**2169-7-3**].  Hemodynamically stable with
SBPs in 130's, HR in 80's, clinically stable.  The patient was
bolused a liter of fluid, placed on a PPI, made NPO, had his
antibiotics switched to IV, and GI was consulted.  They
attempted to take the patient for an EGD on [**2169-7-4**] to the [**Hospital Ward
