Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
34 yr old male with hx of secundum type ASD with right-to-left
shunt and severe pulm HTN (75/33), asthma and heroin abuse who
presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with substernal chest pain. Pt describes
the chest pain as "like a knife," [**7-2**], worse with deep breaths
and cough. The pain was associated with palpitations and
shortness of breath. Of note, pt was admitted one month ago for
chest pain and a cardiac cath showed clean coronaries. Pt was
given ASA, beta blocker, SL NTG x 3 and morphine with
improvement in the pain.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt complained of sudden onset of chest pain with
associated shortness of breath. At that time, his O2 sat dropped
to the 60s and improved to only 82% on 100%NRB. A gas on the NRB
7.46/23/51. A CXR was unremarkable and a CTA was negative for PE
and acute pathology in the lungs. Given his hx of severe pulm
HTN and ASD, there was concern for shunting and cardiology was
called. Cardiology recommended oxygen therapy and ativan for
anxiety. He was started on a NTG gtt given his pulm HTN. Pt was
admitted to MICU for work up of pulmonary HTN and hypoxia [**1-25**]
right-to-left shunt.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pulmonary hypertension/Eisenmenger's syndrome - Most likely
etiology is Eisenmenger's syndrome secondary to 34 years with
unrepaired ASD. On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 8878**] was initially in the
MICU, where he received NTG gtt and inhaled O2/NO with
improvement in his oxygenation by ABG and relief of his SOB. He
was eventually weaned off the NTG and NO, and was also weaned
from non-rebreather to O2 by NC.  He was started on sildenafil
50 mg PO TID.  An HIV test, as well as autoantibodies, were sent
to evaluate as a possible cause of primary pulmonary
hypertension.  Autoantibodies were negative.  The HIV
confirmatory test is pending as of this writing. The pt ruled
out for an MI with enzymes x 3.  Notably, the patient had a
serum tox and Urine tox sent AFTER he had been given morphine in
the ER. He denies having used heroin x 8 months.
  On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 8878**] was satting well on 2LNC, then
weaned to RA, on which he satt'ed between 92-97% consistently,
including during ambulation.  He continued to receive
sildenafil, and was also started on Lisinopril 2.5 daily.  He
complained of a dry cough (starting before the ACE inhibitor was
started) and was given guaifenesin/dextromethorphan.  He also
used a combivent inhaler.  We discussed with the patient his
grave condition and that the only hope for a real cure was
heart-lung transplant. The pt definitely lacked insight into the
intensity of such a solution, and would require further
discussion as an outpatient. We impressed upon him the gravity
of the situation and the importance of close follow-up with a
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt stated that he understood the importance of
keeping his appointments iwth both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5543**], his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the pulmonologist.  The pt expressed an interest in
being placed on the transplant list, at which time Hepatitis
serologies were sent. The labs have since returned consistent
with Chronic Hepatitis B, of which the patient will be informed
as an outpt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5543**], his usual PCP.
  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt was seen by pulmonary, who recommended that we continue
with sildenafil and did not recommend home O2 for the patient,
as it was thought to do little to improve his clinical picture.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.  The patient
was also seen by cardiology, and had a repeat echo that showed
much worsening EF (20-25%) and global hypokinesis. Although
there was no intervention for the patient acutely other than an
ACE, as his Eisenmenger's syndrome and extreme pulmonary artery
hypertension can no longer be repaired with closure of his ASD,
cards recommended that as an outpatient [**Known firstname 26785**] PCPs consider
having him seen by a specialist in heart failure for input.
 The pt was discharged on sildenafil 50 mg PO TID, lisinopril
2.5 mg PO daily, and combivent inhaler.

2. cough - The pt complained of a dry cough before starting his
ACE inhibitor. As he was only on his ACE for 2 days before
discharge, it is unclear whether this will be exacerbated by the
medication. PT was given cough suppressant as his cough was
thought to be benign.

3. communication - The pt is [**Name (NI) 8003**] speaking only. He was given
discharge information in [**Name (NI) 8003**], as well as prescriptions in
[**Name (NI) **].  The above conversations occurred in [**Name (NI) 8003**] as well.
