Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention


History of Present Illness:
58 year old woman w hx of HLD, HTN, DM, no known hx of CAD who
was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**] for elective
right total knee replacement for longstanding arthritis.
Procedure went without complications three days prior to
admission.  She notes that she had a blood transfusion the day
after the procedure which resulted in a transfusion reaction,
including temperature changes, pruritis, fevers, chills, and
delirium immediately after starting transfusion; blood
transfusion was continued for the rest of the unit.

On the third post-operative day, the patient reported crushing
8/10 chest pain and shortness of breath associated with
diaphoresis and severe nausea.  She reports having some nausea
for the last three days, worsened  was ruled out for PE with
chest CT and found to have elevated cardiac enzymes.  She was
given 8mg IV morphine, aspirin, plavix, IV benadryl, and
sublingual nitroglycerin.  Her blood pressures dropped after two
doses of sublingual nitroglycerin. She developed severe
itchiness, which was presumed to be secondary to the morphine,
on her arms and back, for which she received IV benadryl with
good effect.  ECG showed TWI in anterior and inferior leads
V1-V3, III and T-wave flattening in leads in the remaining
leads.  CXR showed atelectasis.  CTA was done to rule out
pulmonary embolism and showing a 2cm well defined nodule
requiring [**2-21**] month followup.  Urine analysis was negative.
Notable labs from outside hospital include Hct 24, platelets 96,
INR 1.3, PTT 40.  Platelet count on [**2176-2-21**] was 84.  On day of
transfer at 3:30pm, CK 77, CK-MB 3.3, Troponin-I 0.43.  At 8pm,
just prior to transfer, Troponin was trending down to 0.39.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

On presentation to the CCU, patient complained of pruritis from
morphine.  She complained also of chest pain [**2-28**].  ECG showed
similar T wave changes to prior ECG at outside hospital.  Her
chest pain increased to [**4-27**], accompanied by mild nausea.  She
was started on a nitroglycerin drip and treated with ativan with
resolution of the pain.  ECG at this time again had no further
ST-T wave changes.

Patient reported having similar chest pressure last week while
folding laundry but more mild.  She reports having some
orthopnea at home when flat on her back, sleeps on [**1-20**] pills.
She attributes her dyspnea on exertion to her asthma.

Patient notes that he did have a temperature to 101F in the last
couple of days prior to transfer; her temperature was elevated
to 100.5F at outside hospital prior to transfer and was given
tylenol.  She notes a recent cough in the last few days
occasionally productive of sputum.  She denies hematochezia or
melena, though she does have alternating diarrhea and
constipation, most recently constipation. She did complain of
pruritis in her skin, mostly in her arms and back, much improved
from previously at the outside hospital. Her elbows were
particularly itchy.

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam:

VS: T= 99.2 BP= 113/65 HR= 88 RR= 25 O2sat= 95%
GENERAL: WDWN woman in NAD. Oriented x3. Anxious.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. EOMI. dry mucus membranes.

sternal border.
LUNGS: Resp unlabored. CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.

Discharge exam:

Pertinent Results:
Lower extremity ultrasound [**2176-2-25**]

TECHNIQUE: Multiple grayscale and Doppler ultrasound images of
bilateral
lower extremity veins were obtained.

FINDINGS: Bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and
popliteal veins
demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
Bilateral
posterior tibial and peroneal veins demonstrate color flow.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within
bilateral lower
extremities.

V/Q scan [**2176-2-26**]
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate central
clumping, which can be seen in COPD. Perfusion images in the
same 8 views show
no defect. Chest x-ray shows no focal abnormality.

The above findings are consistent with a very low probability of
pulmonary
embolism.

IMPRESSION: 1. Very low probability of pulmonary embolism. 2.
Central clumping
on ventilation images, which can be seen in COPD.

[**2176-2-24**] Transthoracic echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. There is no mass/thrombus in
the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with regional systolic
dysfunction. Differential diagnosis includes an isolated RV
infarction or acute pulmonary hypertension due to PE (pulmonary
pressures may be underestimated on the current study).

[**2176-2-24**] Cardiac catherization
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD, and LCX
were
patent. The RCA had an eccentric 70% stenosis in the mid vessel.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 15 mmHg. There was moderate
systemic
arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 155 mmHg.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis on left heart
pullback.
4. Successful direct stenting of the mid RCA stenosis with a
3.5x15 and
a 3.5x8mm Vision stents. Final angiography revealed no residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III
flow (
see PTCA comments).
5. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful placement of BMS x 2 to RCA.
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.
