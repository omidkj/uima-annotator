[**2126-10-6**] - EKG: mild ST elevation in V3, unchanged from previous


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the CVICU.  EKG was unchanged from
prior and cardiology felt that the entire clinical picture was
of low suspicion for acute plaque rupture given his renal
failure and previously elevated cardiac markers, instead much
more likely a demand ischemia in the setting of his medical
illnesses and exertion at rehab.  He was transfused with 2 units
of blood for his Hct of 24 and responded appropriately with Hct
increasing to 29.8 and staying constant throughout his
hospitalization.  His troponins leveled off and trended
downwards starting at 0.42-->.45-->.54-->.52-->.47. He had no
further episodes of chest pain.

His white count was initially 12.1 on admission and sputum
cultures from prior admission revealed MRSA+.  He was started on
vanco and continued on the cipro which he was continued on as
outpatient.  After no new growth from the cultures and mini-BAL
negative for bacteria and being afebrile since admission, the
antibiotics were stopped.

On discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was afebrile, vitals within normal
limits and reported feeling "much better".
