CT HEAD ([**5-11**]):
1. Multiple foci of hemorrhage within the bilateral basal
ganglia and right temporal lobe. 6-mm shift of normally midline
structures towards the left. Subtle hyperdensity due to blood
products is also seen in pons.
2. The right parietal extra-axial hematoma appears to be
subdural.
3. Interventricular hemorrhage within the right posterior and
left posterior lateral ventricles. Left ventricular system mild
dilatation concerning for early hydrocephalus.
4. Small amount of subdural hemorrhage layering along the right
tentorium.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 51 year old man hx of Etoh abuse who was found
after a fall, and has multiple intracranial hemorrhages, with
IVH, and a small right parietal epidural bleed. It is not clear
if he had one hemorrhage, fell, and then had the other
intraparenchymal hemorrhages and the right epidural, OR if he
fell first and then
had the multiple intracranial hemorrhages and the epidural
hemorrhage. The intracranial hemorrhages may thus be due to
trauma, or hypertension.  Possible underlying mass, AVM or VST
were ruled out with MRI/A/V of the head with and without
contrast.

He was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the ICU.
He developed a fever on HD#2 for which he had fever work-up
which showed 1/2 blood culture growing GPC in pairs and chains
plus sputum growing multiple species including possible
Haemophilus species plus GNRs hence he was started on broad ABX
of vancomycin and Zosyn.  He never developed leukocytosis.
Although he had no stigmata, given mulitple ICH and positive
blood culture, TTE was obtained to rule out endocarditis.

He was made CMO and transferred to the floor.
