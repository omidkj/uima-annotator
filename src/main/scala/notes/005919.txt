Pertinent Results:
-CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**11-18**]

1. No acute osseous injury identified.
2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.

-CT head [**11-18**]

1. No acute intracranial process

-CT C Spine [**11-18**]

There is a fracture through the right transverse process of C1
vertebral body involving the foramen and the right and left
posterior lamina of C1
([**Location (un) 5621**]-type fracture).
The dens is intact. A nondisplaced impaction-type fracture is
noted in the
lateral mass on the right of the C2 vertebral body.
C3 is fractured through the right pars interarticularis
extending into the
proximal lamina with minimal displacement.
The C4 right pedicle is fractured. A small triangular fragment
at the right posterior inferior vertebral body corner
representsa small avulsive type fracture.
Fracture is noted at the right C5 superior articulating facet
extending
longitudinally through the lamina terminating at the
spinolaminar junction.
Slight hyperattenuation is noted posterior to the C3-C%
vertebral bodies
suspicious for epidural hemorrhage. High attenuation is also
noted layering
along the ventral cord at these levels suggesting subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
C6 and C7 are intact. There is multilevel disk space narrowing
from
pre-existing degenerative disease. There is a markedly
anteriorly displaced
anterior osetophyte at C4-5 suggesting extension-type injury at
this level
since reduced. This would be congruent with the posterior
element fractures
noted above (accounting for a rightward tilt to the trauma
mechanism).
Current alignment is anatomic with cervical lordosis maintained.
Marked
pervertebral soft tissue swelling noted.

-MRI Cervical spine [**11-18**]

1. Hemorrhagic cord contusion with surrounding edema extending
from the C2
through the C6 levels.

2. Evidence of extensive ligamentous injury, as described above.


3. Extramedullary intradural hematoma appears to extend to the
cervicothoracic junction and at C5 causes leftward mass effect
on the cord.

4. Multiple cervical spinal fractures, right more than left, are
better
detailed on the recent CT of the cervical spine. High signal
within the C4-5
and C6-7 disks is also likely related to trauma.

-X ray L hand [**11-19**]

Fractures of the left small and ring finger metacarpals, as
above.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2198-12-2**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
---CTA Chest [**12-2**]

1. Acute isolated right apical subsegmental pulmonary embolism,
the clinical
significance of which is uncertain.
2. New moderately severe bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
3. New bilateral small pleural effusions.
4. Right upper and right lower lobe consolidation and clustered
nodules are
consistent with an acute infection, acute aspiration is also
considered
possible.

[**2198-12-5**]:
Chest XR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], allowing for
the obliquity of the patient, there is no change in the
monitoring and support devices.  There appears to be some
improved aeration in the retrocardiac region at the left base,
though some atelectatic change persists. No evidence of vascular
congestion or definite acute pneumonia

[**2198-12-13**]
CTA Chest
1. New segmental PE in vessels supplying right lower lobe
posteriorly and
lateral right middle lobe. Possible additional subsegmental PE
supplying left
upper lobe posteriorly. No infarct or new right heart strain.
2. Improvement in right middle and lower lobe peribronchial
nodules and
consolidation c/w improving infection or resolving aspiration.
3. Persistent bronchial impaction and airway secretions
(particularly on the
left), with persistent near-complete left lower lobe collapse,
which could be
due to recurrent aspiration.
4. Nearly resolved bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt initially admitted to the ICU and the trauma service after he
was intubated for airway protection following a fall from 20
feet. Multiple cervical spine fractures noted on CT scan and he
remained in a hard cervical collar with flat bed rest until his
thoracic and lumbar spine could be safely cleared.
 His exam on admission was limited movement of his R fingers and
was able to shrug shoulders, his right side greater than his
left side. MRI of cervical spine was consistent with multiple
cervical spine fractures and stir changes within the cord from
C2-C6 but showed no canal compromise and no role for emergent
surgical intervention.
 Further treatment options of his cervical spine fractures were
discussed with attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] and it was decided that
patient would remain in a hard cervical collar for treatment of
his fractures. He was found to have displaced fracture of his
left ring finger and this was reduced by the hand surgery team
and placed in a splint.
on [**11-22**] he spiked a temp and had increasing secretions.  He
underwent bronchoscopy and was started on  7 day course of
antibiotics for presumed ventilator acquired pneumonia.
Ultimately all cultures were negative.
 He underwent an uncomplicated tracheostomy on [**2198-11-23**].
  He was bronched after fever spike to 102.8 on [**11-25**] and these
cultures were also negative.  He was working with PT and OT and
is a good candidate for [**Hospital 74207**] rehab. His
antibiotics were discontinued after a 7 day course on [**2198-11-29**].
his upper extremity strength has improved slightly and is now a
[**3-23**] in both upper extremities.
 On [**12-1**] pt was febri
