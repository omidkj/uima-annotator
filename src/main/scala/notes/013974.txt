Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Mitral valve repair(#32 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring)Tricuspid valve

History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with history of Mitral regurgitation and mitral valve
prolapse who has noticed worsening dyspnea on exertion and leg
edema over the pastmonth. A repeat
echocardiogram by her cardiologist at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] revealed
worsened mitral regurgitation with moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Her LVEF was reduced
at 45%. Given the progression of her mitral regurgitation and
onset of worsened symptoms, she has been referred for surgical
management. Of note, she was treated for a UTI on [**2138-7-27**]

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No
mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC is dilated
(>2.5cm)

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderate/severe MVP. Mild mitral annular
calcification. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**] (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: No TS. Moderate to severe [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
4. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis.
5.There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse of P1 scallop.
Mild MVP of P2 and the anterior leaflet is also seen. Annulus is
mildly dilated at 4 cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation in an
eccentric anterior direction is seen. 8. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid annulus is dilated to
4.2 cm.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including milrinone, vasopressin
and phenylephrine.
1. Left and right ventricular function is unchanged from pre CPB
2. An annuloplasty ring is seen in the mitral position, stable,
trace MR is seen. No [**Male First Name (un) **] or flow acceleration across LVOT seen.
3. An annuloplasty ring is seen in the tricuspid position. Mild
to moderate residual TR is seen.
4. Aortic contours appear to be intact

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
