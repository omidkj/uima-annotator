HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post
left pneumonectomy for lung carcinoma with likely primary
lung carcinoma on right asthma, chronic bronchitis, coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation and GI bleed.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital3 27946**] Hospital on [**2160-4-27**] for
recurrent right pneumonia.  His course at the outside
hospital was complicated by upper GI bleed, status post BICAP
cautery to ulcerated gastric polyp.  He had a visible vessel
and ruling in for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes,
CK 260, MB 9.1, troponin 0.96.  He had a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction on presentation to [**Hospital3 27946**]
Hospital with peak troponin of 3.46 on [**4-29**], CK of 306 in
the setting of his GI bleed.  The patient's hematocrit
dropped to 27.6 and he was transfused with two units of
packed red blood cells.  There was a right middle lobe
infiltrate noted on chest x-ray of [**4-29**] and on [**4-30**] it was
no longer seen.  On [**2160-5-6**] the patient had his PICC line
placed.  On [**2160-5-6**] the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for question of cardiac
catheterization as the patient described intermittent chest
pain and tightness described at 4/10, worsening over the last
five months, no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, but he has had
chest pain for the two days prior to admission here and
increased difficulty lying flat.  The patient also needed to
be intubated for two days at the outside hospital.  The
patient was weaned and extubated successfully.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Lung carcinoma status post left
pneumonectomy with possible right upper lobe primary lung
carcinoma.  2. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
he is steroid and O2 dependent.  3. Gastroesophageal reflux
disease.  4. Coronary artery disease.  5. Atrial
fibrillation, 4+ MR with mitral valve prolapse and an
ejection fraction of 50%.  6. Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1. Prednisone 10 once a day.  2.
Amiodarone 200 once a day.  3. Toprol XL 25 once a day.  4.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q. 4.  6. Alphagan for his
eyes.  5. Protonix 40 once a day.  6. Calcium carbonate 600
once a day.  7. Foradil one puff b.i.d.  8. Vitamin E.  9.
Xalatan drops.

ALLERGIES:  Cipro leads to hallucinations.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco, no alcohol, lives at home
with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were afebrile, 99/44, 97,
30, 98% on two liters.  He was well appearing in no apparent
distress, lying in bed at 60 degrees.  Sclerae were
anicteric, moist mucous membranes.  Pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, without
jugular venous distension.  Chest had positive wheezes
bilaterally, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, [**4-10**]
holosystolic murmur, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended without edema.  Cranial nerves two through 12
were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 31.7, hematocrit 32.1,
platelet count 178, 140/3.8, 98/38, 24/1.2, 129.  Arterial
blood gases 7.53, 46.5, 95 on two liters nasal cannula.
Albumin 2.2, digoxin 1.7, CK 260, MB 9.1, troponin 0.96.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 80-year-old male with severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status
post left pneumonectomy, transferred from an outside hospital
for further evaluation of coronary artery disease, ruling in
for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  The patient
originally was admitted to the medical intensive care unit
where he was observed overnight.

1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient
was given Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV b.i.d. and given p.r.n.
nebulizers with DuoNebs q. 4 hours.  The patient was able to
tolerate that course.  As the patient's breathing became
better he was switched to oral prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d. and
then started a taper.  The taper will end with his home dose
of prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient was not started on
antibiotics as the patient had antibiotics at outside
hospital.  The patient was continued on two liters nasal
cannula at all times.

2. Lung mass:  The patient likely has lung carcinoma again,
with his history of lung carcinoma and smoking history.  The
patient also had chest CT that demonstrated the mass around
his bronchus.  The patient could not tolerate either
bronchoscopy, which he was refusing anyway, and the patient
could not tolerate percutaneous biopsy.  The patient also
already has lung masses demonstrated on CAT scan.  The
patient decided to have comfort care measures initiated
during hospitalization.  The patient also gave sputum
samples.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  The patient's CK
and troponins were trending down and the patient refused
cardiac catheterization as he decided to have comfort
measures only in the setting of lung cancer.  The patient was
not started on heparin because of previous GI bleed that led
to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction when the patient
was on Lovenox.  The patient has 4+ MR so we tried to
increase ACE inhibitor though the patient did not have room
to move because of the blood pressure, so we continued
aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and statin.  The patient
was monitored on telemetry without event.

4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient was in sinus
rhythm throughout this day.  We continued amiodarone 200 once
a day and Lopressor.

5. Severe mitral regurgitation:  The patient tried to keep
ins and outs even, low sodium diet, and an ACE inhibitor.

6. GI bleed:  The patient had all stools guaiac tested.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable during the
hospitalization.  He had a b.i.d. proton pump inhibitor set
and increased amylase and lipase, possible pancreatitis.  The
patient reported no pain and the patient had a right upper
quadrant ultrasound that showed cholelithiasis.  The patient
did not want ERCP as he was comfort care only.  The patient
received one unit of packed red blood cells.

7. Ophthalmology:  The patient had home medications continued
without incident.

8. The patient had increased white blood cells which were
trending down over the hospitalization likely due to
steroids.

9. Disposition:  The patient was seen by physical therapy and
occupational therapy who helped with his movement.  The
patient had been in bed for three weeks.  The patient was
discharged to rehabilitation.  The patient chose DNR/DNI
during this hospitalization and comfort measures only which
were initiated with the help of [**Doctor Last Name 2270**] and we appreciate her
help.
