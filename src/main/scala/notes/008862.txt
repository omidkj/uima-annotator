Pertinent Results:
[**2143-1-27**] CT
1. Small focal of thrombus in the SVC, query prior line
placement?
2. Postsurgical changes involving the aortic arch.
3. Extensive thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm which
terminates in the left common femoral artery. Origins of the
celiac axis, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and left renal arteries are off the false
lumen. There is dissection involving the SMA and left renal
arteries.
4. Suggestion of longstanding occlusion of the left subclavian
and left innominate vein due to multiple collaterals seen within
the neck and collateral from the supreme intercostal vein
through a paravertebral vein draining into the hemiazygos.

[**2143-1-15**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
5. A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent
with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen
in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. There is flow
in the false lumen.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is on an infusion of phenylephrine and is in
sinus rhythm
1. An ascending aortic graft is seen in position.
2. AI is unchanged (trace)
3. There appears to be a line of redundant echodensity on the
Aortic root near the takeoff of the left main coronary artery
which was not present prebyass. There is no flow between it and
the contour of the aorta. There is flow still seen in the left
main coronary artery. Possible sources include, but are not
limited to, a portion of the graft material or pledgets
overlapping the root, or extension of the dissection.
4. The echodensity consistent with aortic dissection is still
seen in aortic arch and descending aorta an is unchanged in
these locations.
5. Biventricular function remains preserved without evidence of
any new wall motion abnormalities.
6. Remaining exam is unchanged.
7. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71435**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2143-1-15**] and taken
urgently to the operating room. She undewent a replacement of
her ascending aorta with resuspension of her aortic valve.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day two, she was
extubated. On postoperative day three, she developed respiratory
distress and was reintubated. A bronchoscopy was performed with
removal of thick secretions.  On post-operative day six she was
re-extubated.  With aggresive pulmonary toilet she remainded
extubated and was sent to the floor on ten.

On the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 71435**] [**Last Name (Titles) 27836**] well. she was seen in
consultation by the physical therapy service.  She was placed on
Keflex for phlebitis noted on her right forearm.  By
post-operative day fifteen she was [**Last Name (un) **] for discharge in stable
condition to home.
