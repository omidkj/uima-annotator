Floor Course:
Patient was transferred from the ICU to the floor in stable
condition on POD1.  She was NPO with IVF and IV pain
medications.  On POD4 the NGT was removed after it had low
output.  On POD6 the patient passed flatus and her diet was
advanced to clear liquids.  Unfortunately, on POD7 the patient
began vomiting and her abdomen was distended.  CT scan found and
ileus with questionable small bowel in a ventral hernia.  The
patient was treated conservatively with an NGT and bowel rest.
On POD13 the patient was started on TPN due to prolonged NPO
status.  On POD15 the patient passed flatus and she was advanced
to clears.  The TPN was discontinued on POD16.  She was found to
have a swollen right arm on POD16 and an ultrasound revealed a
non-occlusive blood clot in her basilic vein where the PICC line
was present.  She will be treated with 3 months of lovenox for
this clot and follow-up with her PCP for management.  In
addition, the patient was having expiratory wheezes on POD16 and
we obtained a pulmonary consult.  They commented that the
patient was volume overloaded following TPN and she would
require gentle diuresis.  Following some diuresis the patients
breathing improved.  She will be discharged to rehab continuing
to be diuresed.  On the day of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet, her pain was well controlled and she
was having bowel movement regularly.  She will follow-up with
her PCP for management of the lovenox and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
