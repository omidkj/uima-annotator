cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
86yoF with COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia and DM who presented to OSH
with acute worseing of chronic DOE and band like abd pain. has
had these sxs for last 3 weeks. ECG with LBBB, hard to interpret
and CK 1700, MB 190, TnI 95. Likely completed infarct and COPD
flare with mild CHF. CXR here very concerning, interstitial
infiltartes (no effusions) and BNP only 500. Also RLL
infiltrate.
.
Stress test [**2134-2-17**] with 1.5 min. exercise, myoview demonstrated
a large transmural perfusion defect of significant severity c/w
with previous MI noted at the apex and extending well into the
mid and distal anterior wall and distal inferior wall. Small
area of ischemia reperfusion in the apical lateral wall.
Dyskinesia of the apex along with the hypokinesis of the other
walls also present, EF=29%.
.
On night PTA, Pt. developed acute onset bilateral epigastric
discomfort along with acute SOB, so severe that she could not
get out of bed. Went to [**Hospital3 **] where she was given
combivent, ceftriaxone and azithromycin then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. At OSH CKs elevated to 1737/CKMB = 197.79/CkMBI = 11.2,
Trop I = 95.4, BNP 533 (0.0-100). Patient given lopressor 5mg IV
x II, heparin gtt, integrillin per protocol- d/c'ed when cr

that she became CP free when the oxygen was placed.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: NSTEMI
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Preserved cardiac output.
3. IABP was placed via the right femoral artery.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD lesion
5. Successful stenting of the unprotected distal LMCA lesion.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated severe two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had a
long tubular 80-90% stenosis involving the origin of the LAD.
The LAD
also had a 70% mid segment stenosis at the takeoff of the D1.
The D1 was
a large bifurcating vessel with flow limiting disease. The LCx
had mild
diffuse plaquing. The OM1 and OM2 were large vessels with flow
limiting
disease. The RCA had an ostial 90% lesion that was calcified.
The was
also a proximal 70% stenosis. The rest of the RCA had mild
diffuse
disease. There was a large marginal branch and then small R-PDA
and
R-PL.
2. Resting hemodynmaics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated large changes in pressure from respiratory
variation. The
right and left filling pressures were moderately elevated (RVEDP
16mmHg,
LVEDP 25mmHg). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
hypertension
(45/26mmHg). The calculated cardiac output from the Fick method
was 4.1
L/min with a cardiac index of 2.45. There was no mitral stenosis
appreciated. There was no transaortic gradient upon catheter
pullback
from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta..
3. We successfully placed a 30cc intra aortic balloon pummp in
the
descending aorta with satisfactory diastolic pressure
augmentation.
4. the proximal LAD lesion was successfully predilated with a
2.5 X 15mm
maverick balloon and stented using a 2.5 X 23mm Cypher stent
with lesion
resolution from 70% to 0%.
5. The distal LMCA lesion of 80%-90% was predilated in to the
LAD using
2.5 X 15mm and 3.0 X 15mm Maverick balloons, LAD stented using
3.0 X
18mm Cypher stent and kissing balloon inflation of the distal
LMCA and
both ostia of the LAD and the CX with lesion reduction to 0% in
the LMCA
and the LAD but leaving a residual 30% lesion in the jailed and
rescued
CX ostium and 80% stenosis in the jailed but not rescued ramus
ostium.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissections or
embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
stress MIBI ([**2134-2-17**]): 1.5 mins on modified protocol- functional
class [**4-17**] test stopped [**3-18**] dysnea. O2 sat = hi 80s - 90s.
Uninterpretable ECG [**3-18**] LBBB. Results of nuclear imaging
pending.
Large transmural pefusion defect of significant severity, c/w
previous MI, noted at apex and extending well into mid and
distal anterior wall and distal inferior wall. Small area of
ischemia reperfusion in apical lateral wall. EF=29%.
.
Chest CT ([**2134-2-22**]): No lung mass identified in this study.
Findings consistent with CHF and interstitial pulmonary edema.
Severe centrilobular emphysema. Severe coronary artery
calcifications. Several small pulmonary nodules in the lower
lobes measuring 4-6mm. Follow up with CT of the chest in 3mo is
recommended.
.
Admission ECG: Rate = 113 bpm, LBBB- no old for comparison, ST
elevations in V2- V3, TWI/ST depresions in II, III, F, V5-V6.

Pt was cath'd [**2134-2-23**] with cypher stents to LM and LAD, jailing
- then rescuing of the LAD. See cath report below. IABP was
placed in preparation for CABG, however decision was made to
forego CABG in favor of re-cath, and IABP was d/c'
