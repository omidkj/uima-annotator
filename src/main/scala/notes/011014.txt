Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Clonidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT code with shock, CPR
Intubation
Right femoral CVL placement
Right axillary a line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77M with [**Hospital 10224**] medical problems including

systolic CHF, 3V CAD s/p multiple BMS, ESRD on HD, atrial

fibrillation on coumadin, CVA with residual R-sided deficits,

recent hospitalization with nausea, vomitting, diarrhea and

thrombosed AV fistula who presented to the ED with worsening
diarrhea and lethargy. He was admitted to the hospital for
similar symptoms twice in the past 2 weeks, recently discharged
on [**7-23**]. At home, he

had stool incontinence, which is chronic dating back to
radiation,

with worsening diarrhea up to 5 times per day of non-bloody,

non-mucuus brown liquid diarrhea. In the ED, he denied abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills. No CP, no SOB. He has
been feeling extremely weak at home for past day, his last HD
was yesterday with limited making of urine.

.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had hypotension without anything focal on
presentation. 76/34. He had a line in for HD and received fluids
for sepsis and hypotension with SBP rising to low 90s. A femoral
line was placed due to difficult access and preferred because of
unkown INR. Pressures stayed in the 80s. Baseline was 100-110
per ED. He was subsequently started on dopa. After the line was
placed, BP dropped to 65 and pt VT arrested (HR was 140s prior
to this). He was shocked once, developed pulseless electrical
activity and started on CPR. Epi x 2 and bicarb was given. Pt
was in PEA for 4-5 minutes and then had return of spontaneous
circulation. Pt was given succinylcholine and itnubated. Of
note, pt had vomited right before the arrest. He was given levo
and BP went to 90-100 and HR to 130. He got vanco, zosyn and
rectal zosyn for presumed sepsis. Post cardiac arrest team was
consulted regarding cooling protocol, but pt's mental status
returned when he came to CCU (could follow commands) so cooling
was not done.

Pt received a total of 4.5L IVF in ED and an additional 1L in
CCU.

Trop 0.6 which is nl for him but MB is up.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16149**] is 77 y/o M with a complicated PMH incl including
systolic CHF, 3V CAD s/p multiple BMS, ESRD on HD, a fib on
coumadin, CVA, recent hospitalizations with N/V/D and thrombosed
AV fistula who presented with lethargy, diarrhea, and
hypotension to ED. After femoral CVL was placed in the ED, he
had a VT then PEA arrest, with return of spontaneous circulation
with shock and CPR.  He was transferred to the CCU in the evenng
on [**7-25**] on levophed and dopamine for pressure support. He was
noted to be responsive to commands so cooling protocol was not
initiated. Family mtg with the pt's 2 sons and HCP (friend
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]) but the CCU resident revealed that they thought
the pt had been DNR. Unfortunately, this was never noted in his
past [**Hospital1 **] records and he was ordered for full code status on his
last admission. He was made DNR with no shocks or CPR in the
evening of [**7-25**].
.
Right axillary A line was placed by cardiac fellow and pt was
maintained on pressors levo/dopa/vasopressin overnight.  He was
treated for arrhythmia with amiodarone, sepsis with vanco/zosyn.

.
Pts HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] approached CCU resident at 8am stating he
had talked to the pt's sons and they had agreed to make the pt
[**Name (NI) 3225**]. The CCU team then rounded on the pt and attg Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and
fellow Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16157**] agreed that this was a reasonable decision as
the pt was being maintained on 3 pressors and the etiology of
his shock was still unclear. Pt's outpt cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and NEOB were notified. Pressors and mechanical ventilation were
weaned. Pt went asystolic on tele and was pronounced at 905am
after physical exam. Son and HCP refused autopsy. Medical
examiner was notified as this was a death w/i 24 hrs of
admission and waived the case. Causes of death were:
Cardiogenic/septic shock, ESRD on HD, CAD.
