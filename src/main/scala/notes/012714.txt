History of Present Illness:
76M who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis (CT
revealed necrotizing pancreatitis and multiple pancreatic
pseudocysts) approximately 6 weeks prior, treated conservatively
with NPO and IVF. He had been placed on TPN (+lipids) via a RUE
PICC line since last discharge due to poor PO intake. He
presented on [**2108-7-13**] with fevers and tachycardia and was sent
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

After his previous discharge, he reported no problems with his
PICC and specifically denied chills after TPN infusion. He felt
well until [**2108-7-10**], when he had an abdominal CT with contrast.
After the procedure, he developed
shaking chills which he thought were due to low blood sugar.
Chills resolved with juice. On [**2108-7-13**] patient again developed
shaking chills. He was seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 111777**] office, where he was
noted to be diaphoretic, tachycardic to 138, and febrile to
102.3.

ROS was significant for morning cough productive of scant white
sputum x 1 month, rhinorrhea x 3 days, intermittent low back
pain, and increased urinary frequency in the setting of TPN
feeds. Two loose BM's were documented on [**2108-7-14**] but patient
reported they were soft only and denied diarrhea.

Physical Exam:
On discharge:
Vitals - T 98.1  86  122/60  20  99% on FiO2 35%
Gen - NAD, resting in bed, responsive
CV - RRR, S1S2
Resp - wet sounding cough productive of thick secretions, harsh
breath sounds throughout
Abd - Soft, non-distended, non-tender, no massess; transverse
incision dressed with wound VAC. JP drain on left side,
abdominal drain (more midline) draining to ostomy bag
Ext - WWP, non-edematous

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**7-13**]): The lungs are grossly clear with no focal opacities
concerning for
an infectious process.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are
unremarkable.  No appreciable pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
and no gross
bony deformities. IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Urine Culture ([**7-13**]): <10k organisms.
Urinalysis ([**7-13**]): Negative for
nitrite/glu/ketones/bili/urobil/leuks, Small blood, RBC 4, WBC
2, Few bacteria, <1 epith, pH 5.5

Blood Cultures ([**7-13**]): No growth

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**7-17**]):
1.  Interval progression of pancreatic pseudocyst which now
extends to the
hepatic capsule and exerts mass effect on the duodenum.  No
significant change in pancreatic necrosis with only a small
remnant in the head, uncinate process and tail.
2.  Small left and trace right pleural effusions are new from
comparison.
3.  Interval increase in ascitic fluid along the bilateral
paracolic gutters, left greater than right.
4.  Stable non-obstructing left inguinal hernia containing
colon.

BAL ([**7-19**]): ESCHERICHIA COLI.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML

Abscess Culture ([**7-19**]): CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX

Placement of Dobhoff Tube ([**7-20**]):  Successful placement
[**Location (un) 2174**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**] feeding tube into the second portion of the
duodenum. Tube is ready to use.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**7-23**]):
1.  Interval increase in the amount of ascites and the bilateral
pleural
effusions as well as the consolidation/atelectasis at the lung
bases.
2.  The NG tube is coiled within the stomach multiple times.
3.  There is infected walled off pancreatic necrosis. Although
decreasing in size, the collection is amenable to re-drainage.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 111808**] discussed this finding with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the
time of reporting at 4:25 pm and it was agreed upon that
drainage insertion would be performed on [**2108-7-24**].

CTAP ([**7-27**]):
1.  Subtle peribronchial ground-glass opacities seen in the
right lung,
predominantly in the right upper lobe, concerning for an
infectious process.
An additional nodular opacity in the right upper lobe likely
represent
additional site of infection. Recommend follow-up after
treatment.

2.  Moderate bilateral simple pleural effusions and compressive
atelectasis of
both lower lobes, stable since [**2108-7-23**].

3.  Acute necrotizing pancreatitis, with slight decrease in the
size of the
walled-off pancreatic necrosis after placement of drainage
catheter. Stable
pseudocyst in the uncinate process of the pancreas.

4.  Moderate amount of abdominal ascites, slightly larger since
the prior
study of [**2108-7-23**].  Moderate anasarca.

5. Severe gastroesophageal reflux.

6. Attnuated but patent splenic vein.

CTAP [**7-30**]
1.  Surgical intervention with almost complete resolution of
lesser sac fluid
collection, three drains within the peripancreatic/lesser sac
region.
Residual small lenticular collection in the left colic gutter.

2.  No change in amount of pelvic ascites, decrease in the
amount of
perihepatic ascites.

3.  Status post cholecystectomy.

4.  Study is otherwise unchanged which includes a right IJ line
with tip
abutting the brachiocephalic vein at the brachiocephalic/SVC
junction.

CTAP [**8-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right upper lobe nodular density now with slight central
lucency, possibly
indicating evolution of infectious nodule.
2.  Postsurgical change of pancreas with stable small uncinate
process
collection and no new collections identified allowing for
limitations of
noncontrast study.
3.  Otherwise, no change detected compared to four days prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment of his hypotension, tachycardia, and
fever on [**2108-7-13**].

Upon admission, a full set of laboratory tests including CBC,
BMP, blood and urine cultures, lactate, arterial blood gas, and
LFTs were sent. A chest x-ray was also obtained. Results of
these studies may be found in the 'Pertinent Results' section
above. The patient was started empirically on IV antibiotics
(vancomycin and zosyn). He was given a clear liquid diet, and
provided IV fluid rehydration as well. His PICC line was not
used, while evaluation for a source of bactermia was in
progress.

On Hospital Day #1 ([**7-14**]), he no longer had any fevers. He
tolerated a regular diet, and was having bowel movements. He was
continued on vancomycin and zosyn. He ambulated regularly. He
was urinating normally. He was not given TPN, and his PICC line
was used only for the administration of antibiotics. He was
given tylenol and ibuprofen for his back pain.

On Hospital Day #2 ([**7-15**]), he continued to be afebrile, and
tolerating diet. He continued to ambulate and have bowel
movements. He was continued on vancomycin and zosyn. TPN
continued to be held.

On Hospital Day #3 ([**7-16**]), the Medical and Infectious Disease
Teams were consulted. Due to SBP 110s and HR 60s-70s, his beta
blockers were discontinued. He continued to be aggressively
hydrated with IV fluids, and given vancomycin and zosyn. TPN
continued to be held. On this day, he was returned to a clear
liquid diet, which he tolerated well.

On Hospital Day #4 ([**7-17**]), a LUQ ultrasound was performed, which
revealed a small increase in size of pseudocyst, and new
intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with no
choledocholithiasis, as well as known cholelithiasis. On this
day, TPN was restarted. Further evaluation led to the
determination th
