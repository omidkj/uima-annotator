Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/Fatigue/DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-7-27**] - Redosternotomy, CABGx3(Saphenous vein graft
(SVG)->Diagonal artery, SVG->Ramus artery, SVG->Posterior left
ventricular artery), MVR(33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] 33mm Porcine Valve)
[**7-29**] - Reexploration for bleeding
[**8-1**] - Permenant pacemaker placement.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting for critical symptomatic congestive heart
failure symptoms back
in [**2124-1-15**] up in [**Location (un) 5450**], [**Location (un) 3844**].  The patient
re-presented with a bout of congestive heart failure and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 78250**] worked the patient up, which showed that all of his vein
grafts were occluded.  His mammary artery was
patent to the LAD and there was severe native vessel progression
as well.  This degree of mitral regurgitation had significantly
increased as well between [**Month (only) 1096**] and this point.  The patient
was therefore referred for redo coronary
artery bypass grafting as well as mitral valve repair or
replacement.

Physical Exam:
74  112/62  67"  188lbs
GEN: WDWN in NAD
SKIN: Warm, dry, no clubbing or cyanosis.
HEENT: PERRL, Anicteric sclera, OP Benign
NECK: Supple, no JVD, FROM. (B) CEA incisions.
LUNGS: CTA bilaterally
HEART: RRR, No R/G, I/VI systolic late blowing murmur, well
healed sternotomy
ABD: Soft, ND/NT/NABS. well healed right nephrectomy incision.
EXT:warm, well perfused, no bruits, no varicosities, L GSV
harvested Right appears suitable. Mild peripheral edema
NEURO: No focal deficits. Uses cane for walking d/t left hip
arthritis.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-7-27**] - ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated and elongated.
Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the
suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be
confirmed on the basis of this study. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with an inferior basal aneurysm with akinesis of the
basal inferior and inferior-septal walls. There is also severe
hypokineis of the entire lateral and remaing portions of the
inferior and septal walls, and mild hypokinesis of the anterior
and anteroseptal walls. LVEF 20%, but given severity of MR, this
is likely an overestimation of actual LV function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm (0.8 cm).
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass: No change in Biventricular function. There is a
bioprosthetic mitral valve in place, no paravalvular leaks.
Aortic contours intact. Remaing exam is unchanged. All finidngs
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

PROCEDURE: Chest PA and lateral on [**2124-8-7**].

COMPARISON: [**2124-8-3**].

HISTORY: 68-year-old man with status post MVR and CABG, rule out
effusion.

FINDINGS: The loculated right hemithorax effusion including the
fissures have
remained stable. The small present left pleural effusion has
decreased in
size on today's examination. Persistent cardiomegaly is
moderate. The left
subclavian dual-lead pacemaker is unchanged in location. Left
retrocardiac
atelectasis is more pronounced on today's examination. The
pulmonary
vasculature is slightly prominent but no definite edema is seen.


IMPRESSION:
1. Loculated right small to moderate pleural effusion, stable.
2. Improvement of the small left pleural effusion.
3. Moderate cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-7-27**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery and vein graft disease. He was
taken directly to the operating room where he underwent a
redosternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting to three
vessels and a mitral valve replacement using a 33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
porcine valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was transferred to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. He initially required inotropes and packed
red blood cells for pressure support and anemia. Complete heart
block was noted under his temporary pacemaker and the EP service
was consulted. A pacemaker was likely needed. He was
successfully extubated on postoperative day one. On
postoperative day two, he developed high output from his chest
tubes and was reintubated. He was taken to the operating room
where he was re-explored for bleeding and hemostasis was
acheived of a bleeding branch of a vein graft. He was then
returned to the intensive care unit for monitoring. The next
morning he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He
remained pacer dependent. Plavix, aspirin and a statin were
resumed. As it was unlikely his conduction system would recover,
the electrophysiology service placed a permenant pacemaker on
[**2124-8-1**] without complication. The hematology service was
consulted for thrombocytopenia. Although his HIT assay was
negative, it was recommended to treat as if he was HIT positive.
Thus, all heparin products were avoided and a serotonin release
HIT assay was sent and if positive, it is recommended he be
treated with argatroban and coumadin. His platelets recovered.
On [**2124-8-2**], he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.Plavix
was resumed. He required agressive diuresis and remained in the
hospital for diuresis.  Repeat HIT antibody was negative. SRA is
still pending. His pacemaker was interrogated on [**8-8**], adn wsa
found to be functioning correctly. He was noted to have 3 5
minute episodes of atrial fibrillation, he was switched to a
full aspirin.  He will follow up with the device clinic in 6
weeks. He was ready for discharge home on POD #12.
