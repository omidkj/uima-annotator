Chief Complaint:
fever, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76M w/ Hx of bladder ca s/p cystoprostatectomy,
bilateral lymph node dissection and urinary ileal conduit on
[**2188-8-5**] who presents from rehab (he was d/c'd from the [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2188-8-13**]) with c/o abdominal pain and fever. At the rehab center,
he reportedly had a temperature to 100.5, poor po intake
requiring PPN, and abdominal distension prompting NGT and rectal
tube placement. Per the patient's family, the NGT emptied
bilious fluid intially but the output appeared coffee-ground and
melanotic this morning. (Of note, the NGT had a single suction
port and no air port which may have caused some trauma). His
wife notes that the patient was having some small bowel
movements daily but no substantial output. Her greatest concern
was his ongoing abdominal discomfort which had been present at
the time of discharge and attributed to a slight ileus. He did
not have any vomiting or unusual diarrhea. He was on keflex at
discharge for slight wound erythema but that had improved - no
purulent drainage was reported. Of note, he does have an
extensive history of UTIs, urosepsis and pyelonephritis.
The patient could not be fully interviewed as he was wearing a
nonrebreather O2 mask and eventually became intubated.

IMAGING:
CT C/A/P (prelim report): 11cm fluid collection in the lower
pelvis. Bil. ureteral stents and cysts. Lung nodules due to
metastasis. note that lung nodules are new and dedicated chest
imaging is recommended after stabilization of the acute issue.
CT head (prelim): Generalized brain atrophy, without acute
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU for possible urosepsis.  He
required intubation and admission due to respiratory distress.
He did improve clinically in the ICU and was able to extubate
successfully.  He was doing ok on [**8-18**] other than some
tachycardia.  However, in the afternoon around noon his
tachycardia began to worsen to the 160s-180s.  He became
agitated and dyspneic complaining of belly pain but no chest
pain.  His blood pressure began to drop at this point with a
systolic of 70.  Eventually the patient required intubation.
During intubation the patients pulse was lost and his BP dropped
to less than 50.  CPR was initiated and a code was called.  In
the ensuing hours the patient regained vital signs on and off
requiring CPR, multiple pressors to maintain his blood pressure,
and even a few shocks from the defibrillator.  He never regained
consciousness throughout the code.  An echo was done during this
time which showed hardly any ventricular filling on either side
of the heart.  His Hct also appeared to be dropping.  It was
unclear if the patient was hypovolemic from some type of
possible intraabdominal bleeding as his belly became more and
more distended.  There was also the possibility that he had an
MI or PE.  Unfortunately, the clinical picture was not clear and
it was poorly understood what manifested this event.  Eventually
the patients family arrived and they requested to stop any
additional heroic efforts.  At that point he had a blood
pressure and pulse and was not requiring CPR.  However, his MAP
continued to fall over the next hour or so.  At 1759 the patient
was pronounced dead.  The family did not want an autopsy and the
medical examiner did not require one either.  The attending and
chief residents were aware of the situation the entire time.  I,
the intern, was present for most of the code and assisted as
much as possible and relayed information to the attending and
chief as much as possible.
