Imaging:
CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
3. Sinusitis changes.
4. Displaced left nasal bone fracture.
5. Periorbital swelling and hematoma anterior to the left
zygoma. Orbital
globes are intact.

CT Cspine
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes.
3. Small left pleural effusion.

CT sinus
IMPRESSION:
1. Displaced left nasal bone fracture.
2. Opacification of the sinuses. The left OMU is occluded.
3. Left periorbital swelling and hematoma.

Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-6-28**],
the severity of aortic regurgitation has increased. The severity
of pulmonary hypertension has increased. The rhythm now appears
to be atrial fibrillation with beat-to-beat variation in left
ventricular ejection fraction.

Carotic US
IMPRESSION: Limited left-sided study but less than 40% carotid
stenosis.
Right side was not evaluated as described above.

CXR
Impression: Stable appearances with slight improvement in
pulmonary edema
which is mild. Persistent moderate-to-large left pleural
effusion and smaller right pleural effusion.

KUB
There is less fecal material in the colon. The bowel loops of
the colon and gas-filled small bowel loops in the abdomen are
not distended. Maximum
diameter of the colon is 4.1 cm.
Degenerative changes of bilateral hip joints, vertebroplasty at
several of the lumbar vertebral bodies are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo female with dementia who fell and sustained nasal fracture
and bilateral humeral fractures, s/p intramedullary rodding of
right proximal humerus fracture, open repair of right rotator
cuff, and intramedullary rodding of left proximal humerus
fracture.  She was transferred to the TSICU for Afib with RVR
and subsequently transferred to MICU for volume overload.
.
# Bilateral UE humeral fractures:  She underwent intramedullary
rodding of right proximal humerus fracture, open repair of right
rotator cuff, and intramedullary rodding of left proximal
humerus fracture.  As per orthopedics, her activity level should
be weight bearing in upper extremities as tolerated.
.
# Afib/Aflutter:  This was likely worsened by diuresis, systemic
infection and increased adrenergic tone.  She required a
diltizem drip and was successfully transitioned to diltiazem
extended release 360mg daily after her other acute issues had
resolved. Her heart rate has been maintained in the 80's. She
was anticoagulated with ASA alone given fall risk.
.
# Pulm edema/Chronic left pleural effusion:  Patient was
diuresed with IV Lasix as needed. Her goal urine output should
be 1L daily. She is on lasix 20mg IV BID, and she should receive
PRN IV lasix to achieve her goal urine output as her BP
tolerates.
.
# ?UTI:  Infectious diseases service felt that her urine
cultures were consistent with contamination, as she has had ESBL
UTI's in the past. She received a three day course of meropenem,
until it was stopped for this reason. She is continued on
premarin cream for prevention of UTI.
.
# C. diff: Patient developed leukocytosis and abdominal pain, as
well as diarrhea. She was found to have C.difficile and was
started on flagyl in the ICU on [**2191-11-25**]. Because her white
blood cell count continued to increase, she was also started on
PO vancomycin on [**2191-11-27**]. If the patient's abdominal exam shows
evidence of rebound/guarding or stool output stops quickly and
in the setting of continued abdominal tenderness, KUB to assess
for toxic megacolon should be performed. KUB on [**2191-11-26**] showed
no evidence of toxic megacolon.
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Patient
with acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation upon transfer
to the ICU. She was placed on lasix 20mg IV BID, as well as PRN
lasix IV to achieve goal UOP of 1L per day.  Because of variable
BP's with Afib on RVR, beta blocker was held. If blood pressure
will tolerate, and HR remains stable in the 60's to 80's, low
dose coreg should be started. Patient also would require that
ACEi started, given CHF. KCl was held during hospitalization as
daily labs were being drawn. If labs are not obtained frequently
at rehab, she will require resumption of home dose 20meq KCl
daily.
.
# Nasal fracture:  Patient was seen by plastics who recommended
dressing changes an
