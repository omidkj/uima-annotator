Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o female who presents from OSH with evidence of portal vein
thrombus on ultrasound. An ultrasound was performed on admission
to [**Hospital1 18**] showing thombosed left portal vein. Main portal and
right portal veins are patent. there is a normal gallbladder
with no gallstones. The liver is diffusely echogenic compatible
with fatty infiltrate. A CTA was then obtained to further
delineate the extent of thrombus, which showed the left portal
and anterior right portal vein thrombosis. Small thrombus
extends into the main portal vein. The posterior right portal
vein remains patent. The SMV and the splenic veins are patent.
No discrete pancreatic
mass. There is also a 6 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule
which would be concerning due to patients 50 pack year history
of smoking.
The patient was immediately started on a heparin drip and was
given 2 days of Unasyn due to concerns for cholangitis. Blood
and urine cultures taken on admission have been finalized with
no growth. In the meantime coverage was broadened to Vanco and
Levaquin. An echo was performed showing no evidence of
vegetations and an EF > 65%.
She was noted to have worsening abdominal pain, and on [**1-16**], a
repeat abdominal CT was obtained showing progression of the
previously noted portal vein thrombosis, which now involved the
posterior right portal vein. There was marked delayed periportal
enhancement without biliary dilatation, with findings concerning
for septic thrombophlebitis. Perforation of sigmoid colon by an
intraluminal foreign body is suggested as etiology by the
imaging findings; as there is no provided
history of any hepatobiliary stenting, there is the possibility
of an ingested foreign body.
On [**2101-1-17**] the patient underwent attempted thrombolysis. Portal
venogram demonstrating completely occluded left portal vein.
Partial filling defect noted in a branch of the right portal
vein suggestive
of partial thrombus. She had successful placement of a TPA
(Alteplase) infusion catheter via the left portal venous branch
for overnight thrombolytic infusion and was transferred to the
SICU overnight for monitoring. On [**1-18**] a pre-procedure venogram
showed no decrease in the clot. She then had a Post-AngioJet
clot lysis venogram demonstrating total clot lysis in the
branches of the right portal vein. Residual clot is still noted
in the left portal vein. The left portal vein appears small in
caliber, with little forward flow. The heparin drip was
restarted and she was able to be transferred back to the regular
surgical floor.
The thrombus remnant was sent for culture, there was no growth
obtained from this specimen.
On [**1-19**] the antibiotic coverage was changed, the levaquin was
d/c'd and Zosyn was started.
Her respiratory status was worsening, she had developed
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, and chest xrays indicated
concern for new bilateral opacities, likely pneumonia with para
pneumonic effusions, right greater than left. Lasix was started.
Over the next few days her respiratory status improved and on
[**1-25**] a chest xray was obtained showing there is some decrease
in the still present bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive atelectasis at the bases. The pulmonary vascularity
has returned to an almost normal state.
Another CT of the abdomen was done on [**1-25**] showing increased
perihepatic and perisplenic ascites. Since [**2101-1-16**], there has
been interval removal/resolution of thrombi at the distal main
portal vein and the proximal right posterior branch, the right
posterior portal vein is now widely patent and the left portal
vein and anterior branches of the right portal vein are not
opacified with IV contrast and likely thrombosed. This is
unchanged since [**2101-1-16**].
As the patient was having persistently elevated WBC, with all
negative blood and urine cultures as well as the thrombus, the
central line was removed, and she was also switched to PO
Augmentin which should continue for an additional two weeks. The
WBC came down to 14.8 and she remained afebrile.
