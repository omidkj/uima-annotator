REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *7.0 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 5.9 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.16 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus
in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter
the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity.
Moderately depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Thickened AVR
leaflets. No AS. Severe (4+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed
toward the anterior
mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
MVP. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The TEE probe
was passed
with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope. No TEE
related complications.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX %). There is moderate
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present.
The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation
jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild mitral
valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2194-9-13**] 8:49 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: check hydroptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man s/p right thoracotomy/redo .
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
check hydroptx
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

INDICATION: Right hydropneumothorax.

PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2194-9-13**] and
compared with the most recent study performed on [**2194-9-10**]. There
has been a decrease in the size of the loculated effusion on the
right side, both in the retrosternal area and in the major
fissure. The pneumothorax has decreased in size with only a tiny
apical amount remaining. Air-fluid level seen in the
retrosternal area consistent with small loculated
hydropneumothorax has resolved. Small amount of fluid is seen at
the right costophrenic angle and a small left pleural effusion
is also present. The patient is status post recent cardiac
surgery with multiple skin staples present.

IMPRESSION:

Decrease in right-sided loculated hydropneumothorax. Persistent
small left pleural effusion.
