HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38403**] is a 32-year-old
male with dilated cardiomyopathy (viral versus idiopathic)
and ventricular arrhythmia who was admitted to the hospital
because of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing;
then subsequently transferred to Coronary Care Unit for
congestive heart failure.

Mr. [**Known lastname 38404**] dilated cardiomyopathy was first diagnosed
in [**2132**]/[**2132**] when he developed upper respiratory infection
with persistent symptoms resulting in persistent dyspnea and
fluid retention.  A workup of these symptoms led to the
diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy.  Since that time he has
done well with medical therapy.  He denied paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea but does report dyspnea on
exertion with one flight of stairs.

In [**2136-1-10**], he had a syncopal episode and was found
to be in ventricular tachycardia and had an automatic
internal cardioverter-defibrillator placed.  He had been
stable status post his automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator placement until this month when he
was admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on [**3-21**] after his
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fired several times
over the course of several days.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**3-23**] for an electrophysiology study which showed multiple
fossae of ventricular tachycardia which were not able to be
mapped and ablated because he tolerated this study poorly and
required cardioversion.  He did have one right bundle branch
pathway ablated.  After his electrophysiology study he was
transferred to the CMI Service, but had an episode of more
than 30 beats of ventricular tachycardia with subsequent
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing; override
pacing failed.

He was transferred to the C-MED Service and over the next
several days received sotalol, amiodarone, and a lidocaine
drip with good results.  His lidocaine was subsequently
discontinued and replaced with mexiletine with poor results.
Therefore, his sotalol, amiodarone, and mexiletine were
discontinued, and the patient was started just on quinidine
with good results.  He was also started on Coumadin for a
poor ejection fraction.

A cardiac transplant evaluation was begun on [**3-31**].  As
part of this, a right heart catheterization was performed on
[**4-2**] with the following numbers:  A right atrial pressure
mean of 23, right ventricle of 49/23, pulmonary artery 49/33,
wedge of 33, cardiac output of 3.2, cardiac index of 1.3,
pulmonary vascular resistance of 200, less than 3 Wood units,
systemic vascular resistance of 1625, superior vena cava
saturation of 54, pulmonary artery saturation of 50.  An
echocardiogram on the same day showed an ejection fraction of
less than 15%, moderate dilation of the left atrium,
biventricular dilation, and severe biventricular hypokinesis.

Because of the results of his right heart catheterization, he
was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for Swan-[**Location (un) **]
therapy.  A right femoral Swan-Ganz catheter was placed under
fluoroscopic guidance in the Coronary Care Unit on [**4-3**]
with pressures similar to the results from the [**4-2**] right
heart cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2132**] to [**2133**];
class II heart failure (details as above in History of
Present Illness).
2.  Automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placement
in [**2136-1-10**].
3.  History of frequency ventricular tachycardia, sustained.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Anxiety.
6.  Sleep apnea, unable to tolerate CPAP at home due to
claustrophobia.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from C-MED
were aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
(held for Swan-Ganz catheter placement), Coreg 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Zestril 30 mg p.o. q.d., quinidine gluconate 324 mg
p.o. q.8h., Lasix 80 mg intravenously b.i.d., K-Dur 20 mEq
p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o. q.d., Celexa 10 mg p.o.
q.d. times three days then 20 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan p.o.
p.r.n., and Serax p.o. p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with [**Name2 (NI) 17472**].  Father
with cardiomyopathy and heart transplant; passed away in [**2133**]
from pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Engaged.  He lives with his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
cashier at a gas station.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   No fevers, chills, cough, abdominal or
urinary complaints.  Has significant anxiety about recent
event.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 96,
heart rate of 85, blood pressure of 110/60, respiratory rate
of 16, 97% on room air.  In general, a well-developed,
well-nourished, appeared somewhat anxious, in no acute
distress.  Neck revealed jugular venous pulse 9 mc.  No
lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or masses.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur maximal at the
sternal border, as third heart sound is present.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly, and no masses, normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally to
the midshin, cool foot, barely palpable distal pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count of 7.8, hematocrit of 43.6,
platelets of 155.  Sodium of 143, potassium of 4.1, chloride
of 101, bicarbonate of 30, blood urea nitrogen of 16,
creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 65.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for Swan-[**Location (un) **] therapy, as detailed above.

He was continued on his regimen of Coreg, Zestril, and Lasix
which he had been getting on the floor.  A milrinone drip was
started with subsequent increase in cardiac output and a
decrease in his pulmonary artery and wedge pressures.
However, the patient experienced frequent supraventricular
tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia on the milrinone, and
on one occasion had an episode of ventricular tachycardia
resulting in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing as
well as loss of consciousness (transiently).  Therefore, the
milrinone was discontinued, and the strategy of therapy was
changed to maximizing the diuresis and afterload reduction.

Anticoagulation for a poor ejection fraction which had been
started on the floor had been held for the Swan-Ganz catheter
placement but was restarted with a heparin drip and Coumadin
in the unit.

2.  ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient with frequent episodes of
ventricular tachycardia, status post multiple antiarrhythmic
regimens on the floor; finally controlled well quinidine.
However, after milrinone was initiated, the patient had
recurrent supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular
tachycardia necessitating the cessation of milrinone drip (as
detailed above).  He was continued on quinidine
gluconate 324 mg q.8h. and had his pacemaker reprogrammed by
the Electrophysiology team.

3.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient with significant and
understandable anxiety over recent events.  A Psychiatry
consultation was obtained who recommended adding Ativan as
well as continuation of Celexa.

4.  CARDIAC TRANSPLANT EVALUATION:  The patient had
serologies and 24-hour urine collection, appropriate
radiologic studies, and cardiac catheterization performed
during this hospitalization in an anticipation of cardiac
transplant.

In the meantime, biventricular pacing and left ventricular
assist device were being considered as bridges to transplant.

NOTE:  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, as
well as discharge medications, and plans for discharge,
followup, and transplant evaluation will be dictated in a
Discharge Summary Addendum.
