All urine and blood cultures were negative throughout hospital
course.

C-Diff was negative X 3

CTA (Admit): Extensive, severe acute pancreatitis, with internal
pancreatic hypoattenuation that may represent edema versus
necrosis

CTA ([**5-3**]): Continued pancreatitis without evidence of clearing,
there is now an ileus seen on CT

CTA ([**5-13**]): Interval increase in peripancreatic inflammatory
changes, multiloculated fluid collection extending into the left
pericolic gutter and along the descending colon. SBO seen on CT.

CTA ([**5-29**]): 1. Interval increase in peripancreatic inflammatory
changes and interval unification of some of the multiloculated
fluid collection in the left pericolic gutter and in the lesser
sac. New areas of fluid collection are noted in the anterior
abdominal wall. Percutaneous drainage is not feasible given the
multiple internal septations.

2. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis or venous thrombosis or
pseudoaneurysm.






Brief Hospital Course:
After presenting to the ED, the patient was directly admitted to
the SICU for monitoring.  During his short stay in the SICU, his
BPs were stable in the 120-150's, HRs were in the 80-90's (NSR),
and his sats were in the high 90's on 2 L NC.  He did not
require intubation nor did he require pressors in the SICU.
After being transferred to the floor, the patient did well.  He
was tolerating clears well, did not c/o N/V, and his WBC trended
downwards.  His pain was well controlled at first by a PCA then
transitioned to PO pain meds.  He did not c/o significant
pain/breakthrough pain.

Psychiatry was consulted given his h/o schizophrenia.  ID was
consulted given his h/o HIV.  Given these recommendations, the
patient was started on his PO anti-psychotic /depression
medications but did not start on his HIV regimen in fear of
resistance (PO status may change at any minute).

Halfway through his hospital course, the patient suddenly became
distended and had episodes of emesis.  He was made NPO and a NGT
was inserted.  He stopped passing flatus and required daily
suppositories.  Despite being NPO with a NGT, the patient
remained distended.  In addition he began to c/o more pain,
located in the epigastric region. He began to spike fevers.  His
WBC started to rise.  He was continued on IV Abx for empiric
treatment and cultures from his urine and blood were obtained.
Repeat CTAs were performed, showing evidence of non-resolving
and worsening pancreatitis.  In addition, the CTA suggested
ileus.

In light of his nutritional status, a PICC was placed and TPN
was started.  He remained NPO.  Despite numerous attempts in
D/Cing the NGT, the patient became more nauseated and distended.
 After failing conservative management for approximately a week,
a repeat CTA was obtained which showed pancreatitis and a SBO.
The patient was then taken to the OR and explored on [**5-21**].  LOA
was performed.

Post-operatively the patient did well.  He became less distended
and could tolerate not having a NGT.  He was passing flatus had
numerous BM.  C-diffs were negative X 3.  His abdomen became
much less distended and softer.  His diet was advanced.

On the day of discharge, he was cleared by psychiatry and ID.
He was to restart all his home medications. He was afebrile X 24
hours with a normal WBC.  He was tolerating a diet and had less
frequent BM.  His abdomen was slightly distended but soft.  His
Amylase and Lipase levels are WNL.
