Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]                    Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 18500**]

Admission Date:  [**2196-7-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-7-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2124-6-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 72 year old
woman who was admitted for planned cardiac catheterization
with intervention on her left circumflex.  The patient had an
aborted intervention on [**2196-6-23**], due to subintimal wire
entry of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal
graft as well as a groin hematoma with hypotension.  The
patient had two episodes of chest pain prior to admission to
the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital back in [**Month (only) **] with negative enzymes.  A
Persantine MIBI at the outside hospital showed a reversible
defect in the lateral wall with mild septal hypokinesis and
the patient was transferred to Catheterization at [**Hospital1 346**] where she was found to have a left
main 60% stenosis, left circumflex 80%, diagonal 2 80%,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 with a patent left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and
saphenous vein graft to patent ductus arteriosus 20 to 30%.

On the day of admission, on [**2196-7-19**], the patient was taken
to the Catheterization Laboratory directly and while on the
table, she had a vasovagal episode after the intervention
whereby her heart rte fell into the 40s and her systolic
blood pressure was unable to be found due to the large size
of her arms and she was given 1.5 mg of Atropine with good
response.  The systolic blood pressure rose back to 118 with
a pulse of 78.  An echocardiogram was ordered to rule out
tamponade and this was negative.

During the catheterization, the LMCA had an occlusion of 80%,
left anterior descending totally occluded, left circumflex a
non-dominant vessel with a mid segment 80% and obtuse
marginal 2 of 90% lesion.  At the TV of the previous
saphenous vein graft, the left main was stented with zero
residual and normal flow and subsequently the mid segment of
the left circumflex and the obtuse marginal 2 was stented.

The vasovagal episode spoken of previously actually happened
during the sheath pull.

The patient remained on the floor without chest pain or
shortness of breath and developed a drop in hematocrit.  The
hematocrit was 35 on admission, 29 after catheterization and
24.7 on the morning after catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2184**]; grafts of left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending; saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal 1; saphenous vein graft to patent ductus arteriosus.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Small cell lung cancer status post chemotherapy and
radiation therapy.
7.  Dementia:  Difficulty with short term memory.
8.  History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
9.  Hypothyroidism.
10. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
11. History of colon cancer.
12. Parkinson's.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Glyburide 5 mg q. day.
2.  Lasix 40 mg q. day.
3.  K-Dur 20 mEq q. day.
4.  Amiodarone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Cogentin 1 mg q. day.
6.  Synthroid 0.125 mg twice a day.
7.  Prednisone 7.5 mg q. day.
8.  Reglan 10 mg three times a day.
9.  Naprosyn 500 mg twice a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.8 F.; blood pressure
125/60; heart rate 92 and respiratory rate 18.  The patient
was in no acute distress, appears to be in mild discomfort on
admission.  The lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly
bilaterally.  Heart regular rate and rhythm with a positive
systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
Guaiac examination on admission revealed no stool in the
vault.  Guaiac positive when the patient finally had a bowel
movement.  Extremities:  Obese; minimal edema bilaterally
lower extremities.  No hematoma, bruit or bleeding at the
groin site.

LABORATORY:  Labs on [**2196-7-24**], were as follows:  White
blood cell count 5.2, hemoglobin 10.9, hematocrit 31.8,
platelet count 127.  Sodium 142, potassium 3.4, chloride 110,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 24, creatinine 0.8, glucose 75, magnesium
1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:    The patient had this falling hematocrit
post catheterization and the hematocrit was followed and the
patient received three units of blood on the floor.  She had
a CT scan of her abdomen, pelvis and lower thighs which
showed no retroperitoneal bleeds and was negative for any
acute bleeds.  An ultrasound of the groin revealed no
hematoma and no bleeds and an ultrasound was negative for
tamponade.

Thereafter, GI was consulted for a possible gastrointestinal
bleed.  GI believed that the patient should be transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for stabilization and evaluation of a
possible bleed.

In the Coronary Care Unit, the patient required two more
units of packed red blood cells.  The first
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed red blood at the GE
junction.  There was retained solid food in the stomach, not
allowing visualization of the duodenum.  The next
esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed small sized hiatal hernia
as well as evidence of gastritis and three non-bleeding
ulcers in the stomach body along the greater curve of the GE
junction.

The patient was injected during the examination with
epinephrine.  GI recommended that the patient be placed on
high dose proton pump inhibitors twice a day and to avoid
NSAIDS as well as aspirin.  The patient was continued on her
Plavix and aspirin secondary to the left main stent which was
placed during the catheterization.

After one day in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was
transferred back to the floor, stabilized, with no further
blood loss and without chest pain or shortness of breath and
without fevers, chills or abdominal pain.

The patient was advanced to a p.o. diet after a day and a
half of the n.p.o. with intravenous maintenance fluids and
tolerated it nicely but has not yet had another bowel
movement.  When she has another bowel movement, the plan is
to check for continued blood.

The patient was placed on stress dose steroids in the
Coronary Care Unit.  The plan is a rapid taper of this
Prednisone as the patient is doing well at this point.

The events to discharge will be added in an Addendum per the
next intern.
