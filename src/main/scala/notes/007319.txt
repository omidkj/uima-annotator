History of Present Illness:
85F s/p L AK [**Doctor Last Name **]-DP artery bypass left basilic vein in [**2114**] who
presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] on [**11-26**] with
worsening pain and redness in left 1st toe. Symptoms initially
began 1 month ago and have been slowly progressing w/ purulent
drainage. She was admitted to [**Location (un) **] and started on ceftriaxone
and azithromycin. Symptoms continued to persist and she
underwent NIAS which were reportedly poor. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. She reports pain in toe only improves
after dangling legs off of the bed. She denies any recent fevers
or chills.

[**2123-12-10**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 106 bpm, left axis deviation,
poor R-wave progression, left ventricular hypertrophy. Lateral,
anterolateral, and inferior ST depressions which are not seen on
most recent EKG.
.
IMAGING:
[**2123-12-1**] Non-invasive arterial rest studies of lower exremity:
Doppler waveform analysis reveals triphasic waveforms at the
common femoral arteries bilaterally. On the right, there is a
triphasic popliteal waveform and monophasic DP and PT waveforms.
On the left, there are monophasic popliteal, DP, and PT
waveforms. ABIs are 0.69 on the right and 0.63 on the left.
Pulse volume recordings show essentially normal waveforms in the
thighs bilaterally. There is absence of calf augmentation
bilaterally. There is further dampening at the metatarsal level
on the left. Significant left SFA and bilateral tibial arterial
disease.
.
[**2123-12-2**] Left lower extremity angiogram:
1. Normal-appearing left common femoral artery and profunda
    femoris artery. Mild to moderate calcification along the
    mid and proximal portion of the left superficial femoral
    artery.
2. Patent distal portion of left superficial femoral artery
    and above-knee popliteal artery.
3. Patent proximal anastomosis of the above-knee popliteal
    artery to dorsalis pedis bypass graft.
4. Patent distal anastomosis and proximal region of
    anterior tibial artery with immediate occlusion just at
    the or just beyond the distal anastomosis. Vessels were
    observed to reconstitute from collaterals in the lower
    calf. However dorsalis pedis was diminutive in size.
5. Occlusion of peroneal artery just beyond its origin with
    reconstitution above the level of the ankle and flow
    below down to the foot.
6. Complete obstruction of the posterior tibial artery at
    its origin with reconstitution off of the peroneal
    artery at the level of the ankle.
.
[**2123-12-10**] CXR: There is a fracture of the uppermost median
sternotomy wire, chronic. The right IJ central venous catheter
has the distal lead tip in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged.
There is a persistent cardiomegaly. There is a persistent
blunting of the left hemidiaphragm suggestive of pleural fluid,
atelectasis, or focal infiltrate. Overall, the findings are
stable.
.
[**2123-12-11**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal,
mid, and distal inferoseptal segments. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic funciton with
regional wall motion abnormalities as described above. Increased
left ventricular filling pressures. Normally functioning
bioprosthetic aortic valve. Biatrial enlargement. Mild mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2120-8-5**], wall motion abnormalities are new. The aortic sinus
and aortic root are no longer dilated.
