Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
EP evaluation for monomorphic V.Tach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ventricular tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (possibly from myocarditis persumed viral >10
years ago) with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral
regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, admitted to
CCU after attempted ablation of arrythmogenic focus performed
due to recent ICD discharges [**Month (only) **].
.
Prior to [**Month (only) 359**] she felt months of increased dypsnea, weakness,
exhaustion and had deteriorated to NYHFC Class III despite not
being fluid overloaded. ICD fired [**9-2**] and [**9-5**]. Amiodarone was
increased from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to TID late [**Month (only) **]. At the visit the
end of [**Month (only) 359**] noted mild edema in her ankles, no difference in
symptoms, no orthopnea or PND. No CP or palpitations but
described episodes lightheadedness and feeling faint that passed
20-30 seconds later at which point her ICD fired. She was 162
lbs at that point.
.
In the cardiac catheterization lab had endocardial and
epicardial access searching for source, none found, pt briefly
hypotensive (induced to vtach and would become hypotensive) and
admitted to CCU on dopamine @ 2mcg/kg/min for monitoring for
possible pericardial effusion. Sheaths are out and pt extubated
prior to arrival. Pulsus by doppler at bedside negative
(115->113), informal bedside TTE showing no evidence of
pericardial effusion. Pacer is set at DDV 60, biV paced.
.
On review of systems, she describes chest pain at the site of
her recent epicardial approach but is otherwise negative.

EKG: [**2114-10-9**]
A-V paced rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2114-5-23**] the
complexes now may represent fusion and loss of left ventricular
capture. The complexes now appear to be conducted consistent
with inferior myocardial infarction, left axis deviation and
right bundle-branch block. There may also
be septal myocardial infarction. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

ECHO: [**2114-10-10**]
FOCUSED STUDY: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severely dilated left
ventricle with severe global hypokinesis. Mild right ventricular
global hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-9-12**],
the findings are similar.

EKG [**2114-10-10**]
A-V paced rhythm. Since the previous tracing the QRS complex is
narrower
suggesting restoration of biventricular pacing. Clinical
correlation is
suggested.
TRACING #2


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 67-year-old woman with an idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate
mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD,
admitted to CCU after attempted endocardial/epicardial ablation
of multifocal VT admitted to the CCU for monitoring.
.
# Monomorphic V.Tach/Relative Hypotension: The patient was taken
to the EP lab and attempted endocardial/epicardial ablation
unsuccessful (no ablatable source found).  The patient was
started on mexilitine and her home amiodarone was discontinued.
After the procedure the patient was placed on dopamine drip and
had pressures in the high 90s.  The patient will start quinidine
as an outpatient.  On discharge to the floor, the patient's
dopamine drip was stopped and her pressures were in the low 80s,
asymptomatic.  The patient had a new friction rub on exam likely
related to pericardial inflammation after procedural
manipulation, without any pulsus on exam.  After the procedure,
she was pain controlled with Dilaudid PCA, and was later
transitioned to oral regimen; upon d/c her pain was well
controlled on tylenol. The patient also had a TTE post-procedure
which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
.
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Chronic, LVEF 20%. NY Class III per
outpt notes which has worsened recently from II. On partial CHF
regimen including c
