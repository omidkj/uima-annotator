Abd: Soft NT ND
Neuro:
Alert oriented to self, not oriented to date, time and only
sometimes to hospital.  Fluent language with intact repetition.
Able to follow simple unilateral commands. Is easily distracted
and not attentive to task. She moves all 4 extremities but
unable to fully access muscle strength. There is a slight Left
sided droop to smile. EOMI with limited upgaze. Pupils are
symmetric and equal. She is able to stand with assistance.
Unable to test coordination.

Pertinent Results:
Dupplex US:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left
lower extremity.

Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2155-8-18**], the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are
increased, and the pulmonary artery pressure appears to be
somewhat further elevated.

    TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 	*64 mm Hg

comparison with the recent CT perfusion study, with involvement
of left

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 99617**] [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 87 yo woman with a history of afib off
coumadin secondary to fall risk who was found the morning of
presentation by an aide with new onset right hemiparesis and an
apparent global aphasia.  She was last seen well at 6:30 pm the
eve of admission.  The most likely etiology is a  cardioembolic
given the recent discontinuation of her coumadin.  She was
admitted to the Neuro ICU and started on heparin and kept with a
PTT of 50-70.  Her SBP was controlled oto goal less than 180.
An MRI was done which demonstrated a left insular stroke.  Given
her bradycardia and risk of autonomic instability she was
transferred to a Neuro step-down unit.   Her stroke risk factors
were controlled with LDLcalc: 78 and A1C 6.1.   An Echo was done
which demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension. A lower
extremity doppler was also completed and negative for DVT. She
was started on Coumadin in order to prevent future strokes. She
was noted to be in A-fib on arrival per EKG read by cardiology
but did not demonstrate A-fib while on telemetry.   On telemetry
she had bradycardia to 38 without symptoms and stable blood
pressure. This was known in the past and no intervention was
needed.

Her INR was theraputic and should be monitored to achieve an
optimal goal range of [**1-1**]. The issue of putting her on Coumadin
was discussed with the patient, the patient's family, and her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

For nutrition she failed her initial speech and swallow, and
dobhoff was placed with tubefeeds. This was discontinued after
passing speech and swallow for a pureed diet.  She was also
found to have a positive UA and was started on cipro x 3 days.
