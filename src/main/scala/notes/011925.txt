History of Present Illness:
A 69-year-old gentleman with a history of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma with CNS involvement undergoing XRT, PCP ([**2168-7-28**]), DVT
s/p IVC filter placement, was admitted for hypoxia, shortness of
breath, fever, fatigue. His wife called the clinic for concern
that the patient has had shortness of breath, new oxygen
requirement, fatigue and weakness, and with temperature of 101.6
3 days PTA. He has had decreased activity tolerance (before
could ambulate with walker) and shortness of breath which
required 2L NC at home for comfort when normally he is not on
oxygen. In clinic, he was noted for a decreased oxygen
saturation to 88-90% on room air which improved to 95% on oxygen
at 2-3 liters via NP. He was admitted to the BMT service to
workup his hypoxia, fever, and fatigue/weakness. He had his dose
of inhaled pentamidine on [**2168-11-23**] and was previously on
atorvaquone for PCP prophylaxis until [**2168-10-14**].
.
On admission, the patient denies chest pain, palpitations,
cough, sputum production, urinary symptoms, URI symptoms, night
sweats. He notes decreased PO intake, constipation, and
decreased LE edema after his IVC filter placement. He has noted
some bruising on his hands but no other bleeding particularly
any blood in his urine or stool, epistaxis or gum bleeding.



Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
His diagnosis was in [**3-/2167**] when he palpated a lymph node in
the right groin area. He underwent biopsy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
that showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
He then received R-CHOP for six cycles, which completed as of
06/[**2167**].  He was well until [**10/2167**] to [**11/2167**] when he developed
right lower extremity weakness.
Followup PET scan for his R-CHOP showed no evidence for
lymphoma.
 However, his lower extremity weakness and pain radiating down
his right leg increased.  He underwent repeated MRI scanning
with
his first on [**2167-12-10**], which showed a partially enhancing
lesion within the posterior L4 vertebrae suggestive of an
atypical hemangioma.  He subsequently was admitted in [**1-/2168**]
for
workup of his right lower extremity weakness as the concern was
for CNS involvement or a cord compression.  He was evaluated by
additional MRIs and lumbar puncture, which did not show any
evidence for malignancy, although noted the same question
atypical hemangioma in the lumbar spine area.  He was
extensively
followed by his primary oncologist as well as the neurologic
service.  On [**2168-2-17**], his CSF cytology did show evidence for
malignant cells.  MRI also demonstrated increased uptake in the
sacral plexus with evidence of possible right lumbosacral
plexopathy.  In mid-[**2-/2168**], he received radiation therapy to
the
sacrum with improvement in his pain complaint and at that time
he
also was initiated on Decadron.  Since [**3-/2168**], he has received
intrathecal high-dose methotrexate as well as systemic
methotrexate with leucovorin rescue for treatment of his CNS
disease.  At the end of [**8-/2168**], it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had
shown some progression of his systemic disease as his last CT
had
shown some evidence of bony erosion and he was having some
increasing lower extremity weakness.  He subsequently began on
Gemzar and Navelbine and received two cycles of treatment with
his last treatment on [**2168-11-3**], which was day eight of Gemzar,
Navelbine, and prednisone.  He has remained on a low dose of
Decadron during this time.  Unfortunately, in [**10/2168**], Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was admitted due to blurry vision that had progressed over the
past month.  He noted a decreased visual acuity and
unfortunately
a head MRI showed a new 1.5 cm suprasellar mass likely
representing progression of his CNS disease.  He subsequently
has
initiated whole brain radiation.
.
1.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as noted above, complicated by
lymphomatous meningitis and a new recent CNS lesion.
2.  Right lower extremity weakness secondary to plexopathy.
3.  Bilateral upper extremity weakness.
4.  Right lower extremity DVT.
5.  Hives intermittently over the last couple of years.
6.  Raynaud's phenomenon.
7.  LUL lesion in [**2129**] status post INH times one year.
8.  Status post appendectomy.

Chest CT
In the four days since the previous CT chest, there has been
collapse/consolidation of the apicoposterior segment of the left
upper lobe.  The superior segment of the left lower lobe is now
opacified, and the remainder of the left lower lobe is also
collapsed/consolidated.  There is increased left pleural
effusion to account for atelectasis and volume loss of the left
lung, however there is also likely consolidation concerning for
an infectious process in the left lung.  The right lung now
demonstrates pleural effusion with relaxation atelectasis and
volume loss at the lung base.  There is also a ground-glass
opacity in the right upper lobe that is concerning for an
infectious process.
