Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of Mini-tracheostomy tube, [**2105-8-3**].

History of Present Illness:
76 y.o. gentleman with history of recurrent pneumonia, PAF,
cognitive deficits readmitted from rehabilitation hospital where
he had been transferred after recent 25 d admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for
subarachnoid hemorrhage with ventricular drain placement, course
c/b prolonged intubation necessitating trach and PEG.  Pt
tracheostomy had undergone recent decannulation.  He presents
with two days of increased secretions, tachypnea and slightly
altered mental status with desaturation to the 80s.  PMH also
notable for recurrent pneumonia He has a h/o serratia PNA
requiring meropenem and per the ED notes the patient was to be
started on ceftriaxone for serratia isolated from his sputum.
He had also been recently started on bactrim for a UTI, and
flagyl to prevent Cdiff with the initiation of these abx.
In the ED he was found to be febrile to 102, tachypneic with RR
=40 and tachycardic to 112.  WBC at 13.5 (PMN predominance)
Initial lactate was 3.1, subsequently declined to 1.2.  Initial
ABG 7.42/33/74.   ECG revealed sinus tach with PACs. He was
given IVF, vanc, ceftazadime 1 g and IVF and tylenol.


Past Medical History:
1) HTN
2) gait abnormality presumed to be NPH since per family it
improved after LP at [**Hospital 15629**].  Gait abnormality reported
to have worsened recently.
3) SAH in [**4-/2105**] diagnosed after pt found down.  SAH suspected
secondary to trauma.
External ventricular drain placed [**2105-5-5**]
Head CT demonstrated multiple SAHs and intraparenchymal
hemorrhages but angio negative for anneurysm, s/p ventricular
drain, trach and PEG
4) Atrial fibrillation discovered when he presented with ICH
with 8 sec pauses
5) h/o recurrent PNAs - serratia initially pan sensitive but
required switch from levo to ??

CXR: ? RUL consolidation but may have been present in [**Month (only) **]. No
PTX. L base not seen in X ray.
*******
ECG: Sinus tach, nml axis, no acute ST-T changes
******
CT Head [**7-29**]: CONCLUSION: Perhaps very slight increase in size
of the subdural hemorrhages, which still appear chronic in age.
********
[**2105-8-1**] Saccrum/Coccyx
The lateral view has some of the osseous detail obscured in the
region of the sacrum and the distal coccyx is cut off from view.
Frontal view has poor angulation and overlying soft tissue
structures preclude definitive evaluation. Degenerative features
are seen in the lower lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION: Quality of the films is not sufficient for ruling
out osteomyelitis. If this is a real clinical concern, CT scan
may be more valuable.
*********
[**8-3**] B/L LE veins
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left and right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, waveforms
are demonstrated. There is no intraluminal thrombus.
*******
[**2105-8-3**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 8:40 a.m. on [**8-2**].

Disparity in lung volume, right substantially greater than left
has been present without appreciable change since [**7-29**].
Left lung though small is otherwise unremarkable. The right lung
is presumably hyperinflated. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion, although the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax is
excluded from the examination and the patient is rotated. I
would recommend a repeat view carefully position with the
patient erect.

Heart size is normal and mediastinum is midline.
***************
ECHO [**2105-8-3**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly
dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
7. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year-old gentleman with history of recurrent
pnuemonia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sacral decubitus
wound, and  recent admission for subdural and subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  He was readmitted from rehabilitation hospital
admitted for [**1-8**] day history of respiratory distress, fever,
increased secretion, presumed secondary to nosocomial and/or
aspiration pneumonia.  Febrile, tachypneic in ED with elevated
WBC. Also slightly worsened mental status. Started on
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, flagyl empirically for presumed
nosocomial and/or aspiration pneumonia   Microbiological studies
revealed gram positve rods in sputum, also gram positve rods
with gram negative rods in sacral decub wound.  The blood
cultures from [**2105-7-29**] also grew out g+ cocci.

1) Respiratory failure / hypoxemia:  On day one of MICU
admission pt noted to be afebrile, but with yellow, thick
secretions.   One mucus plug was suctioned.  Secretions
diminished through night.  Following morning pt afebrile
oxygenating and ventilating well on 50% mask as shown by
arterial blood gas.  Given fever, leukocytosis, increased
secretions, pt's increased resp distress was thought to be due
to pneumonia though no infiltrate was seen on xray.  Given h/o
resistant serratia, and long-term care facility residency he was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover a nosocomial
pneumonia-- vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  He was also started on
flagyl due to his aspiration risk.  He also received aggressive
pulmonary toiiet to aid with secretion clearance.  Initially, he
was placed on a 100% nonrebreather, but with suctioning and
clearance of mucous, he was quickly weaned to nasal canulla.
His lung exam and resp distress all improved quickly within 2
days of initiation of antibiotics.  He was called out to the
floor on [**8-1**].  Sputum culture did not reveal definite pulmonary
pathogen.  Bactrim was stopped.  On [**8-2**], pt was noted to be
more tachypneic, ta
