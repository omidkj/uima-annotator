PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Left lower extremity cellulitis.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Aortic stenosis.
5. Appendectomy.
6. Venous stasis ulcers status post skin graft.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Os-Cal 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory on [**4-10**], which showed an
ejection fraction of 50% ostial 40% RCA lesion, otherwise no
significant coronary disease, aortic valve area of 0.45 cm
squared with a peak gradient of 65 mmHg.  Left ventricular
end diastolic pressure of 25.

Patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on
[**5-12**] and underwent aortic valve replacement with a #21
[**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine valve.  Patient was transported to
the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine
and propofol infusion.  Please see operative note for further
details.

During the initial postoperative period, the patient was
noted to have moderate amount of bleeding from the chest tube
as well as labile hemodynamics.  Discussion was had with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**], and decision was made to take the patient back to
the operating room for re-exploration of bleeding.  In the
operating room, patient continued to have labile
hemodynamics.  Patient was started on low-dose milrinone with
improvement in hemodynamics.

In the operating room, it was found the patient had a small
bleeding site thought to be due to a sternal wire.  This was
cauterized.  Patient was transported back to the Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition.  Patient remained intubated on
her first postoperative night, continued on milrinone with
adequate cardiac index as well as Levophed for blood pressure
support.

Patient was weaned and extubated early morning postoperative
day #1.  The milrinone was weaned to off with continued
adequate cardiac output and the Levophed was weaned off by
postoperative day #2.  The patient was noted to have a drop
in platelet count and a Heparin antibody was sent, which was
subsequently negative.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
removed.  Patient was started on low-dose Lasix and
Lopressor.  Patient was transferred from the Intensive Care
Unit to the regular part of the hospital.

Patient began ambulating with Physical Therapy.  Patient's
chest tubes were removed without incident.  On postoperative
day #3, patient's pacing wires were removed.  By
postoperative day #3, the patient completed a level 5 with
Physical Therapy, and by postoperative day #6 the patient was
cleared for discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs stable.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.  Lungs are clear
bilaterally.  Incision is clean, dry, and intact.  Sternum is
stable.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, positive bowel
movement, grossly benign.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 4.6, hematocrit
27.6, platelet count 171.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.2,
chloride 102, bicarb 30, BUN 16, creatinine 0.3, glucose 110.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x7 days.
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days.
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn.
7. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home in
stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Aortic stenosis.
2. Status post aortic valve replacement.
3. Reoperation for bleeding.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-17**] weeks.  Patient is to followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in [**5-21**] weeks.
