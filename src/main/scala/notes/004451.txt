Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old
male with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular
disease, status post left below the knee amputation and
status post right first and second toe amputations, chronic
kidney disease, history of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococcus,
who presented with left lower extremity swelling, erythema
and a "green drainage" from the right heel per VNA, who had
seen the patient on [**2191-11-5**].

The patient complains of right lower extremity pain extending
from the knee down to the foot.  He also noted increased
fingersticks at home in the 400 to 500 range for two days
prior to admission.  Review of systems at presentation was
significant for no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria or bright red blood per rectum.  In the
Emergency Room, the patient was given Vicodin, morphine,
Ancef and oral Levaquin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had a recent
cardiac catheterization in [**2191-3-23**] which demonstrated
diffuse three vessel disease.  The patient received stents to
the left marginal for a 70% stenosis and the obtuse marginal
one for a 90% stenosis.  The patient has a known left bundle
branch block.  Persantine thallium in [**2191-4-23**] demonstrated
defects inferiorly (moderate partially reversible), apical
(moderate to severe reversible) and anteroseptal (mild,
fixed) walls.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was
noted to be 31% at that time with global hypokinesis and
enlargement.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2 complicated by chronic kidney
disease (several episodes of acute renal failure, receiving
dialysis at that time), neuropathy and retinopathy.
3.  Intermittent left bundle branch block.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Recurrent right lower extremity cellulitis, last
admission [**2191-6-23**] with piperacillin/tazobactam therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time was negative for
osteomyelitis.
6.  Left renal artery stenosis, stented in [**2191-3-23**].
7.  Anemia.
8.  History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
and vancomycin resistant enterococcus infections.
9.  Cataracts/blindness.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left thyroid lobectomy.
2.  Amputation of right first toe in [**2181**].
3.  Amputation of right second toe in [**2183**].
4.  Right popliteal-dorsalis pedis bypass in [**2183**].
5.  Left below the knee amputation in [**2185**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an unclear allergy to codeine.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Lipitor
40 mg p.o.q.d., metoprolol 100 mg p.o.b.i.d., NPH insulin 36
units q.a.m., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.q.d., Plavix
75 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Colace 100 mg

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 4634**].  He
has VNA visits twice weekly and his children are actively
involved in his care.  He has not been ambulatory for the
last year.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 132/66,
heart rate 86, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 98%
in room air.  General:  Alert, in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Left eye shut, extraocular
movements full, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple without
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Left lower extremity
below the knee amputation, no erythema or edema, right lower
extremity with erythema and edema extending above the knee,
status post right number one and number two toe amputations,
heel ulcer healing with no drainage, beginning of skin
breakdown on right shin and right foot but no drainage and no
cuts/ulcers/lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission sodium was 142, BUN 73,
creatinine 2.3, white blood cell count 5.9, hematocrit 30,
platelet count 233,000, prothrombin time 12, partial
thromboplastin time 29.8, and INR 1.  On the day prior to
discharge, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, white blood cell count
4.7, hematocrit 33.1, and platelet count 328,000.

IMPRESSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with
vasculopathy, peripheral vascular disease, status post left
below the knee amputation, coronary artery bypass grafting,
who was admitted with right lower extremity cellulitis
complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction,
likely in the setting of demand ischemia and acute renal
failure, now improved.  He has remained afebrile while on
levofloxacin and clindamycin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room on [**2191-11-6**]
with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus right lower
extremity cellulitis.  A chest x-ray was clear and venous
ultrasound was negative for thrombosis at that time.  He
received hydrocodone 5 mg orally, cefazolin 1 gram,
levofloxacin 500 mg, and intravenous morphine 2 mg.

The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service, where
intravenous metronidazole was added, cefazolin was changed to
vancomycin pending the MRSA screen.  BUN and creatinine were
noted to be elevated and he received one liter of half normal
saline.

Early in the morning on [**2191-11-7**], the patient
developed five out of ten chest pain.  An electrocardiogram
showed 1 mm inferior and lateral ST depressions and his chest
pain resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  That day,
antibiotics were changed to intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam
3 grams every eight hours and intravenous vancomycin 1,000 mg
every 24 hours.  Both of these antibiotics were continued
through [**11-8**].  He had received a total of
three units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit less
than 30.  His stool remained occult blood negative.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia on [**2191-11-10**] and consideration of repeat
vascularization may be undertaken after the acute process
resolves.

On [**2191-11-11**], the patient developed a cough and
shortness of breath with mild desaturation.  Secondary to
increasing serum creatinine, Captopril was also discontinued
on that day.

On [**2191-11-12**], the patient was noted to be somnolent,
with nausea and vomiting.  Narcotics were withheld and he did
not respond to Neurontin.  The patient had received
Kayexalate per rectum for a potassium of 5.6.  The patient
became febrile and had a temperature that peaked at 102.9.
The Nephrology Service was consulted for a rising creatinine
(4.4) and oliguria.  The Renal Service suspected acute
tubular necrosis and Lasix boluses and isosorbide mononitrate
were discontinued.

Throughout the evening of [**2191-11-12**], the patient
continued to have rigors and soaking sweats.  He experienced
several episodes of transient hypotension to the 80s and 90s
systolic.  He rapidly became hypoxic around 2:00 p.m. and
eventually required a 10 liter face mask.  He was noted to
have poor secretion management, with a weak cough and
persistent rattle without frequent suctioning.  He was noted
to have cardiac enzymes that were positive and his metoprolol
was decreased to 25 mg twice a day rather than discontinuing
it altogether secondary to his hypotension.  He was totally
anuric at that time.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
suctioning and blood pressure monitoring.  He was diagnosed
with aspiration pneumonia at that time and was treated with
renally dosed levofloxacin and clindamycin.  He was continued
on aspiration precautions with the head of bed greater than
45 degrees with frequent tracheal
