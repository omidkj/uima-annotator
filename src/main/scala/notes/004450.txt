CXR: COMPARISON: Comparison is made to chest x-ray performed
[**2186-1-3**].

There is stable flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms with
a relative
paucity of vasculature in the left upper lung, consistent with
reported
history of COPD. Stable mild bilateral blunting of the
costophrenic angles
may represent a small pleural effusion. No focal opacification
concerning for pneumonia identified. Mediastinal, hilar, and
cardiac contours are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged exam. Stable minimal blunting of
bilateral
costophrenic angles may represent small effusions versus
scarring.
.
EKG: [**1-4**]: Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality.
Somewhat late R wave progression. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing the rate is slower. QRS voltage is less
prominent in the precordial leads.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 75 yo F h/o COPD on 3L with recent COPD
exacerbation, HTN on [**Last Name (un) **] presenting with uvula swelling and
urticaria which was concerning for allergic reaction to
levofloxacin or Losartan.
.
# Uvula Swelling: Only new exposures include levofloxacin and
prednisone. Levofloxacin renally cleared and patient does have
mildly decreased GFR, so the timing of this new medication may
coincide with her reaction. Another possibility includes the
[**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Both medications can cause an allergic reaction
in less than 1 % of all noted reactions. Airway did not appear
compromised. Patient had no dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea,
stridor and is managing secretions without difficulty. On home
O2. Was initially using accessory muscles, however improved
after nebulizers. We emailed Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], allergist and the
recommendation was to continue to hold levofloxacin and
losartan, while was okay to start on HCTZ. ENT was also
consulted and recommended tx with steroids. She was given an
dose of epinephrine in the ED and then started on methaPred than
transitioned to prednisone 40mg with recs to take it for 5 days.
Her uvula slight less swollen at time of discharge. As noted
above, it was only mildly swollen by the time she arrived to the
MICU. she was instructed to stop taking levofloxacin and
possible losartan. I gave granddaughter verbal instructions over
the phone since they could not come to pick up the patients.
- Prednisone 40mg for 5 days
- Famotidine and hydroxy as needed for symptomatic relief
- Hold levofloxacin and losartan
- [**Month (only) 116**] consider allergist referral
.
# COPD: On 3 liters at baseline, however did appear in mild to
moderate distress on presentation which improved with neb
treatment
