History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83584**] is a 65 year-old woman transfered from an outside
hospital following hypotensive bradycardic arrest. Per her
daughters, the patient had been feeling fatigued and lethargic
for about one month. She was evaluated by her hepatologist who
adjusted her lasix and aldactone dosing and continued her
lactulose regimen with some limited improvement in symptoms. The
evening prior to admission the patient complained of nausea and
leg cramping. On the morning of admission, the patient had a
witnessed fall after exiting the bathroom. She reportedly hit
her head during this episode, but quickly regained
consciousness.
.
She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital3 **] where her HR was in the
30's and she was noted to be in third degree heart block and had
a K 5.7. Shortly after arrival to the OSH, she vomited and
became unresponsive. She was treated as an arrest and received
CPR, although in between compressions she was noted to have a
pulse in 20's. She was subseqently intubated; she was reportedly
a difficult intubation. As part of her work up for a fall she
received a Head and C-spine CT that was reassuring. Initial CXR
was also reassuring, although post-intubation CXR was concerning
for PNA, possibly aspiration pneumonitis. She received one dose
of zosyn at the OSH for possible PNA. She was then transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
She arrived intubated to [**Hospital1 18**] paralyzed, intubated and
internally paced through right cordis with OG tube in place.
Arrival vitals were BP 99/58 HR 83 RR 20 SpO2 100% on mechanical
ventilator. Repeat labs at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a K of 4.4. Cooling
protocol was initiated in the ED and the patient was admitted to
the CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated and paralysed
accoring to the cooling protocol. She was accompanied by her
daughters [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 402**] who were available to provide her
medical history. Following arrival to the CCU, her external
pacemaker was set to 60 bpm and she remained hemodynamically
stable with BP 108/59 and preserved oxygen saturation of 98%.
.
On review of systems, she denies prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

DISCHARGE LABS:

PERTINENT STUDIES:
TTE ([**2153-7-28**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT HEAD ([**2153-7-29**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect; mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid and sphenoid
sinuses. While there is no large hypodense area to suggest an
obvious alrge ifnarct, early/subtle ischemic changes can be
better assessed with MRI if there is continued clinical concern
without contra-indication.

MRI HEAD ([**2153-7-29**]): Subtle T1 hyperintensities in the basal
ganglia are nonspecific, but can be seen in metabolic or hypoxic
encephalopathy.

TTE ([**2153-7-31**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.6 cm2). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
