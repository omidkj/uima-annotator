Pertinent Results:
[**2132-9-16**] ECHO
Pre-bypass:
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal
free wall function.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Torn mitral chordae are present. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is AV-Paced and receiving 0.02 mcg/kg/min of
epinephrine post-CPB.
The LV - EF is approximately 30%.
There is mild mitral regurgitation.
All other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.
The aorta is intact post-decannulation. All findings
communicated to [**Month/Day (2) 5059**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1001**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-9-15**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Within the next 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Hew as then transferred
to the step down unit on postoperative day one. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He was started on an
ACE-I due to a low ejection fraction.  The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  His narcotics were
discontinued due to visual hallucinations and he was using
Ultram sparingly for pain control.  His visual haalucinations
abated.  He benefited from vigorous pulmonary therapy. He has an
allergy to ASA and therefore was not started on it.  He is being
anticoagulated with Plavix and Coumadin for a history of DVT.
First INR draw to be done Mon [**9-22**] with results to be called to
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8725**] or faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8719**] for
