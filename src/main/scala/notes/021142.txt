Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis and Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement
R internal jugular venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 y.o. female with a h/o transfusion
dependent CLL who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Neeham where she
presented with hypotension SBP = 60s in EMS (SBP = 50s earlier
by home VNA) lightheadedness, and dizziness. She was found to be
anemic with HCT = 21 - she was scheduled for a blood transfusion
tomorrow.  She also c/o n/v/ denied melena or BRBPR.  Her vitals
on presentation to [**Location (un) 620**] were 97, 78, 74/22, 16 and 98% on 2L
NC. At [**Location (un) 620**] placement of a subclavian was attempted without
success with ensuing hemoptysis. (The amount of hemoptysis was
not quantified- but was reported to be significant.) Given 2U
PRBCs and 1L NS.  Her ECG demonstrated NSR @ 73, Q in F,ST
depression in lateral leads with TropI =21, CK = 424, and CK MIB
= 13.6.
The patient was then intubated for airway protection, a R
femoral cordis was placed and she was started on dopamine. She
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Upon
presentation to the ED T = 100, 76, 95/38 but per resident SBP =
70s off dopamine, RR = 21, SaO2 = 100% intubated on 100% FiO2
with vent setting AC: Vt = 500, RR = 20, PEEP = 5.  She was
given a dose of zosyn and vancomycin, fentanyl and versed. Her X
ray demonstrated bibasilar infiltrates vs consolidation. Given
1L NS. and continued on dopa gtt.

Past Medical History:
- Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia dx by
BM bx in [**8-/2106**] @ [**Hospital1 18**]
- H/o myocardial infarction-[**2107-6-1**]- h/o cardiac caths in late
90s but records could not be accessed. Refused cath during this
admission 04/[**2107**].
Heart failure- EF = 25-30% on [**5-/2107**] with severe hypokinesis of
the apical and antro-septal walls., mod- severe TR, nml RV
function, mod AV stenosis, moderate pulmonary artery htn.
- Iron deficiency anemia.
- Chronic left leg pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident.
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/Severe chronic
bronchitis - in [**5-/2107**] FEV1, and FEV1/FVC reduced on PFTs at
[**Location (un) 620**]
- Osteoporosis.
- GERD- EGD in [**2106-4-12**] wnl [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] d/c summary

- ?CVA- per d/c summary on [**2106-8-5**] [**Location (un) 620**]
- Baseline BP = 130/80
PSH:
s/p bipolar endofemoral hemiarthroplasty of the left hip, open
reduction, internal fixation left distal femur, osteotomy left
distal tibia

Social History:
60 pk yr smoking h/o and quit in [**2107-4-12**] per day and denied
alcohol use.  She lives with her sister and ambulates with a
quad cane in the home.  This was a single floor dwelling with
three stairs.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y.o. female p/w hypotension initially requiring pressor who
course was complicated by the development of hemoptysis after a
failed atempt at placing a subclavian line  OSH.
<br>
Shock: Ddx includes cardiogenic, distributive/sepsis and
hyovolemia, adrenal insufficiency
Cardiogenic
The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes were
concerning for cardiac ischemia.  She was started on aspirin,
heparin and a statin.  Cardiac tamponade was ruled out by a
negative US. Her hemodynamic instability precluded CT scanning
to evaluate for PE. Cardiology was consulted and the patient was
placed on a heparin drip to treat both a possible pulmonary
embolism and ACS.
*
Sepsis:
The pulmonary consolidations were concerning for possible PNA
and thus she was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
*
Hypovolemia
We wondered whether her hypotenstion was secondary to bleeding
or decreased po intake secondary to nausea and vomiting. The
source of bleeding was unclear at this point since her NG lavage
was clear, FAS scanning was negative for blood or pericardial
effusion. The patient was hypotensive prior to the development
of bilateral infiltrates on chest Xray thus DAH unlikely to be
cause.
*
Respiratory Distress:
She was intubated solely for airway protection but A-A gradient
= 308 on 100% FiO2. We thought that her respiratory distress was
multifactorial in etiology probably secondary to  severe
COPD/bronchitis with restrictive and obstructive defect noted on
recent PFTS along with new diffuse consolidations/infiltrates
