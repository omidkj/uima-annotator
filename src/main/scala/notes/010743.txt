Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Right subclavian central line

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old woman who was found down in [**Location (un) 583**] by
the police early on the morning of admission. There were no
obvious signs of trauma. She was unresponsive in the field and
had a temperature of 31.9 rectal. She briefly awoke in the ED
and could say her name was "[**Known firstname 2048**]" and her birthday. She
followed commands but was otherwise aphasic. Moved all four
extrmities. She was put on a bear hugger and given warmed saline
and warmed humidified air. CXR showed possible bilateral lower
lung infiltrates. Lactate was initially 8.0 with a gap of 25,
bicarb 14, creatinine of 1.6, CK of 324, wbc 9.1 with 73%
neutrophils, 9% bands. She received 6 liters of normal saline
and lactate improved to 2.5. She had a CT scan that showed no
bleed.
.
After the CT scan she became rigid and then had tonic clonic
activity for 10 seconds. She was intubated for airway
protection. She was given ativan 4 mg and 3 amps of bicarbonate
as her urine tox was positive for tricyclics. Serum ethanol
level was 17 with an acetominophen level of 6.1. She also
received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir and ampicillin. She
also received 10 mg IV decadron. She had 2 liters of urine
output in the ED. An LP was performed which showed 4 wbc, 52
rbc, 3% poly, 80% lymph. Protein 56 and glucose was 87.
.
In her jacket there was bupropion 150 mg SR, lipitor 10 mg,
lisinopril 2.5 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg.

ECG: Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 93 bpm. Normal axis. QRS
110. PR and QTc normal duration. No ST or TW changes. No prior
for comparison. There is slurring of the S in I and AVL and R in

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
54 F with h/o HTN, COPD, SI who was found down, hypothermic, and
combative s/p suicide attempt with Wellbutrin and amitryptiline
overdose.
.
##  Altered Mental Status:
Differential includes toxic overdose which may include
tricyclic, bupropion, alcohol and acetominophen. Bupropion
lowers the seizure threshold and can cause confusion and
somnolence. TCA overdose can cause widened QRS, confusion,
hyperthermia, obtundation, hypotension. Charcol was not given in
the ED. Whole bowel irrigation can be helpful in cases on
ingestion with bupropion. Toxicology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did not
recommend as there would be no benefit this far out from an
ingestion. Pt was extubated on hospital day # 2 but had periods
of somnolence post-extubation. Her mental status improved by
hospital day 3 and she reported that her name was [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 18479**]
[**Known lastname 19704**].  On the floor, patient's mental status was normal,
A&Ox3, normal affect, able to converse and communicate clearly.
.
##  TCA and wellbutrin overdose:
Given the risk of widened QRS she was closely monitored on
telemetry and have frequent EKGs. Initial ecg showed QRS
prolongation of 126 that did not improve with bicarbonate
treatment. Daily EKGs show no sign of widening QRS. Tox consult
on [**12-7**] -symptoms - tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis -
likely anti-cholinergic symptoms in setting of tricyclic
overdose. Suggested treating supportively.  Also question fo
possible alcohol withdrawl.  Started on CIWA scale. She required
minimal valium from CIWA scale.  On the floor, EKG showed NSR
with poor precordial R wave progression, resolution of QRS
prolongation, and no QTc prolongation while on fluoroquinolone
for aspiration pna.
.
##  Seizure:
Differential includes bupropion, TCA, hypothermia, CNS
infection. LP showed no signs of infection. She was observed
intubated for 24 hours in order to assess for late seizures
given ingestion of long acting bupropion. No further seizure
activity while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] or on the floor.
.
##  Aspiration pna:
On the floor, patient had R sided pulmonary dullness halfway up,
with L crackles.  Due to pulmonary edema on CXR, was possible
that infiltrate was hidden.  High probability of aspiration pna,
associated with seizure in ED, drug overdose with altered MS,
low grade fever, and R side favored in aspiration events.
Patient was started on Levo/Flagyl [**12-12**] to [**12-19**].  Patient
continued with O2 requirement of 3L nc to maintain sats > 95%.
CTA chest was performed to assess whether PE was present due to
tachycardia and O2 requirement, but no PE.  Patient was
discharged on 4 more days of Levo/Flagyl, for a 7 day course.
.
##  Respiratory failure:
after somnolence on [**12-7**], ABG revealed increased pCO2.  Pt was
started on BIPAP and pCO2 treneded down.  Was then taken off
BIPAP and able to maintain sats.  On morning of [**12-8**], in
setting of decreased O2 sats, pt found to have diffuse crackles.
 Given Lasix and nebs - CXR revealed evidence of infiltrates
consistent with pulmonary edema.  Pt was diuresed and started to
improve. Pt also started on albuterol, ipratroprium, and
steroids for question of COPD.  Steroids discontinued on [**12-9**].
.
##  Hypotension:
Likely from ingestion vs sepsis. Patient was hypothermic,
tachycardic, hypotensive and had an elevated lactate, thus she
fits the criteria for SIRS. She does not have a suspected
infection, but was started on broad spectrum antibiotics given
her severe illness. Urine shows no infection and LP shows no
sign of infection. CXR shows possible bilateral lower lobe
infiltrates. Will repeat CXR in am. Will continue vancomycin and
ceftriaxone for 24 hours pending improvement and follow
temperature. Also started on steroids for inappropriate response
to cosyntropin stim test.  Antibiotics were discontinued on
hospital day # 2.  Hypotentsion resolved after fluid
resuscitation.  Pt became hypertensive on hospital day #2. She
was strted on metoprolol TID but during that time she had
increased wheezing so it was discontinued. She was started on
lisinopril for blood pressure control.
.
On the floor, patient was triggered several times for SBP<90,
likely associated with dehydration and vasovagal response.
First episode occurred while patient was passing BMs on toilet
for a few hrs.  Patient was asymptomatic, no dizziness, mildly
diaphoretic, did not realize her BP was low.  Was placed in
Trendelenberg and BP increased to 118 with boluses.  Urine was
concentrated.  Lisinopril was held for repeated hypotensive
episodes.
.
##  Sinus Tachycardia:
HR was 110-120 upon transfer to floor, then decreased to 90s,
likely due to albuterol nebs and pna/fever.  Sinus and QRS
prolongation resolved on EKG.  CTA Chest showed no PE.
.
##  Nonlocalizing abdominal pain and nausea:
On the floor, patient had diffuse abdominal pain, worse with
palpation, but no signs of surgical abdomen.  BMs were induced
to assess whether abdominal pain wa
