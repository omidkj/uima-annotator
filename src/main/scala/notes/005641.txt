Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo F living at [**Hospital3 2558**] with multiple
medical problems including DM, HTN, diastolic CHF,
hyperlipidemia, pulm HTN, ESRD on HD, h/o AV graft infections,
morbid obesity, lower extremity DVT, b/l IJ vein thromboses on
coumadin, and OSA. She has recently been admitted several times
to [**Hospital1 18**] for tachycardia most recently on [**2-25**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service which she was found to be in atrial tachycardia.

Today, she presents directly from HD. She has been needing more
HD sessions for fluid removal in the past week. Today, she had
2kg fluid removed and was hypotensive at HD and metoprolol was
held. Shortly afterwards, she began to notice palpitations with
HR 120-130's. She was sent in directly from HD to [**Hospital1 18**].

In our ED, initial vitals were 96.9 128 133/112 20 100%RA. One
hour in ED, her BP then decreased to 64/60, which improved to
110's after receiving 1500 cc NS. She was mentating throughout
and stated that BPs normally run 80-90's. She then received
lopressor 5mg IV X 3 with no change in HR. She had a low grade T
100.4, CXR negative, blood and urine cx drawn, but no
antibiotics started.

She was admitted to the ICU, where she reported feeling well.
She is still noticing some fluttering sensation in chest, but
denies CP. She did note a left shoulder twinge during HD which
prompted her to ask RN at HD to check her HR. Since then, she
has not had any more twinges. She attributes increased need for
HD to eating more fruit at NH (watermelon and grapes). She has
been to HD last Tues, Wed, [**Last Name (un) **], and today. Also, she is
recently s/p 7d levoquin for pneumonia. She denies fever,
chills, N/V/D, no PND/orthopnea/LE swelling

Imaging:
Echo [**2137-5-13**]
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction. No significant valvular abnormality seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-10-4**],
findings are similar.

         SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo F with ESRD and atrial tachycardia admitted initially to
MICU for hypotension/tachycardia.

1) Atrial Tachycardia: The patient was started on IV Diltiazem
and converted to PO Diltiazem and Metoprolol after rule out of
myocardial infarction.  EP was consulted to advise and her
Diltiazem was stopped, replaced with Amiodarone load to complete
[**2137-6-13**].  At this time, metoprolol will be discontinued.  The
patient had an echo with no significant change from prior.

2) Hypotension: The patient has chronic BP in the 80s-90s
especially post-dialysis.  The goal of therapy above is to
remove her Diltiazem & Metoprolol to avoid the hypotensive side
effects of her rate control medications.  She was given fluid
rescusitation but did not develop sepsis during this admission.
Although she had 1 bottle positive for Coag negative Staph and
received 2 dose of Vancomycin, therapy was discontinued as this
is a likely contaminant.

3) Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient remained euvolemic on exam
and on her baseline 1.5-2L oxygen by nasal cannula.  Echo
confirmed no signficant change.

4) Venous Thromboembolism: The patient has a history of multiple
DVTs.  She was maintained on warfarin 2.5mg intermittently
during this admission as her INR often increased over 3.0.  She
will be discharged on 1mg daily given the addition of Amiodarone
and followed closely at [**Hospital3 2558**].

5) ESRD: The patient was continued on her renal vitamins and HD
Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday.

6) Depression:  Continued Paxil

7) DM:  Continued Home NPH with additional sliding scale
coverage.
