Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72M h/o CHF (EF 20%), EtOH abuse, CRI s/p renal artery stent,
AAA repair, clean cath [**2106**], lost to follow-up [**2108**] with med
non-compliance x 1 year presents with acute onset SOB at 6pm
[**2109-12-2**] in the setting of chronically worsening DOE x 6 months.

.
One year ago he states that he ran out of meds and did not
schedule a follow-up appointment. At baseline he is not active
but claims he can climb 1 flight stairs without stopping. 1
pillow orthopnea and denies PND or ankle edema. Does not follow
Na-restricted diet.
.
The evening of admission he was having a heated discussion with
his wife regarding his medical conditions when he became
'stressed' and acutely SOB. Called EMS who found SaO2 84% on
room air, RR 40, HR 130's, SBP 170's. Denies CP or palpitations
but was noted to be cool, pale, and diaphoretic with bilateral
crackles on lung exam. Put on NRB and given nitro sl x 2. On
arrival to the ED, SaO2 90% on 100% NRB, SBP 170's, and ECG with
SVT 180's. Given lopressor 5mg IV x 1 and HR decreased to 100's.
Repeat ECG revealed likely atrial tachycardia with frequent
PAC's. Given 40mg IV lasix, combivent nebs, lopressor 25mg po,
levalbuterol, and nitro gtt with SBP decrease to 91/58. ABG was
7.19/72/175 and he was started on BiPAP. Repeat ABG 7.36/39/134.
Admitted to CCU for further management.
.
No palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or claudication.

ECG ([**2109-12-2**]): atrial tachycardia, 107 bpm, freq PAC's, PR
interval 200ms, Q's III/AVf, PRWP, no ST or T changes; similar
to [**11-29**] ECG
.
CXR, portable ([**2109-12-2**]): Mild/moderate interstitial and alveolar
pulmonary edema.
.
TTE ([**2109-12-3**]):
EF 20%. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-12-23**],
left ventricular systolic function appears similar. Mitral
regurgitation is now more prominent. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher.

Prior studies -
.
Cath ([**3-1**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary arteriography of this right dominant
system revealed evidence of mild coronary artery disease.The
left main coronary artery was free of stenosis. The LAD and the
circunflex system had no angiographic evidence of flow limiting
lesions.The right coronary artery had a proximal 20% stenosis
followed by a 40% distal flow limitation. The left main coronary
artery was engaged with a JL5 catheter.
2.Left ventriculogram revealed no significant mitral
regurgitation.
There was evidence of severe left ventricular dyfunstion with
global
hypokinesis and a calculated ejection fraction of 20%.
3. Resting hemodynamics showed elevated left heart filling
pressure with a mean end-diastolic filling pressure of 28mmHg.
There was evidence of mild pulmonary hypertension with mean PAP
of 30mmHg.
4.Aortogram revealed a desdending infrarenal aneurysm measuring
5cm in diameter.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Angiographic evidence of mild coronary artery disease.
2. Severe global systolic and distolic dysfunction.
3. Infrarenal aortic aneursym.
4. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
TTE ([**11-28**]):
EF 20%. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
72M h/o CHF (EF 20%), EtOH abuse, CRI s/p renal artery stent,
AAA repair, med non-compliance with chronically worsening DOE x
6 months presented with acute onset SOB and SVT.
.
# Dyspnea: likely due to acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation in
setting of med and dietary non-compliance followed by poorly
compensated rapid SVT leading to flash pulm edema. improved on
BiPAP, eventually weaned to off supplemental oxygen with
diuresis and rate-control.
.
# SVT: likely atrial tachycardia per EP consult. initially
rate-controlled with IV metoprolol. pt had one brief
asymptomatic 3 min episode atrial tach 2 days prior to
discharge. no further episodes on telemetry. rate controlled
with metoprolol, switched to toprol XL prior to discharge. EP
suggests first optimizing CHF management and then considering EP
study if further episodes. he was discharged with an oupatient
event monitor and EP follow-up.
.
# CHF: EF 20%. likely etiology is EtOH; unlikely ischemia prior
clean cath. extremely
