CXR: Since the prior study, endotracheal tube has been withdrawn
and now
terminates about 3 cm above the carina. Otherwise, no relevant
change since recent study.

CT w/ and w/o Chest:
1. Negative exam for pulmonary embolism.
2. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion.
3. Worsening of ground-glass opacity in right upper lobe that
might suggest
an acute process such as pneumonia.
4. Unchanged central chronic bronchiectasis.
5. Stable significant mediastinal lipomatosis.
6. Enlarged main pulmonary artery is suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension and is unchanged compared to prior study in
[**2131-12-31**].
7. Acute right rib fracture and new mid vertebral bodies
compression
fracture.

TTE with bubbles:
Late appearance of saline contrast suggestive of transpulmonic
passage (e.g., pulmonary AVM). Normal biventricular cavity sizes
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
If the clinical suspicion for an atrial septal defect is high, a
TEE is suggested to better clarify the interatrial septum.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year-old male with HIV/AIDS presents with dyspnea
and hypoxia.

# Dyspnea/Hypoxia/Respiratory failure: Initial differential
diagnosis was broad including infectious etiologies such as
bacterial/viral pna, as well as OI infections including PCP or
MAC; non-infectious causes including PE, or less likely CHF (no
history of LV dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction); and finally
interstitial pneumonias associated wit HIV such as DAH or LIP.
Patient underwent bronchcoscopy with BAL with was negative for
DAH. TTE was negative for signs of impaired LV function but did
demonstrate delayed bubbles most consistent with pulmonary AVM.
Ultimately, the patient had sputum and BAL cultures that
speciated as Pseudomonas sensitive to pip/tazo but resistant to
fluoroquinolones. He was treated broadly with empiric
antimicrobials including double GNR coverage.  Despite broad
antimicrobial coverage, the patient developed progressive ARDS
and was intubated with an increasing oxygen requirement.  After
discussion with the patient's HCP and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] decision was made
for terminal extubation and CMO.  All antimicrobials were held
and the patient was extubated and expired shortly thereafter.

# HIV/AIDS: Most recent CD4 count 33 on [**2133-1-6**], viral load
undetectable.  The patient was continued on HAART during his
admission until his code status was changed to CMO.

# Anemia: Patient has baseline anemia felt to be secondary to
HIV myelosuppression with component of hemolysis.  His
hematocrit was low during the course of his admission and he
received  a total of 3 units PRBCs.

# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets at baseline. Thrombocytopenia
likely secondary to HIV myelosuppression and sequestration [**3-3**]
splenomegaly.

# Hepatitis C: Active disease with most recent VL 8,640,000
IU/mL on [**2132-3-4**]. Not being treated [**3-3**] pancytopenia.

# Code status/Goals of care: As above, the patient transitioned
from full code to DNR to CMO during the course of his
hospitalization.  Numerous meetings were held with the patient's
HCP and his PCP was informed of treatment decisions and
long-term goals of care discussions throughout. As above, the
patient was transitioned to CMO with terminal extubation and he
expired shortly thereafter.
