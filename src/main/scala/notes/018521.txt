Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] is a 71-year-old male
patient with known 3-vessel disease diagnosed in [**2120-2-4**] by cardiac catheterization.  At that time, he was
referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for evaluation for CABG.
Surgery was deferred secondary to a climbing creatinine with
a maximum of 5.0 and need for temporary dialysis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**]
has since been seen in our office with hopes for a decreased
creatinine and optimized hemodynamics prior to coronary
artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement/repair.

He presented to an outside hospital with anemia.  He was
transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells with flash
pulmonary edema and intubation.  He was thus transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for ongoing
management.  His creatinine was below baseline on admission
at 1.6, and we were asked to consider surgery at that time.
Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] reports dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, shortness
of breath, and weakness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 1 diabetes (diagnosed at the age
of 24), chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine of
1.9), glaucoma (legally blind), coronary artery disease
(myocardial infarction in [**2119**]), congestive heart failure,
peripheral vascular disease, anemia, hypertension, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, hard of hearing, and degenerative
joint disease.

ALLERGIES:  Question allergy to ACE INHIBITOR'S.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily,
multivitamin, Lipitor 80 mg p.o. once daily, Protonix 40 mg
p.o. once daily, Lopressor 50 mg p.o. three times per day,
Imdur 40 mg p.o. three times per day, amlodipine 5 mg once
daily, trazodone 50 mg p.o. once daily, hydralazine 50 mg
p.o. three times per day, Timolol 0.5 percent 1 drop at
bedtime, Bimatoprost 0.03 percent 1 drop both eyes at
bedtime, and insulin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Height of 5 feet 0
inches, weight of 69.9 kilograms.  Vital signs revealed
temperature was 96.0, the heart rate was 63 (in sinus
rhythm), the blood pressure was 94/31, the respiratory rate
was 16, and 100 percent intubated.  In general, flat in bed.
Intubated, sedated, and in no acute distress.
Neurologically, responded to painful stimuli.  He moved all
extremities.  Respiratory examination revealed fine rales at
bilateral bases. Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  A positive 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  Gastrointestinal examination revealed soft,
round, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
The extremities were warm and dry.  Positive red scaly shins
without any open areas.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was
8.9, the hematocrit was 30.9, and platelets were 230.  PT was
13.9, PTT was 28.8, and INR was 1.2.  Sodium was 142,
potassium was 3.8, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 25, BUN
was 38, creatinine was 1.6, and glucose was 245.  Urinalysis
was negative.  Typed and crossed - O positive.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A chest x-ray revealed congestive heart
failure with bilateral effusions.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated in the History of
Present Illness, Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] was admitted on [**2121-2-20**]
from an outside facility with flash pulmonary edema, status
post red blood cell transfusion.

On [**2-21**] - on hospital day two - he was successfully
weaned and extubated.  He continued in the Intensive Care
Unit that day.  His cardiac surgery workup was continued.
The patient suspected of having a right lower lobe pneumonia,
for which he was on azithromycin with sputum culture pending.
His anemia was worked up showing low iron stores and low TIBC
which supported anemia of chronic disease diagnosis, and was
transfused as needed for that with a Hematology consult
deferred.  He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for
hemodynamic management.

On hospital day four, he was transferred to the inpatient
floor for continued management.  A preoperative
echocardiogram documented no mitral regurgitation; whereas a
past echocardiogram in [**2120-12-4**] had shown 2 plus
mitral regurgitation and transesophageal echocardiogram was
performed in the Operating Room to thoroughly evaluate this.

Mr. [**Known lastname 18252**] [**Last Name (Titles) 20354**] to the Operating Room on [**2121-2-26**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with a LIMA to the LAD, a
saphenous vein graft to the OM, and a saphenous vein graft to
the RCA.  He also had a mitral valve repair with a 28-mm
ring.  Please see the Operative Report for further details.
He was unable to wean on his operative evening, and on
postoperative day one was successfully weaned and extubated.
His IV drip medications were also discontinued as tolerated,
and he was started on Natrecor as well as Lasix for diuresis.

On postoperative day three, his milrinone was restarted.  As
well, he was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 27.  On postoperative day three, he
remained hemodynamically stable on milrinone and Natrecor;
increased to maintain his blood pressure for renal perfusion.
The Lasix drip was also continued to maintain urine output.

On postoperative day four, the same medications were
continued.  As well, he was transfused with 1 more unit of
packed red blood cells.  On postoperative day four, a Renal
consultation was also obtained for a rise in creatinine of up
to 2.3 with recommendations for diuretics as needed, but no
aggressive diuresis.  On postoperative day four, he also had
sustained bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation which was
treated with intravenous amiodarone.

On postoperative day six, he was started on Coumadin for
anticoagulation secondary to the atrial fibrillation with a
subsequent jump in his INR to 2.2 the following day.  His
creatinine also dropped down to 2.0 with ongoing evaluation
by the Renal staff.

Over the next several days his intravenous drip medications
were discontinued.  As well, his Coumadin was held for an
elevated INR, and his creatinine remained stable at 2.0.  He
was transferred to the inpatient floor on postoperative day
10 for ongoing recovery and rehabilitation.  He was also
restarted on his Coumadin on postoperative day 11 at only 1
mg with close monitoring of his INR.  A pericardial friction
rub was noted on postoperative day 12; for which he was
started on ibuprofen 800 mg p.o. q.8h.

On postoperative day 13, a recheck of his creatinine showed a
creatinine of 1.6; which was significantly improved.  He was
reevaluated by Physical Therapy, and it was decided that he
needed some additional physical therapy prior to being safe
for discharge home, with dropping of his oxygen saturation to
74 on room air with ambulation.

On postoperative days 14 and 15, he continued on his oral
Coumadin and was seen by Physical Therapy with some
improvement in ambulation, but still requiring oxygen with
ambulation with a decrease oxygen saturation on room air to
84 percent.  On postoperative day 15, it was decided that he
would be better served to be discharged home than to
rehabilitation with agreement by the patient and his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] was thus discharged home with followup by visiting nurses.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  Vital signs revealed
temperature was 98.0, the pulse was 68 (in sinus rhythm), the
blood pressure was 112/50, the respiratory rate was 18,
weight was 76.7 kilograms (with a preoperative weight of
72.7), and his oxygen saturation was 97 percent on room air.
PT was 14.8 with an INR of 1.4.  On physical examination,
neurologically he was alert and oriented; nonfocal.
Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  The sternal incision without drainage or erythema.
The sternum was stable.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  The extremities
were warm with 2 plus edema.  Right and left leg
