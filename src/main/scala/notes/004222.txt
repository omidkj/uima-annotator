None


History of Present Illness:
70 yo F w/h/o CVA, Dementia, HTN, hypothyroidism presented to
OSH from NH for fevers, increasing somnolence, abdominal pain,
N/V x1. Pt was admitted to NWH on [**2126-11-13**] w/initial VS 100.3 BP

IMAGING: [**11-16**] CXR: There are no old films available for
comparison.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is ill-defined
pulmonary vasculature redistribution.  The hemidiaphragms are
poorly visualized suggesting bilateral pleural effusions.  There
is bilateral lower lobe volume loss.  A focal infiltrate cannot
be totally excluded.  Some mildly dilated loops of bowel are
seen in the abdomen. IMPRESSION:
1.  Fluid overload with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular
plethora.
.
[**11-16**] RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  Limited views of the
liver demonstrate no focal or textural abnormalities.  Small
stones and sludge are seen within a nondistended gallbladder.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or adjacent pericholecystic
fluid to indicate acute cholecystitis.  Common bile duct
measures 4 mm and is not dilated.  There is no son[**Name (NI) 493**]
[**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.  No ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis
or calculi. IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  Cholelithiasis and
sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.  No biliary
ductal dilatation.
.
[**11-20**] HEAD CT: 1.  No evidence of acute intracranial pathology,
including no sign of hemorrhage.  Chronic small vessel
infarction as described above. 2.  Bilateral prominence of the
lateral ventricles  out of proportion to the degree of brain
atrophy.  Question is raised of communicating hydrocephalus,
which should be correlated clinically.
.
Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT: 1.  Overall limited examination; however,
no definite evidence of pulmonary embolus to the segmental
level.
2.  Extensive severe pancreatitis with no definite evidence of
pancreatic necrosis.  No comparison exams are available at our
institution limiting assessment for change. Due to extensive
inflammatory changes, the patient is at risk for sequela of
severe pancreatitis including necrosis and vascular
complications.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis with
no definite evidence of pneumonia.
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.   Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF 50-60%)
(The inferior wall appears hypokinetic on some views, but not
all). Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Overall low normal LVEF. Cannot exclude a
regioanl wall motion  abnormality due to technical limitations.



Brief Hospital Course:
.
#. Fevers: Fevers to 103.2 on presentation raised concern for
SIRS vs. biliary sepsis in the setting of pancreatitis and
E-coli UTI, elevated lactate, and leukocytosis. She was
initially treated with meropeneum empirically for biliary
infection possibility. Upon improvement of pancreatitis,
meropenem changed to cipro for pansensitive e. coli UTI on
[**2126-11-9**].=, however, she developed another positive UA on this
regimen and began spiking fevers again, therefore this was
changed to ceftazadime on [**2126-11-22**]. Blood cultures from the OSH
and [**Hospital1 18**] were all negative. A CT chest showed b/l pulm
infiltrates, but no PNA. She defervesced around [**11-24**]. All
antibiotics were stopped around [**11-24**].(Pnemovac and Flu vaccine
given [**11-14**] at OSH)
.
#. Pancreatitis: Most likely due to gall stones noted on abd u/s
at OSH. Surgery was consulted and did not feel that the patient
was a surgical candidate given her multiple other active medical
issues.  She was treated conservatively with IVF, NPO and pain
control.  A post pyloric daubhoff was placed by [**Doctor First Name **] for tube
feeding. A repeat CT showed extensive and severe  pancreatitis,
but no sign of necrosis.  She was started on sips with modified
diet per speech and swallow on [**11-25**] and was tolerating thin
liquids and ground diet on [**11-27**].
.
#. Delta MS/Dementia: Multifactorial in setting of infectious
process, resolved with improvement of acute issues. Baseline MS
per report by patients brother is [**Nam
