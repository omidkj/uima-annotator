Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
84yo M w/ h/o TBI s/p [**2164**]0 yrs ago, presented to OSH after
developing respiratory distress at home. Has no diagnosis of
CHF, but had developed inc DOE and LE edema over last several
days. Per wife's report, went to lie down after dinner and when
he awoke, complained of feeling SOB and unwell. Taken to [**Location (un) 620**]
ER where a nasal intubation was performed. An OG tube was also
placed. An EKG was taken, as was a CXR (pulm edema), but the EKG
was concerning for possible STEMI (with EKG changes that showed
ST elevations in III, [**Location (un) **], VI, as well as ST depressions in I,
II, V2-V6). He was started on a heparin gtt and sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, he was felt to be agitated and was given 2mg
versed and 50mcg of fentanyl.
.
Of note, approx one month ago, pt was at a respite for a week
and was diagnosed w/ CHF. Wife is unclear what happened to cause
this, but stated that pt was not discharged on a diuretic.
.
ROS: Unobtainable as pt is sedated and intubated and wife is not
present.

Imaging:
CXR [**2164-1-14**]: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared with previous study dated yesterday. The
tip of the endotracheal tube is identified slightly above the
thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube courses towards the stomach.
Minimal patchy
atelectasis is seen at the lung bases. The lungs are clear
otherwise without evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart is top
normal in size. There is continued mild tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. The previously identified right upper lobe
opacity has been improving. No pneumothorax is identified.
.
CXR [**2164-1-13**]: 1. Unchanged appearance of right upper lobe opacity.
2. Improved pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2164-1-13**]: Mild pulmonary edema. Right upper lobe opacity,
which could be secondary to summation of structures; however
dedicated PA and lateral views are recommended prior to
discharge to exclude a pulmonary nodule.


Brief Hospital Course:
84yo M w/ presumed hypoxic respiratory failure from worsening
CHF. Etiology of his CHF exacerbation is unclear, but likely
contributors include worsening AS and demand ischemia.
.
# PUMP: On admission, we had no information on Mr. [**Known lastname 21617**] EF
but he had an obvious late peaking systolic murmur best heard at
LUSB and radiating to his carotids bilaterally, as well as gross
peripheral edema. BNP on admission was >2800. He was placed on a
lasix gtt and aggressively diuresed. His BP remained stable,
even slightly hypertensive, so an ACE inhibitor was added for
afterload reduction. An ECHO was performed after the patient was
extubated and showed an EF of >55%, but worsening AS, so he
likely has diastolic failure exacerbated by worsened severe AS.
He is not a surgical candidate for [**Last Name (LF) 1291**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was decided to
medically manage his AS and CHF. His weight was monitored daily
and strict I/Os were kept. By discharge, he was switched over to
once daily ACE-inhibitor and lasix.
.
# ISCHEMIA: His EKG on admission was concerning for diffuse ST
and T wave changes, likely demand-related in setting of his
worsened heart failure. His cardiac enzymes were cycled and
peaked at a max CK of 484, CK MB of 57, and trop of 5.99 on
[**2164-1-13**]. He was admitted on a heparin gtt, but that was stopped
once his labs came back w/ PTT >150 and INR of 5.6. After it was
decided that his enzyme leak was most consistent with demand
ischemia, his aspirin was also discontinued as it was felt that
he was a bleeding risk.
.
# RHYTHM: He was monitored on telemetry while his cardiac
enzymes were cycled. He remained mostly in NSR with occasional
runs of AIVR/NSVT, which was felt to likely be a reperfusion
rhythm. By discharge, his telemetry was normal, with no further
arrhythmias.
.
# COPD/ASTHMA: He had no evidence of a COPD or asthma
exacerbation (no wheezing, no hyperinflation on CXR, no
difficulty w/ ventilation or oxygenation). Mr. [**Known lastname 21617**]
respiratory symptoms appeared to be mostly due to volume
overload from heart failure. After approximately 2-3L had been
removed, he was able to be extubated without any complications.
He was diuresed first with a lasix gtt, then switched to IV,
with a total of >6L removed. He was switched to PO lasix prior
to discharge, with the goal of keeping his I/O even.
.
# DVT: He has a h/o of a DVT in the past, which his wife says is
the reason that he is on coumadin. His INR on admission was
elevated at 5.6 so his coumadin was held. He was given one dose
of PO vitamin K and his INR trended down. He had been on a
heparin gtt on admission for ? NSTEMI, but once in the CCU, it
was felt that his enzyme leak was more likely from demand
ischemia so his anticoagulation was held due to his
supratherapeutic INR. The goal was to hold off on restarting
coumadin until his INR <2.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: Mr. [**Known lastname 21615**] is hypothyroid and is treated with
levothyroxine. His TSH was 3.0 on [**2164-1-13**]. He was continued on
his outpatient dose of levothyroxine.
.
# ANEMIA: Mr. [**Known lastname 21615**] has a history of chronic anemia, but he
has been only mildly anemic here, with a stable Hct in the range
of ~36-38. His anemia is normocytic, with no evidence of Fe
deficiency or B12 deficiency as he has had in past. His Hct was
checked daily to insure that it remained s
