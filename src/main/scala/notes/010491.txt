History of Present Illness:

HPI: 81yom with h/o CMML, CAD, CHF, and known portal
hypertension (Known grade 3 varcies, transferred from [**Last Name (un) 4068**]
where he orginally presented.  Patient reports he was on [**Location (un) 28985**] this week and not compliant with his normally low-Na diet.
He did take all meds as usual.  While on [**Location (un) **] he did not
sleep in his usual hospital bed, and instead had to sleep in a
chair due to increased dyspnea.  He would feel his anginal pain
if he slept laying down.  He developed a progressive worsening
DOE and increased leg girth over past week.  Overnight he went
to OSH due to acute onset of increased dyspnea and [**6-8**] CP.  He
denies angina since arrival at the hospital after he was given
morphine, asp, nitro, lasix 20 IV, metoprolol 5mg x2.
  In the ED he was seen by cards fellow, no ST elevation, felt
to be demand ischemia d/t fall in Hct from 30s-->27.  Baseline
hct in 30s, has dropped over past week.  He denies any melena or
BRBPR or hematemesis, n/v, however, in the ED, he endorsed dark
melanotic stools for one week, and bright red blood in his stool
for several days.  In ED, he was guiac-positive, although he is
on iron.  He also takes coumadin for his hypercoag state.  He
has undergone multiple laser ablations at [**Hospital3 5097**] for his
watermellon stomach.  Reports seeing his doctors recently, with
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] recent change in medications.  Per report, GI aware patient
is here.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave
myocardial infarctions in [**Month (only) 958**], [**Month (only) 547**], and [**2190-6-30**].
The patient has had multiple cardiac interventions. In [**2190-2-28**] the patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and PTCRA of the left anterior descending artery
and first diagonal. Then in [**2190-6-30**] the patient had
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the first
diagonal, and then in [**2190-8-30**] the patient had a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the
posterior descending artery on [**2190-9-3**], and then was
taken back to the catheterization laboratory for recurrent
chest pain on [**9-6**] and had percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty to the first diagonal which had a 90%
lesion. The patient also has a history of congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 50% to 55%.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has had significant
gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. Grade III varices.  The
patient also has gastric ulcers. He also has a "watermelon
stomach." for which he has had 4 laser ablations.
3. Hypercoagulable stable, status post splenic infarct,
multiple pulmonary emboli, cerebrovascular accident and
portal vein thrombosis.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 1.8 to 2.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Hypertension.
8. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29050**] at
[**Hospital3 17310**].
10. Right groin hematoma, status post cardiac
catheterization.
11. Right thigh cellulitis.

Pertinent Results:
[**2194-5-27**] CXR - Interval development of left lower lobe
atelectasis.
Some improvement in the magnitude of bilateral pulmonary
infiltration with significant degree of residual bilateral
pulmonary infiltration still present.
[**2194-5-27**] Renal U/S - No evidence of hydronephrosis. Scarred right
renal parenchyma
[**2194-5-26**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and probably distal
septal/apical hypokinesis (however the apex is not well
visualized). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2194-5-18**], left ventricular systolic function is probably
similar. Mitral regurgitation appears similar to slightly
increased.
[**2194-5-25**] CT Head - No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. No change
since prior CT dated [**2194-5-21**]
[**2194-5-22**] CXR - No significant interval change over the last 24
hours, the patient with marked congestion, probably pulmonary
edema and possible overlying infectious processes
[**2194-5-21**] CT Head - Severely limited exam, secondary to patient
motion. Slight area of increased density within right anterior
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], unlikely represents a hemorrhage or hematoma. No
definite intra or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified
[**2194-5-21**] Abdomenal U/S - Markedly limited exam. Unusual,
incompletely assessed vascular structure in the left abdomen
measuring up to 5.2 cm. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**]
