Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe mitral regurgitation status post minimally invasive
mitral valve repair.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo mitral valve surgery with mitral valve replacement, 27 mm
Biocor tissue valve.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old male who 1 week earlier underwent
mitral valve repair for a flail posterior leaflet and a
myxomatous valve through a right
minithoracotomy minimally invasively. His postoperative TEE at
the time of surgery showed an intact repair with no mitral
regurgitation whatsoever. He was discharged from the hospital 3
days later with no murmur and feeling well. However, on the 5th
postoperative day he presented to an outside hospital
complaining of shortness of breath and found to have a murmur
and echocardiogram showed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. He was admitted urgently to the ICU and TEE that
showed dehiscence of the mitral
annuloplasty band posteriorly. He was brought to the operating
room for mitral valve surgery through a median sternotomy.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
[**2108-1-4**] at 2:20:23 PM      PRELIMINARY
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. PFO is present. Left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Low normal LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mildly dilated RV
cavity. Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Abnormal MVR motion c/w partial
dehiscence. Severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the eccentric MR jet, its
severity may be underestimated (Coanda effect).
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened . There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The annunloplasty ring has
dehisced and has dissociated from the posterior mitral annular
region. Motion of the mitral annulus is abnormal and suggestive
of partial dehiscence. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. There is a bioprosthetic prosthesis in mitral position. Well
seated and stable with good leqaflet excursion. There is no MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] gradient is 17 mm Hg and mean gradient is 11 mm Hg.
(Cardiac Output 6.5 liters/min with epinephrine infusion)
2. LV and RV systolic functions are unchanged.
3. Intact aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo male admitted with shortness of breath and increasing
lower extremity edema.   After TEE showed dehiscence of the
mitral annuloplasty band posteriorly, the patient was taken on
[**2108-1-4**] to the operating room for a redo mitral valve surgery
with mitral valve replacement, 27 mm Biocor tissue valve via
median sternotomy.  See operative note for full details.  He was
transported to the intensive care unit and weaned off of all
vasoactive medications on post operative night.  He was
extubated without incidence on post operative night.  He was
started on beta blockers and they were increased as needed.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.  He was transferred to the floor on post operative day
# 1.  He continued to work with physical therapy for improving
strength and endurance.  He was diuresing well with Lasix twice
a day.  He was tolerating a full po diet, his incisions were
healing well and he was ambulating with assistance on post
operative day 4.  It was felt that he was safe for discharge to
home with VNA services at this time.
