Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**]
Chief Complaint:
Back/Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
(Russian interpreter requested for the AM) 72 M w/ pmh of HTN,
CAD, Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%) CKD, chronic abdominal
pain admitted on [**12-15**] with left sided abdominal pain, that
started acutely 4 hours prior to presentation and associated
with nausea. Patient has been most tender on the left side and
periumbilical region. Denied fevers, chills, new foods, sick
contacts. Different from his chronic abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 85 131/61 19 94% on RA. Exam noted for
tenderness on the left side. CT ABD/Pelvis showed Left sided
nephrolithiasis with mild left renal edema, perinephric
stranding, no other abdominal process. U/A showed blood but no
leukocytosis. Got 16 IV morphine, 8IV Zofran. Urology was
reportedly consulted in ED, though no note in chart or OMR.
.
On the floor the patient continued to have abdominal pain and
nausea only partly relieved by morphine.  Of note, patient has
been getting 125cc/hr of IV fluids for the last 1.5 day, and did
not receive his home lasix dose.
.
Patient was noted to be hypoxic to 85% while on 3L while
sleeping this evening. Exam notable for bilateral crackles. He
complained of some shortness of breath.  He received 40mg IV
lasix x1 with good urine output of 300cc+.  ABG was 7.36/36/72
while on 100% NRB. CXR notable for bilateral pulm edema. Patient
had persistent O2 sats of 85%-90% on 6L nc. He was transferred
to the MICU for relative hypoxia and nursing concern.

.
.
On MICU eval patient complained more of abdominal pain, though
did not feel comfortable with breathing. This was confirmed with
a Russian interpreter. A trial of Bipap at his usual OSA
overnight settings was attempted, with sats still 90%.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:97.8 BP: 152/60 P: 76 R: 18 O2:  95% on Bipap
General: Alert, oriented, tachypnic
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated though body habitus is quite
large, so this is difficult to assess, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Irregularly irregular, no murmurs
Abdomen:  soft, mildly tender to deep palpation over R side,
non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or
guarding, no organomegaly
GU:  foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-12-18**] KUB: prelim read: Gas distended small bowel may
represent ileus vs early/partial obstruction.
.
[**2200-12-17**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: Since the previous chest
radiograph, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
congestion have improved and are now minimal. No new
consolidation, left lower lobe atelectasis also improved with
partial reappearance of the left hemidiaphragm. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged. IMPRESSION: Overall improvement in pleural effusions,
pulmonary vascular congestion and
left lower lobe atelectasis.
.
[**2200-12-16**] Renal US: FINDINGS: Note is made that this is a limited
portable study. The right kidney measures 10.3 cm and the left
kidney measures 12.7 cm. There is a borderline pelvocaliectasis
seen in the left kidney which appears unchanged from the CT of
yesterday. No renal stone can be identified. No hydronephrosis
is seen in the right kidney. IMPRESSION: Mild fullness of the
left kidney, unchanged from the CT of [**2200-12-15**].
.
[**2200-12-15**] CT abd/pelvis without IV contrast: There is bibasilar
subsegmental dependent atelectasis at the lung bases. The heart
is enlarged as before. Coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcification is noted. Evaluation of the abdominal organs is
limited without IV contrast. Within this limitation, the liver
is unremarkable. The common bile duct measures up to 11 mm,
which is unchanged from prior. Gallbladder is not seen. The
pancreas demonstrates mild fatty atrophy. The spleen and adrenal
glands are unremarkable. The opacified stomach and
intra-abdominal loops of bowel are unremarkable. The left kidney
appears slightly edematous compared to the right and there is
mild left perinephric stranding. In addition, there is slight
engorgement of the left renal pelvis. There is a 2.5-mm
radiodensity along the expected course of the left mid ureter
(2:38) which likely represents a ureteral calculus. No other
calculi are identified. There is extensive atherosclerosis of
the abdominal aorta and several branches. A saccular infrarenal
aortic aneurysm is again noted measuring 3.0 (TRV) x 2.9 (AP) x
2.5 (CCN) is not significantly increased from prior when it
measured 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm. No free air or fluid is noted in
the abdomen. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement is noted. The
patient is status post partial gastrectomy with
gastrojejunostomy. The urinary bladder, distal ureters, seminal

vesicles, prostate, sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable.
There is no free fluid or pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy
noted. BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions identified.
IMPRESSION: 1. Left mid ureteral 2.5-mm stone with associated
left perinephric stranding and mild renal edema. 2. No evidence
of mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis or acute aortic
pathology, although evaluation is somewhat limited on this
non-contrast-enhanced CT. 3. No significant change in the
saccular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to
[**2200-2-27**]. 4. Cardiomegaly.
.
[**2200-12-16**] EKG: "Fine" atrial fibrillation with ventricuilar
premature beats. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraventricular
conduction delay with left axis deviation may be due to left
ventricular hypertrophy and left anterior fascicular block. ST-T
wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy,
intraventricular conduction delay and/or possible ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2200-12-14**] no significant change.
