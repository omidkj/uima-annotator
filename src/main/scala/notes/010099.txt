Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
left leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dual chamber pacemaker placement
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to OM1
Left superficial Femoral Artery- posterior tibial bypass


History of Present Illness:
This 70-year-old gentleman with
history of abdominal aortic aneurysm who presents with
noninvasive arterial studies had suggested popliteal artery
disease on the left. The patient underwent an arteriogram on
[**2198-4-24**] that demonstrated left profunda femoris artery
and superficial femoral artery with diffuse disease but
patent. The left below-knee popliteal artery was occluded all
the way to the tibial bifurcation at which point it
reconstituted and gave rise to patent posterior tibial artery
and peroneal. The post tibial artery was patent all the way
to the ankle as was the peroneal which gave rise to smaller
anterior and posterior collateral branches. Given these
findings, it was recommended that the patient have a bypass
around his occlusion in the below-knee popliteal artery on
the left and it was discussed with him that the most
appropriate way to perform this would be with arm vein from
his right upper extremity.

Cardiac catheterization: [**2198-5-5**] -
Coronary Angiography - right dominant
LMCA:  subtotally occluded
LAD:  proximally occluded; distal vessel fills via LIMA
LCX:  diffuse proximal/mid disease; SVG to major OM seen to be
occluded
RCA:  not injected; known severely diffusely diseased
SVG-OM: proximally occluded with acute appearance of thrombus
LIMA-LAD:  normal

SVG-OM - dilated and stented with overlapping 4.5x28 and 5.0x18
Ultra stents with no residual, normal flow.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2198-5-5**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-1-6**],
there is new regional LV systolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 53751**] is a 70 yo man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2192**],
diastolic CHF, severe PVD who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for his
elective fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass. He was taken to the OR and he tolerated
his procedure well. He recovered in the PACU without acute
events and was transferred back to the vascular floor in stable
condition.  However, in the early morning on POD 1 the patient
developed nausea/vomiting, and eventually chest pain and hypoxia
and was found to have a post-operative STEMI & CHF.
.
# Posterior STEMI/CAD: The patient developed ACS from acute
occlusion of SVG graft.  Two Ultra bare metal stents place in
SVG-OM. ECHO with EF 40-45%, with new inferior/lateral akinesis,
no significant valve disease. The patient developed stuttering
CP since cath with no evidence of new ischemia, Imdur increased
from home dose. CPK peaked at 2754 and trended down.  Aspirin
was increased from 162mg daily to 325mg daily and he was started
on Plavix. Omeprazole was changed to ranitidine daily for GERD
[**2-5**] interaction with Plavix.  Pt should have cardiac rehab as
recommended by his outpatient cardiologist.
.
# Acute on chronic Systolic Congestive heart Failure: Currently
seems euvolemic with no O2 requirement, able to lie flat. EF [**Month (only) **]
to 40-45%. Pt has acute renal failure with ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] per pt's
wife, was on Hydralazine TID at home which was restarted prior
to discharge. Furosemide at home dose was restarted at
discharge.
.
# Hypertension - Pt was largely normotensive.  His BP were well
controlled on metoprolol and Imdur.
.
# Sick Sinus syndrome: The patient developed prolonged (5 sec)
symptomatic pauses s/p MI.  EP was consulted and they
recommended that the patient get a pacemaker.  He received a
Metronic Dual chamber pacemaker on [**2198-5-9**] without complication.
Metoprolol was restarted at his previous dose after pacer.  The
patient was advised on routine post pacer activity restrictions.
.
# PVD s/p bypass - [**2198-5-4**] L SFA-PT (R cephalic) Groin intact
with no ecchymosis. Right arm and left leg sutures with no
evidence of infections, drainage or pain. Pt will see Vascular
surgery in the next 2 weeks. Per surgery, no dressing is
necessary and walking is encouraged.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - [**Year/Month/Day **] panel showed LDL 197, TG 152. Pt
has allergies to all statin with myalgias, weakness being
primary side effect. Pt also has been on Wellchol and Niaspan
but has not tol these medicines. Pt was referred to [**Year/Month/Day 2200**] clinic
here.  He is currently tolerating Simvastatin 80 mg and has
agreed to continue this at home for now but will d/c if his
previous myalgia symptoms return. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was updated regarding
this situation.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease - Patient had a mild elevated
in his creatinin to 1.7 s/p cath but quickly improved to
baseline of Cr 1.5.
.
# Obstructive Sl
