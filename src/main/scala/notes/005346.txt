FINGER(S),2+VIEWS RIGHT  [**2143-3-7**] 1:55 PM
FINDINGS: There is soft tissue swelling over the index digit of
the right hand. There is loss of the joint space. There is a
dorsal osteophyte extending from the distal end of the middle
phalanx. aint curvilinear calcification is seen along the volar
aspect of the finger. No well-corticated erosion and no
characteristic gouty tophus is identified to confirm the
presence of gout. The differential diagnosis includes svere OA,
gout, and septic arthritis, and gout.

IMPRESSION: Focused view of the index digit of the right hand
demonstrates loss of joint space , cortical irregularity, dorsal
osteophyte and curvilinear soft tissue calcification. Remainder
of the hand is not available for comparison. Differential
includes sever osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, and gout.

================================
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-3-5**] 10:44 AM
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. Patient is slightly rotated to her left somewhat
limiting exam. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with
increasing bibasilar atelectasis. There may be mild pulmonary
vascular congestion. The heart size is stably enlarged.
Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is atherosclerotic
calcification along the aortic knob. Diffuse osteopenia is
noted.

IMPRESSION:

Possible mild congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of CAD, CHF, CKD presenting with acute
shortness of breath and hypoxia now markedly improved with
diuresis and transient NIPPV.

# Hypoxia: likely acute pulmonary edema in setting of poorly
controlled hypertension or potentially afib with RVR supported
by CXR findings, marked improvement with diuresis and NIPPV. no
sign of pneumonia. taking coumadin for hx of Afib so low prob
for PE. low risk for ACS in absence of chest pain or ischemic
EKG changes. minimally bronchospasmtic and minimal cough so COPD
exacerbation unlikely
- gradual diuresis (lasix 40 mg po bid) initially, changed to
home dose Lasix (alternating 40mg qday with 20 mg qday) after
BUN/Crt rise.
- recommended daily weights as outpatient
- discussed dietary compliance with patient and her family
- continued ACEi, beta-blocker, and nitrates
- hold aspirin given hx of allergy
- home dose bronchodilators
- low salt/heart healthy/DM diet

# right 2nd PIP destructive osteoarthritis -- Evaluated by
rheumatology.  Short prednisone burst prescribed given
contraindication for NSAIDs with renal disease.  She continued
Tylenol.  She and her family were advised the prednisone may
worsen her heart failure and to return to the ED with any
shortness of breath or difficulty.  The rheumatologists advised
tapping her joint, but she declined.

# Chronic kidney disease: Cr near her baseline
- renally dosed meds
- add-on Ca-phos
