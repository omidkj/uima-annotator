intermittent shortness of breath.  He had a positive stress
test and was admitted to the C-Med service for a cardiac
catheterization that showed severe left main disease and RCA
stenosis with a normal ejection fraction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2.  Tonsillectomy
3.  Resection of a pilonidal cyst

ALLERGIES:  REZULIN

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin

coarseness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, totally benign without scars or

EXTREMITIES:  Normal palpable PTs and DPs.  His left leg had

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2157-6-15**].  The patient was started on intravenous steroids
while on the medical service for exacerbation of his
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.
The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with
left internal mammary artery to LAD, saphenous vein graft to
PDA, saphenous vein graft to DM graft on [**2157-6-15**] under
general anesthesia.  Indication was unstable angina.  The
surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7625**].
Postoperatively, he was transferred back to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit where the arterial line,
Swan, Cordis, two ventricular pacing wires and mediastinal
and chest tubes, Foley.  The patient had his vein harvested
from the right lower extremity.  Pulmonology was consulted
postoperatively for recommendations regarding possible future
interventions.  Given his chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, they recommended a brief course of steroids at half
the dose started on medical service for 24 hours, to be
discontinued the next day if he showed successful intubation
had good arterial gases and no pulmonary distress, which he
did and in accordance with this their recommendations were
followed.  He was on albuterol, Atrovent and ipratropium
postoperatively, as well as aggressive chest PT and incentive
spirometry.  He did well and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #1 without any problems.

During the course of his admission, his chest tubes and wires
were discontinued.  His Swan was taken out as well as his
A-line and Cordis prior to his transfer from the Intensive
Care Unit to the floor.  As part of his ...............
study, it was noted that his electrocardiogram had some
changes, most notably some irregular arrhythmia.  For this,
an echocardiogram was done to rule out any possibility of
ischemia or heart dysfunction. The echocardiogram was done
and it showed indeed a preserved systolic left ventricular
function and no acute pathology.  He had good wall motion and
the patient was then discharged on [**2157-6-20**] without incident.
He was sent home on ipratropium and metered dose inhalers 4
puffs [**Hospital1 **], aspirin 325 mg once a day, docusate 100 mg po bid,
Lasix 20 mg po bid for a week as well as potassium chloride
20 milliequivalents [**Hospital1 **] for a week, Lopressor 50 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain,
ibuprofen 600 mg q6h prn for pain, albuterol 2 to 4 puffs
through a metered dose inhaler qid prn pain.  He also was
encouraged to ambulate and his VNA at home would monitor his
wound, as well as assess his cardiopulmonary status, as well
as his home oxygen requirements.

The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] for
surgical issues and his primary medical doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3613**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23019**] for all medical cardiology issues.
