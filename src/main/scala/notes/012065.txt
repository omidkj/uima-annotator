Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 80 year old
male with multiple medical problems including chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of four previous
intubations and respiratory distress / respiratory failure,
status post recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 190**] from [**2130-9-20**] until [**2130-9-26**], for
respiratory distress and pneumonia, history of left lower
extremity cellulitis, history of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in sputum, hypertension, and atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin.  He presented as a transfer from an
extended care facility after the onset of increased lethargy,
decreased oxygen saturation to 60% on room air.

The patient was recently discharged on [**2130-9-26**], after a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with intubation.
He was discharged on nebulizer treatments, Prednisone,
Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and metronidazole for empiric
Clostridium difficile.  He finished antibiotic therapy and
was doing well at rehabilitation until the day prior to
admission.  At that time, the staff noticed increased
erythema and edema of the left lower extremity, resulting in
re-initiation of Vancomycin therapy.

On the day of admission, the patient was noted to have
altered mental status, increased respiratory distress with
respiratory rate 28 to 32, and decreased oxygen saturation to
67 to 76%.  At that time, blood pressure was 78/50;
temperature 97.2; heart rate 110 to 117.  On arrival to the
Emergency Department, the patient was moaning, not alert or
oriented.  Respiratory rate was elevated with blood pressure
50s to 60s systolic, heart rate 110 to 120.  He was intubated
emergently after administration of succinylcholine and
Atomodate.  In the Emergency Department, he also received
Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously; Ceftazidine 1 gram;
Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously.  Electrolytes were repleted
with calcium gluconate 2 grams, magnesium sulfate 4 grams,
and he also received intravenous fluid therapy.

The patient's blood pressure ranged from 50 to 60 systolic in
the Emergency Department for a good ten to twenty minutes;
therefore, a central venous line was placed.  The patient was
started on dopamine pressor therapy.  This resulted in
tachycardia to the 150s and therefore Dopamine was changed to
Levophed.

Blood pressure remained tenuous even after maximum doses of
Levophed and therefore Neo-Synephrine was added.

comfortably, in no acute distress; cachectic in appearance.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Bilateral cataracts.
Pupils minimally reactive.  Neck supple with no masses or
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs with bibasilar crackles.  Scattered
rhonchi, anterior laterally with poor air movement.
Cardiovascular with regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 heart
sounds auscultated.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen
scaphoid, prominent staples, nodular objects underneath his
skin likely from prior Billroth procedure.  Abdomen is
nondistended.  Hypoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities with
left calf with marked erythema, warmth, edema to knee.  Right
leg with chronic venous stasis changes.  Neurologically:
Intubated and sedated.  Moving extremities spontaneously.
Pupils minimally reactive.  Not following commands.  Skin:
Mottled, cyanotic.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission, white blood cell count 7.3,
hematocrit 31.7, MCV 97, total platelets 393.  Coagulation
profile showed PT 27.5, PTT 49.7, INR of 5.0.

Serum chemistry showed sodium of 141, potassium 4.3, chloride
110, bicarbonate 21, BUN 55, creatinine 4.0.  Please note
patient's baseline is 1.5 to 2.0.

Cardiac enzymes shows CK 85, MB fraction not performed.
Troponin T 0.52.

The initial chemistry showed calcium 6.0, phosphorus 6.0,
magnesium 1.0.

Urinalysis showed urine to be [**Location (un) 2452**], cloudy, large blood,
100 protein, moderate leukocyte esterase, nitrites positive.
Zero to two epithelial cells, greater than 50 white blood
cells, moderate bacteria.

Arterial blood gases right after intubation showed pH 7.09,
Carbon dioxide 71, oxygen 87, bicarbonate 23, lactate 1.8.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse right greater than left
parenchymal opacities, not significantly changed from prior
study dated [**2130-9-21**].  Also noted were small bilateral
pleural effusions suggestive of aspiration versus pneumonia
on top of chronic parenchymal scarring.  There was some
question of right upper lobe and right lower lobe collapse.

EKG was irregularly irregular with no regular P waves;
therefore, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in
the 120s, frequent premature ventricular contractions.  There
were no acute ST-T wave changes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service as a transfer from
an extended care facility with increased lethargy, mental
status change, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure
status post intubation in the Emergency Department.  He
required a central venous line placement and multiple
intravenous pressors for hypotension, presumed sepsis and
severe acidemia.

1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  It was fel that the patient's
respiratory failure was most likely seco
