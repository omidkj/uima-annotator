Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
79 year-old long-standing smoker with atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, CHF (EF 40%) presumed non-ischemic, and HTN who
presents with shortness of breath and pedal edema.

She reports the onset of left side chest pain about 3 weeks ago,
located under her lower rib cage, [**8-15**], pleuritic, intermittent,
non radiating. She endorses associated nausea and dry heaves x
2-3 days. Nausea subsided, but intermittent pain continued.
Approximately 2 weeks prior to admission, she also noted
progressive shortness of breath. She reports feeling fatigued
and SOB after walking for only 10 minutes, which was much less
than her baseline. She may have noted onset DOE about a month
prior to admission, but not significant until about 2 weeks ago.
She also reports new bilateral ankle swelling. Denies orthopnea,
PND, or SOB at rest. Symptoms of DOE became progressively worse,
until patient could not wash her dishes w/o feeling SOB. Of
note, recently taken off digoxin in the last month (caused
blurry vision). Today she went to PCP for evaluation who
referred her to the ED for further evaluation.

ROS remarkable for occasional chills at night, no fevers. + dry,
non-productive cough x 2 weeks. No sick contacts/recent travel.
+ 13 lb weight loss over last year. Denies melena/BRBPR. Reports
100% medication compliance and no dietary indiscretion.

In ER, CXR done revealing mild CHF, with possible L pleural
effusion. She was given ASA 325mg, levofloxacin, and lasix 20 mg
IV x 1.

EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with rate 99, old LBBB.

Relevant imaging data:
[**2168-6-29**] LLE U/S: No evidence of DVT in the left lower
extremity.

[**2168-6-29**] CXR (portable): 1. New retrocardiac opacity could
represent atelectasis or possibly early pneumonia. 2. Severe
cardiomegaly with possible small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2168-6-30**] CXR PA/LAT: Cardiomegaly with associated left greater
than right effusions. These findings are nonspecific with
differential considerations in addition to CHF including
pericarditis, pleural information, hypoalbuminemia, or pulmonary
embolism.

[**2168-6-30**] ECHO: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. RA moderately dilated. Small
secundum ASD. LV wall thicknesses and size normal. Severe LV
systolic dysfunction, EF 30-35%. Resting regional WMAs include
HK of the anterior septum and anterior wall along with AK to DK
of the mid to distal anterior septum and anterior wall. RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No AS. Mild AR.
[**3-11**]+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] systolic hypertensioin. Moderate sized
pericardial effusion, circumferential, but layers mainly
posteriorly. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2168-7-5**] Cardiac cath: LMCA normal. 40% mid LAD stenosis. No
flow limiting disease. PCWP 20mm Hg.

[**2168-7-6**] CXR PA/LAT: Stable cardiac silhouette. Small to
moderate left-sided effusion, unchanged, ? loculated
posteriorly. Likely LLL atelectasis, unchaged.

[**2168-7-6**] ECHO: Overall LV systolic function is moderately
depressed. RV systolic function appears depressed. There is a
moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential,
however, there is minimal fluid anterior to the RV. The effusion
is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

[**2168-7-7**] CT TORSO: 1. Moderate pericardial effusion. 2. Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. 3. Cardiomegaly. 4. Hypodense
lesion in the left kidney upper pole is larger and does not
measure simple fluid density. Followup ultrasound is recommended
for further evaluation. 5. Multiple bilateral simple renal
cysts.

CXR [**7-21**]: Unchanged tiny left apical pneumothorax after removal
of chest tube.  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly with near
complete resolution of pulmonary edema.  Improving bibasilar
atelectasis with small right pleural effusion.
.
Cytology: Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
Bx results: Pleura, biopsy (A): A. Pleura with chronic
inflammation, fibrosis and focal mesothelial cell hyperplasia.
B. Unremarkable skeletal muscle.

2. Pericardium, biopsy (B): Pericardium with chronic
inflammation, fibrosis and mesothelial cell hyperplasia with
reactive atypia.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7018**] red stain is pending on specimen 2. Once reviewed, an
addendum will be issued
.
[**7-28**]: CXR: The heart size is markedly enlarged but unchanged.
The aorta is calcified with no evidence of focal dilatation.
The tip of the left chest tube is projecting over the posterior
superior pleural space.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. There is marked decrease in
bilateral pleural effusion, especially on the right.  The lungs
are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
Overview: 79 year-old female long-standing smoker, with HTN,
atrial fibrillation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and RA on MTX,
admitted with DOE, found to have large exudative L pleural
effusion, moderate echo-dense pericardial effusion, and renal
lesion concerning for renal cell carcinoma, transferred to the
ICU with hypotension initially poorly responsive to IVF on the
floor. She spent some time in the ICU and then transitioned to
the floor after which time she underwent VATS and pericardial
window.  Drainage into chest tube increased, patient underwent
pleurodesis and then spent a night in the ICU for respiratory
depression secondary to narcotics overuse.  Following the ICU
stay, her chest tube continued to have increased drainage and
she was in decompensated CHF.  Sh
