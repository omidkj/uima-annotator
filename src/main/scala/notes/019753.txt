History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with a history of ALS, CAD
s/p CABG, CHF (EF of 35 %) who initially presented from home
with acute onset shortness of breath, epigastric pain and arm
pain. Of note the patient was recently admitted to this hospital
between [**2105-2-14**] and [**2105-2-23**] for rectal pain. During that
admission the patient was found to be impacted and also to have
a urinary tract infection.  He was disimpacted and started on
stool softeners.  He received a two week course of ciprofloxacin
for his UTI which was scheduled to end on [**2105-2-27**].  He was also
started on digoxin for better rate control of his atrial
fibrillation and imdur for recurrent chest pain.  The patient
reports that since that admission he was been experiencing cough
and congestion for approximately 8 days.  On this presentation
he complained of acute worsening shortness of breath, epigastric
pain and bilateral arm pain.   The pain was described as dull
and in his epigastrium without radiation.  It was not associated
with movement or eating.  He has had similar pain before but it
has not been persistent.  The arm pain was described as going
down both arms without an aching sensation.  He denied chest
pain, lightheadedness or syncope.  He did report nasal and sinus
congestion and cough since his last discharge. He denied fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting or fatigue.  He was transported here by
EMS who noted that he was rhonchorous and diaphoretic.  His
epigastric pain and dyspnea did not improve with nitroglycerin.

In the ED his vitals were 98.6, 135, 137/86, 26, 100% on NRB. He
received 2mg IV morphine for chest pain. He was given 10mg IV
diltiazem for afib w/ RVR with decrease in HR to 80s-90s. Blood
cultures were drawn and Vanc/Zosyn (for HAP as he has recently
been hospitalized) and IVF were given. The patient had a large
bowel movement in the ED. Labs were notable for lactate of 2.7,
repeat K (first hemolyzed) of 4.7, WBC 10.9 with mild left
shift, INR of 1.4, BNP 1376, troponin 0.04/CK 239 with negative
MB. His O2 supplementation was weaned to face tent. A CXR was
interpreted as CHF. Additionally he was given PR ASA. A RIJ CVL
was placed. CVP readings were [**10-25**]. His SBP dropped to the 70s
while HR was in the 60s-70s and dopamine and levophed were
started. She received a partial dose of 0.5mg IV Dilaudid for
pain control. He received ~2.5L NS while in the ED.  He was
transferred to the MICU for further management.

In the MICU he continued to have shortness of breath as well as
atypical chest pain.  His CXR was consistent with pulmonary
edema nad he recieved lasix for diuresis.  He had a repeat
echocardiogram which showed 3+ mitral regurgatation and he was
started on lisinopril for afterload reduction.  He had a speech
and swallow evaluation which was notable for moderate to severe
dysphagia.  A PEG tube was discussed with the patient who
declined, prefering to take POs despite the aspiration risk.
Goals of care were discussed with the patient and his sister
[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) 227**] his unstable cardiac status, repeated
hospitalizations and dysphagia the decision was made to focus on
comfort measures.  His dyspnea and chest pain improved with
subsequent administration of PRN morphine.  Per this discussion
the patient would still prefer around the clock care in a rehab
setting as opposed to hospice.  He was transferred to the floor
for further management.

Review of systems is difficult to obtain secondary to the
patient's severe dysarthria.  He complains of abdominal pain and
consiptation but does not want any medications.  He denies
dyspnea or chest pain currently.

Past Medical History:
ALS
HTN
chronic systolic CHF (EF 35%-40%)
CAD s/p MI
Afib
Gout, currently inactive
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Resides in Brookside Home. Sister lives with him and assists
with some IADLs. Gets privately-hired HHA as well as VNA twice a
week. Has been seen by palliative care during previous
admissions, but while he wants to focus on comfort, he also
wants to be treated and hospitalized if necessary for acute
illness. Has considered [**Hospital 100**] Rehab although has declined to go
there during last admission in order to minimize spending.
Denies tobacco, EtOH, illicit drug use.

Admission EKG: Probable atrial flutter with rapid ventricular
response. Left ventricular hypertrophy and intraventricular
conduction delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-2-22**]
ventricular response has increased. There is left axis
deviation. No diagnostic interim change.

Imaging:
.
[**3-3**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %) with
inferior and inferolateral akinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-3**] AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Tip of a right IJ central venous catheter
terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is status
post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
The aorta is unfolded. There is unchanged moderate pulmonary
edema. New airspace abnormality within the right upper and right
infrahilar regions is concerning for aspiration or evolving
pneumonia. There are small bilateral effusions, right greater
than left. Left basilar atelectasis wit
