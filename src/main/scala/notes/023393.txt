HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old female
with severe coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2105**]
and redo in [**2123**], with angioplasty in [**4-24**] with patent
stents, SVG to LAD and patent LIMA to ramus, total occlusion
of SVG to RCA.  Also, has history of anemia with negative
colonoscopy and EGD in the past.  Patient presented on
[**2137-2-25**] to [**Hospital3 24768**] complaining of neck and jaw
pain, not resolved with nitroglycerin.  EKG showed
intermittent AV pacing, inferior ST depressions.  CK and
troponin were negative.  Hematocrit was low at 21 percent.
She was given 3 units of packed red blood cells.  INR was
found to be elevated at 5.9.  She is taking Coumadin for
atrial fibrillation.  She was given FFP, given nitroglycerin
this morning with hypotension.  She is now off nitroglycerin
with elevated blood pressure.  Currently pain free.  Patient
denies abdominal pain, did not notice change in her bowel
movements but was found to be guaiac positive at the outside
hospital.  No nausea or vomiting.  She had a recent
catheterization in [**State 108**] for unclear indication.  She was
started on Plavix, and her Coumadin dose was increased.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8 degrees, blood
pressure 106/55, respirations 11, saturating at 100 percent
on 2 liters.  Generally, patient is in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Left pupil round and reactive to light.  Right pupil
non reactive, status post surgery.  Mucous membranes moist.
Uvula midline.  No JVP.  PULMONARY:  Bilateral basilar
crackles.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular with
midsystolic murmur radiating to the neck over the left upper
sternal border.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No
edema.  Pulses, 1 plus dorsalis pedis bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  GI bleed.  Patient presented to [**Location (un) 11790**]
with hematocrit of 21 percent, INR of 5.9, and guaiac-
positive stool.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red
cells, given vitamin K, and 3 units of FFP, started on
pantoprazole.  When she was transferred here, she had a
gastric lavage, which was guaiac negative.  Her EGD was
negative except slight NG-tube trauma.  She had a
colonoscopy, which showed non-bleeding diverticula and grade
1 internal hemorrhoids.  She was felt to likely have a small
bowel AVM with bleeding secondary to elevated INR.  She will
have an outpatient small bowel follow through or capsule
endoscopy, and her Coumadin was held until her small bowel
follow through.

Substernal chest pain.  Patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  This was felt to be likely demand
ischemia secondary to decreased hematocrit.  Her
catheterization reports from [**State 108**] were obtained, and she
had a non-Q-wave MI in [**State 108**] on [**2137-1-13**].  Catheterization
showed essentially unchanged anatomy from prior
catheterization at [**Hospital3 **].  She had an attempted
rotablation of a proximal left circumflex lesion, which was
heavily calcified and rotablation was unsuccessful, and she
was sent home on antianginal therapy and optimal medical
treatment.  She was also noted to have a systolic murmur.
Echocardiogram showed 3 plus TR and ejection fraction of 35
to 40 percent.

Atrial fibrillation.  She was on amiodarone 200 mg orally
every day, which was discontinued on discharge.  She was
continued on digoxin, but her dose was changed from 0.25 mg
every Sunday and Wednesday to 0.125 mg every other day.  She
is status post DDD pacemaker from Mobitz type II.

Diabetes mellitus.  Her metformin was held as an inpatient;
she was continued on Regular Insulin sliding scale.

Hypertension.  Her antihypertensives including Isordil,
Aldactone, and beta-blocker were initially held secondary to
GI bleed.

Hypercholesterolemia.  She was continued on atorvastatin.

Allergy.  After being given ampicillin for GI prophylaxis
with TR, she complained of itchiness of her arms.  She was
noted to have facial erythema and arm erythema.  No tongue
edema.  She was given Benadryl 25 mg intravenously x 1 with
resolution of her symptoms.  [**Hospital **] medical record was
changed to add an allergy to ampicillin.
