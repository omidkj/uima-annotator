Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Iodine; Iodine Containing / Erythromycin Base / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Right-sided weakness and aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
82 year-old right-handed woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation on warfarin, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia,
congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease who
presents to the [**Hospital3 **] emergency room after reportedly
being found by her family at approximately 9:45 am today, with
difficulty speaking and right-sided weakness.

The patient had suffered from a "cold" recently, and was last
seen normal last evening by her husband at 11 pm.  At 7:30 am,
she was seen by family, sleeping in bed.  When her daughter came
to visit at approximately 9:45 am today, the patient was found
downstairs, but was having difficulty "getting words out."  Her
right face was drooped.  She tried to rise to her walker, but
had difficulty grasping it with her right hand.  Emergency
medical services were notified and arrived on the scene at
approximately 10:10 am.  Her vital signs on the scene included a
blood pressure 204/94, pulse 76, respirations 14, oxygen
saturation 98%.  A fingerstick glucose was 246.  Her rhythm
strip suggested atrial fibrillation.  She was seated in a chair,
leaning toward the right.  A right facial droop was noted.  She
was reportedly "A x O x3" but it was observed that it was "very
difficult for the patient to speak."

The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation
and management.  A Neurology consult was emergently called; the
patient was sent for non-contrast CT of the head.  Given unclear
time of onset and inability to speak with family, the decision
was made to proceed with a CTA of the head and neck as well as
CT perfusion in order to determine if she might be a candidate
for
an intervention.  The study was ordered by the emergency room
and I confirmed this order with the stroke fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 78537**].
We decided to proceed in the absence of a BUN and creatinine.
We later learned of her prior history of worsening renal failure
in the setting of iodine contrast media.

Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation on warfarin
-Hypertension
-Diabetes mellitus, non-insulin dependent
-Congestive heart failure
-Chronic kidney disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes,
baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6.  Has had acute renal failure
previously when exposed to contrast dye with iodine.
-Left breast cancer diagnosed 11 years ago, s/p mastectomy and
lymph node removal.  Received Tamoxifen.
-Osteoarthritis
-Right rotator cuff injury
-s/p right hip replacement
-s/p bilateral knee replacements


Social History:
Lives at home with her husband.  Uses a walker.  No history of
smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use.


Family History:
Mother reportedly had transient ischemic attacks.

Physical Exam:
On admission:
Vitals: Temperature was not obtained
BP 162/70   P 75    RR 28    SaO2 95 on nasal cannula
General: elderly woman, intermittently somnolent, breathing with
effort at times
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, dry MM
Neck: no nuchal rigidity, no bruits appreciated
Lungs: rhoncherous breath sounds bilaterally
CV: irregularly irregular rate and rhythm, no MMRG appreciated
Abdomen:  soft, obese, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: no rashes, has scars at knees suggestive of possible prior
knee surgery

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Somnolent but arousable, she is able to offer her first name in
dysarthric, halting speech, but little other speech is produced,
cooperative with exam as able, though she appears to have
difficulty following many of the exam commands, she is able to
show me her left thumb at request.

Cranial Nerves:
Optic disc margins sharp; blinks to threat bilaterally without
field cut detected.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light,
4 to 3 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements intact, no
nystagmus.  Edentulous but appears to have a right UMN pattern
facial droop.  Hearing to conversational volume (follows some
verbal commands).  Palate elevates midline.  Tongue protrudes
midline, no fasciculations.  Does not follow commands to assess
spinal accessory nerve.

Sensorimotor:
Reduced tone in the right arm compared to the left, increased
tone in the lower extremities.  Formal motor examination is
difficult at this time given her somnolence and possible
difficulties with comprehension.  She is able to maintain her
right arm ant-gravity at the deltoid and extended for at least
five seconds.  Her right arm is plegic.  She is able to raise
the
left iliopsoas against gravity with the heel off the bed for
several seconds.  She is able to raise the right iliopsoas just
against gravity, but is unable to raise the heel off the bed.
She grimaces to noxious in the left arm only.  She withdraws the
left foot minimally.  There is no withdrawal on the right side.



Reflexes:
She is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] throughout the right arm, and is
normoreflexic elsewhere, except at the ankles, where reflexes
could not be elicited.  Toes were upgoing bilaterally.

Coordination and gait could not be assessed given somnolence and
weakness.

IMAGING:
CT Head [**2132-2-2**]: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage
or large vascular territory infarction seen. However, if there
is concern for acute infarction, MRI would be recommended for
more sensitive evaluation. 2. Mucosal thickening with layering
air-fluid level in the right maxillary
sinus could represent acute-on-chronic sinusitis. 3. Small
hyperdensity in left frontal region within a sulcus is likely
due to vascular calcification.

CTA Head [**2132-2-2**]: 1. CT head demonstrates subtle [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation loss in the left temporal region
suspicious for an acute infarct. Small vessel disease and brain
atrophy seen. 2. CT perfusion demonstrates evidence of an acute
infarct in the left temporal region. 3. CT angiography of the
neck demonstrates bilateral moderate stenosis in the carotid
bifurcation with calcification. 4. CT angiography of the head
demonstrates abrupt cutoff of the temporal branch of the left
middle cerebral artery suspicious for branch occlusion.
Otherwise, normal CTA of the head.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2132-2-2**]: Acute left temporal infarct. No evidence of
significant
vasogenic edema or blood products. Small vessel disease and
brain atrophy.

TTE [**2132-2-4**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is
