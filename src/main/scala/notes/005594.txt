Date of Birth:  [**2090-10-15**]        Sex:  F

Service:  GYN


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old
female 23 weeks pregnant who was in her usual state of health
until the night of presentation when she noted severe
headache, myalgias and a temperature to 102.0. She presented
to the Emergency Department around 2:00 a.m. where her
temperature was noted to be 102.0. A lumbar puncture was done
which showed no white blood cells. The patient was also
complaining of some mid epigastric pain and occasional
vomiting. Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no
evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones.

On review of systems, the patient denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, upper respiratory infection like
symptoms, urinary symptoms. The patient did have a young
daughter at home who had an upper respiratory infection for a
week.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was about to be discharged
when blood cultures returned four out of four bottles for
Gram positive cocci. The patient was given vancomycin. The
patient then developed respiratory distress with an increased
respiratory rate to the 30s and oxygen saturations down to
the 80s on room air. She was placed on a non-rebreather.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with ST
depressions inferiorly and laterally. Chest x-ray revealed
bilateral patchy opacities. The patient developed worsening
hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient
had many loose bowel movements while in the Emergency Room.
After intubation, the patient developed systolic blood
pressures in the 80s. She was initially started on a Levophed
drip in the Emergency Room. A right central internal jugular
line was place and an SVO2 monitor was initiated. The
patient's SVO2's were in the 50s and dobutamine was started.
Infectious Disease and Obstetrics and Gynecology were
consulted. The patient had normal fetal heart tones when she
first presented to the Emergency Room. After intubation and
her hypotension, fetal heart tones were lost. Per Infectious
Disease, she was given clindamycin and intravenous IG for
concern of toxic shock syndrome. She was given blood products
including six of fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood
cells for an increasing INR and decreasing hematocrit. The
patient was taken to the Operating Room for evacuation of her
uterus. This was performed after stabilization in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.

Two spontaneous vaginal deliveries.

Celiac sprue.

Anemia.

Nasal polyps.

MEDICATIONS:  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin, ibuprofen and cephalosporins.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband in
[**Name (NI) **]. She does not smoke or drink. She recently took a trip
to [**Location (un) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's
temperature was 101.4 with a pulse of 110, blood pressure
142/63. The patient was intubated on assist-controlled 500 x
24, PEEP of 10, 100 percent FIO2.
GENERAL:  She was intubated and bucking the vent.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Endotracheal tube in place.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy and no bruits on the neck.
CHEST:  Poor air exchange and rales.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachycardia with normal S1, S2 and a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur heard at the left lower sternal
border.
ABDOMEN:  The belly was soft, nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  No pedal edema and warm extremities.
SKIN:  Evidence of a petechial rash over abdomen.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was sedated.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an initial white blood cell
count of 8.7 which had normal differential to start and then
developed a significant bandemia up to 15 bands. The
patient's hematocrit was 26.8 which decreased to 24.7. Her
platelets were 409. Chem-7 included a sodium of 138,
potassium 3.1, chloride 113, bicarbonate 12, BUN 9,
creatinine 0.8 and glucose of 87. Calcium was 6.1, magnesium
1.1, albumen 2.2, phos 3.8. The patient's INR went from 2.3
initially to 4.1. Fibrinogen decreased to 112. Initial CK was
76 and 95 with negative MB's and troponin. Initial arterial
blood gas was 7.11, 42 and 113. This improved on mechanical
ventilation to 7.27, 37 and 185. Review of microbiology
revealed four out of four bottles of Gram positive cocci in
pairs and chains. Urine culture was negative. Cerebrospinal
fluid was negative and stool culture was pending at the time.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse patchy opacities consistent with
multifocal pneumonia versus adult respiratory distress
syndrome.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Septic shock/acute respiratory distress syndrome:  The
   patient presented with pneumococcal septicemia requiring
   vasopressors and mechanical ventilation consistent with
   septic shock. MUST protocol was activated and the patient
   had central access placed with an SVO2 monitor. She was
   initially started on Levophed and dobutamine but
   subsequently developed further hypotension requiring
   dopamine and vasopressins, as well as Neo-Synephrine.
   Dobutamine was weaned off. The patient continued to have
   hypoxic respiratory failure and nitric oxide was initiated
   with modest improvement in her respiratory status. She
   then developed worsening oxygenation and an attempt at
   prone ventilation for adult respiratory distress syndrome
   was attempted. This was unsuccessful and the patient was
   placed back in the supine position. She was treated with
   lung protective ventilation strategy of low tidal volumes
   and high respiratory rate. The patient developed shock
   liver with liver function tests rising to the mid
   thousands. The patient was initiated on activated protein
   C and stress-dose steroids. She underwent cardiac
   echocardiogram which revealed depressed right ventricle
   and left ventricle function consistent with septic shock.
   The transthoracic echocardiogram also revealed evidence of
   large right and left pleural effusions.

A right chest tube was placed and drained 2.4 liters of
exudative serosanguinous fluid. Her oxygenation after chest
tube on the right improved markedly and she was able to
achieve reduction of FIO2. The patient had an esophageal
balloon placed to assist in management of her PEEP. The
patient's chest tube / high ventilatory presssures were
complicated by subcutaneous air which was followed on chest x-
ray. The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation
requiring frequent transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, packed
red blood cells and platelets. The patient's white blood cell
count rose to the 60,000s. With fluid management and improvement
in her septic shock, she was able to initially be weaned off of
dopamine, then Neo-Synephrine, then Levophed, and finally off
vasopressin. She had undergone bronchoscopy which just showed
findings consistent with pulmonary edema. She was switched
from initial settings of APRV over to pressure control and
then to pressure support. She tolerated these changes over
the course of [**5-25**] days.

She developed a ventilator associated pneumonia which was
significant for Klebsiella that was pansensitive, as well as
yeast and Hemophilus that was a non-lactamase producing
strain. She was then initially treated with ciprofloxacin and
vancomycin for vent associated pneumonia. This was then
changed to Zosyn and vancomycin. She received penicillin for
approximately seven days for treatment of her pansensitive
pneumococcus. The presumed source was from the lung as her
chest x-ray had suggested outline of an infiltrate. She had
diarrhea and had multiple Clostridium difficile toxins sent
that were negative. Her liver function tests improved as did
her DIC. She did not require any transfusions of blood
products over the three days prior to transfer to the floor.
On [**2125-6-14**], the patient was able to be extubated and was
extubated to nasal cannula. She received nebulizer treatments
to help with reactive airway disease. On the day of transfer
to the floor, she was on Zosyn 2.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. on day
four of ten and vancomycin 1 gm dos
