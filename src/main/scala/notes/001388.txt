Chief Complaint:
Syncope.

History of Present Illness:
86 year old woman with critical AS (valve area < 0.8cm2, mean
gradient 59, peak gradient of 85), parkinson's disease,
orthostatic hypotension previously on droxidopa), who presents
with one episode of syncope last night.  Patient was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 29273**] for dyspnea attributed to
pulmonary edema secondary to critical AS, diastolic CHF, and
mod/severe mitral regurg and/or early pneumonia (lives at senior
housing).  She was started on levofloxacin for a 5 day course,
diuresed with lasix, and her droxidopa was held (due to ?
increased afterload [**2-7**] norepi effects exacerbating CHF).  She
is on no home lasix.  Unfortunately patient is a poor historian.
 On the day of admission, patient went for a ten minute walk and
felt lightheaded and fatigued.  She felt "crummy" but denies
frank lightheadedness or vertigo.  She went to sit on her cough
and lost consciousness per report for 2-3 minutes.  Her eyes
were reported to remain open and she did have urinary
incontinence.  There was no seizure activity or tongue biting.
When she regained consciousness her speech was garbled but is
without any focal deficits.  Denies chest discomfort,
palpitations, cough, fevers, chills, recent travel.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.4 75 150/72 18 100%. Labs notable for
HCT 25 (baseline 25-27), WBC 7, UA without evidence of
infection.  CXR shows improved airation of right lung with small
right pleural effusion, retrocardiac consolidation with left
sided pleural effusion, consistent with infection though final
read is pending.
.
Patient is now breathing comfortably on the floor without acute
complaints.

ECG [**2181-12-28**]: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Complete
right bundle-branch block.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.  Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2181-12-23**] multiple abnormalities as noted
persist without major change.

ECG [**2181-12-31**]: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Compared
to the previous tracing there is no significant change.

ECG [**2182-1-3**]: Sinus rhythm.  RBBB with first degree AV block (PR
252).

ECG [**2182-1-3**] (6 hours after previous): Sinus, RBBB, resolution
of first degree AV block (PR 135).

Chest Radiograph (PA and Lat) [**2181-12-28**]: IMPRESSION: Left lung
base consolidation with associated pleural effusion. Small right
pleural effusion is present with improved aeration of the right
lung.

Chest Radiograph (PA and Lat) [**2181-12-31**]: FINDINGS: As compared to
the previous radiograph, there is moderate improvement, with
larger lung volumes and improved ventilation of the basal lung
areas.

On the right, a plate-like atelectasis along the minor fissure
persists, but the pre-existing medial basal opacity has
substantially decreased in extent and severity.  On the left,
the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is also improved.

The bilateral pleural effusions, better visualized on the
lateral than on the frontal radiograph, are not substantially
changed.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.  No
newly appeared parenchymal opacities.

Echo [**1-3**]:
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Limited study/Focused views. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mean transaortic valvular gradient 30 mmHg.
Moderate to severe posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-12-25**],
the mean transaortic valvular gradient has decreased from 59
mmHg to 30 mmHg status-post aortic valvuloplasty. Given the
limited nature of the current study a comprehensive comparison
of all parameters could not be made.
