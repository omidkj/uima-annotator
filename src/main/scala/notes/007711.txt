[**12-23**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 19F with no significant PMH who presented to the
emergency department with a chief complaint of palpitation for
two hours. She developed a tachycardia which made her heart feel
that her heart was popping out of chest; she also felt that she
the beats were reverberating up to her neck. No LH or dizziness.
She denied any EtOH, cocaine, metamphetamine, ecstasy or other
drug intake. She denied any recent fevers, URI symptoms, rashes,
ill contacts. She has never had any palpitations such as this.
.
In the ED she was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia at a
rate of 200 BPM, during which time her vitals remained stable.
She was given procainamide 1g x2 after which she converted to
normal sinus rhythm.  She was noted to have an elevated temp to
100.2. After the procainamide, her BP dropped slightly to the
mid 70s, but responded to IV fluids.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

None

Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  1.0 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  1.0 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Findings
LV mass along the lateral wall measuring 2.3cm
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

TEE related complications. Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass
study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
2. There is a noted LV mass that measures 2.3 cm in width that
extends from the base to the apex. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%) with noted lateral wall hypokinesis of the mid-
segment.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS:
For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including
levophed and was A paced.
1. In the mitral positon, there is a noted mitral mechanical
prosthesis. The valve is well seated with no mitral
regurgitation. Washing jets are noted. Mean gradient across the
valve is 4mmHg with a cardiac output of 6L/min.
2. Biventricular function is unchanged, LVEF is 65%.
3. The lateral LV wall appears intact, anterolateral papillary
muscle has been resected. No disruption of LV wall noted by
color flow doppler
3. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
4. Flow across the interatrial septum is still seen


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 19 year-old female with no significant past
medical history who presented with new onset ventricular
tachycardia and was found to have a mass on her anterolateral
papillary muscle.
The patient presented to the hospital in Vtach to the 220s,
however she tolerated this well and her SPB remained in the
120s. Her rhythm was broken with a procainamide drip in the ED.
Once VT was broken, there was no evidence of a WPW type bypass
track on EKG. Initially on presentation, the patient's urine
toxicology screen was positive for amphetamines.  The pa
