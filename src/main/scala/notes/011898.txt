History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] is a 66yo M with history of COPD on 2L home O2 and
hypertension who presented to his PCP's office with 12 days of
non-radiating substernal chest pain and worsening shortness of
breath.  He felt this pain may have been his GERD but did not
improve with tums.  At [**Company 191**] (his PCP's office), he was noted to
be look weak and an EKG was concerning for ? new
anterior-lateral changes.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98, 84, 136/88, 18, 96% 2L. On
arrival to ER, EKG was NSR without ST changes, and labs were
significant for trop of 0.31, platelets of 9, leukocytosis to 35
with 88% "other" cell types and hematocrit of 21.  Repeat EKG
was still non-ischemic and cardiology felt his troponins were
not due to active ischemia.  Given his platelets, there were no
plans for intervention.  Heme/onc was consulted to review his
smear given concern for acute leukemia.  Patient was given one
sublingual nitro and started on morphine for pain control.  He
was moving very little air on exam and felt to be having a COPD
exacerbation.  He was given solumedrol, ceftriaxone,
azithromyin, cefepime and albuterol/ipratropium nebs.  Patient
was transferred to the ICU for further management.  At time of
transfer, vitals were 98.7, 93, 150/68, 20, 94% 3L NC.

In the ICU, he endorses having had chest pain for the past
couple weeks that he felt was heartburn and epigrastric pain.
Over this time period, he has also had some generalized weakness
and cough productive of blood tinged sputum.  He feels his
scattered arm bruises are related to tripping and falling a few
days ago.

STUDIES:
NEOPLASTIC BLOOD  Date of [**2148-9-19**]
Karyotype: 47,XY,+8,t(15;17)(q22;q21.1)[2]
Only two metaphase cells were obtained and analyzed from
this specimen. This limited/ incomplete study may not rule
out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an
analysis. Two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome
8 (TRISOMY 8) and a TRANSLOCATION of chromosomes 15 and
17. This translocation is associated with PML-RARA fusion
and is a characteristic finding in acute promyelocytic
(M3) leukemia.
----------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300
CELLS-------------------
nuc ish(PML,RARA)x3(PML con RARAx2)[89/100]
FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed
on nuclei with the LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion
Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22
and RARA at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 89/100 nuclei, which exceeds
the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this
probe in our laboratory. A PML-RARA rearrangement is
found in most acute promyelocytic leukemias (FAB M3).
This test was developed and its performance
determined by the [**Hospital1 18**] Cytogenetics Laboratory
as required by the CLIA '[**25**] regulations. It has not
been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. This test is used for clinical
purposes.

FLOW CYTOMETRY:
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize blast yield.
Abnormal cells comprise 82% of total gated events.
B-cells comprise 6% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens.
T-cells comprise 57% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature
lineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of
1.04 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells
isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated
antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express
CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10
(cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14,
CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute
myeloid leukemia.  Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] promyelocytic
differentiation.  However, correlation with concurrent
cytogenetic findings is recommended for further
characterization.

IMAGING:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2148-9-20**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate to severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the
anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more
hypokinetic than the other walls) (LVEF = 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
