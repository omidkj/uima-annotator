Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of DES x2 in LAD

History of Present Illness:
84 yo h/o HTN, Stage III CKD, c/o 3 weeks of worsening chest
pain. Three weeks prior, the patient was walking in [**Location (un) 21601**]
from 57th Street to 42nd street to attend a play ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 12239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**]).
Approximately [**3-4**] blocks into his walk, he developed sharp chest
pain along the anterior chest in a band like pattern associated
with SOB. Denies diaphoresis, palpitations, N/V,
lightheadedness. He did not stop and rest, but continued to
walk. The pain persisted until he sat down to watch the play. In
the days following, he continued to have pain upon exertion,
occuring shorter distances (approximately 100 feet). Today, the
patient first complained of chest pain driving to [**Location (un) 86**] that
was releived with 1 SL NTG.
 Patient was staying in his vacation home in [**Location (un) 57605**], MA over the
course of three weeks and eventually saw an internist Monday, 5
days prior to admission. An ekg was performed, and patient was
told he had an MI. He was given a prescription for SL NTG and
told to double his aspirin to 162 daily. He was sent for a
nuclear stress test two days prior to admission. This showed
large areas of infarct and smaller areas of peri-infarct
ischemia involving the LAD and RCA. LCx appears relatively
spared. Severely depressed LV systolic function (EF: 35%).
Given these findings, the patient made an appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] today. He was noted to be volume overloaded. He was
then directly admitted for further management of ACS and volume
overload.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he was chest pain free and had no
complaints.
