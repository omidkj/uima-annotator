Admission Date:  [**2124-9-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-10-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2074-4-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery

RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient underwent a radiological trauma
series with a lateral cervical spine, demonstrating no
fracture dislocation from C1 through C6.  The chest x-ray
showed trauma board artifact and mediastinum was widened,
with displacement of the trachea to the right.  There were
irregular opacities present within the left lung field,
concerning for contusion and there was deformity of the left
upper thoracic cage, representing multiple rib fractures.  No
pneumothorax was demonstrated.  The pelvis demonstrated
disruption of the left pelvic rim.  Assessment of the
sacroiliac joints was limited.

Given these findings, the patient was taken to the CT
scanner, where CT scans of the chest and abdomen were
performed.  The CT scan of the chest demonstrated a
descending thoracic aorta strongly suggestive of aortic
transection, bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, multiple rib fractures, predominantly on the left
side, with subcutaneous emphysema and underlying contusion in
the left lung.  There was also an intra-articular fracture
involving the left superior pubic ramus and acetabulum,
associated with hemorrhage along the left pelvic sidewall.  A
CT scan of the head demonstrated a left occipital condyle
fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiothoracic surgery residents were
immediately contact[**Name (NI) **] and came to evaluate the patient.  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course is as follows.

[**Last Name (STitle) 35700**]is patient's life threatening aortic injury, he was
taken immediately to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of
cardiothoracic surgery, where a repair of a thoracic aortic
transection was performed with a 20 mm woven interposition
gel weave graft.  This required left pulmonary vein to right
common femoral artery bypass.  The aorta was crossclamped
immediately proximal to the left subclavian for the repair.
The patient lost approximately five liters worth of blood
during the procedure and received 3,000 cc of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**],
seven liters of crystalloid, two units of fresh frozen plasma
and seven units of platelets.  The crossclamp time was 33
minutes.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, where he was stabilized and a
neurosurgical consult was obtained for the left occipital
condyle fracture that was demonstrated on the CT scan of the
head.  Neurosurgery performed a very limited examination
secondary to the fact that the patient was sedated and
intubated, but recommended continuation of the cervical
collar.  There was also an orthopedic consult requested for
the left sided zone I sacral fracture and extra-articular
anterior common fracture of the acetabulum.  It was
determined that it would also be managed nonoperatively.

The patient subsequently had an extended Intensive Care Unit
stay.  He was in the Intensive Care Unit for 22 days.  He was
moving all four extremities postoperatively and was doing
well until approximately postoperative day number five, when
he developed fevers and an elevated white blood cell count.
His Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by E. coli
pneumonia that was diagnosed by broncho-alveolar lavage.  His
bronco-alveolar lavage grew out E. coli as well as Serratia,
for which the infectious disease service was consulted.  The
patient was placed on vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamicin
initially.  The gentamicin was discontinued and the patient
was placed on ciprofloxacin during his Intensive Care Unit
course.  His antibiotics were subsequently changed again to
Zosyn, ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  He completed a 14 day
course of Zosyn, a 22 day course of ceftriaxone and a 12 day
course of vancomycin for his hospital acquired pneumonia.

The patient required a prolonged period of intubation given
his pneumonia and his left flail chest that was demonstrated
intraoperatively.  He was not extubated until Surgical
Intensive Care Unit [**Unit Number **].  During this period of intubation, he
underwent multiple bronchoscopies.  He required heavy
sedation and would periodically by lightened for evaluation
of his neurological status.  He was able to move all four
extremities throughout his Intensive Care Unit stay.

On [**2124-9-26**], the patient was successfully extubated
and, at this point, the slow process of rehabilitation was
begun.  He did have a postpyloric feeding tube placed and he
was receiving tube feeds during his Intensive Care Unit stay.
He had also been placed on Lovenox as deep vein thrombosis
prophylaxis.

The patient was transferred to the regular floor on [**2124-9-29**], at which point an otolaryngology consult was
obtained because it was noted that, during his aortic
transection repair, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was
removed.  After evaluation by otolaryngology, they
recommended that he undergo video stroboscopy as an
outpatient.  He did undergo a speech and swallow evaluation
as well, which he failed.  For this reason, he underwent a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement by
interventional radiology on [**2124-10-4**].

Orthopedic surgery was following the patient throughout his
course, and their final recommendations were that the patient
could touch down weightbear on the left leg and that he could
undergo full range of motion exercises.

The patient had one to two days of nausea after percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, which resolved.  At
that point, he was tolerating his tube feeds.  His mental
status was much improved.  He was alert and oriented,
conversant, moving all four extremities.  He was clear to
auscultation with an irregular rhythm, tolerating his
physical therapy.  Given these findings, it was felt that he
was stable for discharge.

Summary of the patient's injuries:
1.  Thoracic aortic transection, status post graft
interposition repair.
2.  Left occipital condyle fracture, for which patient would
remain in a cervical collar.
3.  Left recurrent laryngeal nerve transection, for which he
would follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient;
telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41**].
4.  Left pelvic fracture, requiring nonoperative treatment,
for which he should follow up with orthopedic surgery in two
weeks; telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**].
5.  Multiple left rib fractures, for which he would follow up
with trauma surgery; he should call to schedule an
appointment with trauma surgery.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Colace 100 mg pg b.i.d.
Reglan 10 mg i.v./p.o.q.6h.
Lovenox 30 mg s.c.b.i.d.
Nystatin swish and swallow.
Paxil 20 mg pg q.d.
Respalor tube feeds via PEG at 100 cc/hour.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to remain in his
cervical collar until further follow-up with trauma surgery
and neurosurgery.  He was instructed to follow up with
neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology,
cardiothoracic surgery and orthopedic surgery.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Depression.
Status post motor vehicle accident, sustaining a thoracic
