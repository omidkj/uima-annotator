History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 64151**] is a 54 y/o lady with PMH of atrial fibrillation on
chronic coumadin, diastolic dysfunction, and hypertension
originally admitted to the general medical team for chronically
worsening shortness of breath. She has been treated on the
medical floor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response; cardiology was consulted for assistance with
management of her afib with RVR. Over the course of the past few
days, the patient has been on escalating doses of verapamil,
disopyramide, and a low dose beta blocker (see dosing changes
below); the beta blocker is new for her as it had been avoided
in the past due to concerns over reactive airway disease. Today,
the patient received 240 mg verapamil, 200 mg disopyramide, and
12.5 mg lopressor. At about noon, she was nauseated and sat up
to vomit. At that time, she syncopized in the setting of
bradycardia to the 50s. She fell face-forward and struck her
head. Head CT did not reveal any hemorrhage or fracture. EKG
showed bradycardia at 50 bpm with no concerning ST changes. She
remained on the medicine floor until she had worsening
bradycardia to the 30s noted at 1700. At that time, EKG
demonstrated ventricular escape beats with QT > 600 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
during this time was ~ 100 systolic. The patient's mental status
was also noted to be worse than her baseline during this time.
.
She was urgently transferred to the CCU where right femoral line
was placed with temporary pacing wire. A line was placed as
well. Labs drawn on ABG from the floor revealed 7.26/60/63 with
K 7.0. The patient was treated with 2 amps calcium gluconate due
to concern for beta blocker overdose. Treatment for hyperkalemia
was initiated with insulin gtt (blood sugar also > 400).
.
Full review of systems not obtainable due to patient's mental
status on presentation.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest "pressure"
earlier today which has resolved; the pressure was substernal
but patient could not describe further. Has chronic 4-pillow
orthopnea with chronic dyspnea on exertion (recently walked
60-70 feet at clinic visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**]. Patient syncopized
today as per above. Other review of systems not able to obtain
due to patient's mental status.

CXR ([**6-28**]): There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural
effusion. There is engorgement of the vasculature due to
vascular congestion. There is mild increase in right lower lobe
opacity that could represent pneumonia or aspiration.

Head CT [**6-28**]: This study is slightly limited secondary to
patient motion. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
masses, mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in caliber and configuration. No fractures are
identified. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear. Normal study.

EKG [**6-28**]:Probable junctional rhythm with borderline voltage
criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST-T
wave abnormalities. Cannot exclude anterolateral ischemia with T
wave inversions in leads I, aVL and V3-V6. There is also marked
Q-T interval prolongation. Compared to the prior tracing of
[**2176-6-24**] atrial fibrillation has been replaced by junctional
rhythm.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 y/o F with paroxysmal afib (recently with RVR), diastolic
dysfunctoin, and hypertension who presents with ventricular
escape bradycardia with relative hypotension from the floor to
the CCU.
.
# Bradycardia: The patient has been on escalating doses of
antihypertensives/nodal agents over the past few days believed
related to poor medication compliance at home. On day of
transfer to CCU, she received verapamil, disopyramide, and
lopressor. Her presentation could represent tachy-brady syndrome
but likely exaggerated AV block due to increasing doses of
verapamil, beta-blocker.  Initially, temporary pacing wire
placed via the right groin.  All nodal blockers (disopyramide,
verapamil, beta blocker)were held.  Patient was discussed with
EP felt there was no current need for a permanent pacer. Cardiac
enzymes were cycled to rule out myocardial infarction and
thyroid function was normal.  She was monitored on telemetry
with return of NSR which progressed to Afib.  QT-prolonging
agents(ciprofloxacin/reglan)were discontinued.  There were no
further episodes of bradycardia and patient was transferred to
the floor.
.
# AFib w/ RVR: Patient with long-standing history of AFib likely
a result of her underlying OSA.  After episode of bradycardia
and slow restart of nodal agents, she returned to AFib w/ RVR
after brief stay on the floor.  She was transferred back to the
unit and started on Esmolol drip, but the Afib remained
refractory. Metoprolol dose was increased, amiodarone TID began
on [**7-3**], and diltiazem drip required for rate control as the
esmolol was titrated down.  Patient was converted to po
medications with successful rate control of Afib and regimen
simplified to once daily dosing as possible to increase
likelihood of compliance.  She was started on a stable coumadin
dosing and she will need INR monitoring in the [**Company 191**] coumadin
clinic.  She will also need monitoring for
