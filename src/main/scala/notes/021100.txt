Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, altered mental status
admitted to ICU for hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79yo woman with h/o AFib on coumadin, HTN, and
borderline DM who presented with confusion after a fall and was
found to have hyponatremia to 112.

She is amnestic to the events, so history is per review of her
chart.  Apparently, her husband heard a bang and found his wife
on the floor.  She thinks she was unconscious, but this has not
been confirmed.  She had bumped the back of her head.  When she
came to, she was somewhat confused.  Upon arrival of EMS, she
was hypertensive and had a glucose was 121 at the scene.  She
was also noted to have an episode of urinary incontinence en
route to [**Hospital3 **].  All she can remember is feeling
unsteady on her way to the bathroom last night around 2:30 and
then waking up at [**Hospital3 **].

Upon presentation to [**Location (un) **], she was hypertensive to 175/35 and
bradycardic with HR 56.  EKG was felt to be at baseline.  Labs
revealed a Na of 112 and she had a cavitary lesion in her RML on
CXR.  CT of head and C-spine were normal.  She was started on
hypertonic saline, and a PPD was placed on the left forearm.
She was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

In the emergency department, initial VS were 97.6   121/95   56
 16   97% on 2L.  Na was 115.  She received a dose of vancomycin
and was admitted to the MICU for hypertonic saline and further
work-up of her cavitary lesion on CXR.

Upon arrival to the ICU, she is comfortable and asking for
water.

Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION LABS:

STUDIES:
CXR [**1-18**]:  Parenchymal opacity abutting the horizontal fissure
indicating
consolidation or atelectasis in the right upper lobe. Right
perihilar
lucency, which could represent a cavitary lesion.
.
CT Chest [**1-18**]: There is patchy consolidation in the right upper
lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe. There is no
evidence of cavitary lesion.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
small on the right and trace on the left.  Mild linear
atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base. Small
mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, but none meeting CT criteria
for pathologic enlargement. There is no pneumothorax.   There is
atherosclerotic soft plaque in the thoracic aorta. The heart and

great vessels are otherwise unremarkable without pericardial
effusion. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.   This exam is
not optimized for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. Within this
limitation, atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the celiac
origin.  There are nonspecific periportal lymph nodes not
meeting the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. Peripelvic
cysts are noted in the left kidney.
Degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted. There
is no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion. The apparent
abrupt cutoff of an upper lumbar vertebral body on the sagittal
images is due to
misregistration of two concatenated sequences of acquired
images.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe and superior
segment of the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia. No
cavitary lesion identified.
2. Small right and trace left pleural effusion.
3. Atherosclerotic disease as above.
.

OSH Head CT [**1-18**]:  No evidence of hemorrhage.  +Mucosal
thickening in maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses.  No mass
or midline shift.
.
OSH CT C-spine [**1-18**]:  No fracture or subluxation.  Soft tissues
within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
79yo woman with h/o AFib on coumadin admitted after a fall in
the context of hyponatremia.

# Hyponatremia: Patient was admitted to the ICU with a sodium of
112.  DDx includes SIADH in setting dehydration, or medication
side effect (on HCTZ).  Patient appearred hypovolemic on initial
exam.  Per renal consult, the finding of dilute urine made HCTZ
side effect more likely than SIADH, but it is most likely that
she had a mixed picture. Initial sodium deficit of 15mEq, so
hypertonic saline was started at 28cc/hr.  Her sodium persisted
to be 115 despite being at 46cc/hr, so that rate was continued
with plan for correction of 8-12mEq over 24 hours.  Soidum was
checked frequently.  Renal was consulted and agreed with plan.
Na increased to 119 and hypertonic saline was stopped at 6pm on
[**1-18**].  Sodium was 126 on time morning of transfer out of ICU on
[**1-19**].  On the floor, the patient did well. She was initially
still orthostatic and received gentle IV fluids. Her orthostasis
resolved and renal recommended fluid restriction. This, in
combination with salt tablets, resulted in Na of 130 at the time
of discharge. She will need a repeat sodium as an outpt, this is
scheduled for later this week, with follow-up with pcp.

# Pneumonia: While initial x-ray suggested a cavitary lung
lesion, this was not
