Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83F s/p mechanical fall due to tripping on her pocket book which
her walker got caught on. Denies LOC. Admitted to [**Hospital **]

CT Head [**2128-6-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left frontal extraaxial, likely subdural, hematoma,
with mass
effect upon the adjacent sulci, but no midline shift or
herniation.

2. Unchanged intraventricular blood layering in the right
lateral ventricle.

3. Hyperdense opacification of the right maxillary sinus,
consistent with
hemorrhage secondary to incompletely characterized fractures.


Repeat head CT [**2128-6-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Similar size of left frontal extra-axial, likely subdural
hematoma with
mass effect on adjacent sulci. New slight rightward 4 mm midline
shift.
2. Unchanged dimensions of ventricles.
3. Decreased blood in the right lateral ventricle.
4. Unchanged appearance of maxillary sinus blood and complex
fractures as
described in a facial bone CT from outside hospital.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Due to slight differences in
measurement
technique, it is not clear that there is any new shift. There is
no
compressino of the right lateral ventricle. Overall, the
findings do not
suggest left hemispheric mass effect.


MR Cervical spine [**2128-6-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No finding to specifically suggest acute injury;
specifically, there is no evidence of acute ligamentous injury,
with trace fluid-signal, immediately ventral to the upper
cervical vertebrae, of doubtful significance.
2. Unremarkable craniocervical junction and cervical spinal cord
intrinsic
signal.
3. Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative disease with spinal
canal and
neural foraminal narrowing, as detailed above. These findings
are most marked at C4-5, where the ventral cord is flattened, at
C5-C6, where there is central canal and right neural foraminal
narrowing but no cord contact, and at [**Name (NI) **], where degenerative
retrolisthesis and marked ligament flavum thickening result in a
"confined" appearance to the spinal cord without frank
compression.
4. Note that the cervical alignment on the MR examination
appears
significantly different from that on the CT, some of which may
relate to the presence of the immobilization collar, or to
differences in patient
positioning.

However, underlying instability, not related to acute
ligamentous injury,
cannot be excluded, and if this is of clinical concern,
dedicated
flexion/extension radiography should be considered (if
feasible).


Chest single view [**2128-6-11**]

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with subdural
hemorrhage.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
available for comparison.

Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal position, contour and
width are
unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasilar
linear
opacities consistent with areas of atelectasis. Lobulation of
the left
hemidiaphragm is noted, incompletely assessed given the absence
of the lateral view. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax was demonstrated.






Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery and
Plastics were consulted given her injuries. Her SDH/IVH were
managed non operatively; serial head CT scans were followed and
remained stable, her neurologic status was monitored closely in
the Trauma ICU. She was started on Dilantin and will continue
with this for at least 1 month at which time she will follow up
in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic for repeat head T scan. She is awake and
alert, oriented x2-3.

Her orbital fracture was evaluated by Plastic surgery; non
operative management was the initial plan and this was discussed
with patient's daughter by the Plastics team. She will follow up
as an outpatient in [**Hospital 3595**] clinic in the next 2 weeks.

Her home medications were restarted with the exception of her
Zoloft; it was held in order to obtain adequate assessment of
her mental status given the head trauma. Restart of this should
be re-evaluated once at rehab.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after her acute hospital stay.
