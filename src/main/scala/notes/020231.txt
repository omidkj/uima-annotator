Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
ER consult - requested by Neurosurgery for a presumed HTN
hemorrhage, EVD to be placed by neurosurgery


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right external intraventricular drain with intraventricular
adminitration of IV TPA.


History of Present Illness:
65 yo woman with HTN, arthritis, previous lacunar infarcts noted
in [**2157**] (on Plavix), Afib on Coumadin, who lives alone.
Yesterday, she had her neuro urgent care follow-up following her
assessment in the ER by Neurology on [**2-17**] for a right facial
movement difference in the context of chest pain.

According to her daughter [**Name (NI) 19975**], she called her and her sister
[**Name (NI) **] and her husband (whom she does not live with) between [**11-19**]
pm complaining of vomiting. When they went to see her around [**3-23**]
pm, they found her slumped over her bed vomiting. She was
brought to the ER, assessed by neurosurgery (Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] who felt
that an EVD was warranted. She was given Factor IX (3 g), 10 mg
vitamin K, FFP and platelets prior to the placement of the EVD.
The EVD was going to be inserted at the bedside.

ROS:unobtainable.

prior to this she was on ASA, Aggrenox was trialled but she had

NCHCT [**2-23**]: FINDINGS: There is an extensive intraventricular
hemorrhage extending from the left lateral ventricle (series 2,
image 20) into the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (series 2, image 14). Blood is
also seen in the third ventricle, some in the left occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] (series 2, image 15) and in the fourth ventricle (series 2,
image 10). Vasogenic edema is seen proximally to the bleed in
the left parietal lobe. There is no midline shift. No other
acute bleed is seen. There is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
junction differentiation. Ventricles, sulci and cisterns despite
the intraventricular blood are essentially symmetric.  There is
no fracture. Mastoid air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: Large intraventricular hemorrhage.
.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The tip of a left subclavian PICC is
seen in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
effusion. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are
unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal, without evidence
of pulmonary edema. The lungs are grossly normal without
suspicious focal abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Left subclavian PICC with tip in the mid SVC. No
pneumothorax.
.
NCHCT [**3-3**]: FINDINGS: The ventriculostomy catheter is removed in
the interval. Otherwise, the study is minimally changed from
that done 1 day earlier. Again noted is a moderate-sized focus
of intraventricular hemorrhage at the left lateral ventricle
with a second smaller component layering dependently in the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of that left lateral ventricle. There is no new
hemorrhage. There is no vascular territorial infarction, edema,
or mass effect. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear. Sclerotic vascular calcification is noted at
the vertebral arteries bilaterally as well as at the cavernous
segment of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post removal of ventriculostomy catheter with minimal
change.  Intraventricular hemorrhage is persistent and
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo RHW with a history of AF on Coumadin, INR 3.3, HTN who
presented with extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, no
apparent parenchymal involvement.  There was no known trauma
assocated with the hemorrhage.  The etiology of the hemorrhage
was presumed to be d
