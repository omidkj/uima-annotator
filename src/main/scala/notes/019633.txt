Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2137-12-9**] Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 86 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
PCI in [**2132**] with stent to the LAD and RCA, COPD on 2L O2 at
night, hyperlipidemia who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**12-8**] with
N/V/D and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with concern of STEMI. The
patient's symptoms of N/V/D began suddenly the evening prior to
presentation. She reports approximately 10 episodes of
non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting and ten episodes of non-bloody
diarrhea over a 3 hour time period. She had associated shortness
of breath, but no chest pain or palpitaions. She denies any
cough or sputum production, though was undergoing a prednisone
taper that was initiated in late [**Month (only) 359**] for COPD
exacerbation/URI.

Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], the patient's EKG demonstrated
ST elevations in II, III, avF, V4-V6. She was given ASA 325 mg,
zofran X 1, and started on a heparin gtt. Labs were significant
for a lactate 2.5, Trop T 0.038, Cr 1.7. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

At [**Hospital1 18**], cardiac cath revealed mild coronary disease, but no
flow limiting lesions to explain her EKG findings. No
interventions were performed. Re-peat EKG following
catheterization persistence of mild elevations, bu improved from
prior.

On the floor, initial vitals were 98.5 101/49 100 22 100%2L.
Patient reports no current chest pain, SOB or N/V/D. She does
endorse an ongoing cough. She is feeling anxious.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

IMAGING
[**2137-12-9**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
without
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease. The LAD had a
patent
proximal Cypher stent with a small aneurysm at the distal third
of the
stent. The apical LAD had a 20% narrowing. The diagonal branch
has a
50-60% ostial stenosis (site of prior POBA). There was TIMI III
flow
throughout the LAD system. The LCx had a 40% proximal and 50%
distal
(above the bifurcation) stenosis, both unchanged from prior. The
RCA had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis at the take of of the AM, which is
unchanged
from prior. There is a patent distal RCA stent with 40% instent
restenosis at the distal edge. There is TIMI III flow throughout
the RCA
system.
2. Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 55%
with
inferoapical hypokinesis.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension
with central aortic pressure of 97/52 mmHg (Note: outpatient
systolic
pressure is 90-100 normally). There is mild elevation in
left-sided
filling pressure with an LVEDP of 15 mmHg.
4. There was no aortic valve gradient seen on careful pullback
from left
ventricle to aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate multivessel coronary artery disease without
angiographic
flow-limitation to explain ECG findings of STE inferolaterally.
Perhaps
this was secondary to coronary spasm.
2. Preserved left ventricular function with mild inferoapical
hypokinesis.
3. Recommend medical therapy.

[**2137-12-9**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 103. Slight ST segment
elevation in leads II, III, aVF and leads V4-V6. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2132-12-18**] the diffuse T wave inversion in
leads, I, aVL and V1-V5, seen at that time, is no longer present
on the current tracing but there is moderate J point elevation
in the lateral precordial leads. Consider acute myocardial
ischemia.

[**2137-12-9**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity size and free wall motion are grossly normal
