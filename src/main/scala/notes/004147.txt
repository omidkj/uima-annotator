age, jaundiced skin. Patient is lethargic but arousable, answers
questions but need to keep awakening to hold attention. Oriented
to person place and year. Knows why she is here.

Cor: II/VI SEM loudest at apex
ABD: Obese, soft, nt/nd, bs+, live tip palpable just below
costal margin. spleen tip not palpable
EXT: 1+ LE non pitting edema to knees, mild diffuse erythema
likely secondary to venous stasis


Pertinent Results:
[**2-27**] CXR

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-27**] and [**2157-11-10**]:

Moderate cardiomegaly has increased since [**Month (only) 1096**]. Elevation of
the left hemidiaphragm and ipsilateral basal atelectasis are
stable. Increased opacification at the right lung base could be
dependent edema but is concerning for pneumonia, unchanged since
[**59**]:07 a.m. Small right pleural effusion is probably present.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach, which is distended with
air.
--------------------
[**3-3**] CXR

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-27**], the patient has
taken a somewhat better inspiration. Continued fullness of
pulmonary vessels is consistent with overhydration and increased
pulmonary venous pressure. There is increased opacification at
both bases, consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic
change. The nasogastric tube has been removed.
[**3-5**] u/s

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
brachial, and basilic veins was performed. The cephalic vein was
not visualized. In the visualized veins there was normal flow,
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms demonstrated. No
intraluminal thrombus was identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis. Cephalic vein not seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49 y/o F h/o HCV cirrhosis, currently on transplant list,
who presented with unresponsive episode and ? seizure episode 2
days prior in setting of hypoglycemia to 8, found to have RLL
consolidation identified on CXR c/w pneumonia. Currently
patient's mental status back at baseline.
.
# Altered mental status

Long h/o admissions for somnolence secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy although more likely etiology this admission
would be hypoglycemia given documented low blood sugar in
combination with underlying hepatic encephalopathy. Etiology for
hypoglycemia itself not clear given no change in meds, diet,
hepatic function. Possibly related to underlying pneumonia and
adrenal insufficiency. Her mental status was back to baseline at
time of discharge, alert and oriented times three. She is to
continue with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic
encephalopathy.
.

#. DM

Patient was previously on Lantus 36 units. She was placed on
sliding scale to determine her insulin requirements. She had no
hypoglycemic episodes as an inpatient. Her dose of Lantus was 34
units at the time of discharge and her fingersticks were running
between 70-180. Of note she has been on a strict diabetic and
low sodium diet so her Lantus requirements may need to be
increased at her rehab facility. She is on a Humalog insulin
sliding scale.
.

# PNA

RLL consolidation, clinically afebrile without leukocytosis.
Given chronic illness and aspiration risk was treated with
Unasyn and Vancomycin given she came from a chronic care
facility. PICC line placed for full 10 day course. Urine
legionella negative, unable to provide sputum, blood cx NGTD.
She will need to complete 2 more days of antibiotics at rehab.
She should have a follow up CXR in 4 weeks to document
resolution.
.

# Depression and Chronic back pain

Psychiatry consulted to manage her depression related to
component of pain and long wait for her liver transplant. She
was started on venlafaxine. Chronic pain service evaluated her
and continued her oxycodone, started Neurontin 300 mg QHS
increase as tolerated every 5-7 days to 300mg TID. Continued
Lidoderm patches to low back area. PT for core strength and
endurance. Tizanidine for sleep and spasm Start at 1 mg po QHS.
