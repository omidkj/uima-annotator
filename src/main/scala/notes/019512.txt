Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11839**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**2171-7-24**].


History of Present Illness:
84M with stage 4 lung CA s/p 6 cycles carboplatin and pemetrexed
(last treatment 8 weeks ago) p/w dyspnea at rest and b/l LE
edema. He was in Poland for past 6 weeks and per family report
began to accumulate edema and progressive DOE along with
periodic low-grade fevers over past 3 weeks. He was transitioned
from HCTZ to Lasix by a Polish doctor to address these symptoms.
He returned to the USA on Sunday partially due to progression of
these symptoms, and at that time his daughter (a physician)
observed he had signficant dyspnea on minimal exertion (walking
a few feet) and had pitting edema of the ankles. Since Sunday
his symptoms have worsened, with dyspenia at rest and difficulty
catching his breath as well as increased edema to the knees. He
was already scheduled for a surveillance chest CT the day prior
to admission.
The chest CT performed [**2171-7-22**] revealed several new lung nodules
as well as a moderate right pleural effusion. In the oncology
clinic today, he was found to have a respiratory rate in the 40s
with an O2 sat of 91%. His oncologist sent him to the emergency
department for treatment of hypoxia and thoracentesis of the
effusion.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2 82 148/86 32 100% NRB, 89% on
RA. Patient was placed on bipap with improvement in symptoms. On
transfer, VS were: 98.1 70 122/66 35 100 bipap. He complained of
difficulty breathing and non-productive coughing, but denied
chest pain/pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, or
any other pain.
.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on NRB O2.  He had R thoracentesis
with removal of 2 liters of exudative fluid.  Thoracentesis
helped somewhat but still requiring oxygen and still tachypneic,
though significantly improved.  He has been net negative >3.5
liters on his own since admission.Code status was changed to
DNR/DNI in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Past Medical History:
1. Advanced, stage IV, adenocarcinoma (potentially nonsmall cell
lung cancer); EGFR wild-type and ALK non-translocated s/p 6
cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed.
2. Prior prostate cancer - [**2168-11-14**]; [**Doctor Last Name **] 4+3 and 3+3 in
multiple cores, status post prostate radiation in [**Month (only) **]/[**2169-2-12**]
with normalization of PSA (most recent 0.2 on [**2169-12-25**]).
3. Hypertension.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. History of CVAs (TIAs?) in setting of malignancy, on
enoxaparin.
6. Radiation proctitis.

[**2171-7-22**] CT C/A/P: IMPRESSION:
1. Several new nodules in the right lung concerning for
metastatic disease.
2. Mixed response of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with decrease
in size of pretracheal nodes and increase in size of left
paraaortic nodes.
3. Increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
Increased atelectasis in the right lower and middle lobes.
4. Stable appearance of lymphangitic spread in the right lung.
5. No evidence of intra-abdominal metastatic disease.
.
[**2171-7-26**] CTA of chest:1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. S/p right throacentesis with small residual effusion.
3. Extensive right lower and middle lobe consolidation and
interlobular septal thickening progressed since [**7-22**] and
concerning for extensive tumor spread and superimposed PNA
(rather than atelectasis).
4. Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
[**2171-7-24**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. The opacities in the right lower
lung, associated to a mild-to-moderate pleural effusion, are
unchanged in extent. Also unchanged is the borderline size of
the cardiac silhouette as well as the small retrocardiac
atelectasis. There is no evidence of newly occurred parenchymal
opacities. No left pleural effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo man with metastatic NSCLC admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia.
Initially admitted to the ICU. Thoracentesis drained ~2Lve
cytology was positive for malignancy.  Transferred out of the
ICU [**2171-7-25**].  IP used U/S to assess need for Pleurex [**2171-7-26**].
but effusion was very small.Pt remained febrile during hospital
stay, so abx changed from amoxicillin/clavulanate and
azithromycin to ceftriaxone/azithro and then vancomycin and
zosyn.  Family meeting discussed poor prognosis and limited
options for treatment of malignancy.  However, continued
treatment of acute illness was desired by family.  CTA chest
showed no evidence of a PE and a cardiac echo showed no evidence
of heart failure.
.
# Hypoxia: Due to progression of disease with evidence of
lymphangitic spread, pneumonia, and malignant effusion.
Thoracentesis drained ~2L.  Broadened coverage for bacterial
pneumonia with ceftriaxone ([**2171-7-26**]) and azithromycin
([**2171-7-25**])followed by vanco and zosyn, without significant
clinical benefit.CTA negative for PE and cardiac echo without
evidence of heart failure.

# Metastatic NSCLC: Multiple family meetings took place with the
assistance of the palliative service. After ruling out other
possible causes contributing to hypoxia pt was transitioned to
hospice care and discharged  home with hospice services.Pt was
started on low doses of oral morphine to help alleviate symptoms
of sob.
.
# Anemia:  Transfused 2 units pRBC.  Anemia labs consistent with
 anemia of inflammation.
.
# Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis: Reactive, due to infection or
tumor.
.
# Hypercoagulable state: Continued enoxaparin.
.
# HTN: Continued oupatient furosemide.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Discontinued atorvastatin given evidence
transaminitis  and short life expectancy.
.
# BPH: Continued doxazosin.
.
# FEN: Regular diet.
.
# GI PPx: PPI and bowel regimen.
