Physical Exam:
On admission, vital signs were: blood pressure 110/50, pulse 69,
respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 86% on 2L by nasal
cannulae. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was rather sleepy, easily arousable and
answered questions, but his wife provided most of the
information. She reported that her husband had not done well
since his discharge to home. He has had generalized weakness,
lack of appetite, increasing edema, shortness of [**Known lastname 1440**], chills
but no fever, diarrhea or emesis.  Skin was dry with psoriatic
changes of nails.  Sternal wound
moist not well approx at distal pole with yellow eschar- no
drainage- 3cm in length. Neck exam notable for trach scar.
Abdomen was firm and obese with a healed mid-abd incision,
psoriatic lesions, and 2 ventral hernias.  It was soft and
nontender on exam.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with
hard pitting edema from thighs to feet bilaterally.  No
varicosities.  There were early venous stasis changes
bilaterally. Left leg SVG harvest site-open and weeeping-
erythema or purulent drainage.
Pulse exam was as follows:
Femoral      Right: +1  Left: 1+
DP           Right:   Left:
PT           [**Name (NI) 167**]:   Left: pedal pulses not palpable [**3-22**] edema
Radial       Right: 2+  Left: 2+
Carotid Bruit        Right:    Left: no bruits appreciated
The remainder of the exam, including cardiac, neurologic and
respiratory components, was normal.

STUDIES:
[**2145-10-7**]: Knee XR: RIGHT KNEE: Images are somewhat limited due to
underpenetration. There is some prepatellar soft tissue
swelling, which is unchanged. There is persistent spurring of
the superior aspect of the patella. There is a suprapatellar
knee joint effusion. No acute fractures or dislocations are
seen. The joint spaces are relatively preserved. There are
surgical grafts. THE LEFT KNEE: Surgical clips are seen within
the medial soft tissues. Joint spaces are relatively preserved.
There is some minimal spurring of the superior aspect of the
patella as well as prepatellar soft tissue swelling. There is
also a small joint effusion.

[**2145-10-5**]: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**10-4**], there has
been some decrease in the left pleural effusion with residual
atelectasis at the base. No evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2145-10-5**]: CT Chest and Pelvis: 1. Postoperative changes in the
anterior mediastinum, without focal fluid collection. 2.
Moderate simple left pleural effusion with compressive
atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 3. Extensive atherosclerotic
calcification. 4. Diffuse subcutaneous edema consistent with
third spacing.

[**2145-10-4**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-20**] through
[**10-3**].
Large scale opacification of the left lower lobe accompanied by
a least
moderate left pleural effusion may not be due to atelectasis
since there is slight rightward mediastinal shift. Findings are
concerning for infection either in the pleural space or
pericardial mediastinum, and the possibility of left lower lobe
pneumonia needs to be excluded as well. Right lung is grossly
clear. Overall size of the
