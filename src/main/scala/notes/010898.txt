Admission Date:  [**2131-11-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2064-9-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
gentleman who has developed a progressive dysphagia and
underwent a workup by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which included
esophagoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which demonstrated distal
esophageal mass extending from 38 cm to 42 cm and was found
to be a T3 N1 adenocarcinoma utilizing biopsy and
intraoperative ultrasound.

A staging chest computed tomography scan, head computed
tomography scan, and bone computed tomography scan were
negative for metastatic disease.

On [**2131-8-17**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30652**] performed a mini-laparotomy
with placement of a jejunostomy tube and a Port-A-Cath.  He
subsequently underwent neuroadjuvant chemoembolization by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 3274**] by Thoracic Oncology and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 44287**]
of Radiology/Oncology.

He has done well from this, having complained therapy and now
presents for his esophagectomy.  A repeat chest computed
tomography scan demonstrated no progression of the disease.
He is doing well status post therapy, having lost a
significant amount of weight from therapy.  He has regained
some of his weight and is currently about 180 pounds.  He has
no other symptoms.  He denies neurological or musculoskeletal
complaints.  All other systems reviewed were negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was a
well-developed male with appropriate weight.  He was not
cachectic.  He was in no apparent distress.  He seemed
comfortable.  Vital signs were within normal limits.  His
sclerae were anicteric.  His neck revealed no supraclavicular
or cervical adenopathy.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation. The heart was regular.  The abdomen was with no
masses.  Thorax demonstrated no asymmetry or masses.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Vascular examination revealed 2+ pulses throughout and
without bruits. Neurologically, he was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2131-11-12**] on the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.

On [**2131-11-13**], the patient was brought to the operating
room, at which time an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy was
performed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and
postoperatively was sent to the Surgical floor to recuperate.

His postoperative course was without complications.  The
patient had a good amount of gastric losses from the
nasogastric tube and was started on tube feeds on
postoperative day two.  The patient's chest tubes put out a
good amount of serosanguineous material up until
postoperative day six, at which time they were discontinued.

During the postoperative course, the patient's heart rate
climbed into the 130s to 140s, at which time he was started
on Lopressor.  Because of the patient's extensive history of
emphysema, the Lopressor was discontinued and replaced with
diltiazem at 360 mg once per day, for which the patient's
heart rate came down to the 100s.

Subsequent chest x-rays each day throughout the patient's
early postoperative course were consistent with normal
postoperative changes without dilatation of the gastric
component of the esophageal reconstruction.

On postoperative day eight, secondary to complaints of the
patient's shortness of breath as well as the resurgence of
the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was performed in order to rule
out pulmonary embolism.  The results of the test were low
probability for pulmonary embolism.  At that time, the
patient's theophylline was restarted; it had been held
previously secondary to his tachycardia to prevent ectopy.
In addition, the chest x-ray that was done at the time of the
complaints of shortness of breath were consistent with a
significant left pleural effusion.  The patient was taken to
Interventional Radiology, at which time the effusion was
tapped for a total of 1400 cc of pleural fluid.  The patient
was started Levaquin to cover for pneumonia.

By postoperative eleven, the patient was doing quite well and
was subsequently discharged.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course, a Cardiology consultation was obtained for his
tachycardia as well, and they recommended the course of
diltiazem, and if his tachycardia was refractory to diltiazem
to start the patient on Lopressor; which was not necessary,
as the patient responded nicely to diltiazem.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  T3 N1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.
2.  Status post [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy on [**2131-11-13**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30652**] in two weeks in the
office.
2.  The patient was to see his primary care physician in one
week.
