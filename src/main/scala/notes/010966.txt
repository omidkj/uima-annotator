History of Present Illness:
This 69 year old white  male has a history of progressive
exercise intolerance over the summer, culminating in the onset
of a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion the week prior to
admisssion. While vacationing in the south he noted the dyspnea
while golfing.  He returned home because of this and went to
[**Hospital **] hospital and was found in heart failure.  He was
transferred here for an ICU bed on Lasix.  He ruled out for a
myocardial infaction and was diuresed with improvement of
symptoms. Echocardiography revealed a flail posterior mitral
leaflet.

Catheterization was done which revealed no obstructive coronary
disease. Right sided pressures were 44/10/18 in the RV, RA mean
13 and PA 49/24/37. There was biventricular diastloic
dysfunction.  Ech cardiography had shown the LVEF to be 55%.

He was referrred for valve surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he continued diuresis and improved
symptomatically. Cardiac surgical evaluation was completed.
Carotid ultrasound revealed 40-59% [**Doctor First Name 3098**] and 60-69% [**Country **] lesions
as seen on recent outpatient exam according to the patient.
Cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed mild
pulmonary hypertension and no obstructive coronary disease.  He
was prepared for surgery.

On [**10-26**] he went to the operating room where attempts to
repair the flail leaflet were unsuccessful.  A mitral valve
replacement was done with a 29mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic porcine valve.
(See operative note for details.)  He weaned from bypass on
phenylephrine and propofol, in sinus rhythm. Vancomycin was
given perioperatively due to his inhouse status.

He weaned from pressors and the ventilator easily.  CTs were
removed as were pacing wires according to protocol.  He was
transferred to the floor and beta blockade and diuretics were
begun.  He had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation after
transfer, which responded to Amiodarone with restoration of
sinus rhythm.

While he was at his preoperative weight at discharge, he was
admitted in failure and positive fluid balance. He as well has
bilateral pleural effusions on CXR. These, coupled with his
pitting peripheral edema, led to the decision to discharge him
home on diuretics.  He will continue Coumadin for now, given his
episode of atrial fibrillation.  This can be discontinued in the
future if sinus rhythm persists.

Arrangements have been made for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5435**] to control his
anticoagulation, with a target INR of [**2-5**].5. Medications  and
instructions were discussed with him and his wife prior to
discharge.  Home Oxygen has been arranged also as he desaturates
still with exertion.  This also should wean as he diuresis.

He is to receive 5 mg of Coumadin today and 5 mg [**11-1**], with an
INR to be checked on [**11-2**] and check with his doctor for
instructions.
