Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain --> NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath
Pacemaker placement
Pericardiocentesis and drain placement/removal
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
s/p left SFA thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, right
fasciotomy
Right femoral line

Right radial A-line


History of Present Illness:
78F h/o PAF (not on coumadin due to fall risk), O2- and
steroid-dependent COPD transferred for cardiac catheterization
for treatment of NSTEMI. Presented to OSH on [**7-20**] with chest
pain rated [**11-19**], sharp, non-radiating, and constant in nature.
The patient was found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's
and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned
to PO dilt and digoxin. Initial troponin in the ED was 0.16, BNP
1080. While on the floor, troponin rose to 19.32 -> 112.2 ->
116.6 while on the floor (CK 1113 -> 2417 -> 2165, CK-MB 255 ->
392 -> 264). The patient was started on a Heparin gtt, Aspirin,
and the patient received a plavix load of 600mg for her NSTEMI.
Chest pain resolved and prior to transfer for cardiac cath, the
patient was chest pain-free, V/S 98.5, 107/64, 60-70s, 18,
94%2L.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

[**7-21**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was very short. The
proximal LAD
had a 99% stenosis. The RCA and LCX were free of
angiographically
apparent disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic blood pressure and
high LV
filling pressure.
3. Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of the ostial LAD stenosis was
performed.
(See PTCA comments.)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Unsuccessful PCI attempt of the ostial LAD.

[**7-22**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**7-25**] TTE
There is normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a very small, echodense inferolateral pericardial
effusion c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-25**],
the inferolateral effusion is identified (prior study only had
subcostal views and this may not reflect a true change).
Serial evaluation is suggested.

[**7-27**] TTE
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-26**], the
pericardial findings are similar. The LVEF may be slightly
improved.
