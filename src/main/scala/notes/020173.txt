Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
71 year-old male with RA recently started on MTX, HTN, IDDM,
COPD, admitted to CCU after found to have new afib with RVR and
pericardial effusion.
.
Patient went to PCP on day of admission with fatigue, vague
symptoms (belching, substernal discomfort relieved by rubbing
epigastrum and Tums) for several weeks, without chest pain,
pleuritic pain, dyspnea, palpitations, PND, orthopnea. He
reported lower extremity edema which has been present for 2
years. Fatigue was characterized by decreased exercise
tolerance; whereas he could previously climb 20 stairs without
problem, he now had to stop after 10 stairs. He attributed all
symptoms to methotrexate which he started two weeks prior. He
also denied fever, chills, cough, diarrhea, dysuria, or sick
contacts. ECG in office in new afib with rate of 120-130s and
low voltage with stable BP. Sent to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED, CTA negative
for PE or dissection but significant for pericardial effusion
with ?RV collapse on bedside ECHO. Given IVF and started briefly
dopamine for SBP 70s, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation and care.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 98.0, HR 98, 167/100, 19, 100%
on 2L. Patient was off dopamine prior to admission at our ED
with SBP 130-140s. Pulsus of 15-18, exam significant for distant
heart sounds but no rub. ECG with low voltage. Bedside ECHO by
cardiology fellow showed moderate concentric effusion, with some
RA invagination but no RV collapse or septal bowing. Patient
admitted to CCU for monitoring overnight, plan for pericardial
tap in AM.
.
On transfer from ED, vitals were HR 99, 111/86, 24, 97% on 2L.
Patient reports feeling well. Denies SOB, chest discomfort at
this time. Asking to eat.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2102-5-25**]):  Sinus rhythm. Low voltage. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

TTE ([**2102-5-25**]):  Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 50-60%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. No right ventricular diastolic collapse
is seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination
consistent elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt
tamponade. IMPRESSION: Small to moderate circumfirential
pericardial effusion. No overt tamponade.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2102-5-26**]):

EKG ([**2102-5-26**]):  Probable atrial flutter with variable but
predeominantly 2:1 block versus atrial fibrillation. Since the
previous tracing the atrial tachy-arrhythmia is new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

TTE ([**2102-5-26**]):  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). RV with normal free wall contractility. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2102-5-25**], the pericardial effusion is now smaller.

CXR 1V ([**2102-5-27**]):  Catheter placement as described. Fiding
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis on the left. A
retrocardiac infiltrate cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year-old male with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis,
recently started on methotrexate, hypertension,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and COPD with new diagnosis
atrial fibrillation and pericardial effusion. Hospital course
was as follows.

1. Pericardial effusion:  On presentation, patient displayed
signs of early cardiac tamponade with RA bowing without RV
dysfunction on TTE. He was tachycardic, normotensive, and with a
pulsus of 16. JVD was difficult to assess given body habitus.
EKG was with low voltage and without electrical alernans.
Although elevated pulsus and low voltage on EKG can be
concerning for tamponade, both can also be seen in COPD. Patient
was taken for pericardiocentesis with drain placement on
[**2102-5-25**]. Right heart catheterization revealed equalization of
pressures: RA 26, RVEDP 26, and PCPWP 28. Approximately 300cc of
serous fluid was removed. Drain was removed after 24 hours.
Given exudate with low glucose, effusion was thought to be
secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatology was consulted,
and recommended holding methotrexate and increasing prednisone
to 30mg PO daily. Pericardial cultures remained no growth to
date on discharge. Cytology is pending at time of discharge.
Pt needs to have a repeat ECHO in approx 1 month.

2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Newly diagnosed atrial
fibrillation at PCP's office on day of admission. Was in RVR
with rate in 120-130s. CHADS2 score is 3 (hypertension, age,
DMII). Patient was in and out of atrial fibrillation during
hospital course. He initially was responsive to metoprolol for
rate control. During one episode he required metoprolol, a
diltiazem gtt, and a amiodarone gtt. Diltiazem, and amiodarone
were stopped following removal of drain and patient was
restarted on verapamil per home regimen for rate control with
low dose metoprolol. He was also started on coumadin 5mg PO
daily for anticoagulation. Will be followed in [**Hospital 3052**] at [**Location (un) 620**].

3. Hypertension:  Blood pressure well-controlled throughout
hospital course. Home medications include verapamil, Benicar,
and Maxide. Patient was restarted on verapamil. Benicar and
Maxide were restarted on discharge.

4. Dyslipidemia:  Continued statin per home regimen.

5. Rheumatoid arthrtitis:  Seropositive. Recently diagnosed. On
methotrexate, prednisone, and acetaminophen at home. Per
rheumatology recs, sent [**Doctor First Name **], SSA, SSB, RNP, Sm, anti-CCP, SPEP
to confirmed diagnosis and rule out other potential diagnoses
such as Sjogren's and SLE. As above
