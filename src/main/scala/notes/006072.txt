Allergies:
Captopril / Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V, abdominal pain ,shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 58 yo woman s/p pancreas/kidney transplant ([**2159**]), CAD,
hypercholesterolemia, HOCOM p/w chest and abd pain. Patient
reports that 2 weeks ago she developed an upper respiratory
infection with a cough, runny nose and shortness of breath.
Cough was production with one episode of blood tinged sputum.
She noted increasing shortness of breath 4 days ago. Two days
ago she developed N/V (4 episodes of vomiting at home), as well
as abd pain and intermittent sub sternal chest pain. The chest
pain is poorly characterized, sometimes worse with eating and
deep inspiration, non-radiating. She also notes that she has had
dysuria x 1 week, and ? of urinary frequency.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt [**Name (NI) 20851**]. Labs notable for elevated [**Doctor First Name **] 190, elevated lip
374, bicarb 6, AG 16 (gap and non-gap acidosis), BUN/Cr 54/1.7
(baseline cr 1.0-1.1), K 5.5, WBC 10 (baseline 5), Hct elevated
at 41.9 (baseline 28-32). Lactate nl. CXR fairly unchanged.
Transplant surgery consulted in ED -> no current surgical
issues. Renal fellow notified -> recommended IV bicarb and will
see in AM. In [**Name (NI) **], pt given 2500cc NS, SL nitro x 1 (no relief of
CP), lopressor 5mg IV x 1, morphine 2mg IV x 1, maalox 30mL x 1,
kayexalate 15mg x 1.
.
On arrival to floor vitals were as follows: T 97.4, BP 106/54,
HR 85, RR 28, O2 98% 4L NC. Admitting resident noted that
patient was increasingly tachypneic. Her repeat labs again
demonstrated a bicarb of 7. No bicarb had been given in the ED.
An ABG on the floor was: 7.20/19/156. Given her increased
respiratory rate and concern for her metabolic derangements, she
was transferred to the unit for further monitoring.
.
At present, she feels that her shortness of breath is slightly
improved. She is denying chest pain, abdominal pain, pain over
renal or pancreatic graft or nausea. She denies diarrhea - has
not moved her bowels in several days. No BRBPR.

Imaging:
RUQ Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal gallbladder and no biliary ductal dilatation.
2. Small subcentimeter hepatic parenchymal calcification is of
doubtful significance and may represent a calcified granuloma or
other remote insult.
.
Renal Transplant US:
IMPRESSION: Doppler flow demonstrated within the transplanted
pancreas and kidneys, with mildly elevated resistive indices as
described. No evidence of abnormal fluid collections adjacent to
the transplanted organs. No evidence of hydronephrosis within
the transplanted kidney. Transplanted pancreas appears of
homogeneous echotexture.
.
Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Diffuse sinus disease.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A left-to-right shunt across
the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial
septal defect is present. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Impression: secundum atrial septal defect; no resting outflow
tract gradient is present at this time
.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver is diffusely
hypodense consistent with fatty infiltration. The spleen
contains areas of calcifications. This is of indeterminate
significance. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. Both kidneys
are atrophic. Loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
Fatty replacement of the patient native pancreas is noted. The
gallbladder has normal appearance with no stones. Extensive
vascular calcification is noted within the aorta and its major
branches. Shotty mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are
noted. No free air or fluid is seen within the abdomen.

CT OF PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The transplanted kidney is
visualized in left lower quadrant. Few small areas of low
attenuation are visualized in the transplanted kidney likely
representing simple cysts. Transplanted pancreas is visualized
in the right lower quadrant. No fatty stranding is seen
surrounding the transplanted pancreas to suggest pancreatitis.
The urinary bladder, distal ureters, and pelvic loops of small
and large bowel are unremarkable. Vascular calcification is
noted.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pancreatiti
