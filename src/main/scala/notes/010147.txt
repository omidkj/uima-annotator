Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CAD, A fib, HTN, CHF s/p recent hospitalization
[**Date range (1) 103736**] involving MICU stay for hypoxia attributed to
underlying interstitial lung disease with overlying pulmonary
edema now admitted for hypoxia. Pt currently at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab -
reportedly received ativan 1mg and ambien for agitation and
became more confused than at baseline and fell.
.
During previous admission [**Date range (1) 103736**] pt was diagnosed with
allergic rash thought [**2-22**] requip as well as hypoxia thought [**2-22**]
underlying interstitial lung disease with overlying pulm edema.
She was aggressively diuresed in the MICU for O2 sats in the
70's on 5L NC with a lasix gtt and nitro gtt. CT scan chest
showed diffuse interstitial changes c/w pneumonitis as well.
Seen by pulmonary consult who rec swallow eval (no overt
aspirations when eating slowly), ANCA (negative), diuresis, and
attempt at slower prednisone taper. Patient was doing better at
time of discharge needing only 1L NC.
.
In the ED CXR was c/w worsening pulm edema vs. infection. O2
sats were initially 70% on RA, 85% on NRB, and 95% on CPAP. She
was treated with 40mg IV lasix and put out approx 300 cc urine.
Was also given solumedrol 125mg IV, Ceftazidime 1gm IV,
Vancomycin 1gm IV, and Morphine 1mg IV.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p PTCA [**Month/Day (2) **] to LCX, RCA, PDA (last cath [**8-20**])
2. Afib with pacemaker 2 yrs ago for tachy-brady syndrome
3. HTN
4. CRI, baseline Cr 1.3 (as of [**2130**])
5. Anemia
6. GERD
7. Bladder spasms
8. s/p appy
9. s/p TKR [**2128**]
10. Chronic low back pain from "ruptured disc" 30 yrs ago
11. Breast Ca, [**2126**], T1N0M0, LN neg, ER pos, Her2/Neu neg, on
Arimidex
12. Hiatal hernia
13. RLS: s/p allergic reaction to Requip.
14. CHF: EF >55% in [**3-26**].


Social History:
Pt used to live at home w/ health aide, worked in antique store,
no tobacco/alcohol use, no IVDA, used to perform most ADLs
independently at home. s/p last admission she has been at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab

Family History:
mother died of CVA


Physical Exam:
Vital signs: 95.8, 92, 158/89, 36, 94% on CPAP+PS 10/5, TV 537,
FIO2 100.
Gen: agitated, heavy abdominal breathing.
HEENT: unable to examine due to CPAP mask.
Neck: supple, no LAD.
Chest: coarse breath sounds throughout with crackles
bilaterally.
CVS: irregularly irregular, no m/r/g
Abd: soft, slightly protruberant, +tympanic, NABS, NT, ND, using
muscles heavily with breathing. many ecchymoses from heparin
injections.
Extrem: no c/c/e.
Neuro: moving all extremities well, not cooperating with exam.


Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2132-4-8**]: Extremely limited study due to patient
condition and motion. No gross hemorrhage or mass effect
identified
.
CXR [**2132-4-8**]: Marked progression of the interstitial opacities
and peripheral alveolar opacities in both lungs, worrisome for
worsening of pulmonary edema. Diffuse infection is another
possibility if the patient has fever. Worsening of the
underlying interstitial lung disease such as AIP can also
manifest this appearance, so as pulmonary hemorrhage if the
patient has hemoptysis. Enlarged right hilar contour, which can
represent hilar lymphadenopathy in addition to known enlarged
pulmonary artery.
.
Echo [**2132-3-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial
septum is mildly aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**2132-4-8**]: AFib at 95, RBBB (old), demand atrial pacing. no
ST/T changes comp to prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o interstitial lung disease, CHF admitted with
severe hypoxia:
.
# Hypoxia: this presentation similar to previous admission which
was felt to be a combination of underlying interstitial lung
disease with overlying pulmonary edema. On admission had
increase in WBC with left shift, slightly hypothermic,
concerning for infection. BNP 15,525. Was initially on BiPAP for
approx 8 hours and was diuresed aggressively with lasix gtt. She
initially responded and was being weaned to lower amounts of
oxygen for a few days. She was initially treated with IV
solumedrol given poor clinical picture on presentation but then
switched to PO steroids given unclear of utility. She was
initially given cefepime and vanc for broad coverage given
severe hypoxia but once diuresed she improved so drastically so
changed coverage to levoflox. She seemed to improve for a few
days, but then even despite negative I/O's each day
(autodiuresis) she began to have more difficulty with
oxygenation. She was put back on Bipap with transient
improvements but then her mental status began to decline.
Oxygenation and overall respiratory status continued to worsen
and this was felt possibly secondary to her underlying
interstitial lung disease (which was never very well
understood). Her family and HCP were [**Name (NI) 653**] and confirmed the
pt was DNR/DNI. She was made CMO and passed away several hours
later.
