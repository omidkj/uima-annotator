Chief Complaint:
Afib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-3-7**] - Bilateral nephrostomy tube replacement


History of Present Illness:
68M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer c/b obstructive
uropathy requiring nephrostomy tube placement ([**11-29**]) who was
sent to the ED today after developing anxiety, tachycardia, and
AMS in the setting of chemotherapy. The pt presented to [**Hospital Ward Name 23**]
9 today for round 2 of Taxotere chemotherapy. Of note, initial
round of chemo given at 110mg, while second round (today) given
140mg dose. At the time the pt denied fever, chills, night
sweats, n/v, mucositis, constipation/diarrhea, rash, edema. He
did endorse SOB, DOE, chronic fatigue at that time. At the
completion of Taxotere infusion, the pt began to complain of
severe sudden anxiety and pruritis. The pt was started on NS IV
to gravity and given Lorazepam 0.5mg IVP and Benadryl 50mg IVP
x1 with resolution of symptoms. 30 minutes later the patient
again began to c/o anxiety and became agitated. He was then
given Ativan 1mg IVP x1, Pepcid 20mg IV & Decadron 10mg IV (in
addition to the Decadron 10mg he received for premedication).
The pt then became hypertensive, bradycardic, and O2sat dropped
to @ 88% on room air. A "code blue" was called. The pt was found
to have HR 148 BP 138/81 FSG 149 satting 100% NRB. He was
transferred to the ED by EMS.

In the ED inital vitals were, 97.6 156 24 135/108 100%nrb. He
was noted to be combative with staff with intermittent
confusion, responsive to painful stimuli and opened eyes
spontaneously. Haldol 2.5mg IV x1 was administered. Pt was
started on a dilt gtt wtih rate slowing to 110-120s. He became
A&Ox3, answering questions appropriately. He denied CP or SOB.
Labs showed hct 34, wbc 11.9, cr 1.9, trop 0.11. Bcx and Ucx
sent. He was given Vanc/Zosyn. 1L NS were infused. CXR showed
increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs,
potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete
consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however
developing infiltrate could also be considered. Head CT with no
acute intracranial process. No large mass or edema to suggest
intracranial metastatic disease. Small foci of air in the
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal soft tissues of unclear
clinical significance. On transfer, the pt's vitals were 98 105
24 125/79 99%RA.

On arrival to the ICU, the pt was A&Ox3, but somnolent. He
denied CP, SOB, though later did endorse some baseline sob and
left lower chest pressure, along with chronic lower abdominal
pain. Per daughter and son, his mental status had cleared
significantly.

Of note, the pt was recently admitted to BIDN [**1-9**] for
pyelonephritis and enterococcus bacteremia - ultimately treated
with ciprofloxacin for a 2wk course with subsequent nephrostomy
tube change [**2199-1-15**]. He also experienced several episodes of
afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt, and his home metoprolol
tartrate was uptitrated to TID.

In the ICU his metoprolol was uptitrated to 50 mg tid and he was
give 5 mg IV lopressor x 2.

Upon arrival to the floor his HR is still poorly controlled in
the 120s. He reports to me that he is SOB with exertion but this
is unchanged. He thinks that it is secondary to his atrial
fibrillation. He does not have SOB at rest. He does not report
PND nor edema. No chest pain or tightness. + nausea with emesis
today but it has since resolved. No abdominal pain. He had
diarrhea with chemotherapy but it resolved one week ago. No
dysuria.
In terms of recent events all he remembers is tell the RN in
clinic that he felt wierd and confused then remembers waking up
in the ICU with all of his family around him.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-2-28**] 4:35 PM
IMPRESSION: Increased interstitial markings throughout the
lungs, potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete
consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however
developing infiltrate could also be considered. Two-view chest
x-ray may offer additional detail.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-2-28**] 4:59 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. No large mass or edema to
suggest
intracranial metastatic disease, but MRI is more sensitive.
2. Small foci of air in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
soft tissues of unclear clinical significance. There is no
adjacent edema to suggest
infection, but it is possible this is tracking fr
