Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85 year old female who was admitted on [**2166-9-4**] for
workup of a right sided lung nodule.  A CT scan demonstrated
extensive mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with
the cavitary spiculated lesion in the right upper lobe and a
second spiculated lesion in the right middle lobe. There was
also  a right pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion.
 Geriatrics was consulted.  Orthopedics was consulted for a left
minimally displaced femoral greater trochanter fracture,
possibly due to metastatic disease.  A bronchoscopy was done HD
2, as well as needle aspiration.  NSCLC was suspected.  She
desaturated later that night, but she is DNR/DNI.  After
extensive discussion with her family, the desicion was made to
refrain from further intervention and control her pain only.  On
HD 4, a morphine dripe oversedated her.  MS contin was started
with some success.  On HD 5, she was discharged to hospice.
