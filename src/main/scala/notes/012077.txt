Chief Complaint:
febrile neutropenia

exploratory laparotomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40860**] is a 51 yoM with AML s/p 7+3 and HiDAC who never
achieved remission. He has been peristently pancytopenic, but
was sent home following admission [**Date range (3) 78859**] for fever and
neutropenia on levofloxacin, voriconazole and acyclovir. He
presented to the 7F outpatient clinic today ([**2118-8-7**]) for
clofarabine and ara-c and was found to have a temperature of
100.9. He was initiated on aztreonam and vancomycin after a CXR,
blood and urine cultures were obtained prior to antibiotics. He
also received his clofarabine in the outpatient clinic as
planned.
Mr. [**Known lastname 40860**] states he was feeling fine at home this morning and
had a temp of 98. Once he arrived at the hospital, he felt cold
and had chills. At that time his temperature was up. He reports
he's otherwise been feeling well, denies feeling sick. His
review of systems is positve for rhinitis, some pressure behind
the eyes. No headaches, cough, sore throat, nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea. He does report constipation x 4 days. He has not been
taking his stool softners. Denies rashes, skin lesions. ROS
reviewed in detail and is otherwise negative.
Past oncologic history:
Pt was admitted on [**2118-5-6**] for work-up of pancytopenia found
by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] consult was obtained and he underwent a
bone marrow
biopsy on [**2118-5-8**] which showed AML. He was started on
induction 7+3 chemotherapy on [**2118-5-13**]. The pt's counts were
slow to return, and he eventually was started on GCSF. He had a
BM bx on [**6-20**] with persistent immature cells. Thus he underwent 5
cycles of HIDAC, which he tolerated well. On [**7-6**] he had a
repeat BM aspirate which revealed an empty marrow. His counts
remained low for an additional 4 weeks. He was finally
discharged home with close follow up on [**2118-7-23**] after undergoing
a bone marrow biopsy on [**2118-7-21**] which showed 20% immature cells
consistent with persistent AML. He initiated clofarabine/ara-c
on [**2118-8-5**].

bone marrow
biopsy on [**2118-5-8**] which showed AML. He was started on
induction 7+3 chemotherapy on [**2118-5-13**] after a transthoracic
echo demonstrated a normal ejection fraction, and a tunnelled
line placed was placed on
[**2118-5-13**]. He initially tolerated this therapy very well,
however his course was ultimately complicated by the development
of severe mucositis, fevers and abd pain. All of his cultures
were negative in spite of an extensive work up. The pt's counts
were slow to return, and he eventually was started on GCSF. He
had a BM bx on [**6-20**] with persistent immature cells. Thus he
underwent 5 cycles of HIDAC, which he tolerated well. On [**7-6**] he

discharged home with close follow up on [**2118-7-23**] after undergoing
a bone marrow biopsy - results pending.

CXR [**2118-8-7**]:  In comparison with study of [**8-2**], there is little
change. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of
normal and there is some tortuosity of the aorta. Specifically,
no evidence of acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yoM with AML s/p 7+3 and HiDAC without remission and
persistent pancytopenia who presented with a fever to 100.9 (Tm
101.4) following clofarabine and AraC (given [**2118-8-5**]).  Briefly,
he was admitted with neutropenic fevers and soon developed
significant abdominal pain and peritoneal signs.  Abdominal CT
scan without significant abnormality.  Typhlitis was considered
given neutropenia.  He was taken to the OR on [**2118-8-13**] for
exploratory laparotomy; this showed viable intestine.  He
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and required ICU level
care and continued ventilator support.  His course was further
complicated by hypotension requiring pressor therapy, acute
renal failure requiring initiation of continuous renal
replacement therapy, VRE bacteremia, and diffuse anasarca.  He
was covered with meropenem, daptomycin, acyclovir, and
caspofungin.  Transfusion support was continued.
On [**2118-8-22**] he was transfered from the SICU to the MICU team for
further management of his multiple medical issues.  On [**8-23**], he
continued to decompensate requiring multiple pressors and
stopping of CVVH.  Mean blood pressures remained at 60 despite
full pressor support.  His oxygenation status also
intermittently worsened.  His family was called to see him given
his declining condition.  After discussion with his family, it
was decided for him to become DNR and ultimately comfort
measures.  He died on [**2118-8-24**] at 8:41 am in the presence of
multiple close family members.  Autopsy was declined.
