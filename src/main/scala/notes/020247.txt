Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiotomy with drain


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 99606**] is a 82 year old female with history of asthma,
atrial fibrillation, who is referred from an ophthalmology
clinic after reporting increased shortness of breath over [**12-24**]
days. The patient is moderately demented and history is obtained
through chart review in addition to patient interview.  Over the
past 1-2 days, the patient has noted increasing dyspnea upon
exertion, previously able to climb approximately one flight of
stairs, and now with shortness of breath with minimal level
ground ambulation. She did not seek medical attention. At a
routine ophthalmology appointment today she was found to have
marked dyspnea and referred to the emergency room.
.
In the ER the patient received an EKG demonstrating low voltage,
and CXR demonstrated a grossly enlarged heart. Bedside echo
demonstrated large cardiac effusion, and the patient was
transferred to CCU for further management.
The patient recalls that she has been told that she has ??????fluid
around the heart?????? approximately 8-10 years ago. On ROS she
denies any fever, chills, night sweats. No change in diet.
Patient reports rare chest pain with exertion, no history of
(pre)syncope.

Echo [**2114-4-4**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The  inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal  motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate (0.5-1cm) sized circumferential
pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-2**], the
pericardial  effusion is slightly larger.
.
Echo [**2114-4-2**]
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.
.
Echo [**2114-3-30**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The inferior vena cava is dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are  normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2114-4-3**]
Atrial fibrillation. Rightward axis. Low QRS voltage. Right
bundle branch block. Poor R wave progression. Diffuse
nonspecific ST-T wave changes
.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2114-3-30**]
Subxiphoid [**Date Range 99607**] was performed with one pass,
draining
approximately 450ml of sero-sanguinous fluid.  The initial
pericardial
pressures were elevated with significant respiratory variation.
The
mean pressure was approximately 24mm Hg.  A post-procedure
echocardiogram demonstrated a moderate residual effusion and
successful [**Date Range 99607**] of large pericardial effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2114-3-30**]
The cardiac shadow is again grossly enlarged, however, there has
been interval decrease in size. There is left lower lobe
atelectasis, which in retrospect, was previously present. No
pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen. These structures are
unremarkable. The pericardial drain tip can be seen over the
left superior cardiac border.IMPRESSION: Interval placement of
pericardial drain, without pneumothorax; drain appears to be
quite advanced along the superior aspect of the heart.
Persistently enlarged but decreased cardiac shadow. Persistent
left lower lobe atelectasis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2114-3-29**]
There are no prior studies for comparison. The cardiac
silhouette is grossly enlarged with extension beyond the aortic
knob, concerning for pericardial effusion. Cardiac silhouette
occupies approximately 3 quarters of the left
