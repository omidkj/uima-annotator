Brief Hospital Course:
58-year-old gentleman admitted for treatment of a complex
pancreatic pseudocyst situation secondary to gallstone
pancreatitis. He had been at an outside hospital for 2 weeks
prior to his transfer to us where he had evidence of a lower
extremity DVT. Upon transfer to us, he had clear-cut pulmonary
embolism identified and this was treated with anticoagulation.
In the antrum we accessed the pancreas via CT and
found it to be stable with a complex multi-loculated cystic
architecture that appears to be growing slightly in size while
here at [**Hospital1 18**]. We also recognized a bile duct stone on imaging
and he had an ERCP performed prior to this procedure.
He was doing well except from a respiratory standpoint where he
had decompensation and evidence of an advancing pulmonary
embolism. For this reason, a DVT filter was placed 3 to 4 days
prior to this procedure. He continued to have respiratory
distress but was doing well other than that. On the night prior
to this operation, he had an acute decompensation and moved from
an alkalotic state to an acidotic state. He required massive
amounts of fluid resuscitation and had a progressive lactic
acidosis. He had a tender tense abdomen as well.He was seen
early in the morning of the [**5-11**] and felt that he
had an acute abdominal catastrophe requiring emergent
exploration. He went to the operating room on the morning of
[**2187-3-13**] with the intent of performing exploratory
laparotomy. The presumed diagnosis was ruptured pseudocyst with
secondary diagnosis of dead bowel. Over the next three weeks
patient remained in ICU for postop care. On [**2187-4-15**] patient was
transfered to the floors for further care. remainder of hospital
course was uneventful, he continued to be stable on TPN,
tolerating regular diet. On POD 51/39 patient was cleared for
discharge to rehabilitation center for further recovery.
