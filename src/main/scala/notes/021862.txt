History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F w/PMH of CAD, HTN, SVT and schizoaffective disorder who
presented to ED from her [**Hospital3 **] with fevers and rigors.
 Patient unable to provide much history, but does report several

(baseline), and lactate 2.8.  UA grossly positive.  Patient
bolused 2L NS and received ceftriaxone 1gm IV x1, acetaminophen.
 While in the ED, became tachycardic to 140s-150s, and BP
dropped to 60s/30s.  EKG showed probable sinus tachycardia.  Was
bolused additional 1L NS without improvement in pressures, and

Imaging:
[**10-14**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions,
now moderate, with adjacent atelectasis.  Large hiatal hernia.

[**10-15**] CXR:
There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly cannot be
assessed.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.  Large
bilateral pleural
effusions with adjacent atelectases, larger on the left side,
are stable.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
.
CXR [**10-18**]:
Tip of the left PIC line is in the right atrium and would need
to be withdrawn 2 cm to securely place it in the low SVC.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are stable.
Cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged.  Upper
lobe vascular re-distribution has progressed indicating mild
cardiac decompensation, but there is no edema.  Severe bibasilar
atelectasis is stable.  Bubble of gas projecting over the
cardiac silhouette is in the hiatus hernia.  Right internal
jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**10-19**] head CT:
 CONCLUSION:
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.  If clinically
indicated, MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction
or lesions related to the trigeminal nerve (if high resolution
sequences through the trigeminal nerves were obtained).
