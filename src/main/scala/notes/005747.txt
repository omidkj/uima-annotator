Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
lower GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post flexible sigmoidoscopy and ethiodol injection with
hemostasis in the rectal varices

History of Present Illness:
89 y/o female with DM, CHF, cryptogenic cirrhosis noted by CT/US
(followed by hepatology), s/p splenectomy, undergoing
thrombocytopenia w/u with question of ITP (started with
prednisone 60 mg approx 2 weeks ago, now on 30 mg daily) who
presented to the ED from the [**Hospital **] clinic for GI bleed.
.
Pt was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) **] for GI bleed and
thrombocytopenia. EGD on this admission was unremarkable;
colonoscopy showed sigmoid diverticulosis, large rectal varices
without stigmata of recent bleeding, and grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids. On that admission, she also had work-up of
thrombocytopenia (nadir 18K, 60K on d/c) with the most likely
etiologies thought to be ITP and cirrhosis.
.
Pt was shortly readmitted on [**2-16**] to the Neurology service for
AMS in the setting of hypoglycemia. During that admission, Heme
was consulted for further work-up of her thrombocytopenia to
nadir 38K, and pt was started on prednisone 60mg for presumed
ITP with subsequent improvement in her platelet count to 74K on
discharge on [**2-19**]. Her thrombocytopenia continued to improve at
her Hematology f/u on [**2-26**], and her anemia (Hct 24-28) was
attributed mostly to CKD.
.
On morning of admission, while at her Hematology f/u, she had a
large loose BM with bright red blood admixed with dark colored
BM. The patient reports having loose stools once to twice daily
over the past several months; they are always dark due to her
iron supplement. She does occasionally have bright red blood on
toilet paper after a BM but never admixed with stool; this began
prior to her last colonoscopy. She has felt more drained in the
past week with increased fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion
and occasional lightheadedness. She was referred to the ED for
further evaluation.
.
Rectal exam was notable for marroon stools (neither bright red
nor melanic per ED resident), guaiac positive. Labs WBC 20.2 (on
steroids), Hct 23.4, Plt 103. INR 0.9. BNP 3645. EKG baseline.
NG lavage was negative. Patient was given pantoprazole 40mg IV x
1 and started octreotide gtt given her history of rectal varices
per Liver recs.
.
In the ICU, Flex sig showed large rectal varices without
bleeding, ethiodol injection with hemostasis in the rectal
varices. Hct has been stable. Got 1 unit of pRBC.
Anti-hypertensives were held overnight; now back on amlodipine 5
[**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 40 qday, natolol; furosemide 40 mg being held
currently. Leukocytosis WBC 19; ?due to steroids.
.
On transfer, VS: 122/55, 78, 97%2L. put out 1 L of UOP today.
Net -1L today.

CXR PA and lateral [**2197-3-12**]:
.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-17**], there is
increasing
prominence of interstitial markings that are somewhat
ill-defined, consistent with developing pulmonary edema and
small pleural effusions. Fluid is seen tracking into the minor
fissure on the right.
.
Because of the vascular consolidation, an early consolidation is
secured.
.
CT head without contrast [**2197-3-10**]:
.
FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained. The
previously
identified focal hyperdensity within the midline pons is
redemonstrated and unchanged in appearance compared to prior
study of [**2197-2-15**]. There is no associated edema or mass
effect. No additional focal hyperdensities are noted within the
brain parenchyma. The ventricles and cerebral sulci are stably
enlarged compatible with age-related involutional change. The
extra-axial spaces are unremarkable in appearance. The basilar
cisterns are patent. There is no evidence of midline shift. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The calvarium is
intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged focal pontine hyperdensity. No new focal
abnormality is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 y/o female with DM, CHF (LVEF > 60%), cryptogenic cirrhosis,
s/p splenectomy, undergoing thrombocytopenia w/u with question
of ITP (on steroids per oncology), recently admitted for BRBPR
who represents with GI bleed, flex sig showing large rectal
varices without bleeding, ethiodol injection with hemostasis in
the rectal varices.
.
# GI bleed: Given recent colonoscopy finding, most likely
etiologies are rectal varices, diverticuli, or hemorrhoids.
Hemodynamically stable, s/p 2 units pRBC and flex sig showing
large rectal varices without bleeding, ethiodol injection with
hemostasis in the rectal varices. Negative NG lavage, and recent
unremarkable upper EGD. Hct remained stable prior to discharge
(discharge Hct 27.7). Patient was maintained with active T&S,
PIV x 2 for access. Empiric octreotide gtt was discontinued as
etiology not felt to be UGIB. Empiric ciprofloxacin prophylaxis
discontinued, as etiology not felt to be UGIB and pt w/o
ascites. Patient was discharged on home PPI. She will have Hct
check on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**3-17**], with results to be faxed to PCP.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Etiology thought to be ITP; plts improving
on prednisone. With ITP, pts usually not at increased bleeding
risk even with markedly decreased plt counts. Prednisone was
decreased to 30 mg as recommended by oncology, and patient was
discharged on this dose. Given elevated BG like
