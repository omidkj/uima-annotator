History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o man with ESRD on HD who presented initially
on [**2128-5-17**] with increasing low back pain since MVC in [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2128**]. He has had a complicated complicated hospital course since
then, which I will summarize briefly here. He initially had an
outpatient MRI which showed question of paraspinal abscess. He
had been told to come to the ED right away, but did not do so
until several days later. The back pain at that time was
centered in his low back with radiation down the anterior
bilateral thighs (R>L). He denied fevers. Spine CT showed
findings concerning for a destructive infectious process. OSH
MRI showed L3 burst fx and retropulsion onto cauda, as well as
paraspinal abscess. He was admitted to medicine for further
evaluation, with ortho spine service consulting. He was
initially started on vanc/gent, and then changed to
nafcillin/gent. Blood cultures grew MSSA.
.
Of note, he was seen in the ED in [**3-12**] with anemia, at which
time he spiked a temp to 101 and blood cultures were obtained.
The patient left AMA from that ED visit, and cultures ultimately
grew MSSA. He was treated for MSSA with cefazolin at HD from
[**3-24**] to [**5-4**], but it is unclear if this course was optimal given
patient's history of missing HD sessions.
.
The patient was treated with antibiotics on the medical service
until [**5-25**], when the patient was taken to the OR for L2-L4
anterior fusion, following which he remained intubated and on
pressors in the SICU. On [**5-28**] he had a posterior fusion. He
initially did well and was weaned off pressors. He was extubated
on [**6-2**], but on [**6-4**] his respiratory status worsened and he
became more hypoxic. He had a thoracentesis followed by a L
chest tube placement for pneumothorax. He was reintubated that
day. A CT scan of his torso on [**6-4**] also showed a large left
sided abdominal fluid collection. On [**6-5**] a drain was placed by
IR, producing 800 cc bloody fluid not noted to be purulent (no
growth to date on culture). Around that time the patient
developed a new pressor requirement.
.
On [**6-8**] he was extubated. On [**6-12**] he was taken back to the OR for
a posterior wound dehiscence. I&D was performed, and a VAC
device was applied. He has now been off pressors since the
morning of [**6-13**]. He was extubated again on [**6-13**] and passed a
speech and swallow evaluation on [**6-14**]. His chest tube was taken
out today, as was the intra-abdominal drain.
.
Currently, he states that his pain is well controlled with
medications, but he does feel anxious. He denies other
complaints.

CT Spine [**5-17**]:
CT lumbar spine without contrast.

FINDINGS: There is extensive destructive process, centered at
L2-3 disc space, which is obliterated, with extensive
irregularity of end-plates and significant loss of height of
vertebral body of L3 and marked irregularity of L2 inferior
endplate and retropulsion of the bony fragments. The canal
measures only 9 mm (AP) at this level. Additionally, there is
high- attenuation material in the epidural space, adjacent to
the largest retropulsed fragment, which may represent hemorrhage
but is also concerning for infection. There is associated
kyphotic angulation at L2-3 level.

Calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted. Paraspinal soft
tissues are not well evaluated in this non-contrast
non-dedicated study.

IMPRESSION: Extensive destructive process at L2-3 level, with
significant retropulsion of bony fragments, narrowing the spina
