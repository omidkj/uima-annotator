HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient has had a very long,
complicated hospital course which has been written out in
multiple discharge summaries which are included in the packet
to the rehab center.  To summarize, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-
old woman who presented with a 60-pack year smoking history
to an outside hospital with 3 weeks history of cough and
weight loss.  Her work-up at that time included a CAT scan on
[**3-12**] at the outside hospital demonstrating left lower
lung collapse and a mass in the left hilum.  She underwent
bronchoscopy with biopsy and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**].

She underwent multiple bronchoscopies here, as well,
demonstrating left main stem obliteration with tumor, with
attempted but unsuccessful clearing of her airway to
reinflate her left lower lobe which occurred with multiple
bronchoscopies, attempts at ablation therapies, and stenting.
She had increased oxygen requirement, and needed to be
intubated for respiratory distress, and transferred to the
Medical ICU where she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] course on and off pressors
for a very long time on the ventilator.  She was treated with
1-1/2 weeks of radiation therapy without significant
improvement as a last ditch effort to try to improve her
respiratory status.  At that time, the patient wished to
proceed with treatment, and after 5 weeks in the hospital,
she underwent a left pneumonectomy and omental flap on [**2182-4-23**].

Her postoperative course was significant for ongoing pressor
requirement which eventually subsided, and she was extubated
on postoperative day six.  She subsequently developed rapid
atrial fibrillation and Klebsiella pneumoniae with copious
secretions.  She had to be reintubated, and developed a large
right pleural effusion.  A tracheostomy was performed on
[**5-14**] to assist with her pulmonary toilet, and her chest
tube was placed around the same time to try to drain this
large pleural effusion around the only remaining lung.  She
is currently on the floor with a Passy-Muir valve, on tube
feeds at goal, starting with POs with strict aspiration
precautions, and going to the rehabilitation facility.

In the time between late [**Month (only) 547**] where she was set to go to
rehab and the current time, she had an episode on the floor
which was responsible for the delay, where she was
tachycardic in SVT with decreased blood pressure and poor
oxygen saturations in the 80s.  This was at a time where her
Lasix dose was cut back and was probably attributed to both
mucous plugging, the development of a UTI, and the lack of
ongoing diuresis.  She went to the ICU, just received
pulmonary toilet, and was transferred back to the floor
within 48 hours.  She was also treated with antibiotics for
gram-negative rod coverage, and eventually this was tailored
to the Enterococcus that grew in her urine which was
sensitive to ampicillin.  However, she had a penicillin
allergy, so we treated her with vancomycin.  The Enterococcus
was resistant to Levaquin, which was the antibiotic that she
was placed on when she was transferred to the ICU,
empirically.  The chest tube was removed prior to this
episode because the output from her right chest went from
more than a liter to less than 200 per a 24-hour period over
the course of about 10 days to 14 days.  Since her transfer
to and return from the ICU, she has been overall improved,
now tolerating Passy-Muir valve, and much more awake, alert
and out-of-bed with activity.  Currently, she has no fluid,
but she is requesting it because of the decreased ability for
her to get herself to the toilet, giving her significantly
impaired stamina.  So, the date of discharge is [**2182-6-7**].

The patient obviously needs a tremendous amount of trach
care.  She is going to rehabilitation and will  need
respiratory therapy, pulmonary toilet, trach education,
frequent suctioning, frequent nebs, negative fluid balance,
antibiotics for a short time, physical therapy, occupational
therapy, nursing care to check wounds, cardiorespiratory
checks, evaluation for home services with social work given
her prolonged hospitalization and her elderly husband, speech
therapy, [**Name (NI) 36422**] valve ongoing, as well as strict
aspiration precautions, given that she has one lung, has
suffered a tremendous amount of respiratory compromise over
the past few months, and would find an aspiration event
absolutely devastating and probably life-threatening.


FOLLOW UP:
1. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] is the follow-up surgeon in 1 month.
2. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-25**] weeks as needed.
