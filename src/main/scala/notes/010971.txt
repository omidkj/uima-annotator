Abd US:
INDICATION: ? splenic granulomas and right inguinal cystic
structure per
outside hospital CT scan.

No studies available for comparison.

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. There are
bilateral
pleural effusions. The liver demonstrates no focal or textural
abnormality.
The gallbladder contains sludge. There is no evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The
right kidney
measures 10.6 cm. There is a 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm cyst at the
lower pole of the
right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or stones. The left
kidney measures
11.1 cm. There is a 2.4 x 2.5 cm cyst in the interpolar region
of the left
kidney. Note is made of multiple scattered punctate hyperechoic
foci, some of
which demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing in the spleen
consistent with
areas of calcification. The pancreas is poorly visualized in
this study.
Evaluation of the right groin region demonstrates no abnormal
cystic
structure.

IMPRESSION:
1. Splenic scattered calcifications.
2. Bilateral renal cyst.
3. Sludge in the gallbladder.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Torso CT:
INDICATION: 79-year-old female with tamponade, 6 months weight
loss, and
pelvic mass on outside hospital CT. Evaluate.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
obtained
without intravenous contrast.

CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple enlarged
axillary lymph nodes
are seen bilaterally, which do not CT criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
Within the mediastinum, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes.
A single
right pretracheal lymph node measures 9 mm in short axis
diameter. Additional
pre and paratracheal nodes measure 5-7 mm. There are mild
coronary and aortic
vessel calcifications. There is a moderately large pericardial
effusion.
Moderate pleural effusions are seen bilaterally, with
compressive atelectasis.
Additionally, there is diffuse edema within the surrounding soft
tissues. On
lung windows, there is a 4 mm nodule within the right lower
lobe, a 3 mm
nodule at the right lung base, and a 4 mm nodule within the left
upper lobe.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Imaging of the
abdomen is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast. Allowing
for this,
there is a small amount of intraabdominal ascites. The liver is
normal in
attenuation, without nodules or masses. The gallbladder and
pancreas are
within normal limits. Multiple calcified foci are seen
throughout the spleen,
consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Both adrenal
glands are normal
in appearance. The left kidney is normal in position, with
multiple hypodense
foci, most likely representing simple cysts, but inadequately
characterized.
The right kidney is inferiorly and anteriorly rotated. A large
hypodense
lesion within the interpolar right kidney, most likely
represents a simple
cyst, but is also inadequately characterize. The intra-abdominal
loops of
large and small bowel are normal in caliber and contour. There
is no
mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Multiple shotty periaortic lymph
nodes are
identified.
