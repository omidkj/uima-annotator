This is a partial discharge summary of the Intensive Care
Unit hospital course.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with history of diastolic congestive heart failure,
hypertension, temporal arteritis, chronic renal
insufficiency, and peripheral vascular disease, who presented
with painless bright red blood per rectum.  The patient
stated that she woke up at 2 a.m. on the day of  admission to
go to the bathroom.  After urinating she noted that the
toilet bowl was filled with bright red blood with some blood
clots.  The patient's niece brought her to the Emergency
Department.  She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, chills, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, or
lightheadedness.  She has never had bright red blood per
rectum before.

She has had a colonoscopy previously, which showed
diverticulosis.  She has no history of GI bleed.  She has not
had any weight loss, melena, change in bowel habits.

alone.

INITIAL EXAM IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Temperature 97.9,
heart rate 72, blood pressure 180/54, respiratory rate 16,
and oxygen saturation 96 percent on room air.  General:
Elderly female lying in bed in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  No JVD, moist mucosal membranes.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
normal S1, S2, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating to the
carotids.  Lungs:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  No external
hemorrhoids.  Extremities:  Warm, 1plus lower extremity
pitting edema, chronic venous stasis changes with mild
erythema over both anterior shins.  Neurologic examination:
Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are intact bilaterally.

INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.1,
hematocrit 39.4, platelets 390.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6,
BUN 60, creatinine 1.7, INR 1.0.  PTT 24.5.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia, congestive heart failure,
mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  In the Emergency Department the patient developed
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulting
in hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and
90s.  The patient was symptomatic with lightheadedness and
dizziness.  Attempts were made to slow her rate with IV
Lopressor, so when her rate did not respond, electrical
cardioversion was attempted with 200, 300, and then 360
joules without success.  Her rate was eventually slowed to
the 110-120 range with IV Lopressor.

Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient again
developed rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the
130s to 140s.  She was given 15 mg of IV diltiazem, which
showed her rate into the 60s and 70s, and converted her into
normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was continued on her
outpatient dose of Lopressor dosed 3x a day with 50 mg/dose,
and she remained well rate controlled throughout the
remainder of her ICU stay.  As at the time of transfer to the
medical floor, she had been in normal sinus rhythm for
approximately 24 hours.  The patient was not anticoagulated
given her recent GI bleed.  In addition, the patient has
reportedly refused anticoagulation in the past as an
outpatient for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  As in the
time of discharge to the medical floor, the patient was
restarted on 81 mg of aspirin daily to decrease her risk of
stroke.

Bright red blood per rectum.  During her Emergency Department
stay, the patient had another witnessed episode of bright red
blood per rectum that was again painless.  The patient's
hematocrit dropped from 39 to 31, and she had no further
episodes of bright red blood per rectum throughout the
remainder of her Intensive Care Unit stay.  Given the
presentation of the patient's bleeding, the etiology of her
bright red blood per rectum was felt to be due to
diverticulosis, versus AVM, versus malignancy.  The patient
was seen by Gastroenterology, and underwent a colonoscopy,
which revealed diverticular disease and one nonbleeding
arteriovenous malformation, which was cauterized.  There was
no obvious site to explain the patient's bright red blood per
rectum, however, it is felt that her bleeding episode was
most consistent with a diverticular bleed.

Anemia.  The patient has a baseline anemia with a hematocrit
that had been around 30 for the past several months.  This is
presumably secondary to her renal disease as she is on Epogen
as an outpatient.  Her colonoscopy was negative for any
malignancy, however, given her history of Barrett's
esophagus, she should have an outpatient EGD as surveillance
for esophageal malignancy.  She was continued on her PPI
during this admission.

Diastolic dysfunction.  The patient has a history of
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 70
percent and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  The
patient's Lasix was initially held during her fluid
resuscitation, however, on the day of transfer from the ICU
to the medical floor, the patient was clinically fluid
overloaded, and was given a dose of 40 mg of IV Lasix.  She
was also restarted on her outpatient cardiac medications and
diuretic.

Temporal arteritis.  The patient was asymptomatic and was
continued on her suppressive dose of prednisone 5 mg daily.

Hypertension.  The patient was mildly hypertensive during her
ICU stay with blood pressures in the 140s-170s as her
antihypertensives were held during fluid resuscitation.  At
the time of her transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, she
was restarted on her lisinopril and hydralazine.

Hypothyroidism.  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism
and was admitted on 50 mcg of Levoxyl daily.  The patient's
TSH was slightly elevated at 8, however, given her atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, this dose was
not increased.  It is also felt that this elevation may have
been due to stress given her GI bleeding and rapid Afib.  The
patient's TSH should be checked as an outpatient 4-6 weeks
after discharge as her dose of Levoxyl may need to be
increased.

Code status.  The patient's code status is do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.

The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated by
the intern on the medicine floor.
