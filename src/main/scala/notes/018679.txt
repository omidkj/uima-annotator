on [**2102-1-17**] for evaluation and treatment.  He was admitted to the
surgery service.  A rectal tube was placed. On [**1-18**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 6249**] was found to be in respiratory distress and was
intubated.  CXR revealed atelectasis and infiltrate.  A CT torso
revealed no evidence of sbo, but a fluid filled sigmoid.  He was
continued on antibiotics.  He was started on neostigmine.  He
was extuabated two days later, and would remain stable from a
respiratory standpoint.  He was transferred to the floor in
stable condition.  Success was achieved with a combination of
prokinetics and dulcolax, and his bowel functioned returned.  He
was started on oral pyridostigmine and reglan. He began
tolerating a regular diet, and by the time of discharge, he was
taking in an adequate amount of oral intake.  The rectal tube
was removed.  He was discharged to rehab in good condition on

with less abdominal distention. He should receive dulcolax for
constipation or abdominal distention.  A rectal tube, as well,
