Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Rituxan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-2-8**] Rituximab infusion
[**2120-2-9**] Bendamustine, cycle one, 1st dose
[**2120-2-10**] Bendamustin, cycle one, 2nd dose


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old male with lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma s/p four weekly doses of Rituxan in [**7-/2119**], with recent
admission c/b pericardial effusion and pleural effusion
(transudative s/p thoracentesis) who presents from
rehabilitation with shortness of breath. The patient reports
gradual onset of his symptoms in the days leading up to
presentation. He reports no baseline resting shortness of breath
immediately after recent discharge and only mild dyspnea on
exertion. He denies associated fevers or chills, chest pain,
cough, abdominal pain. He endorses stable lower extremity edema
that is symmetric in nature. No orthopnea or PND.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 106227**]. During that admission, the patient presented with
new-onset dyspnea, and was noted to have a pericardial effusion
with tamponade physiology. He was monitored in the CCU, though
no pericardiocentesis was performed given its small size, and
follow-up ECHO revealed improvement in the effusion. Ther
patient aslo had a new R-sided pleural effusion on CXR.
Therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis performed, showing
transudative fluid, although flow cytometry of the
fluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his known
lymphoma. His course was also complicated by new A.Fib with RVR
thought [**3-14**] overdiuresis with high right sided pressures and
pericardial effusion. He spontaneously converted back to sinus
rhythm, and decision was made not to initiate anticoagulation.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 97.7 82 174/83 32 99% neb. EKG was
stable compared to prior. His exam was significant for JVD,
diffuse crackles, 2+ lower extremity pitting edema from calves
to dorsum of feet. Bedside ECHO showed small pericardial
effusion, circumferential without tamponade physiology. Pulsus
was measured as 8mmHg. CXR was felt to demonstrate worsening
pulmonary congestion and R-sided pleural effusion. Labs were
significant for lactate 1.2, trop <0.01, BNP 4251 (unclear
baseline). He was started on a nitro gtt and initiated on BiPaP.
No diuresis was attempted given  VS on transfer were: 98.5, 76,
133/62, 22, 99 bipap.
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS:  76  149/68  23  94%RA. He reports
improvement in his shortness of breath.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2120-2-8**] Blood cultures x2: NGTD
.
IMAGING:
[**2120-2-8**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature
depolarization. Borderline low QRS voltage in the limb leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-1-31**] there is no
diagnostic change. Rate 83, QTc 442.
.
[**2120-2-8**] TTE: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systoilc dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
circumferential pericardial effusion.
Classic echocardiographic signs of tamponade are not seen,
although echo evaluation of this physiology has a reduced
sensitivity in presence of significant pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2120-2-8**] CXR (PORTABLE): Cardiomegaly is again seen,
significantly increased since [**2116**], and appearing gradually
increased since [**2120-1-23**] possibly reflecting
pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema
have increased since the [**2120-1-30**]
