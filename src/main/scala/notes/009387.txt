Chief Complaint:
battery ingestion, suicide attempt

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy with battery retrieval

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 28 yo woman with hx of DM, schizoaffective d/o,
in DSS/DMH custody since age 12 who presents to the ED with a
swallowed battery. Of note, the patient presented to the ED on
[**2113-6-23**] w/ abdominal pain in the setting of swallowing a
battery.
At that time, she underwent an endoscopy that showed polyps in
the stomach. A triple AAA battery was found in the greater
curvature of the stomach that was removed via basket. She also
had many sessile non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance 5-10mm
that were biopsied, and returned normal.

She now reports swallowing a pen-cap 3 days ago, and swallowing
a
AA battery today. The patient reports that she did so because
she
was having auditory hallucinations that were telling her to
swallow. She denied any overt suicidal ideation. She reports
swallowing the battery sometime in the morning. She also reports
the development of non-specific diffuse abdominal pain
developing
later in the afternoon. She also reported some chest discomfort
developing prior in the afternoon that has resolved. She has not
tried having orals since the incident today. She denies fevers,
chills. Has not had a BM or passed gas.

FRONTAL ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPHS:  A battery appears situated
within the stomach. No obstruction is seen.  There is a moderate
amount of colonic stool.  No other radiopaque foreign bodies are
detected.

CXR: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Pediatric sternal wires are
present.  The heart size is top normal.  The hilar and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no
pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  No
foreign body is detected, although a battery is seen on the
abdominal radiographs performed on the same day.

EGD [**2114-8-8**]:  Impression: Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus
Foreign body in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to stomach body
Recommendations: An attempt was made to place the overtube with
a plan to subsequently try to endoscopically retrieve the
battery with a snare. However, the patient had a significant
amount of distress with the tube placement, and a decision was
made to abort the procedure. The patient did appear to have some
oropharyngeal irritation upon endoscopic viewing that did not
involve the entry to the esophagus or trachea.
The patient will need to be intubated, and subsequently we will
try again to place an overtube, and retrieve the battery
endoscopically in the morning. Please keep NPO.

EGD [**2114-8-9**]: Battery in the stomach body (removed)
There was evidence of soft palate erosion/trauma seen on initial
intubation of the esophagus.
Otherwise normal EGD to stomach antrum


Brief Hospital Course:
29F w/ schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and
history of multiple suicide attempts via object ingestion
admitted after swallowing a AA battery requiring intubation, now
s/p battery retrieval and extubation. Patient is currently
medically optimized for transfer to inpatient psychiatric
facility.

#BATTERY INGESTION:  Pt ingested AA battery the morning of
admission and presented in no acute distress.  Retrieval of the
battery required  MICU admission intubation/extubation and
endoscopy x2. A small ulcer was found on the gastric lining at
the area of the battery.  She was started on pantoprazole for GI
prophylaxis.  She tolerated this well.  No sign of GI bleeding
or discomfort afterwards.  She will continue pantoprazole po on
an outpatient basis.

#PSYCH: She has a significant history of schizophrenia and
borderline personality disorder.  Was living at a group home
when she attempted suicide by ingesting a battery.  Per
psychiatry, she was section 12, requiring further psychiatric
treatment. She was placed on suicide precaution with a 1:1
sitter.  She continued clozaril 125mg QHS, Risperidone 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
She did have one episode of agitation during the course of her
stay that triggered a code purple, however no intervention was
required.

#Fever:  Pt with Tm 101.0 the night after upper endoscopy
([**8-9**]).  She was found to have a leukocytosis without a left
shift or any clinically localizing signs.  Urinalysis borderline
for UTI, but patient asymptomatic.  Did not treat empirically
for UTI. Urine culture was disgarded before resulted and not
repeated as she remained asymptomatic.  Blood cultures negative
>48hrs.  Fever did not recur.

#DM2: stable, she was started on SSI and restored to her home
regimen of metformin and glyburide after she resumed a regular
diet.

#Asthma: stable, albuterol inhaler prn

#Hypothyroidism: stable, she continued home dose of synthroid.

#Transitional Issues:
-Status: full code
-assure clozapine is delivered at QHS
-Pt is section 12, requires 1:1 sitter
-New medication: pantoprazole PO at home

Patient medically optimized for transfer.
