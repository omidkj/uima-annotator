Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated; extubated successfully


History of Present Illness:
48 y.o. M with h/o AIDS (CD 4 105 [**11-13**]), HCV, asthma, h/o TB,
h/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was found down today by VNA [**12-9**] sitting in urine
"indian" style.  Unknown down time, patient was last seen on
[**2145-12-6**].  Patient was responsive to touch with grimaces, but
not following comands.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and full code
was confirmed in ED, along with confirmation by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was subsequently intubated after Etomidate/Succinylcholine.
Patient's VS were 96.8, patient was placed on bearhugger, they
were 101.6 upon transfer to the MICU.  Patient's HR was 122
initially, after given 1 L NS, then 3 L LR, and his HR was down
to 60-70s.  His SBP remained in 140s-160s.  Patient was
oxygenating well on 2L (100%) but was intubated for airway
protection.  Patient was started on propofol gtt for
precautions.  He was started on vanco/zosyn/CTX.
Patient of note recently admitted on [**11-30**] to [**12-2**] after being
found down, however patient left after full completion of
medical therapy.  It is very likely that he is noncompliant with
his medications.
Patient in ED had a L IJ placed, RIJ was attempted but was
complicated by R carotid puncture.  Patient subsequently has a 6
cm hematoma on the R side.  His CTA is also concerning for
possible opportunistic infectious including TB.
ROS: patient unable to provide.

studies:
CT abd/pelvis [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Nodular opacities within a
bronchovascular distribution most notable in the left lung base
and less so on the right most consistent with aspiration
pneumonia given clinical history. However given
immunocompromised status atypical infections including
tuberculosis must be considered and respirtory precautions
advised.  2. Cystic pancreatic tail lesion also noted on study
from [**2141**] without detectable change.  3. Generalized cachexia,
likely AIDS-wasting syndrome
.
CT C-spine [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Right supraclavicular fossa hematoma
corresponding with recent central venous line attempt in this
location.  2. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  3.
Partially imaged right apical opacity and right apical
subpleural blebs.
.
CT head [**2145-12-9**]: 1. No acute hemmorage or mass effect.  2. Mild
cerebral atrophy which is not age appropriate consistent with
HIV encephalopathy.  3. Confluent regions of hypoattenuation in
the deep white matter which is unchanged from [**Month (only) 1096**] yet new
since [**2141**]. While this may represent sequlae of HIV
encephalopathy, an underlying infectious etiology such as PML
may be considered and an MRI may be helpful.
.
CXR [**2145-12-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly low lying ET tube, approximately 3 cm above the
carina. This could be withdrawn slightly.
2. Small, patchy opacities at the left lung base which appear to
correspond to tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities seen on previous chest CT
.
MRI head [**2145-12-10**]: 1. No evidence of bacterial or fungal
infection. However, extensive white matter hyperintensity is
often found in patients with HIV encephalopathy.  2. Several
foci of apparent infarction or encephalitis in the corpus
callosum raise the possibility of meningitis.
.
Echo [**2145-12-13**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A 24mmHg peak mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-6**],
left ventricular systolic function is now dynamic with a higher
heart rate and mild resting mid-cavitary gradient.
Is there a history to suggest a high output state (e.g.,
thiamine deficiency, hyperthyroidism, anemia, fever, etc.?
