History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 84M s/p right hemicolectomy on
[**2102-7-16**] for massive lower GI bleed complicated by ARDS and acute
renal failure presents with Afib in RVR and fever of 102.
Patient's initial hospital course was prolonged due to ARDS with
fibroproliferation and difficulty to wean from vent with
tracheostomy placement, acute renal failure with uremic
encephalopathy requiring CVVH, and poor po intake requiring PEG
placement. Patient was recently readmitted from [**Date range (1) 103670**] for
Afib with RVR, fluid overload, and dilirium. All cultures at
that time have returned negative, including c diff. Since his
discharge, his trach was changed and patient was back to
baseline mental status until 3 days ago. 3 days prior to
admissiont the patient developed fevers to 101.8 with worsening
dilirium. Blood cultures were obtained at rehab and are negative
to date. Per records, the patient had develop frank pus from his
ostomy site, but a pneumonia could not be ruled out. The patient
was started on emperic coverage of meropenem, vancomycin, and
flagyl. The patient also concurrently developed afib with RVR to
140s and was given metoprolol and diltezem for rate control. 1
day prior to admission, the nodal agents were held due to
hypotension of 80/40's. He was given fluid bolus and responded
well per rehab records. He then developed O2 desaturation to mid
80's and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient's mental status
had been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] for the past 3 days per the patient
son and wife. Although the patient denies any new symptoms when
he initially spiked a fever. Denied CP, abdominal pain, dysuria.

.
In the ED, the patient presented with inital vitals of 98.2
110/53 150 26 100%. He was started on a amiodarone gtt and
subsequently develop hypotension to the 60's/30's. He was givn a
500 cc bolus. The patient was then started on a Levo gtt. A CTA
torso showed possible pna, but no obvious GI absess or evidence
of GI infection. Blood cultures were obtained. He recieved
cefipime, vancomycin and levoquin. He was also givena total of
1.5 L of NS. He was then transferred to the MICU.
.
After arrive to the MICU the patient initial vitals were: 100.2,
74, 87/39, 23 98% on vent (CMV 400x14, FIO2 of 60%, PEEP of 5).

Chest X-ray [**9-20**]:
IMPRESSION:

Findings consistent with stage III SLAC wrist, with marked
radiocarpal and
DRUJ osteoarthritis. Probable DISI deformity.

ECHO [**9-18**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypotension- The patient became hypotensive to 80's/40's on
the day of admission in the setting of afib with RVR to 160's,
but responded well to gentle fluid bolus.  He had an A-line
placed. He was put on levophed. His urine output was inadequate
so he was given IVF and pRBCs. On [**9-18**], his amiodarone gtt was
transitioned to PO amiodarone as described below. He had an ECHO
which showed a preserved EF (>55%). When his blood pressure
stabilized, he was started on gentle
