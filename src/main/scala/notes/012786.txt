Attending:[**Doctor First Name 100050**]
Chief Complaint:
Right breast cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right modified radical mastectomy.


History of Present Illness:
This 55-year-old female presented with carcinoma of the right
breast diagnosed [**2102-9-12**]. This was originally
diagnosed by fine needle aspiration. She was managed with
neohormonal therapy, Arimidex, with good response until late
spring of [**2104**]. At that time, imaging suggested that the cancer
was increasing in size and was multicentric in nature. Of note,
her clinical
course was complicated by venous outflow obstruction of a right
upper extremity AV fistula leading to varices that involved the
right side of the torso, extending up into the neck, into the
axilla, and around to the back. It also led to engorgement of
her right breast. On [**2104-9-9**], she underwent a venogram
and dilatation of a tight stenosis centrally of the outflow from
the fistula. She had some response of the dilated veins.

It was felt that she was not a candidate for chemotherapy due to
multiple other medical problems, including her end-stage renal
disease and HIV infection since [**2086**], as well as severe
hypertension. Due to the multifocal nature of her disease, she
was not a candidate for breast-conserving surgery. In the
context of the disease progression, mastectomy was felt to be
the only appropriate way to proceed for local control.

Past Medical History:
HIV--dx [**2086**]. No opportunistic infections. Last CD4 ([**2100-12-17**]):
110. Last viral load ([**2100-12-17**]): 33,600. Has not been taking all
her medications, and her ID doctor and she are discussing a
"clean start"
ESRD--on HD since [**10-3**]. She has a permacath in the left side,
but this week has started using her R upper arm fistula.
