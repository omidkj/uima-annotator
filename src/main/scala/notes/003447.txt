Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with multiple medical problems here with
multi-focal pneumonia, intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure.  The pt was initially intubated for hypoxia, likely
secondary to multifocal MRSA pneumonia, which may also have been
due to aspiration given emesis x2 prior to arrival. Pt had also
been on steroids and lived in nursing home, thus was felt to be
at higher risk for nocosomial pneumonia. Patient may also had a
component of underlying COPD exacerbation.  The pt was treated
with vanc/CTX emperically, given aggressive inhalers and
steroids for COPD, diuresed with lasix initially, and was placed
on heparin infusion for a LENI study positive for DVT.
Hyperkalemia was treated and aldactone was discontinued.  Stress
dose hydrocort/fludrocort were initiated.  The pt was felt to
have prerenal failure and had some boluses of fluid (recognizing
that his volume status was tenuous).  Troponin showed no
increase.
.
CODE: pt was originally DNR/DNI, which was reversed just prior
to admission because the pt's son and HCP was out of the country
and could not be contact[**Name (NI) **]. In his absence, the other son wanted
his father to be full code. This was readdressed and the pt was
made dnr/dni.  On [**1-11**], he was made CMO and passed away
thereafter.
