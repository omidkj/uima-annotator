HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF of 10 to
15%) and history of recurrent GI bleeds (previously on
Coumadin for left ventricular aneurysm), status post recent
admission in [**2176-6-19**], for a GI bleed with evidence of
AVM's on esophagogastroduodenoscopy requiring 17 units of
packed red blood cells.  The patient presented to the
Emergency Room on the day of admission with a history of
fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance and black tarry stools.
The patient denied any chest pain but mid-back pain is the
patient's anginal equivalent.  The patient called his primary
care physician who referred him to the Emergency Room for
evaluation.

In the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was 78/40
and rectal revealed melena.  Hematocrit on admission was
17.3.  The patient received 800 cc of intravenous fluids and
3 units of packed red blood cells with an increase in blood
pressure to 110/60.  Of note, the patient's baseline systolic
blood pressure is 80 to 90.

any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  Reports good appetite.
No fevers, chills or cough.

smoking.  The patient quit drinking alcohol approximately 40
years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, afebrile, blood pressure
100/40; heart rate 80 and paced; respiratory rate 14; O2
saturation 100% on room air.  In general, well appearing,
pale, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Diffuse point of maximum impulse, positive S4, regular rate,
III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the base.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds.  No
hepatomegaly.  Extremities one plus pretibial pitting edema.
Dorsalis pedis two plus bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Alert and

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 6.2,
hematocrit 17.3, platelets 155,000, INR 1.2, creatinine 2.3,
BUN 133, glucose 159.  CPK 57, digoxin 2.0.

Hematocrit at the day of discharge, 31.6.

RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no evidence of
pneumonia.  There is a persistent right sided pleural
effusion and massive cardiomegaly.

Repeat chest x-ray [**2176-10-20**], showed massive cardiomegaly
with left ventricular predominance.  No evidence of
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 72 year old male with a
history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of
10 to 15%.  Recent admission in [**2176-6-19**], when he
presented with hypotension and melena.  EGD at that time
showed AVM's in the third part of the duodenum.  The patient
received approximately 17 units of packed red blood cells
during this time.  The patient is now admitted with
progressive fatigue, melena and orthostasis on examination.
The patient's hematocrit on admission was 17.3.  The patient
denied any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting at the time of
admission but did complain of back pain which is anginal
equivalent and was [**Year (4 digits) 20003**] out by myocardial infarction by
serial cardiac enzymes.

During this hospitalization, the patient underwent EGD on
[**2176-10-8**], and [**2176-10-21**].  First EGD showed a small hiatal
hernia and lots of coffee ground blood in the stomach and
three AVM's in the stomach fundus which were cauterized.  The
first one-third of the duodenum was visualized with no
evidence of bleeding.  The patient received approximately
five units of packed red blood cells with an increase in
hematocrit from 17.3 to 20.1.

On hospital day number two, the patient's sodium started to
increase as the patient had been diuresing spontaneously and
was NPO for several days.  D5W was started.  On hospital day
number four, sodium increased to 152 and D5W rate was
increased with no evidence of congestive heart failure on
examination or chest x-ray despite ejection fraction of 10 to
15% and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.  Urine
sodium initially was 26 which decreased to less than 10
approximately two days later.  The patient's serum sodium
eventually decreased to 147 and D5W was discontinued.

The patient had a continual low hematocrit of approximately
25 despite 10 to 15 units of packed red blood cells.  In
addition, the patient also received fresh frozen plasma.  On
[**2176-10-21**], the patient underwent a second EGD with further
exploration into the distal duodenum.  Gastric AVM's
previously seen were no longer bleeding.  [**Last Name (un) **] did find
spreading AVM's in the distal third of the duodenum which
were cauterized.  Since second EGD the patient was transfused
4 units of packed red blood cells with stable hematocrit of
30.

At this time, the patient was transferred from Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the Medical Floor.

1.      Gastrointestinal:  The patient is status post EGD
times two as above with three gastric fundi AVM's cauterized
and one distal spreading AVM in the duodenum cauterized.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable at 30 in the 48 hours
prior to discharge.  In total, the patient received 17 units
of packed red blood cells.  Given his history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy and coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient
was restarted on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day two days prior to
discharge.

2.      Cardiovascular:  The patient received a total of 17
units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen
plasma and 12 liters of D5W.  Despite large volume given, the
patient had no evidence of congestive heart failure during
this admission.  At the time of discharge, the patient was
restarted on all his home medications except his Lasix dose
was decreased from 80 mg p.o. twice a day to 40 mg p.o. q.
day.  The patient is to follow-up with his Cardiologist at
discharge.

3.      Renal:  The patient presented with an elevated
creatinine of 2.3 with baseline of 1.4.  The patient received
a large
