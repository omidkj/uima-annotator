Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Found minimally responsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
60 year old man, known to have schizophrenia for several years,
was found by family to be minimally responsive with labored
breathing at home. Last seen about 4-5 days prior to
presentation in good shape per mother. [**Name (NI) **] was brought by
ambulance. He was unresponsive initially, then opening eyes,
able to tell his name.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 99, HR 102, BP 154/89, RR 42,
Sat 98% on NRB, RBS 145.

ED spoke to the patient's family member, he's full code, doesnt
know meds, gets injections at [**Hospital1 **] Q 2 weeks. He had a CXR
which showed hyperinfiltrated lungs otherwise no acute process
or infiltrates. EKG showed sinus tachycardia, normal axis,
normal intervals, inverted P,inverted T with Q waves in V1 and
V2 with poor progression of R waves. No hyper-acute T waves. His
troponin was normal with MBI of 7.7%. Duonebs were given for
labored breathing, never hypoxic. Not intubated. He was placed
on nonrebreather mask. He was found to be hyponatremic and
hyperkalemic. On bedside ultrasound, there was a questionable
Left adrenal gland mass (big, triangular, hollow). no hypertonic
saline was given. He also had a non-contrast head CT which
showed no acute inctracranial process (wet read). He also had CT
abdomen which showed equivocal left adrenal mass with absent
left kidney (wet read). He received 1L NS only to prevent
overcorrection. On transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS were: HR 100, BP 122/65,
RR 18, O2sat 100% on nonrebreather mask.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was minimally responsive to calling his name. He
couldn't follow commands. Tachypneic.

Imaging:
CT Head w/o Contrast ([**2166-10-12**])
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease in the paranasal
sinuses; correlate clinically.

CT Abd ([**2166-10-12**])
1. Normal adrenal glands.
2. Left kidney not seen, either congenitally or surgically
absent, or ectopic in the pelvis.

CXR ([**2166-10-12**])
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The trachea is midline.
The descending thoracic aorta is well defined. The cardiac
silhouette is within normal limits for size. No effusion or
pneumothorax is noted. No displaced fractures are evident. Mild
degenerative disease is seen throughout the thoracic spine.

CT Head w/o Contrast ([**2166-10-13**])
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.

EEG: Per neurology, so slight slowing but no seizure activity

ECHO ([**10-13**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility suggested (not well seen). There is abnormal
septal motion/position (possible RV pressure overload). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST [**2166-10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Emphysema.  Small lung nodule.
Followup in one year is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old man known to have schizophrenia found by family to
be minimally responsive at home with labored breathing, was
admitted to ICU for minimal responsiveness in setting of
significant hyponatremia and hypercarbia.

# Metabolic encephalopathy:
Initially assumed to be [**2-12**] to hyponatremia with Na of 109,
although also appeared to have COPD exacerbation with PaCO2 of
89. All home antipsychotics were initially stopped in setting of
unclear history and concern for their contribution. Initial tox
screens normal. Troponins WNL x 2. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 25100**] with urine
studies showing low Na as well as elevated OSM. Due to lethargy
[**2-12**] to low Na, was initially given hypertonic saline with Na up
to 116, 7 hours later. Also received head CT and LP initial
evening and one dose of acyclovir which was stopped when LP
studies came back not concerning for infection. When mental
status did not change despite Na of 116 and gas next AM showed
PaCO2 of 156, thought most likely that mental status due to
hyperca
