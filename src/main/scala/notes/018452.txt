Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Bronchoscopy
2) Transfusion with packed red blood cells
3) Intubation/extubation
4) Central Line placement (L and R)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 97713**] is a 60 year old female with past medical
history of CAD status-post CABG, status-post AVR and MVR, and
COPD who presented with dyspnea. History is obtained from ED
sign-out and chart review, per discussion much is from the
daughter.
.
Per report, she has had worsening dyspnea for about one week,
along with dizziness. Reportedly she has not been taking her
medications, and her daughter has found them hidden around the
house. The night before admission, she was more short of breath,
and either coughed or vomited up a small amount of blood. This
morning, she attempted to walk to the bathroom and fell twice,
at which point EMS was called.
.
Upon arrival to the BIMDC ED, her initial vitals were a
temperature of 101, blood pressure of 129/78, heart rate of 136,
respiratory rate of 32, and oxygen saturation of 92% on
non-rebreather. Due to respiratory distress and respiratory rate
of 40, she was intubated with etomade and succ. Prior to
intubation, systolic blood pressure recorded as 160-170.
Post-intubation, on propofol, systolic blood pressure dropped to
70-80. She received 300 cc of IVF with improved to 80's, however
at that point a right IJ central line was placed and neo was
started peripherally. Levophed was initiated after central line
placement.
.
While in the ED, she also received 1 gram of ceftriaxone, 500 mg
of azithromycin, 650 mg of acetaminophen, and 10 mg of IV
decadron.
.
Cardiology was consulted regarding elevated troponin, and given
the bloody ETT secretions, it was recommended that heparin drip
be held for now.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she is intubated and sedated,
occasional moving.

Imaging:
[**6-5**] CXR- IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in left upper lobe
pneumonia from the most recent study but considerable
improvement since [**2206-4-29**]; small left pleural effusion.

Echo [**5-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function could not be assessed. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring
is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physio
