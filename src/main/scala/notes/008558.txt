History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 yo F with h/o rheumatic mitral stenosis
s/p mechanical MVR ([**2165**]) on coumadin, right heart failure due
to severe TR and celiac disease who presents for heparin and
catheterization prior to tricuspid valve repair on [**6-28**]. The
patient presents with progressive TR and right heart failure
refractory to diuresis efforts. On review of old medical
records, TR was first mentioned in a report dated 07/[**2175**]. At
that time it was noted that she had a large right atrium and
significant TR, however she was asymptomatic and able to
maintain euvolemia with PO diuretics. However, she was recently
admitted to an OSH for diuresis due to increased peripheral
edema. Per the patients report, despite IV lasix, she was only
able to diurese 1-2lbs. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 461**] in [**Month (only) 116**], [**Month (only) **]
showed enlarged RV with severe TR and preserved LV function.
Over the past two months the patient reports increased weight
gain and LE edema. She has been taking lasix/metolazone daily
without any improvement in symptoms. Aside from the LE edema and
fatigue she denies any other symptoms. She does not have any
chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope or
presyncope. She does report SOB with ambulation however feels
that it is due to the exertion required to move her LE around.
This shortness of breath has been stable over the past month.
Per her report, her dry weight is 145lbs, recently up to 158lbs.

.
The patient's last dose of Coumadin was [**6-21**] and her INR today
was down to 1.7 per outside records (was 3.9 on Friday).
.
On review of symptoms, she reports occasional diarrhea and fecal
urgency especially in the morning. This has been stable since
she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 958**]. She follows a strict diet for
celiac sprue, however per Dr.[**Name (NI) 12202**] last note she may have a
refractory sprue. Biopsies on last colonoscopy were negative.
She reports a normal appetite with weight gain as above. She
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea (sleeps with 1 pillow
baseline), palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
Mitral valve replacement, [**2165**] on coumadin. Treatment for

h/o AF prior to mechanical valve placement
