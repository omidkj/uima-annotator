to be tachycardic to the 110s and oxygen saturation in the
mid 90s on 100% nonrebreather.  CTA of the chest showed large
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  She was started on heparin with
a bolus.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies per doctor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient came from [**Hospital3 2558**]
Rehabilitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was
afebrile.  Blood pressure 119/68.  Heart rate 105.
Respiratory rate 27.  97% on a nonrebreather.  In general,
she was actually in no acute distress.  Oriented to person
and hospital.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Mucous membranes are very dry.  Neck no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular tachy.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lungs bronchial breath sounds at the left base.
Wheezes throughout.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
No masses.  Extremities warm, well healed right hip and right
knee scars.  Neurological moves all four extremities.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  INR of 1.1, PTT 25.2, sodium 133,
BUN 22.  CT of the chest showed bilateral large pulmonary
emboli and a question of a density in the right upper lobe.
Question of infarct in main pulmonary arteries and all
branches.  Head CT showed no bleed.  Chest x-ray showed
flattening of the diaphragms otherwise clear.
Electrocardiogram sinus rhythm, no acute ST T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary embolism:  The patient was
started on heparin with a bolus.  Throughout her hospital
stay she was started on Coumadin.  At the time of discharge
she is on both heparin and Coumadin with an INR of 1.3.  The
plan is to continue her on both medications until her INR is
therapeutic between 2 and 3 and then she will overlap with
heparin and Coumadin for 48 hours.  At that time she can be
discharged from heparin therapy and continue on Coumadin.
The patient had an echocardiogram, which showed an EF of 55%
and no evidence of thrombus.  She also had lower extremity
doppler ultrasounds, which were positive for thrombus in the
right anterior tibial vein.  Given the fact that the patient
had no intracardiac thrombus or significant deep venous
thrombosis it was felt there was no need for lysis or IVC
filter.

2.  Cardiovascular/tachycardia:  The patient had frequent
bouts of supraventricular tachycardia during this
hospitalization.  Electrocardiogram suggested MAT likely
secondary to PE and pulmonary disease.  Her underlying
disorder was treated with heparin and was given gentle fluid
boluses for dehydration.

3.  Dementia/cognitive decline:  The patient had planned an
outpatient head CT prior to admission.  Here no acute bleed
noted on head CT.  This will need to be followed up upon as
an outpatient.

4.  FEN:  The patient was advanced to a soft mechanical diet.
She is taking po, but poorly.  Hyperkalemia was corrected
given normal saline.

5.  Code status:  During this hospitalization was full per
the daughter.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to full time
rehabilitation facility.
