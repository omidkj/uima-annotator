Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-9-27**] - Coronary artery bypass graft x 2 - saphenous vein
grafts to left anterior descending artery and obtuse marginal
artery. Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion in the right femoral
artery.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 82y/o F with PMH of CAD s/p two MIs in [**2125**], cardiac
cath in [**1-/2154**], and stroke presenting with L-sided chest and
axillary tightness, diaphoresis and right leg cramping for 1.5
hours. Chest tightness was non-radiating, located mid-sternal
and left axillary. No nausea. + h/o similar L axillary tightness
and right leg cramping in the past. Symptoms, including the
right leg cramping, relieved with 1 sl ntg from EMS.
.
Pt has history of presentation to ED in [**2-5**] with acute onset
jaw and ear pain and was found to have LBBB with minor ant. ST
elevations and was taken emergently to the cath lab. At this
time cath showed moderate disease in the distal left main and
mid RCA with mild disease in the LAD and LCX. The left main had
a discrete 40% distal stenosis and the RCA had a diffuse 30% mid
stenosis. No interventions.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.1 HR: 65 BP: 164/40 RR: 20
O2Sat: 98%. 1st set of CE negative. CXR demonstrated mild
pulmonary edema. D-dimer elevated at 1277 so CTA was performed
which showed no PE, dissection or PNA. Patient received aspirin
and was admitted for further evaluation and management.
.
Pt denies any complaints this AM. No chest
pain/pressure/tightness. Denies jaw pain. States that she feels
quite healthy overall.
.
On cardiac review of systems pt states that she never sleeps
flat, always sleeps on her side with two pillows thus cannot
tell whether she has orthopnea. Denies PND, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

Chemical stress/perfusion test (Persantine-MIBI) [**2154-9-24**]
.
Stress:
INTERPRETATION: 82 yo woman (h/o MI x 2; cardiac catheterization
revealing moderate LM and RCA disease and mild LAD and LCx
disease without intervention) was referred to evaluate an
atypical chest discomfort. The patient was administered 0.142
mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back, neck or
arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the
procedure. In the presence of baseline ECG abnls, no additional
ST segment changes were noted during the procedure. The rhythm
was sinus with no ectopy noted. The hemodynamic response to the
persantine infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI, the
patient received 125 mg aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
.
Perfusion imaging:
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately dilated.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a large area of moderate
to severe and fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and
inferseptal walls and a large area of moderate to severe and
fixed perfusion defect in the proximal and mid anterior and
ateroseptal walls.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis more pronounced in the
inferior wall and septum. The calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 34%.
IMPRESSION: 1. Large area of moderate to severe and fixed
perfusion defect
involving the inferior and inferseptal walls 2. Large area of
moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect in the proximal
and mid anterior and anteroseptal walls. 3. Dilated LV with
septal and inferior wall hypokinesis; LVEF 34%.
.
Cardiac catherization [**2154-9-25**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2-vessel coronary artery disease involving the Left main. The
LMCA tapered distally to a 60% stenosis, which by IVUS had a
cross sectional area of 4.9 mm2. The LAD had a 60% stenosis at
the origin with heavy calcification. The LCX was a non-dominant
vessel and had heavy calcification proximally. The RCA was a
dominant vessel with a 40% stenosis in the mid segment.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling
pressures, with a LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed hypokinesis of the anterior,
apical
and inferior walls, with a depressed ejection fraction of
45-50%. There
was no transaortic gradient on pullback of the catheter from the
left
ventricle to the aorta.
.
Carotid U/S [**2154-9-26**]
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid
arteries
bilaterally.
.
Echo [**2154-9-27**]
PRE CPB Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the septal, inferoseptal, and inferior walls. The anterior,
anterlateral, and lateral walls display low normal function.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The right ventricle displays focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The wall of the left atrium
is thickened throughout - ? Infiltrative process. There is
severe and fairly diffuse calcification of most of the thoracic
aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at th
