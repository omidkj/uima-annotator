Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent a combined procedure with ENT and Plastics:
right parotidectomy with facial nerve exicision, subtotal
auriculectomy, right modified neck dissection by ENT and by
Plastics:

1.Anterolateral thigh free flap to right facial and temple
    region.
2. Multiple facial nerve cable grafts for reconstruction of
    facial nerve.
3. Harvest of sural nerve for facial nerve grafts.
4. Fascial sling for lower lip.
5. Tarsorrhaphy of right eye.

The case was approx 16 hours in length and the patient went to
the PACU post-op.  His flap was checked every hour initially.
Initially he remained intubated, his BP dropped into the 80s for
a short period of time, his Hct was 26, so he received 2 units
PRBC.  He was extubated on POD 1 successfully.  He was very
agitated post-op and stayed in the unit for a few days secondary
to this.  he required haldol, ativan, and narcotics to settle
him out.  It was necessary that he wasnt agitated as to not
damage his new free flap.

GI:  Once he became less agitated the meds were weaned.  A
dobhoff was placed to start tube feeds but he pulled that out
shortly thereafter.  He was started on PPN as a NG or dobhoff
type tube would unlikely remain in  place.  We had IR place a
Gtube under flouro prior to him leaving the hospital.  Tube
feeds were started and advanced to a goal of 80cc/hr.  This was
all done because he failed a swallow evaluation and was high
risk for aspiration.  Prior to discharge he had a repeat video
swallow which showed he could tolerate thickened liquids and
purees.  He was allowed to begin this for pleasure, but his main
nutrition would be PEG tube feeds for now.

CV: He was maintained on a betabblocker.  While on the floor he
did have some episodes of Vtach for no longer than 10 beats.
Cards was consulted.  We restarted all his home meds, we got an
ECHO, which showed EF 35% and hypokinesis of the inferior LV
wall with mild systolic function depression.  This was
consistent with his baseline.  He was also started on lasix.  No
further Vtach occurred during his hospital stay.

Heme: Heme/Onc was consulted as they had followed him regarding
his Oncology preop.  His WBC cont to trend down, as low as 1000.
 They recommended switching his ancef to clindamycin as ancef
was the likely culprit.  This was done and his wbc stopped
falling.  His wbc never really came back above 2500.  He was
cont on his lovenox until his coumadin was therapeutic.  He is
on 60mg SC bid of lovenox, and 2mg PO QHS of coumadin.  This
should cont until his INR is therapeutic.  He also had b/l
LENI's to check on his DVT from [**Month (only) **] and make sure there was
no progression.  He had no DVTs on these LENIs.
