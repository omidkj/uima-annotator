Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea of increasing severity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement (19mm Magna tissue), Aortic root
enlargement, and Coronary artery bypass grafting times one
(saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery) [**8-18**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91358**] is an 83 year old female with a known history of
aortic stenosis who transferred in from Oan outside hospital for
further evaluation of aortic stenosis and coronary artery
disease. A cardiac catheterization revealed a 50% left main
coronary artery lesion. She had a lower gastro-intestinal bleed
two weeks ago at the outside hospital where she was hospitalized
with suspicion of ischemic colitis and transfused to a
hematocrit of 35%. She was discharged on
[**7-25**] and has not had melena since. She was readmitted to [**Hospital 28941**] on [**8-6**] with lower extremity edema, increasing fatigue,
shortness of breath, and right bundle branch block. Her brain
natrietic peptide was 1444 and she was diuresed with intravenous
lasix. An echo showed severe aortic stenosis with an ejection
fraction of 20-25% and apical anterior akinesis.  Of note, a
prior echo in [**2172**]
showed an ejection fraction of 57%. She was referred for an
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.

Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient:  4 mm Hg
Mitral Valve - Pressure Half Time:  67 ms

Findings
TEE probe was not advanced across the GE junction
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Depressed LAA emptying
velocity (<0.2m/s)

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Good RAA ejection
velocity (>20cm/s). No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. No MS. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate to
severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
Physiologic TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). The posterior pharynx was anesthetized
with 2% viscous lidocaine. No glycopyrrolate was administered.
No TEE related complications. The patient appears to be in sinus
rhythm. MD caring for the patient was notified of the
echocardiographic results by e-mail.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta to 30 cm from the incisors . The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
suggested (not quantified). No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen directed inferolaterally into
the left lower pulmonary vein.There is an increased gradient
across the mitral valve due to high flow, but no mitral
stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.
Significant aortic stenosis. Poor LAA ejection velocity.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
