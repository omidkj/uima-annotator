History of Present Illness:
50 year old male with known hypertension, +30 pack year tobacco
history reports while vacationing in [**Country 6257**] on [**9-2**] he had an
initial episode of chest pain associated with shortness of
breath and fatigue while ambulating.He continued to have
intermittent episodes of chest discomfort, new onset cough, and
returned to MA on [**9-5**]. He presented to MWMC [**9-6**] with
worsening dyspnea, cough, and chest pressure when lying down.
CXR showed left lower lobe
consolidation and he was initially treated for Pneumonia and
treated with Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone. EKG changes were
evident with an elevated Troponin of 2.77. Echocardiogram was
done and showed 4+ Mitral Regurg with a reduced Ejection

possible surgical intervention.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2182-9-9**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No
AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Eccentric
MR jet. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared to the prior study of [**2182-9-9**], findings are similar.
