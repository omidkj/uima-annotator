Admission Date:  [**2147-9-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-9-26**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
89-year-old female with two-vessel coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less
than 28% and eight admissions for congestive heart failure
exacerbation within the last eight months.  The patient was
most recently admitted from [**2147-7-22**] to [**2147-8-22**]
for CHF exacerbation.  Her stay at that time was complicated
by a non-Q wave MI.  The patient is now status post stents to
her LAD, left circumflex.  The hospital stay was also
complicated by bradycardia to the 30s.  The patient received
a dual-chamber pacer at that time.

The patient's last hospital stay was also complicated by
rapid atrial fibrillation for which she was started on
Amiodarone.  The patient also had a hypoxic ventilatory
failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema requiring three
intubations during her last hospital stay.  The patient
ultimately recovered, however, and was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2147-8-22**].

The patient had an uneventful recovery at rehabilitation and
was transferred home on [**2147-9-13**].  At home, the
patient has been largely bedridden without complaints of
shortness of breath.  The patient has stable orthopnea and
denied PND or increased lower extremity edema.  The patient
does state that she has had a cough for one week that is
nonproductive and was subjectively febrile the night prior to
admission.

On the morning of admission, the patient states that she
became acutely short of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.
She denied chest or arm pain.  The patient was transferred to
the ED.  The vital signs in the ED were notable for a blood
pressure of 91/60, pulse 75.  The patient was saturating 100%
on nonrebreather.  The patient became transiently hypotensive
to the 70s and was started on a dopamine drip.  The patient
had a chest x-ray that was consistent with pulmonary edema.
She had 100 IV Lasix to which she had 230 cc of urine output.
Her ECG showed paced rhythm at 75 with a question of ST
segment elevations in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was
started on heparin due to concern about acute coronary
syndrome.

Also concerning, the patient had change of axis in some of
her precordial leads.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as stated in the HPI.
2.  Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of less than 20%.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.

6.  Gout.
7.  Question of diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired lawyer.  She denied
any history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  The patient's
family is very supportive.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.8, pulse 95, blood pressure 108/57 on 5 micrograms of
dopa.  The patient was saturating 98% on nonrebreather.
General:  She was an alert and oriented female in no apparent
distress.  Not using any accessory muscles.  HEENT:  The
oropharynx was clear with dry mucous membranes.  Neck:  JVP
was actually flat at about 30 degrees.  Chest:  Bilateral
crackles to about a quarter of the lung fields.
Cardiovascular:  Paced with normal S1 and S2, soft S3, no
murmur, and diffuse anteriorly displaced PMI.  Abdomen:
Benign.  Extremities:  She had trace ankle edema bilaterally
and Dopplerable DP and PT pulses bilaterally.  Neurological:
Grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  The chest x-ray showed a small right
pleural effusion, mild cephalization of vessels consistent
with CHF.  No obvious pacer migration compared to the
previous.

The patient had a stat echocardiogram in the ED which showed
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, no thrombus present, and no
evidence of RV perf.

The patient's laboratories on admission were notable for a
white count of 17.1 with a normal differential, hematocrit
32.8, platelets 382,000.  The electrolytes were notable for a
sodium of 125, potassium 3.8, chloride 87, bicarbonate 26,
BUN 34, creatinine 1.5.  The patient's LFTs were within
normal limits.  The patient had three sets of enzymes.  Her
highest CK was 20 and her troponins were less than 3.  Her
U/A was unremarkable.  Urine cultures and blood cultures were
sent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 89-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease and CHF admitted
with shortness of breath and found to be acutely hypotensive
requiring a dopamine drip.  Question if whether the shock is
due to hypovolemia versus sepsis, versus cardiogenic.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was continued on
her aspirin and Lipitor.  She had three sets of negative
enzymes and was ruled out for MI.  This was not felt to be
consistent with an ischemic event.

2.  PUMP:  The patient has baseline EF of less than 20%.
There is no change on her admission echocardiogram compared
to her echocardiogram from [**2147-8-8**].  The patient
appeared clinically dry and was bolused with fluid.  The
patient's blood cultures remained negative throughout the
course of her admission and no potential source for infection
to lead to sepsis as an etiology was ever elucidated.

There was concern given the change of axis in the precordial
leads that her pacer may have migrated and she may have
sustained an RV perf; however, her pacer was interrogated and
found to be fine and there was no evidence of echocardiogram
of any right ventricular perforation and no evidence on chest
x-ray that the pacer leads had migrated.

Hypoadrenalism was also considered as possible etiology for
this patient's hypotension; however, she was started on
stress dose steroids and underwent a cortisol stim test.
These revealed that her pituitary adrenal access was
functioning normally with no evidence of hypoadrenalism to
explain the patient's hypotension.

Ultimately, the patient was bolused with fluid, weaned from
dopamine and it was decided that the patient was probably
hypovolemic.  The patient had no further episodes of
hypotension once she was weaned from the dopamine and fluid
resuscitated.  The patient was continued on her ACE inhibitor
and her beta blocker as well as her regular dose of b.i.d.
Lasix.

3.  RHYTHM:  Given the change in axis of the patient's
precordial leads, there was concern that her pacer may be
malfunctioning; however, the pacer was interrogated by EP who
found that her pacer was functioning appropriately.  The
patient had no further rhythm issues throughout the course of
her hospitalization and was continued on Amiodarone for her
history of atrial fibrillation.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient remained afebrile
throughout the course of her admission. She never had any
culture data that was positive; however, pneumonia could not
be excluded based on her chest x-ray.  Thus, the patient was
started on Levaquin for a 14 day course which she continued
after discharge.

5.  PULMONARY:  The patient was able to be weaned to room air
rather quickly.  She did develop a solitary left-sided
pleural effusion which was tapped and found to be
transudative and thought likely due to congestive heart
failure.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient's TSH was elevated at 8.3 on
admission.  Her T3 and FT4 were checked.  It was thought that
her thyroid abnormalities were probably due to starting
Amiodarone recently and should be followed-up on in the next
month.

7.  RENAL:  The patient had some element of acute renal
failure on admission, likely secondary to dehydration.  Her
creatinine decreased back to her baseline with hydration.

The patient was discharged in good condition on [**2147-9-26**].
She is scheduled to follow-up with her primary care doctor,
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
