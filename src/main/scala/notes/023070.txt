Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male w/ h/o CHF, Parkinsons disease presents with
melena s/p ERCP/sphincterotomy.

1. GI bleed: The patient was admitted to the MICU. He underwent
an EGD [**2191-4-8**] which showed large blood clots with small amount
of fresh blood in the second portion of the duodenum. After
irrigation with sterile water, the bleeding was identified to
the recent sphincterotomy site. BICAP cauterization and
epinephrine injection was applied at the sphincterotomy site
with resolution of active bleeding. The patient was initially
kept NPO, and received 8 units of PRBC in the ICU.  He was
transferred to the general floor, after which time he remained
hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (on discharge
28.9). His coumadin and aspirin were initially held, but were
gradually restarted (aspirin on [**2191-4-11**], coumadin on [**2191-4-13**]).
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor. He will follow-up
with gastroenterology as previously scheduled.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was maintained on his home
dose of amiodarone. As mentioned above, his coumadin was
restarted on day of discharge. His INR will need to be closely
monitored as an outpatient, with a goal INR 2-2.5.

3. Ichemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35-40% on TTE [**1-31**]): Given the
patient continued to be orthostatic throughout his hospital
stay, his furosemide and spironolactone were held. At time of
discharge, the patient appeared euvolemic. He will need to
adhere to a low sodium diet and weigh himself daily. His
diuretics will be restarted at the discretion of his primary
care physician.

4. Hypertension: Although the patient has a history of
hypertension, his losartan, furosemide, and spironolactone were
held during his hospital stay given orthostasis and systolic
blood pressures 100s-110s. These medications will be restarted
as needed at the discretion of his primary care physician.

5. Parkinson's disease: The patient was continued on his home
doses of Sinemet and Mirapex. Physical therapy evaluated him
while in-house and, given risk of fall, recommended
rehabilitation center placement. The patient and wife, however,
declined this option in favor of home physical therapy.

6. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: The patient was continued on his home dose
of pyridostigmine with good effect.
