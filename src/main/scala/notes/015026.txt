CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Liver hepatitis and cirrhosis and upper GI
bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The note from the original
admission is missing, as part of the chart has probably been
misplaced and is not available to me at this time.  However,
patient is a 47 year old woman who was transferred from an
outside hospital where she had originally presented
complaining of ascites and jaundice and was found to have
rapidly progressive alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation and possible workup for liver transplant.
At the time of admission to the outside hospital, however,
patient was found to be actively drinking alcohol with an
elevated ethanol level.

neuropathy.  Alcohol abuse.  Gallstones seen on ultrasound in
[**2121-9-26**].  Liver biopsy in [**2117**] at [**Hospital6 14430**].  Hiatal hernia repair performed in [**2120-9-26**].
Alcoholic cirrhosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.a.m., Aldactone
100 mg p.o. q.d., thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d., folate 1 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., multivitamin, lactulose 30
cc p.o. t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient admitted to starting drinking
heavily at age 16 and quitting at age 24 when she gave birth

family.  Her brother and sister also have bipolar disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
is not available, as stated before, that part of the chart
has been misplaced or lost.  However, physical examination at
the time of presentation to the [**Hospital1 **] service on [**3-24**]
was as following.  Vitals temperature 96.7, blood pressure
110/64, pulse 109, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 98%

Dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable bilaterally.  Neuro alert
and oriented times four.  No asterixis.  Moving all four
extremities symmetrically.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of transfer to the [**Hospital1 **]
firm on [**3-24**] showed CBC with WBC 20.9, hematocrit 29.9,
platelets 87.  PT 19, PTT 39.2, INR 2.4.  Chem-7 sodium 134,
potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 28, BUN 23, creatinine
0.6, glucose 102.  Magnesium 2.1.  On [**3-21**] ALT 65, AST 150,
LDH 407, alka phos 124, total bilirubin 33.8.  C.diff
negative on [**3-21**].  Chest x-ray on [**3-19**] showed an interval
increase in the appearance of bilateral bibasilar opacities
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  No evidence of
pulmonary embolism or effusion.  Microperitoneal fluid from
[**3-19**] gram stain 1+ PMNs, no bacteria, cultures negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2122-2-22**] for
further management of her hepatitis.

1.  Liver cirrhosis.  The patient was admitted for further
management and workup for possible transplant.  Since she was
found to be actively drinking heavily at the time of
admission to the outside hospital, she was not deemed a
suitable transplant candidate.  Several tests were performed
to determine the etiology of her liver hepatitis which
finally was determined to be alcoholic.  These studies
included hepatitis serologies which were all negative except
for hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with a
completely resolved old hepatitis B infection.  HIV test was
negative.  AFB was found to be 6.9, therefore, within normal
limits.  [**Doctor First Name **] was positive with a titer of 1:40.  Hereditary
hemochromatosis was found to be negative for C282Y mutation,
but positive for a heterozygous H633D mutation.  Endomyseal
antibodies were found to be 13, therefore, within normal
limits.  Antigliadin antibody was found to be 6 for IgG and
36 for IgA, therefore, within normal limits.  Liver biopsy
revealed moderate steatosis, moderate mononuclear neutrophil
inflammation of lobules, hepatocellular, canalicular and
ductal cholestasis and cirrhosis with focal central venular
sinus although fibrosis with no increase in stainable iron.
On admission patient's bilirubin was found to be 33.  Patient
was started on ursodiol, pentoxifylline, nadolol and
continued on lactulose.  Diagnostic paracentesis was
performed which revealed no malignant cells in the peritoneal
fluid and also no evidence of infection.  During her hospital
stay patient required two more therapeutic paracenteses which
each time revealed no sign of infection in the ascites.
Regarding her cirrhosis, the rest of her hospital stay was
otherwise unremarkable.  She was continued on all her
medications.  She never developed hepatic encephalopathy.
Nutrition was monitored carefully.  A nutrition consult was
obtained.  She was started on supplementation with Boost
three times a day and that helped her to achieve her goal for
caloric and protein intake.  Patient was also started on
ciprofloxacin 24 mg p.o. q.d. for DT prophylaxis,
spironolactone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for ascites management and
vitamin K 10 mg p.o. q.d. for elevated INR.

2.  Upper GI bleed.  On the patient's third day of hospital
stay at [**Hospital1 69**] patient
underwent diagnostic EGD which revealed grade 1 varices at
that time, however, there was no evidence of bleeding.  On
[**2122-3-3**] patient had her first episode of hematemesis.  An EGD
was performed which revealed three to four cords of grade 2
varices at the gastroesophageal junction which were actively
bleeding.  These were attempted to be treated with injections
of sodium morrhuate, however, with only partial success.  At
this time patient was three units of FFP and three units of
packed red blood cells.  However, since the bleeding did not
stop, she was intubated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was placed.  The
bleeding eventually stopped with the [**Last Name (un) **] and both the
[**Last Name (un) **] and the endotracheal tube were removed.  On [**3-13**] patient had another episode of hematemesis.  Once again
she underwent an EGD which revealed three cords of grade 2
varices in the lower esophagus and at the gastroesophageal
junction.  This time the varices were no longer bleeding and
two bands were successfully placed.  Once again patient was
also treated with transfusions of FFP and packed red blood
cells.  On [**3-19**] patient, who by then had been transferred
to the floor, had another episode of upper GI bleed and
hematemesis.  Once again she was transferred to the MICU
where she underwent an EGD which at this time revealed a
laceration next to the banding with no longer active
bleeding.  No other intervention was done, but patient was
once again treated with FFP and packed red blood cells.  Of
note, for eve
