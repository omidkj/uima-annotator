History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3451**] is a 41yo gentleman with h/o melanoma metastatic to his
lung, liver, heart, skin, and bone recently treated at an OSH
for pneumonia who presents with shortness of breath and fevers.
.
Much of the history was obtained from the patient's wife as the
patient was very sleepy upon arrival to the unit.  The patient
was admitted to a hospital in [**State 2748**] [**Date range (1) 38269**] with
pneumonia.  He was discharged on a course of cefuroxime, flagyl,
and levofloxacin, which he has since completed.  In addition, he
was given a 5 week course of prophylactic PO vancomycin given a
history of severe C diff colitis in the past.  He had been doing
well at home, getting about with a walker or wheelchair and
improving his PO intake.  About two or three days ago, he began
to have increased work of breathing.  He was having some fevers
at home as well but no shaking chills.  In addition, he had a
cough that was productive, at one point of foul-smelling green
sputum.  There were times he had some blood-streaked sputum as
well.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  101.8 rectal  110/70   119   22
99%.  CTA chest was negative for PE but showed airspace
consolidation suggestive of RLL pneumonia.  He was given
vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.  In addition, IP was
contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible flexible bronchoscopy in the morning to
help relieve any obstruction.  Because the team was anticipating
the possibility of a PE, they also obtained a non-contrast head
CT, which unfortunately demonstrated likely new brain mets.
Both the patient and his oncologist were informed about this.
.
His ED course was also notable for an episode when his wife
stated he did not respond to verbal or tactile stimuli x 1
minute.  This occurred after 1mg IV dilaudid followed 45 minutes
later by 1mg IV ativan.  When the MD arrived to assess the
patient, he was awake and responsive but somewhat consfused.  He
improved after a dose of narcan.  Finally, he received 2L of NS
and was started on a NS infusion at 150cc/hr.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he was pleasant but sleepy.  He did not
feel particularly short of breath.
.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 3451**] was seen by his oncologist on [**2138-6-11**] and
given a 7 day course of levofloxacin for incidentally-noted LUL
infiltrate on staging chest CT.
.
On review of systems, his wife notes that he has had episodes
recently of being unresponsive after getting his fentanyl patch
similar to what happened in the ED.  He also has been having
some loose stool lately.


Past Medical History:
Melanoma metastatic to lung, liver, heart, skin, and bone
(spine) s/p high-dose IL-2 x 4 cycles, CTLA-4 antibody in [**5-6**] x
2, then EBRT to T7-T12 spine [**3-9**], currently receiving
palliative XRT to hip mets (next dose due [**7-15**])
Hypercholesterolemia
Hypothyroidism
Sinus tachycardia at baseline
Diabetes mellitus [**3-3**] study drug, developed in [**2-7**],
diet-controlled
h/o C diff colitis
h/o severe neuropathy from CR-01 immunotoxin, now improving
s/p Right knee surgery
s/p Tonsillectomy
Recent b/l upper lobe pneumonia treated in CT [**2138-5-30**]
.
Oncologic History:
Pt developed a broken rib in [**2133**],was treated conservatively at
the time, intermittently treated with anti-inflammatory agents.
He then noticed a small bump adjacent to his sternum, which
began to grow through [**2135-4-30**] at which time he was evaluated
at [**Hospital 33316**] Hospital in [**Location (un) **], [**State 2748**]. A surgeon
performed a FNA biopsy of the parasternal mass which showed
metastatic melanoma.  Per his most recent oncology note, his
prior treatments include:
.
1.  Biopsy of a parasternal mass at the site of a pathologic
sternal fracture which revealed metastatic melanoma in 05/[**2135**].
The patient had no prior history of melanoma and no suspicious
skin lesions.
2.  Partial sternectomy with resection of the parasternal mass
in
07/[**2135**].
3.  High-dose IL-2 at the National Cancer Institute Surgery
Branch in 12/[**2135**]. The patient was enrolled in a protocol that
involved the administration of TIL generated from the resected
tumor.  However, no TIL could be grown from the tumor specimen
and the patient therefore received only IL-2.
4.  Medarex anti-CTLA-4 biomarker trial.  Treatment was
complicated by several autoimmune side effects including
colitis,
fever, arthralgias, and elevated transaminases.
5.  CyberKnife treatment to an isolated right medial pulmonary
mass which was at the time the only growing tumor.
6.  Radiation therapy to T7-12.
7.  A second cycle of the CTLA-4 antibody in 06/[**2137**].  This
treatment was complicated by autoimmune colitis and later, the
development of a superimposed C. difficile colitis that failed
to
respond to Flagyl and required oral vancomycin.
8.  Cryoablation of a large LLL mass by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4702**] of the
Interventional Pulmonary Department in [**Location (un) **], [**State 2748**].
The procedure was complicated by the development of a
pneumothorax that required the placement of a Pleurx catheter,
which has long since been removed.
9.  Treatment at [**Hospital1 56915**] with the CR-001 immunotoxin.
This treatment gave rise to a severe peripheral neuropathy that
is slowly improving.
10. Off-study Sutent therapy.

RADIOLOGY:
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of a 12 x 7 mm
hyper-attenuating focus
located in the right occipital lobe given history of metastatic
melanoma is highly concerning for a focus metastasis. This can
be more fully
characterized with MR examination as clinically indicated.
.
CTA Chest:
1. Overall, progression of disease in the diffuse metastatic
disease
involving hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymphadenopathy,
pulmonary
metastasis, cardiac, osseous, and hepatic metastases.
2. New multifocal parenchymal airspace consolidation involving
the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe, the right middle
lobe, that likely represents in multifocal superimposed
infection.
3. Post-obstructive changes involving the left upper lobe with
associated
collapse.
4. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
Shortness of breath and fevers: Pneumonia.  The patient was
treated with a course of broad spectrum abx for nosocomial PNA.
His fevers improved.  He was noted to have hemoptys
