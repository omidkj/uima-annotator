CTA CHEST [**2118-9-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly with marked right atrial
dilatation,
extensive network of venous collaterals in the chest wall, as
well as contrast reflux into the IVC, dilated hepatic veins, and
zygos/hemiazygos system are consistent with right heart failure.

2.  Confluent opacification noted in the right lower lung,
possibly
representing asymmetric pulmonary edema, but cannot exclude
superimposed
infectious process including aspiration.  Bilateral pleural
effusions, small in the posterior dependent portions; however,
loculated effusions are also noted along the right major fissure
and a large loculated effusion noted anterior to the right upper
lobe.
3.  Significant multilevel degenerative change with compression
fractures
noted in T11 and T12.  This area was not completely visualized
on prior study, though it appears that the T11 fracture is new
compared to [**2118-8-17**].

RENAL US [**2118-9-7**]:
IMPRESSION:  Normal renal son[**Name (NI) **].

CXR [**2118-9-8**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
minimally
increased opacity at the left lateral lung bases, likely
atelectatic in
origin.  The known bilateral subpleural opacities along with
pre-existing rib changes, are constant in extent and severity.
Also constant in extent is a known right apical area of severe
pleural thickening.
The lung volumes remain low.  There is status post CABG,
moderate size of the cardiac silhouette.  Right pectoral
pacemaker, clips after left axillary lymph node resection.

[**2118-9-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
Plcement of a dialysis temporary line catheter through the right
internal
jugular vein.  The tip is located in the lower SVC, and the
catheter is ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
88F with hx of CAD s/p MI and CABG [**2110**], breast CA in [**2101**] s/p
XRT, chemo and LND, osteoporosis, pacemaker, and hemorrhagic
stoke with chronic back pain, presented with back pain.

Hospital course: Pt presented w/ back pain, VS 96.2 94 138/87 16
98% RA. Exam was notable for thoracic kyphosis with tenderness
to palpation at approx T6-8 on the right side. There was no
obvious CVA tenderness. Pulmonary exam was mostly clear. Cardiac
exam was unremarkable. Abdominal exam was benign. Labs
significant for CBC and CHEM-7 at baseline with Cr. 1.4. U/A was
negative for infection. Chest X-ra showed small bilateral
pleural effusions, slightly worse than on previous exam, patchy
opacity in the right lung base. CTA chest was obtained for
concern for aortic dissection, showed no dissection, no PE, but
possible new vertebral compression fx. After returning from CTA,
patient had O2 saturation in the 80s with drowsiness, rales on
exam. She was started on O2, and portable chest x-ray showed
mild increase in pulm vasc congestion. Pt was started on CPAP,
given 20mg IV lasix 1mg of dilaudid, and admitted to intenstive
care unit. VS on transfer 72 115/72 16 94%; she was arousable to
voice.

In the MICU, pt became more alert, VS 97.5, 136/57, 73, 11,
93-100% on 3L NC. Her sudden decline in respiratory status was
judged to be likely [**2-24**] an aspiration event while supine in CT
scanner, as patient did not demonstrate any signs of infection
(no leukocytosis, no fever). Speech and swallow was consulted,
who recommended nectar prethickened liquids.

Pt was noted to be in acute renal failure, likely [**2-24**] IV
contrast for CTA. Pt was oliguric but stable, transferred to the
floors for further management. She remained stable, with O2 sats
trending low when taken on the finger but increasing to mid-90s
when taken on forehead.

Cr trended up over first 48 hours on floor, peaking at 4.3 on
[**2118-9-9**]. She was given gentle IV fluids for question of
hypovolemia (reporting thirst, had low PO intake), became more
hypoxic w/ concern for heart failure, fluids d/c'd. Renal
consulted, who recommended diuresis at 80 mg IV lasix, and HD
line placement if no response w/in a few hours. Pt remained
oliguric, IR placed temporary nontunneled HD line on [**2118-9-9**].
Pt's creatinine trended down at next chem draw, however, and
urine output increased from 10cc/hour to 20 cc/hour, reassuring
for renal recovery. Her creatinine continued to trend downward
w/ improvine urine output, and on [**9-11**] her HD line was pulled,
as well as her Foley catheter. By day of discharge she was near
her baseline creatinine of 1.4, with Cr measured at 1.6. She had
one episode of large urinary incontinence on the night before
discharge, judged likely [**2-24**] post-ATN diuresis.
