During admission was in MICU intubated (extubated [**2174-12-9**])and had

antegrade nephrostogram, ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy and
replacement of percutaneous nephrostomy tube with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**].
Later on her nephrostomy tube was capped and then removed in
clinic on [**2175-1-25**]. At that time she was instructed to increase
her fluid intake to 2 liters a day, maintain a low oxalate, and
moderate calcium diet.  She also will add some fresh [**Doctor Last Name **] to
