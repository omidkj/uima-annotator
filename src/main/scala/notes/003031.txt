Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT-ablation
Arterial line placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
73 yo M with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia
s/p VT ablation and AICD, who was admitted to [**Hospital 794**] Hospital
for multiple AICD shocks on [**2178-12-6**], now transferred for repeat
VT-ablation.
.
At [**Hospital 794**] Hospital, he was started on amiodarone and lidocaine
drip, which decreased his heart rate. He then underwent a
right-sided catheterization, which showed muliple vessel disease
and had PCI to the LAD/LCx. The procedure was uncomplicated.
This morning, patient again went into sustained monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia. He was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
repeat VT-ablation.
.
Patient reports that when he has VT, he experiences
palpitations, diaphoresis, and weakness. Recently, he had these
symptoms at the end of [**Month (only) **] and was hospitalized at [**Hospital **]
Hospital from [**10-19**] - 11/31, when he was treated with potassium
and plan was to consider upgrading his ICD to biventricular
pacing. He was discharged home and then had repeated symptoms on
[**10-6**].
.
Of note, patient had his ICD placed approximately 8 years ago,
but had recurrent VTs. He underwent VT ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in [**2172**] but continued to have VTs. He was then succesfully
medically managed with amiodarone for 3 years, but had to stop
due to hepatic toxicity. Since then, he has been shocked "more
than 50 times", including one episode where he had an induced
ICD firing, presumably for slow VT.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, or syncope.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- Echocardiogram ([**2178-12-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near-akinesis of the distal [**11-23**] of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis in the remaining segments. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy with
near-akinesis of the distal [**11-23**] of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis in the remaining segments. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
- CXR ([**2178-12-9**]):
Heart is moderately enlarged, but there is no pulmonary edema or
even vascular congestion and the hila are normal size. No
pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. Lungs clear.
Transvenous right atrial pacer lead follows the expected course.
A transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead ends
closer to the midline than we generally see but cannot be more
carefully localized without a lateral view.
.
- CXR ([**2178-12-10**]):
ICD leads remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite ablation
and AICD, cardiomyopathy, CAD s/p PCI, COPD, hypothyroidism,
treated with dofetilide and repeat VT-ablation.
.
# Ventricular tachycardia: Pt admitted for initiation of
dofetilide ggt which was maintained for 3 days eventually being
decreased to 250mcg q12h.  However, on HOD 2 he developed VT
into the 140s, with sBP in the 110s-120s. Received lidocaine
bolus, placed on gtt, and ativan.  Broke after 5 minutes and did
not require firing of ICD. He subsequently went for ventricular
substrate ablation the following day (see report).  After the
procedure his antiarrhythmic therapy was changed to mexilitine
150mg q8h and quinidine was started at 324mg TID.  Dofetalide
was d/c'd.  Of note When arterial sheath was being pulled, he
became transiently hypotensive to 60s, got 1 amp of atropine and
recovered.  He remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder
of admission, but was noted to have occasional runs of 20-40
beats of vtach during which he remained asymptomatic.  He was
discharged on mexilitine 150 TID and quinidine 324mg TID.
.
# Fever: Febrile to 102 on admission. Influenza swabs sent, came
back positive.  Patient remianed on droplet precautions.  He
remained afebrile throughout admission.
.
# Cardiomyopathy:  Repeat echocardiogram here confirmed EF of
25-30%, with severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, near-akinesis of distal [**11-23**] of the LV and global
hypokinesis. He diuresed well and remained euvolemic on home
dose 20 mg PO Lasix.
.
# CAD s/p stent: History of MI in [**2154**] with anteriolateral
distribution on EKG, consistent with catheterization finding of
LAD, LCX stenosis. Patient has been asymptomat
