Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15397**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mechanical intubation

History of Present Illness:
54-year-old male with history of COPD, obstructive sleep apnea
(not on bipap), pulmonary embolism on warfarin who presents from
OSH with respiratory failure.

The patient was in his usual state of health on the day of
presentation when he developed hypoxemia that was not responsive
to walking or inhalers. He notes coughing a bit with some
shortness of breath. He presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5678**] Hospital. There
he was hypoxic, which by report was not responding to
supplemental oxygenation. He was intubated and sedated. He was
given IV antibiotics and lovenox. The CT scanner at the hospital
was not working so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and management.

Upon arrival, CT was done which was negative for PE or
pneumonia. He did have bilateral atelectasis. ABG showed
7.3/63/71. He was treated for COPD exacerbation with
azithromycin, steroids and inhalers. He was extubated without
difficult and was weaned down to room air with an oxygenation of
88-92.

Currently, he denies any other complaints other than his foley
catheter placement. Specifically, he denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, cough, sputum production,
abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, leg swelling,
palpitations, or other symptoms.

CTA chest: 1.  No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Subsegmental bilateral atelectasis. No pneumonia. 2.
Endotracheal tube ends in the mid trachea.  Nasogastric tube
ends in the stomach. 3.  Possible tracheobronchomalacia. This
could be further investigated with CT Trachea if clinically
indicated when the patient's clinical status improves.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V4 of
unclear significance, may be normal variant. Marginal criteria
for old inferior myocardial infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
54-year-old male with history of COPD, PE on warfarin,
schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea who was
an OSH transfer for respiratory failure caused by COPD
exacerbation and obstructive sleep apnea.

# Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on admission
with significant wheezing per the MICU exam. The CTA was
negative for PE or pneumonia. The thought was that the patient
most likely had an acute COPD exacerbation. He was treated with
steroids, inhalers and azithromycin. He was extubated and weaned
off of oxygen the day after admission. He maintained oxygenation
and was breathing without difficulty or wheezes. We will treat
him with a short course of steroids (5 days of prednisone total)
and antibiotics. The antibiotics were changed from azithromycin
to levofloxacin (due to UTI, see below). Given how rapid he
improved, it is likely that another factor caused the lung
symptoms. We think this is likely obstructive sleep apnea and
possible obesity hypoventilation syndrome (see below).

# Obstructive sleep apnea: He should be treated with BiPAP,
which has been ordered by his pulmonologist. It is currently
under review for [**Month/Day/Year **]. I contact[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] to attempt
to expedite the process but was unable to make it happen. Given
that he had two nights where he was asymptomatic and maintained
oxygenation (continuous O2 pleth) I think it is safe to
discharge home temporarily without BiPAP. I do recommend that he
sleeps at least at a 30-45 degree angle to minimize obstruction.

# Urinary tract infection: The patient had a UA with 23 WBC. He
had some urinary symptoms. It is unclear if this is related to
his foley catheter or is not actually a urinary tract infection.
We will treat him with levofloxacin at the above course.

# Tachycardia: He had tachycardia which was thought to be due to
albuterol, deconditioning and dehydration. He was hydrated with
IV fluids with improvement in his tachycardia. He would have HR
of 120s with ambulation and 70-80s at rest. He was asymptomatic.
CTA was negative for PE.

# Schizophrenia: He was continued on his home medications.

# Prior PE: He was treated with coumadin. Due to him being on
antibiotics his INR levels will need to be monitored closely. He
should have his INR checked on Thursday [**2118-8-18**]. His dose was
decreased to 3mg per day.

# HTN: He was continued on his home medications.

# Hypothyroid: continued on levothyroxine

Transitional issues
- Monitor INR on Thursday [**2118-8-18**] (goal INR [**3-18**]) - needs warfarin
titration
- Needs BiPAP when it is approved by Mass Health
- follow up with primary care physician and pulmonologist
