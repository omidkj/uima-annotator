Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin / Morphine / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Pulmonary edema, intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
85 y/o with hx of CVA in the past and baseline left sided
weakness who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with abdominal
pain.  CT scan at BIN revealed uncomplicated diverticulitis, and
was started on zosyn.  She received 600cc of fluid in setting of
IV contrast (pt w/ Cr of 2.2 at BIN) and developed respiratory
distress with BP of 209/90 per report. This was thought to be
flash pulmonary edema, and was treated with 60mg IV lasix and
nitro paste.  Also received ASA.  Pt was sedated with propofol
as well as receiving several doses of ativan and was intubated.
No ABG obtained at that time.  Pt then apparently developed
hypotension, possibly in setting of lasix, nitro and propofol,
and was started on levophed at 0.03.  R IJ and 2 18's were
placed, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] propofol ggt was stopped and started on
fent/versed.  On admission, vitals were BP: 99/69, HR: 74, RR
23.  Lactate 2.7. Vent settings were AC:  TV-500, 5 PEEP, 100%
FiO2.  ABG was 7.32/45/171 on these settings.

Pt also had EKG at BIN which showed Lateral ST depressions, and
upright T waves.  Repeat at [**Hospital1 18**] showed TWI in AVL, V5-V6.
Troponin noted at 1.51 on admission.

Vitals on transfer to ICU: T:99.0, HR: 81, BP: 144/72, RR: 16,
100% on vent. On 0.02 of levophed.

Past Medical History:
-Right caudate CVA presumptively embolic
-GERD
-Hypertension
-Gait ataxia
-Low back pain with history of laminectomy
-History of pneumonia
-Trigeminal neuralgia

Social History:

[**9-19**] blood cultures x 2: NGTD
.
[**9-22**] CXR:
Pulmonary edema has resolved. There are low lung volumes with
bibasilar
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary effusions.
Cardiomegaly
is stable. There are no new lung abnormalities.
.
[**9-21**] TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.
peak velocity: 3.3 m/s; peak gradient 44; valve area 1.1 cm2

[**9-19**] EKG:
Possible ectopic atrial rhythm. Left axis deviation may be due
to left anterior
fascicular block, although is non-diagnostic. Anterolateral lead
ST-T wave
changes are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2185-9-17**]
ectopic atrial
rhythm and further ST-T wave changes are both now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F yo F p/w diverticulitis c/b shock and respiratory failure
after receiving IVF.  She was intubated for presumed pulmonary
edema c/b post-intubation/lasix hypotension and elevated cardiac
biomarkers in the setting of critical AS.
.
# Shock:  Likely both cardiogenic and septic - secondary to IVF
followed by lasix, nitro paste in the setting of critical AS and
patient being volume depleted from diverticulitis and having a
UTI.  Pt was weaned off pressors.  Pt was then started on lasix
ggt with good output and stable BPs.  Patient likely pre-load
dependent given critical AS. She completed a 7-day course of
cefepime, flagyl, and vancomycin - which provided coverage for
UTI, pneumonia, and diverticulitis.
.
# Critical AS, improved to Moderate AS: Valve area 1.1 cm2 on
TTE [**9-21**], consistent with moderate AS once she was no longer
septic.  Likely cause of pulmonary edema and subsequent
hypotension in setting of fluid shifts.  Pt had hypertensive
episode and had acute pulmonary edema secondary to aortic
stenosis.  Cardiology was consulted and patient was not
considered for replacement valve or valvuloplasty at that time
because of her critical condition at the time.  She was
scheduled for follow-up with cardiology - Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
#Respiratory failure:   Flash pulmonary edema with xray showing
bilateral pleural effusions and edema.  Likely secondary to
critical AS. The patient was diuresed with lasix ggt to optimize
volume status before extubation.  Goal diuresis of negative [**11-20**]
liters was met on multiple days and pt respiratory status
improved.  Her RSBI score gradually decreased and she was able
to tolerate PSV settings while being weaned off of sedation.  Pt
was eventually extubated, but shortly after extubation, she
began to have stridor.  We administered racemic epi, and heliox,
but ultimately pt was reintubated.  She was given 48 hours and
then another tri
