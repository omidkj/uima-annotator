Pelvic US [**7-10**]: IMPRESSION: No definite intrauterine gestation.
Based on imaging, differential diagnosis include complete
abortion, ectopic or early pregnancy. Given history of
misscarriage, the contents in the uterine cavity likely
represents blood
and debris without evidence of retained products of conception.

CT C/A/P [**7-10**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Patchy peribronchovascular opacity within the right upper
lobe and
superior segement of left upper lobe, concerning for an
infectious process. Bilateral dependent atelectasis and small
pleural effusions.

2.  Subcentimeter hypodensity within the left kidney too small
to
characterize.

3.  Asymmetric and Heterogeneous enhancement of the uterus,
presumably
reflecting post-operative changes. Suboptimal opacification of
gonadal veins to evaluate for thrombophlebitis.

4. Fluid and gas within the endocervial canal, likley related to
D and C,
however cannot rule out infection. Trace free fluid is seen
within the cul-
de-sac, unchanged from ultrasound from same day.

5.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt hypotensive and tachycardic in the ED with a fever to 103,
admitted to the ICU for septic abortion and taken to the OR for
D&C which demonstrated minimal retained products, (path
pending).  Continued on amp/gent/clinda post-op.  Post-op, a CT
of the torso demonstrated a RUL opacity consistent with
pneumonia.  Levaquin added, no O2 required.  Received 2U pRBCs
on POD#1 with stabilization of blood pressure.  Complained of
chest pain and was ruled out for MI with negative troponins x 3.
 Called out of the ICU on POD#1 after significant improvement in
pain, decreased temperature and return of appetite.  On
discharge, pt eating regular diet, WBC normalized, Hct stable.
PPD placed prior to discharge with plan to follow up result as
outpatient.  Discharged on Levaquin 500x7d for pneumonia,
Doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for PID.
