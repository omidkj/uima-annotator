Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus.
No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic
function. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction
abnormality/ventricular pacing.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Mild [1+] TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

 N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
lateral akinesis (including the basal inferior wall) and
anterior/antero-septal and apical hypokinesis (suggestive of
multivessel CAD). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**4-18**] Mr. [**Known lastname 90187**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass grafting
times four (LIMA to LAD, SVG to Dx, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA).
Please see the operative note for details.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable
condition to the intensive care unit. His AICD was interrogated
by the electrophysiology service.  He was weaned from pressors
and extubated by post-operative day one.  Epicardial wires and
chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the step down
floor by the following day.  He was seen in consultation by the
physical therapy service for strength and consitioning and an
interim rehab stay was recommended.  He was started on
betablockers and diuresed toward his preoperative weight. His
stain therpay was also resumed. He experienced post-op confusion
which cleared when narcotics were discontinued. By
post-operative day six he was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital 3548**]
[**Hospital 3549**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 1110**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90189**].  All follow-up appointments
were advised.
