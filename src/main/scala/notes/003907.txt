CXR [**2102-3-13**]
 There are extensive bilateral upper zone opacities
with air bronchograms suggestive of pneumonia, previously
diagnosed at an
outside hospital. Outside hospital imaging was not available for
direct
comparison. Left hemidiaphragm is not visualized and suggests
left lower
field atelectasis and/or pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo female with afib, CHF (EF 30-35%), and metastatic colon
cancer undergoing palliative chemotherapy transferred from BIDN
for hypoxia in the context of bilateral multifocal pneumonia
seen on CXR.

She was initially started on vancomycin, levaquin and cefepime
for HCAP. Overnight she became progressively dyspneic and
hypoxic. In the morning, she was started on BiPAP to assist with
breathing. Around 11am, she was found to have right sided
hemiplegia and dysphasia, with a constricted right pupil,
suggesting that she had had a large hemispheric CVA. This
information was explained to her health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
The decision was made to pursue Comfort Measures Only and all
treatment was stopped. She was taken off the BiPAP and given a
morphine drip and ativan for comfort. She expired at 13:31. The
medical examiner was notified as she died within 24 hours of
admission. An autopsy was waved and also declined by next of
[**Doctor First Name **], her sister [**Name (NI) 43726**] [**Name (NI) 74569**].
