Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizzy and diaphoretic with EKG changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-7-20**] Coronary artery bypass graft x4 (Left internal mammary
artery > left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft >
diagonal, saphenous vein graft > RAMUS, saphenous vein graft >
obtuse marginal) and MAZE, resection of left atrial appendage


History of Present Illness:
73 year old man has a history of lone atrial fibrillation was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2134-6-17**] with a recurrence of
atrial fibrillation. He had been exercising at the gym when he
suddenly felt dizzy and diaphoretic. He noted
his heart rate at 140-160 bpm. The episode lasted around an
hour. EMS was activated and an EKG by EMT's was reported to show
ST depression in V3 through V6 with a heart rate of 162 bpm. He
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm by the time he arrived
to the emergency room. Troponin was indeterminate at 0.08.
Stress echo was completed during the admission. This was
negative for chest pain. Echo imaging revealed mild hypokinesis
of the mid and apical septal segments with exercise. In terms of
symptoms, he report feeling very well without chest discomfort,
shortness of breath, fatigue or change in his activity
tolerance. He was referred for left heart catheterization to
further evaluate. He was found to have coronary artery disease
and is now being
referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
with normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**2-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and brought to the operating room for
coronary artery bypass graft, MAZE and LAA ligation.  See
operative report for further details.  He received Cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and transferred to the intensive care
unit for post operative management.  That evening he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
without complications.  On post operative day one he was started
on beta-blockers and diuretics.  Later that evening he was
transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility.  Chest tubes and epicardial wires were
removed per protocol.  Coumadin was started for his afib.  By
post-operative day 4 he was discharged to home with coumadin
follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  All follow-up appointments were
advised.
