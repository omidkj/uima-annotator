Pertinent Results:
[**2146-12-30**] - CXR: The tracheostomy is in place with its tip
approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. The right chest tube was
inserted after recent surgery. The fifth rib is partially
resected as a part of the surgery as well. There is no evidence
of pneumothorax. The lungs are well aerated bilaterally. There
is no appreciable pleural effusion.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The epidural
anesthesia
catheter tip is projecting over the level of the T10. Right
chest wall
subcutaneous air is small.

[**2147-1-4**] - CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-3**],
there is again a small right apical pneumothorax, with area of
consolidation involving the right upper and lower lung zones.
There may also be a small patchy area of opacification in the
retrocardiac region on the left.
Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Of incidental note is gas
within soft tissues along the lower right chest and upper
abdomen wall.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84405**] was admitted to the SICU on [**2146-12-30**] following her
tracheobronchoplasty.  The following is a summary of her
hospital course from [**12-30**] until her discharge to rehab on [**1-5**]:

Neuro:  Epidural placed prior to surgery on [**12-30**] was split to
bupivicaine and a dilaudid PCA on POD #1 for optimization of
pain control.  Her postoperative pain control regimen was
expanded to include toradol, as well as PO tylenol and ultram
once she was tolerating POs, and she was ultimately transitioned
to MS contin [**Hospital1 **] with percocet for breakthrough pain.  Her pain
control did improve steadily however she continues to have some
discomfort at the incision site, especially with coughing or
movement.

CV:  She was hemodynamically stable throughout this admission,
and she was started on her home dose of lasix.

Resp:  Aggressive pulmonary toilet was initiated immediately
postop, and she was weaned off CPAP to trach mask on POD #1.
She continued to tolerate trach mask for increasing periods of
time each postoperative day, and at time of discharge she was
requiring only minimal periods of CPAP support overnight.  She
was proactive in using her incentive spirometer and getting out
of bed.  She continued to have a moderate amount of clear
secretions and underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2147-1-5**] which did not
demonstrate any abnormality or mucus plugging.  She was
continued on her home nebulizer treatments.

GI:  She was kept NPO following surgery until she underwent a
formal speech and swollow evaluation on [**1-2**].  Her diet was
advanced to pureed solids and thin liquids at that time, which
she tolerated well.

GU:  Foley catheter was discontinued following removal of the
epidural catheter, and she voided on her own without difficulty.
 She was continued on her home dose of lasix 20mg PO daily.

Heme:  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
admission and did not require any transfusions of blood
products; her discharge day Hct was 34.2.

ID:  She received 3 doses total of perioperative cefazolin.  She
had a low-grade fever of 101.3 on POD #1 which was treated with
tylenol.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent on [**12-31**]
which demonstrated no growth, and she remained afebrile with a
normal WBC from POD #2 until the time of discharge.

Endo:  She was started on an insulin sliding scale in the
perioperative period though her blood sugars remained normal or
near-normal and insulin was not required.

Tubes/lines/drains:  A right-sided chest tube was removed on
[**2147-1-3**] and CXR demonstrated a tiny pneumothorax which remained
stable on CXR over the next two days.  At time of discharge she
has a peripheral IV and a tracheostomy tube.

Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on heparin 5000 Units SC TID
for PE prophylaxis and she continued her home omeprazole for GI
prophylaxis.
