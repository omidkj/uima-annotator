Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
for decreased oxygen saturation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old white
female with a history of coronary artery disease (status post
coronary artery bypass graft with a complicated postoperative
course) who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for
worsening oxygen dependence and respiratory distress.

The patient initially underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft on [**2113-10-27**] after cardiac catheterization
showed a significant left main and 3-vessel disease.  Her
postoperative course was immediately complicated by
hypotension and atrial fibrillation requiring an amiodarone
drip and a long course of pressors.  The pressors were
continued until approximately postoperative days 15 to 16 for
presumed septic shock.

The course was further complicated by a gastrointestinal
bleed with subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2113-12-3**] showing esophagitis and gastritis.  The patient
failed to wean from the ventilator and underwent an operative
tracheostomy after failing a bedside attempt.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation for ventilator weaning, but was transferred
back several days later with maroon stools.  The patient was
transferred and hematocrit remained stable.  A colonoscopy at
an outside hospital prior to that had revealed
diverticulosis, so no colonoscopy was performed at that time.
The patient was transferred back to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

Over the last one month, the patient has been at [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation for chronic anemia apparently making minimal
progress.  A chest x-ray was performed one week ago for fever
and leukocytosis, which reportedly revealed bilateral
pneumonia.  The patient appears to have been started on
vancomycin, gentamicin, nebulizer, and Unasyn at that time
with the sputum culture growing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and Acetobactor.  The white blood cell
count trended down, but the sputum remained thick and had
grown progressively bloody with suctioning.

Over the last 24 hours, the patient has desaturated on
multiple times requiring increasing FIO2 (from 0.4 to 1)
progressively with arterial blood gas showing 7.47/47/53
while on 50% FIO2.  The patient's sputum has grown purulent
and more sanguinous.

At the time of transfer, the patient was on intermittent
mandatory ventilation, respiratory rate was 22 to 35, blood
pressure was 140/70, oxygen saturation was 95% on 100% FIO2.

The patient currently appears to deny chest pain, shortness
of breath, and pain but was not very interactive.  Prior to
admission, outside notes suggestive of prior treatment for
cellulitis around the gastrojejunostomy tube site.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2113-10-20**].
 2.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Echocardiogram on [**2113-11-4**] showed an ejection
fraction of 40% to 50% with 2+ mitral regurgitation.
 4.  Congestive heart failure.
 5.  Status post tracheostomy for an inability to wean.
 6.  Status post endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube placement.
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed with an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2113-11-22**] showing
esophagitis and gastritis.
 9.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2113-11-19**];
transfusion and hematocrit remained stable.
10.  Diverticulosis.
11.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (no pulmonary
function tests on record).
12.  Right total knee replacement.
13.  Hypercholesterolemia.
14.  A questionable history of ventricular tachycardia.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
 1.  NPH 20 units subcutaneously q.h.s.
 2.  A regular insulin sliding-scale.
 3.  Prevacid 30 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube every day.
 4.  Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s.
 5.  Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Multivitamin 5 mL p.o. q.d.
 7.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Atrovent nebulizer every 2 hours as needed.
 9.  Albuterol nebulizer every 2 hours as needed.
10.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. to b.i.d.
11.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12.  Vancomycin 1 g intravenously q.d.
13.  Unasyn 3 g intravenously q.6h.
14.  Gentamicin 80-mg nebulizer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco use.  Denies
alcohol use.  Currently at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation; was
living at home prior to her transfer there status post
coronary artery bypass graft.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature was 98.1,
heart rate was 78, respiratory rate was 22, blood pressure
was 153/57, oxygen saturation was 96% to 100%.  Ventilator AC
16/500/0.6/5.  Breathing at a rate of 19.  Peak inspiratory
pressure was 37 and plateau pressure was 31.  In general, the
patient was a diaphoretic, mildly tachypneic, an minimally
interactive female.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed no oropharyngeal lesions.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  No icterus.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No rubs or
gallops.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border without radiation.  No jugular venous
distention.  Mild bilateral peripheral pitting edema.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds at
both bases (the left worse than right), coarse rales in the
lower two thirds of the right lung field and lower one half
of the left lung field.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Gastrojejunostomy tube
located in left upper quadrant.  Mild erythema around the
site, no exudate.  Neurologic examination revealed alert and
oriented to name.  The patient moved all extremities and
voiced words; although she could not talk because she was on
the ventilator.  The patient could follow basic commands.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratory data on admission revealed sodium was 140,
potassium was 3.7, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 29, blood
urea nitrogen was 33, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose
was 174.  White blood cell count was 12.2, platelets were
263, and hematocrit was 32.3.  INR was 1.2 and partial
thromboplastin time was 22.4.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was suggestive of bilateral
congestive heart failure with pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit and was diuresed with intravenous Lasix.  Her
ventilator was set at AC 10/500/40/5.  She was briefly
switched to pressure support but did not tolerate it and was
placed back on assist control.  She was diuresed with Lasix
intravenously 40 mg every day to twice per day and initially
put one liter out.  Then her creatinine bumped to 1.4 and
further diuresis was held.  She was maintained on the above
ventilator setting (AC 10/500/4/5) she did not desaturate and
reported that she was comfortably breathing.

After her creatinine dropped to 1.2, diuresis was attempted
again with oral Lasix, and again her creatinine bumped to 1.4
(with a blood urea nitrogen of 33), and so further diuresis
was held.

On the day prior to discharge, the patient's urine output
remained at 20 cc per hour, so she was gently hydrated with
250 cc of normal saline.  This did not cause her any
respiratory discomfort.

Her course of vancomycin was due to be completed on [**2114-1-7**], and her Unasyn course was due to be complained on
the day prior to her admission to [**Hospital1 190**]; however, both antibiotics were continued to
the day of discharge.  The patient did not appear clinically
infected, did not have any leukocytosis or fever and was not
coughing an excessive amount.

Because some blood was removed from the tube with suctioning,
the patient was offered a bronchoscopy but flatly refused.
She was also offered thoracentesis for her bilateral pleural
effusions, but she flatly refused this intervention also.
She also refused to allow us to place a central venous triple
lumen catheter as well as an arterial line.  However, she did
consent to allow a peripherally inserted central catheter
line to be placed.
