History of Present Illness:
CC:  73 yo Hispanic man admitted to Holding Area from exercise
lab due to EKG changes and chest pain during outpt ETT today.

HPI: Information obtained from pt. with assistance of
interpreter services. This 73 yo man with no known prior hx CAD,
reports overall good health. Approximately 3 months ago, he
noted the onset of chest pressure associated with physical
activity. He also had periods of DOE both with and without chest
pressure. He works as a janitor. Initially symptoms were
infrequent and relieved by rest. Over the past month he has had
2-3 episodes of chest pain per week. Symptoms relieved by rest.
He was referred for ETT today by PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1789**]. He completed
11.5 min of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol. Stopped due to symptoms
of chest pressure and fatigue. EKG showed 2.25 mm ST segment
horizontal down sloping in the inferolateral leads. There were T
wave inversions leads V2-V5 noted during the recovery phase. Nuc
imaging revealed nl LV size, mild systolic dysfunction, and
distal anterior HK.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
Headaches

Social History:
Employed custodian. Lives with his son. [**Name (NI) **] his son is not
able to help with discharge to home due to work schedule. No
current tobacco (Quit 30 years ago) or ETOH use.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2107-8-9**] 2:27 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate ptx
CXR, TWO FILMS

HISTORY: Status post CABG.

FINDINGS: Sternotomy noted. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions and thickening of the fissures. The bibasilar
atelectasis shows considerable improvement compared to the
previous examination of [**2107-8-7**]. No heart failure.

CONCLUSION: Status post CABG. Improving bilateral pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

PRELIMINARY REPORT

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Abnormal ECG. Aortic valve disease. Coronary artery
disease. Left ventricular function. Mitral valve disease.
Valvular heart disease.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2107-8-5**] at 13:59
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007AW02-:
Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 40% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Off Pump CABG
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is
seen in the RA. Dynamic interatrial septum. No ASD or PFO by 2D,
color Doppler
or saline contrast with maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderately depressed
LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Physiologic MR (within
normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. Suboptimal image quality -
poor echo
windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast
with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= XX
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial
effusion.

 Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2107-8-5**]  5:47:06 PM


Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beat. Low limb lead QRS
voltage, is
non-specific. Modest right precordial lead/anterior T wave
changes are
non-specific and unstable baseline makes assessment difficult.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2107-8-3**] sinus
bradycardia is absent, ventricular ectopy and precordial T wave
changes are now
seen.

coronary artery disease. Given these findings, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical mananagement. Mr.
