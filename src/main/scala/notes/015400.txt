Brief Hospital Course:
1. s/p [**2186**]2 yo F s/p fall from standing and hit back of head and neck on
furniture, developed neck pain and then taken to [**Hospital **]
Hospital. CT revealed C1 anterior and posterior arch fx and base
of odontoid fx.  Neurosurgery was following.  Her CT c-spine
confirmed the type 2 odontoid fracture.  After extensive
evaluation neurosurgery felt that her best treatment choice
would be non-surgical in which whe will wear her hard c-collar
at all times for 6 mos.

2. Pulmonary
Pt was given Morphine at OSH, developed stridors/resp distress
and was intubated and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Her vitals
continued to improve to the point she was weaned and then
extubated 2d later.  However, 12 hours after extubation, she
went into respiratory distress/stridors and was re-intubated.
Pt then slowly stabilized. A tracheostomy was performed on
[**2186-4-5**] for failed extubation.  She remained stable following
her surgery and throughout the rest of her hospital stay.

3. ID
Her CXR showed a LLL atelectasis and she continued to have low
grade temperatures and leukocytosis.  Bl Cx have been NTD.
Urine was +MRSA & Sputum Cx +MRSA and was therefore placed on
vancomycin.  A PICC line was placed and she was d/c'ed with 2
weeks of vancomycin.

4. FEN
A nutrition consult was placed.  Pt was being given tube feeds c
fiber at 60cc for goal.  She was then taken to the OR for an
open gastrotomy-jejunostomy tube placement on [**2186-4-5**].  There
were no complications with the procedure and the patient
remained stable throughout the rest of her hospital stay.
