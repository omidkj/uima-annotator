Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, CP, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking male with h/o CHF, CAD s/p CABG in
[**2137**] and revision in [**2147**], PPM for sick sinus s/p replacement 6
weeks ago and AS s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] who presented to the ED with worsening
SOB, chest pain x 2 days.

He was increasingly short of breath with fevers.  He denied
cough but complained of chest pain x 1 day.  He also had
reportedly been consuming a high sodium diet.

In the ED, he had O2 sats in the 80's and was placed on BiPap,
nitro gtt and given Lasix.  He remained hypoxic and was
intubated.  He was also reportedly given ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin and ASA.  He was then admitted to the CCU and
continued diuresis.  There was some question of whether he had a
pneumonia on CXR and he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  Blood cultures grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas and
his Abx were changed to cefepime and azithro.  He also complains
of pain at the pacer site.  He has had negative Cks and
troponins.  ECG showed paced rhythm with "memory T waves" per
CCU team.  He was extubated yesterday without complication.

Today he states he remembers feeling SOB at home and had pain at
his pacer site.  Cannot give the timeframe of his symptoms.
Also endorses chest pain.  States he does not remember coming to
the hospital and "must have lost consciousness."  Now he denies
SOB, cough, urinary symptoms.  Endorses abdominal pain due to
constipation and complains his home regimen is not being given
to him.  He also endorses left-sided chest pain, worse with
inspiration.

Studies:

[**2155-5-7**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a single ventricularly
paced beat. Right bundle-branch block and left anterior
fascicular block. Non-specific precordial T wave inversions may
be related to the right bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2155-3-28**] native rhythm is now seen

[**2155-5-7**] Chest Xray: 1. Suboptimal study due to patient motion
and a repeat is suggested.  2. Relative mild haziness of the
right lung fields may relate to patient motion, although
interstitial edema or infectious process cannot be excluded.
Possible minimal right pleural effusion.

[**2155-5-9**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction.

[**2155-5-12**] Ankle Xray: In comparison with the study of [**2154-12-27**],
there is no interval change. Extensive vascular calcification is
again consistent with diabetes.  No evidence of bony or joint
space abnormality or appreciable soft tissue swelling. Multiple
surgical clips are seen in the soft tissues medially. Although
there is no definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis, if
this is a serious clinical concern, MRI could be considered.

[**2155-5-12**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Moderate right and small left-sided pleural effusion. Right
lower lung base opacity likely represents associated compressive
atelectasis, however, superimposed pneumonia cannot be
completely excluded and should be considered in the correct
clinical setting.
2. Prominence of left intrahepatic duct and common bile duct is
unchanged
since [**2154-12-22**].
3. Multiple stable bilateral renal cysts.
4. Air in the bladder likely secondary to recent
instrumentation.

[**2155-5-13**]: Chest Xray: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], there
is little change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette in a patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in
place. Blunting of both costophrenic angles persist, though
there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
congestion. Residual contrast material is seen within the colon.


[**2155-5-13**]: CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities. However, a small acute infarction could be
difficult to detect in the setting of multiple previous chronic
infarctions. If clinically indicated, MRI with and without
contrast would be helpful to detect a new infarction and to
assess for septic emboli.

[**2155-5-13**]: CTA Head/Neck: 1. Hemodynamically significant
atherosclerotic stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral
artery and of the intracranial right vertebral artery.
2. No acute vascular abnormalities of the cervical and
intracranial arteries including no evidence of occlusion,
dissection or aneurysm.
3. For further evaluation of the intracranial structures, please
see
non-enhanced CT of the head from the same date.

[**2155-5-14**]: TEE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium and left atrial appendage but no
mass/thrombus. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium
or right atrial appendage. Catheter/pacemaker leads are seen in
the right atrium and right ventricle wthout associated
vegetation/thrombus. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal disc motion. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen
(may be normal for this prosthesis). The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is s
