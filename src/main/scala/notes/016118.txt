Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise and weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 2894**] [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year-old woman with history of CAD,
systolic CHF (EF 40%), peripheral [**Known lastname 1106**] disease,
insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who
presents from home with malaise and increasing shortness of
breath.

She felt short of breath and weak at home this afternoon at
about 3 p.m. She felt that her legs were weak. She could not
endorse any change in urine output. She has felt short of breath
at this time and had some chest pressure at the upper part of
her sternum. This chest pressure occurred when she was sitting
at the dining table - she lay over the bed. It did not resolve
so her husband called EMS. Her pain had begun to resolve by her
arrival.

In the ED, she was found to be bradycardic with HR in the 40s
and a systolic blood pressure that dropped from 130 to 80s. Her
initial potassium was 7.8, non-hemolyzed, with a creatinine of
3.7 up from baseline 1.8 to 2.0. EKG revealed junctional rhythm
with slightly peaked t-waves. She was given atropine 0.5 mg x1
with increase in heart rate to 70s and systolic blood pressure
to 110s. Her hyperkalemia was treated with 2g calcium gluconate,
10 units insulin and one amp D50. Additionally she was given 30
grams of kayexalate.

Of note, the patient was admitted on [**2168-1-22**] for hyperkalemia.
While inpatient, she was found to have an NSTEMI. Cath showed
non-intervenable two vessel disease, which was managed medically
with beta blocker, aspirin, plavix, statin and blood pressure
control.  She was also treated for CHF exacerbation.  The
patient was admitted again on [**2168-2-10**] for fatigue and
generalized weakness, thought to be due to a combination of poor
glycemic control, orthostasis, and deconditioning.

She was more recently admitted from [**3-1**] to [**3-12**] for shortness
of breath. Pneumonia was diagnosed radiographically and she was
started on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime, expanded to include
Levoquin subsequently. Tracheobronchomalacia was noted on CT.
Nebulizer treatements and diuresis (Lasix 40 mg IV Q6H, then DC
on 60 mg PO QD) also helped improve her respiratory status and
O2 was weaned to 2L of NC and she was discharged to rehab. That
admission was also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure
(2.3 from baseline 1.6), which seems to have be attributed to
poor forward flow, pre-renal azotemia. NSTEMI occurred on the
second day of admission, attributed to strain, without
intevention but requiring a stay in the CCU. It was medically
managed with ASA, Carvedilol, Plavix, Simvastatin, Integrillin,
and a Heparin gtt as her coronaries were not amenable to
intervention. Her enzymes subsequently trended down and she
remained chest pain free for the remainder of her hospital stay.


On [**2168-5-4**], the patient could not be roused by her husband. [**Name (NI) **]
called EMS and she was found to be hypoglycemic. She presented
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was given dextrose. UTI was treated with
Bactrim, which she took.

EKG ([**2168-5-9**]):
Baseline artifact. Junctional or other supraventricular
bradycardia. Possible inferior myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Since the previous tracing of [**2168-3-3**] the
rate is slower, P waves are less apparent and ST-T wave
abnormalities are now less prominent.

EKG ([**2168-5-11**]):
Sinus rhythm with slight A-V conduction delay. Left atrial
abnormality. Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction
although is non-diagnostic.
Modest non-specific ST-T wave changes. Since the previous
tracing of [**2168-5-10**] the rate is slower, inferior lead Q waves
appear more prominent but there may be no significant change and
precordial lead T waves are less prominent.

CXR ([**2168-5-9**]):
FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. An
overlying EKG lead and an external pacer wire project over the
patient. Low lung volumes limits evaluation. Cardiomegaly is
noted with pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] prominence likely indicating mild
failure. Small pleural effusions cannot be entirely excluded.
The retrocardiac region is difficult to assess though the
remaining areas of both lungs demonstrate no evidence of
pneumonia. Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob
is noted. Tiny clips are noted to the right of the tra
