Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3948**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers to 101 and increased SOB.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-8-11**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
of secretions.
[**2129-8-9**] Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 46 year old female with history of breast
cancer, thyroid cancer, and Hodgkins status post XRT who first
presented with a pleural effusion on [**2129-6-13**].  She had a
thoracentesis and  thorascopy with pleuradesis on [**2129-6-23**].  She
had trapped lung following htis procedure, requiring
decortication ([**2129-6-28**]) and chest tube placement.  She developed
a post-operative fever and was treated for pneumonia with
vancomycin/zosyn --> augmentin on discharge (completed [**2129-7-11**]).
  She re-presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-7-29**] with fevers and shortness
of breath and was discharged on [**8-7**] with vancomycin for MRSA
empyema.
.
She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday with fevers to 101, hemoptysis
with occasional clots, and increasing shortness of breath.
There were blood clots present in her sputum. She denied chest
pain, LE edema.
.
Patient is on anticoagulation with lovenox for mechanical aortic
valve which was held last night.  She was given Vanco/Zosyn for
empiric treatment for pneumonia.  She had a bronchoscopy today
which showed diffuse bleeding on the right side.  A small amount
of bleeding that resolved was seen on the left side.
.
Following bronchoscopy, patient went to bathroom and developed
shorntess of breath patient was increased from 4 to 6LNC of
oxygen.  She was coughing, but denied hemoptysis.  She reported
shortness of breath.  She denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, or any other symptoms.


Past Medical History:
Left lower lobe effusion s/p [**2129-7-29**] Pigtail catheter placement
into the left pleural space
[**2129-6-23**] Pleuoscopy, drainage left pleural effusion, biopsy
[**2129-6-24**] Left video assisted thoracoscopy converted to
left thoracotomy, decortication of lung, also placement of
pneumoperitoneum catheter.
Hodgkin's disease, status post XRT and lymphadenectomy.
Breast Cancer s/p bilateral mastectomy & bilateral
reconstruction
hypothyroidism s/p total thyroidectomy in [**2122**] for bilateral
papillary carcinoma.
s/p Aortic replacement mechanical [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] for radiation-induced
valvular disease in [**2123-8-24**].



Social History:
The patient does not smoke. She drinks alcohol occasionally. She
is married, but has no children. She owns a gift store.


Family History:
Family history is negative for breast cancer.


Physical Exam:
VS: T: 98.2    HR: 106 SR    BP: 160/80    Sats: 96% RA
General: 46 year-old female in no apparent distress
HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy
Card: RRR good click, normal S1,S2 no murmur/gallop/rub
Resp: decreased breath sounds bilateral
GI: benign
Extr: warm no edema
Incision: well healed, pigtail site no discharge
Neuro: non-focal


Pertinent Results:
[**2129-8-19**] Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked improvement of diffuse airspace consolidation and
opacity in the
right lung, consistent with resolving hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged appearance of left-sided pigtail catheter; little
decrease
in small left pleural collection, probably hemorrhagic.
3. Improving left lower lobe hematoma.

[**8-11**] CTA chest/ abd/ pelvis: There is no evidence of any active
bleeding or extravasation of contrast into the pleural space or
into the abdomen. Minimal free fluid in the abdomen is of a
simple fluid attenuation and is not blood. It is not bloody in
nature.

[**8-8**] Ct: Worsening of diffuse airspace opacities in the right
lung from

[**2129-7-31**]. These may represent worsening multifocal pneumonia.
However, superimposed edema or hemorrhage can't be excluded.
Left lower lobe nodular opacities similar in appearance from
prior study. Left loculated pleural effusion is smaller with
pigtail catheter centered in the effusion. Assessment for
empyema limited without IV contrast.

CXR
[**8-20**] The right lung base shows a  peribronchial area of
consolidation that is likely to represent pneumonia. In the
retrocardiac lung areas, sparse air bronchograms and a subtle
pleural effusion is seen. Here another consolidation could be
present. No hilar or mediastinal enlargement. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.

CXR [**8-8**]:  B/l diffuse airspace opacities which may reflect
worsed multifocal pna; superimposed pulm edema/hmg cant be ruled
out/ no effussions.

[**2129-7-31**]. These may represent worsening multifocal
pneumonia.However, superimposed edema or hemorrhage can't be
excluded. Left lower lobe nodular opacities similar in
appearance from prior study. Left loculated pleural effusion is
smaller with pigtail catheter centered in the effusion.
