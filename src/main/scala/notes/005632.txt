Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 yo M with a PMH significant for NIDCM (EF 25% in
[**2175**]), pAF on coumadin, stage IV CKD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia
who presents with 1 week of progressive shortness of breath and
wheezing. The patient was in his normal state of health until
one week prior to admission when he noticed mild shortness of
breath associated with exertion. Since then, this shortness of
breath has been progressive and now occurs with only slight
activities. The patient also notes audible wheezing during these
episodes and he has had to sit frequently in order to catch his
breath. The patient endorses stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND,
no palpitations, no chest pain, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
The patient notes medication compliance. He does not follow a
low salt diet and he frequently eats KFC.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies recent illnesses,
cough, sputum production, rhonorrhea, diarrhea, stomach upset,
or dysuria. The patient endorses a decreased appetite, 15 pound
unintentional weight loss over the last two months, urinary
frequency, and nocturia. He had a gout flare one month prior.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99.8 74 124/67 18 94% RA. The
patient had a CXR done that showed central pulmonary edema. He
was given 40mg IV lasix and placed on NRB. The patient also
recieved 1 dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for his
leukocytosis. The patient recieved a Duoneb. On arrival to the
floor, the patient is comfortable and would like to order
dinner. After 2 hours, the patient became more tachypnic,
desaturations to 85%, and increased wheezes and crackles. The
patient was deemes to require BiPap for pulmonary edema and was
transfered to the CCU overnight for monitoring. The next day,
the patient was transfered back to the floor for further
management.

Reports:

[**5-26**] CXR: FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart is
moderately enlarged. The hilar and mediastinal contours are
within normal limits. There is central pulmonary vascular
congestion with mild interstitial edema. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Intrafissural fluid is also
seen on the lateral view.
IMPRESSION: Central pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
interstitial
edema.

[**5-27**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40%)
with basal inferior and mid inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis
with mild to moderate global hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size is dilated and free wall motion is borderline
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-1-29**],
biventricular systolic function appears more vigorous. Estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85 yo M with a PMH of NIDCM (EF 25% --> 40%), HTN,
CKD stage V who presents with progressive shortness of breath,
wheeze, and pulmonary edema diagnosed with an acute CHF
exacerbation. The patient required BiPap transiently in the CCU
before being managed on the floor.
.
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: NIDCM,
BNP 30,000. Last TTE showed EF 25%. Repeat TTE showed EF 40%.
The likely etiology of his heart failure exacerbation is dietary
indiscretion and worsening renal failure. The patient required
BiPap in the CCU for pulmonary edema, but was weaned off
quickly. He was also placed on a lasix gtt and his crackles
improved and he was breathing comfortably on RA after diuresis
of about 5L total. He was switched to his home dose of 20mg PO
lasix with the hope to keep him euvolemic and prevent further
decline in his GFR. The patient will also be discharged on an
increased dose of Coreg 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], and hydralazine 50mg TID.
The patient is not on an ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] due to ESRD.
.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine up from a baseline
of [**5-14**].5 to a discharge Cr 6.1. The patient is still able to
control his volume status and electrolytes at this point.
However, his CH
