Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation w/ RVR


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84F with PMH of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, s/p kyphoplasty
[**1-15**] for L1 compression fracture presenting after being found
down by her house cleaner this AM. She is hungry and thirsty but
otherwise has no acute complaints. She was soiled with stool.
She has been on the floor for an unclear length of time - she
reports anything between a few hours and a few days. She feels
extremely weak and has no strength. She reports that she had not
been eating or drinking for an unclear period of time.  She is
able to answer questions appropriately for the most part, but
also says that she was attending crazy meetings at a conference.
On exam has dry mucous membranes and Afib with RVR to 170s. Has
not taken atenolol in several days.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 97.8 120 109/72 18 95% RA. On exam
looked dry. Labs notable for creatinine 0.8 (baseline 0.65 in
[**11/2105**]), CK of 1307, troponin of <0.01, INR of 5.2, lactate of
1.3. UA unremarkable. Urine and blood culture obtained. She was
given 5mgIV metoprolol and 3x25mg PO for heart rate and SBP
dropped to 70s. She was given 3L NS w/ improvement in SBP to
90s. Also unable to get good pleth in ED although no respiratory
complaints. CXR with no acute process. CT head s/ age

.
EKG ([**8-16**]): Rate 153 in a fib. Normal intervals. Severe baseline
artifact, especially in lead V2. Atrial fibrillation with a very
poorly controlled ventricular rate. Diffuse non-specific ST
segment flattening throughout. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2105-12-28**], poorly controlled atrial fibrillation has replaced
sinus rhythm. The frontal plane axis is no longer leftward.
Repolarization abnormalities are similar, although accentuated
by the tachycardia.
.
CT C-spine ([**8-16**]): 1. No cervical spine fracture or evidence of
acute malalignment. 2. Retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 of
indeterminate age with multilevel degenerative disease and
posterior disc osteophyte complexes marginally encroaching on
the central canal from C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 suggesting
chronicity.
.
CT Head ([**8-16**]): 1. No acute intracranial process or evidence of
fracture.
2. Global age-appropriate atrophy with evidence of chronic small
vessel
ischemic disease.
.
lumbosacral spine x-ray: Stable scoliosis and chronic
compression fracture, now post-vertebroplasty of L1. Otherwise,
vertebral bodies appear intact and grossly normally aligned.
.
t-spine: Stable scoliosis and chronic compression fracture, now
post-vertebroplasty of L1. Otherwise, vertebral bodies appear
intact and
grossly normally aligned.
.
cxr: Numerous apparently chronic findings, although prior
studies are
not available for direct comparison. No definite acute traumatic
injury or
other process identified.
.
ECHO ([**8-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated in the
anteroposterior dimension, but appears compressed along the
lateral free wall (extrinsic compression vs lipomatous
hypertrophy/epicardial fat pad). Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum is present The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area not quantitated due to the technically
suboptimal nature of this study). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
MRI/MRA of brain and neck:
1. No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
2. Diffuse volume loss and extensive chronic white matter
disease.
3. No evidence of aneurysm, significant stenosis or vascular
malformation.
4. Limited evaluation of the origin of the left common carotid
and left
vertebral arteries.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical
spine worse at C5-6.
