Admission Date:  [**2153-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-4-13**]

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 52-year-old man, with coronary
artery disease status post one-vessel CABG, MVR, congestive
heart failure with EF 20-25%, who presents with increased
dyspnea on exertion worsened over the last 2 days.  He also
reports increase in fatigue and anorexia over the last month
with approximately a 10 pound weight loss.  He initially
describes the shortness of breath as intermittent and
occurring over the last month, however significantly worsened
over the last few days.  He denies ever having any chest
pain.  He was evaluated by his primary cardiologist and
electively admitted for right heart cath.

On [**2153-3-29**], the patient underwent right heart
catheterization which showed cardiac output 4.13, cardiac
index 2.33, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 46, PA
pressure 73/27.  Left heart catheterization was also
performed which showed widely patent LIMA to LAD with normal
left main, occluded midvessel LAD, midvessel 30% left
circumflex lesion, and luminal irregularities in the RCA.

After the cardiac catheterization, he was admitted to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for tailored CHF management.
Secondary to sedation received in the Cardiac Cath Lab and
increasing hypercapnia, the patient was electively intubated
on [**2153-3-29**].

The patient was extubated on [**2153-3-30**].  However, due to fever
to 103, right lower lobe infiltrate and respiratory distress,
he was reintubated.

Over the course of the next 4 days, the patient was diuresed
with Natrecor for a short period of time, as well as
intravenous lasix.  His cardiac output and index
progressively improved to a point where his cardiac output
was roughly 6, and his index was 3.3.  As his CHF management
was felt to be optimized, he was placed no pressure support
ventilation on numerous occasions and was not deemed able to
be weaned from the ventilator.  He was, therefore,
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
respiratory management and possible tracheostomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure with EF of 20-25%.
2. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2132**],
one-vessel, LIMA to LAD.
3. Status post mitral valve repair x 2 in [**2132**] and [**2143**], with
his last MVR being a St. Jude valve secondary to significant

5. Type 2 diabetes.
6. Duodenal ulcer with history of upper GI bleed.
7. Endocarditis complicated by septic emboli.

PFTs repeated in [**2144**] showed similar FEV1 to FVC ratio with a
total lung capacity of 48%.  PFTs in [**2151**] similarly showed an
FEV1 of 1.39 and FVC of 1.56.
9. History of varicose veins.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT ON [**2153-4-2**] (UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO ADMISSION
NOTE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.):  Temperature 99.3, blood
pressure 91/46, heart rate 77-95, pulmonary artery pressure
53/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12, CVP 12,
ventilated on assist control 500x10, PEEP of 5, FIO2 30% with
SAO2 of 98-100%.  In general, the patient was intubated and
sedated.
HEENT EXAM:  Pupils were equal, round and reactive.  Sclerae
were anicteric.  ET tube and OG tube were in place.
NECK:  Demonstrated a right internal jugular Cordis which was
in place which was clean, dry and intact.  There was a
hematoma tracking into the right scapular area secondary to
traumatic line placement.
THORAX:  Demonstrated limited chest wall movement with
inspiration.  Bilateral rhonchi were noted.  There was a
question of paradoxical movement of the chest wall.
CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION:  An irregularly irregular heart
rate, loud metallic S2, with a III/VI systolic murmur
diffusely across the precordium.
ABDOMEN:  Tense but there was no rebound or guarding.
Normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Showed chronic venous stasis changes bilateral
lower extremities, but there was no edema on exam.  He had
decreased peripheral pulses bilaterally, which have been
noted to be dopplerable in the past.
SKIN:  Demonstrated no other rashes or skin breakdown.  There
were no sacral decubitus ulcers.
NEURO EXAM:  He was awake and alert, and he was following
commands appropriately once sedation was weaned.

LABORATORY VALUES ON [**2153-4-2**]:  White count 12.0 with normal
differential, hematocrit at baseline 39 which decreased to
29, platelets 108, MCV 89, PT 12, INR 1.1, PTT 58, sodium
139, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarb 33, BUN 24,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 110, calcium 8.3, phosphorus 3.4,
magnesium 2.3, ALT 14, AST 33, alk phos 62, total bili 1.4,
hemoglobin A1C 9.0.  Blood cultures [**3-30**] and [**2153-4-1**] were
negative.  Sputum culture from [**3-30**] showed 4+ gram-positive
cocci in pairs, chains and clusters.  However, respiratory
culture showed only moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora.

EKG from [**2153-3-27**] on admission showed atrial fibrillation,
poor R wave progression, low voltage, but essentially
unchanged from EKG dated [**2152-8-25**].

PERTINENT RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS DURING HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CT of the abdomen [**2153-3-31**] showed diffuse bibasilar
central lobular and nodular pulmonary opacities likely
consistent with infectious etiology.  Simple cyst within the
right kidney.  No evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation,
or an abscess within the abdomen.
2. Chest x-ray [**2153-4-1**] showed improving right lower lobe
process related to area of resolving aspiration or pneumonia.
3. Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2153-3-28**] showed an EF of 25%,
left atrial enlargement, global left ventricular hypokinesis,
paradoxical septal motion consistent with right ventricular
pressure volume overload, and increased pulmonary
hypertension when compared with transthoracic echocardiogram
performed in [**2152-4-25**].
4. Cardiac catheterization [**2153-3-29**] showed cardiac output
4.13, cardiac index 2.33, PA pressure 73/27, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure mean of 46.  There was a widely
patent LIMA to LAD with the left main showing no
angiographically apparent lesion.  His LAD was occluded
midvessel.  There was a left circumflex midvessel lesion of
approximately 30%.  RCA demonstrated luminal irregularities.

IMPRESSION:  A 52-year-old,with congestive heart failure, EF
of 20-25%, coronary artery disease status post one-vessel
CABG in [**2132**], MVR x 2 complicated, first one complicated by
endocarditis with current St. Jude valve, atrial
fibrillation, and restrictive lung disease known to be
present since [**2142**] which is thought secondary to ankylosing
spondylitis, who was transferred from the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for difficulty
to wean from the ventilator despite optimal diuresis.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient's
initial presenting symptoms included dyspnea on exertion and
shortness of breath for 1 month which increased over the last
2 days.  However, his symptoms also included significant
fatigue, anorexia and a 10-pound weight loss.  Given his
clinical history and chest x-ray findings, he was felt to
have a right lower lobe pneumonia which, in combination with
congestive he
