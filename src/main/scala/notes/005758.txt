ORIF of her left periprosthetic femur fracture.  On [**2103-11-17**],
[**2103-11-18**], and [**2103-11-19**] she was again transfused with 1 unit of
packed red blood cells each day for acute blood loss anemia.  On

revision of her femoral component to a long stem.  She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the T/SICU for further
monitoring post operatively.  She was transfused with 2units of
packed red blood cells on [**2103-11-29**] and [**2103-11-30**] due to acute blood
loss anemia.  On [**2103-11-30**] she was noted to have staph coag
