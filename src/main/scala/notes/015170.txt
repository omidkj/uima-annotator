87F history of hypertension complains of right-sided abdominal
pain and vomiting. Per EMS, the pain has been going on for about
a week. Patient called EMS because she ate this evening and then
started vomiting. Has not been able to eat since last sunday
night because she vomits everything. No BM for a few days.
Unreliable historian; denied abd pain initially in MICU saying
it was more of a soreness in her thigh and radiating down her
leg. When asked if she had N/V she also denied that initially,
then asked if she was sure, said she did. C/o dry mouth.

CT Abdomen without contrast ([**2120-8-24**])
1.  Bibasilar opacifications  is concerning for
aspiration/pneumonia versus atelectasis in the correct clinical
setting.
2.  Small pericardial effusion.
3.  Distended loops of small bowel measuring up to 4.2 cm with
transition
point in a right obturator hernia and with completely collapsed
large bowel loops concerning for high-grade small-bowel
obstruction.
4.  Fat-containing umbilical hernia.
5.  Right inguinal hernia containing decompressed loops of small
bowel.
6.  Right kidney demonstrates mild fullness of the collecting
system and the proximal ureter without evidence of obstructive
calculus.
7.  Severe degenerative changes within the thoracolumbar spine.

[**2120-8-24**] ECG
Sinus tachycardia. Early precordial R wave progression
suggestive of prior posterior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous
tracing T wave inversions in the anteroseptal leads are less
prominent.

[**2120-8-26**] ECG
Sinus rhythm and slowing of the rate as compared with previous
tracing
of [**2120-8-24**]. The anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities have
improved, although there is continued ST segment depression and
T wave inversion in leads V1-V3 which may represent anterior
ischemia. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested

[**2120-8-27**] CXR
Patient's condition did not permit PA and lateral chest
technique,
but had to convert it to sitting examination using AP frontal
and left lateral views.  Enlarged heart, as before.
High-positioned diaphragms conceal major portion of the heart
shadow and diaphragmatic contours obscured by bilateral pleural
densities that blunt the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.
Mostly linear densities on the bases indicate crowded pulmonary
vasculature most likely related to the bilateral pleural
effusions.  Pulmonary vasculature again shows perivascular haze
on the bases consistent with marked pulmonary congestion.  As
before, the patient has a marked S-shaped scoliosis in the
thoracolumbar spine with advanced degenerative changes.

Comparison with the next previous examination demonstrates that
the patient is still in left-sided heart failure with dilated
heart shadow and bilateral pleural effusions.  No new discrete
parenchymal infiltrates can be identified, but the possibility
of some processes in the lung bases with the crowded pulmonary
vasculature and partial atelectasis cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with one week history of abdominal pain,
nausea and vomiting who was admitted to MICU with [**Last Name (un) **] and noted
to have incarcerated hernia. She was taken to the OR on [**2120-8-24**]
for repair of her hernia. She was admitted to the TSICU post-op
for close hemodynamic monitoring.

N: Her pain was controlled w/ dilaudid and tylenol prn. She was
intermittently agitated/delirius and was given haldol low dose
prn

CV: She was initially on pressors intraoperatively (neo) but was
able to be weaned off. Her hypotension responded to fluid
boluses. She had some St segment depression, though likely due
to demand ischmia, and she was put on metoprolol. Cardiac
enzymes were sent and returned negative.

Pulm: She was extubated after the OR and did well on NC then
eventually room air.

GI: She was kept NPO and on IV fluids, awaiting return of bowel
frunction.

GU: She had an elevated Cr on admission, thought likely due to
dehydration, and she was given fluids for resuscitation. Her
creatinine continued to improve daily.

ID: She was placed on zosyn for a day for ischemic bowel.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 82823**] was transferred to the surgical floor under the
ACS service on [**2120-8-26**].  Her pain continued to be managed with
parenteral analgesics.  As her diet was advanced, oral
non-narcotic and narcotic analgesics were administered.  Her NGT
was discontinued.  Physical and occupational therapy were
consulted.  Both felt that, due to deconditioning, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 82823**] would benefit with discharge to a rehabilitation
facility.

Post-operatively, the patient became agitated during the
evening, requiring PRN doses of olanzapine.  She was started on
the regimen twice daily.  As the patient became somnolent during
the day, the anti-psychotic was written on an as-needed basis.

Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 82824**] initial CT scan of the chest showed areas of
questionable pneumonia or atelectasis.  She was afebrile, but
had a consistent leukocytosis of approximately 13.  A follow-up
chest radiograph showed bilateral pleural effusions.  She
exhibited no issus of shortness of breath, hypoxia or dyspnea.
Aggressive pulmonary toileting was achieved thro
