Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy [**2188-8-2**], [**2188-8-8**]
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) [**2188-8-8**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 year-old male with DM, HTN, HLD, history of
diverticular bleed s/p clipping who presented with continued
maroon stools.

The patient was hospitalized at OSH from [**Date range (1) 87437**] for
diverticular bleed with a colonoscopy showing a site of active
diverticular bleeding estimated at 45cm. No other active sites
were identified to the level of the cecum. 5 clips were placed
at the site of diverticular bleeding and epinephrine was
injected.  An EGD did not reveal blood from above.  The patient
reportedly became hypoxic during the colonoscopy, thought to be
due to an aspiration event.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care from [**Date range (1) 87438**].  At [**Hospital1 18**], he remained HD stable and
was transfused 2 units packed RBCs, with his HCT remaining
stable.  He completed a course of levofloxacin and flagyl and
was transitioned to Zosyn for aspiration pneumonitis. His
respiratory status continued to improve and he was discharged on
[**7-30**].
.
This morning of his current admission, the patient awoke and had
two episodes of maroon stools.  He had no light-headedness at
the time, but endorsed crampy abdominal pain.  In the ED, he
became very dizzy and light-headed. He had some dyspnea on
exertion, but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, continued
cough, constipation, straining, or tenesmus. He was admitted to
the MICU for further management of his presumed continued lower
GI bleed.
.
In the ED, VS T 98.2 HR 80 BP 153/62 RR 20 O2Sat 100% on RA.  Pt
was complaining of light-headedness but no abdominal pain.
Denied cp.  Three peripherals placed (20 G, 16 G, 18 G).  Seen
by GI with plan to rescope on Monday.  Originally admitted to
floor but had another episode of dark red stool and was
light-headed so transferred to MICU.
.
In the MICU, he reports no light-headedness, sob, cp, abd pain,
n/v, diarrhea.

STUDIES

COLONOSCOPY [**2188-8-2**]: A single sessile 4 mm polyp of benign
appearance was found in the 30 cm. Multiple diverticula with
mixed openings were seen in the sigmoid and descending colon;
scattered diverticula in the right colon and cecum.
Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity. Three
Hemoclips were present in the sigmoid colon 30 cm. There also
appeared to be evidence of previous [**Country **] ink injection at
approximately 35 cm. No evidence of active bleeding or stigmata
of recent bleeding. Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
and descending colon; scattered diverticula in the right colon
and cecum Three Hemoclips were present in the sigmoid colon 30
cm. There also appeared to be evidence of previous [**Country **] ink
injection at approximately 35 cm. Polyp in the 30 cm. No
evidence of active bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding.

TAGGED RBC SCAN [**2188-8-4**]: Following intravenous injection of
autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and
dynamic images of the abdomen were obtained for 77 minutes. A
left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained. Blood flow
images show no evidence of active GI bleed. Dynamic blood pool
images show no evidence of active GI bleed.

COLONOSCOPY [**2188-8-8**]: Large internal hemorrhoids with stigmata of
recent bleeding were noted. Multiple non-bleeding diverticula
were seen in the whole colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of
moderate severity. Surgical anastamosis in the distal right
colon was seen. The terminal ileum was intubated and appeared
normal. 3 clips were seen in the sigmoid colon with mild
ulceration but no stigmata of recent bleeding. Impression:
Surgical anastamosis in the distal right colon was seen. The
terminal ileum was intubated and appeared normal. Diverticulosis
of the whole colon. Internal hemorrhoids. 3 clips were seen in
the sigmoid colon with mild ulceration but no stigmata of recent
bleeding. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.

EGD [**2188-8-8**]: A hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to
39 cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 41 cm from the
incisors. Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the whole
esophagus. Stomach: Nodularity of the mucosa without evidence of
bleeding. Duodenum: A single irregular, sessile, 10-15 mm
non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the second
part of the duodenum. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the second part of the duodenum. Impression:
Nodularity of the mucosa without evidence of bleeding. Polyp in
the second part of the duodenum (biopsy). Hiatal hernia. Normal
mucosa in the whole esophagus. Otherwise normal EGD to third

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 78 year-old male with DMII, HTN, HLD, history
of diverticular bleed s/p clipping who presented with continued
maroon stools. The patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 87439**]. Brief
hospital course is detailed below.

1. GI Bleed: at the time of discharge, the source of the
patient's maroon stools remained unknown. Upon presentation, the
patient was hemodynamically stable, but in the setting of
orthostasis, was transferred to the MICU. Hematocrit was
monitored, and nadired at 22.4. He received a total of 6 units
of packed RBCs and underwent colonoscopy, which was negative for
acute bleeding. EGD was not repeated, as his EGD at the OSH was
negative. The patient was transferred to the floor, where he
continued to have maroon stools. He required only one unit of
RBCs throughout the remainder of his hospital course. He was
maintained on IV pantoprazole and was followed with serial HCTs.
In the context of his continued bleeding, GI, IR, and surgery
were consulted. A tagged RBC was performed, which did not show
evidence of active bleed. A second colonoscopy and EGD were
performed because of concern for upper, rather than lower GI
bleed, but these studies again did not show evidence of acute
bleeding. He was noted to have extensive diverticulosis and a
duodenal polyp (biopsied). At the time of discharge, the patient
had not had maroon stools for ~48 hours. He was hemodynamically
stable and his had HCT stabilized. His aspirin was held and not
restarted. Omeprazole was increas
