Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69390**]
Chief Complaint:
acute on chronic renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right swan catheter placement s/p removal
Right temporary dialysis line placement s/p removal
Right internal jugular tunneled dialysis line placement


History of Present Illness:
73 yr old patient with chronic CHF r/t non ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, CRF from h/o renal cell carcinoma,
mono-clonal gamopathy, htn, no acute indication for HD.has an
AICD for primary prevention.  She is transferred from [**Hospital1 882**]
for management of acute on chronic renal faillure.
.
In [**Month (only) **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for back pain and
incidentally found to have gallbladder stones.  On that
admission she was treated with vand and unasyn followed by
Augmentin for a total of a 10 day course end [**2128-3-2**] for GB PPX
and UTI.  She was discharged to rehab.
.
She then was re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] with nausea, vomiting x6
episodes NBNB and diarhea, and renal failure thought to be
secondary to dehydration.  ERCP was planned at [**Hospital1 112**]; however,
this was cancelled secondary to renal failure. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Of note her
Creatinine on admission was 3.5 and is now up to 4.5 (baseline
2.5-3.0). Given her history the initial though was that she was
dry and they gave her 750cc NS, however her creatinine went up.
Thinking she was suffering from poor forward flow in the setting
of her volume overload she was restarted on her torsemide with
worsening of her renal function.  The patient has never been
dialyzed and has no acute indication.
.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for further management, though why
cardiology is unclear.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Test                          Result              Reference
Range/Units
FREE KAPPA, SERUM             94.0  H             3.3-19.4 mg/L
FREE LAMBDA, SERUM            14.3                5.7-26.3 mg/L
FREE KAPPA/LAMBDA RATIO       6.57  H             0.26-1.65

Interpretation:  In serum, the kappa/lambda ratio
of whole immunoglobulin molecules is 2:1, whereas
the kappa/lambda ratio of free light chains is
1:1.5.  The latter is attributed to the occurrence
of lambda light chains as dimers whose serum [**1-18**]-
life is approximately 3 times longer than that of
monomeric kappa light chains.  Excess production
of kappa or lambda light chains alters the kappa/
lambda ratio.  Alterations that fall outside the
normal range are attributed to the presence of
monoclonal light chains.  Monoclonal light chains
are found in serum of patients with multiple
myeloma, the light chain variant of MM,
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, mu-heavy chain
disease, primary amyloidosis, light chain
deposition disease, monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance, and lymphoproliferative
diseases such as B-CLL.  Measurement of free light
chain concentration in serum is useful for
diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease activity
and following response to therapy of these
disorders.


Chronic infection and chronic inflammatory
diseases, as well as renal insufficiency, may be
accompanied by a diffuse increase in both kappa
and lambda free chains, but the kappa/lambda ratio
remains within the normal limits.  The serum
concentration of free light chains increases with
age over 60 years; light chains may reach 50 mg/L
in those 70-80 yrs of age; in these cases the
kappa/lambda ratio still remains within normal
limits.

Physicians, who are accustomed to the
identification of clonal protein by electro-
phoretic means, may order immunofixation in
addition to free light chain immunoassay.  In
rare instances, immunofixation may identify
monoclonal light chain protein in the absence
of abnormalities in the quantitative light chain
immunoassays.
