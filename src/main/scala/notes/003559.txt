Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal stent placement

History of Present Illness:
This 54 yo woman with a history of obesity, asthma, anxiety,
kidney stones is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after diagnosis of
MG (+ MUSK Ab) who is being admitted to the medical ICU
following respiratory decomposition after extubation following
placement of tracheal stent via elective rigid bronchoscopy.

She has had several recent decompositions from her myasthenia
over the past year, and most recently getting IVIG while
continuing on her cellcept, prednisone, amd pyridostigmine. She
has been recalcitrant to steroids in the past. She was last
admitted from [**2139-4-27**] - [**2139-5-26**] during which she had 3 tracheal
intubations (*Difficult airway/fiberscopic intubation) and
underwent plasmapheresis. She underwent trach/PEG placement on
[**2139-5-22**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was decanculated on [**2139-7-9**].

This morning, she had noted some increased tiredness and
diplopia,

She had tracheobronchomalacia on CT from the spring, and
underwent initial stent placement on [**2139-5-7**]. Y stent was
removed on [**2139-9-15**] and there was moderate granulation tissue
seen in the mainstem bronchi at that time. She was electively
admitted for Y-stent re-placement today, which occurred without
complication. She had cryotherapy to local granulation tissue.
After the extubation, the patient was noted to be hypoxic in the
PACU with O2 sats 70s-80s with mental status
change/unresponsiveness. She was on BiPap with improvement in
mental status and now weaned off to face tent.

Currently, she is complaining of severe headache mostly, which
has followed her General Anesthesia the last 3 procedures. Mild
dyspnea.  She has some complaint of pain in her chest following
the stent, which she has had previously in same setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan
54 yo woman with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 15099**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on cellcept, mestinon, and
prednisone, GERD, anxiety, admitted to MICU for respiratory
distress following extubation for Y-stent replacement. DDx for
resp failure includes hypercarbia, hypoventilation from MG, or
aspiration process

# Respiratory Failure:
The patient had an elective stent replacement on [**2139-10-15**]. She
required admission to the ICU s/p procedure, however, for
hypoxia (70's-80's) and somnalnace requiring mask ventilation
thought secondary either to neuromuscular weakness (in context
of MG) causing hypoventialtion vs. obstruciton and collapse in
setting of bronch findings above.
.
In the ICU, the patient was started on BIPAP. She was given a
Z-pak for possible sinusitis and started on Tessalon Perles,
Mucinex, and Nebulized saline to aid in secretion clearance. She
was placed on an Insulin SS for her diabetes. She continued her
outpatient MG regimen of Prednisone 20mg [**Hospital1 **], Mestinone 50mg q4h
and Cellcept 1000mg PO BID. She was followed by IP s/p Y-stent
placement. She required only 1L o2 by NC. She was
tachychardicinto the 150's while in the ICU; this was thought
2dary to anxiety. A neurology consult was requested; the
neurology team noted that the patient had not taken her
Pyridostigmine since the day before the procedure. They
additionally recommended infectious work-up in case infection
was triggering an exacerbation of MG. A Trial off BIPAP was
attempted on [**10-17**] but she failed, but the team was successful
in subsequent weaning such that on the day of transfer, she
required only 3 hours Bipap and was breathing 97% on 2L NC. She
did have new complaints suggestive for possible hospital aquired
PNA, and was started on Vancomycin but not Ceft/Zosyn.
Although her pCO2 was elevated, she was clinically stable and
thought to be stable for transfer from the ICU. She was briefly
transferred to the floor and then returned to the ICU with
hypertension and respiratory distress likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema.  She was stablized overnight and returned to
the floor.  The patient was continued on nebs, but still
continued to have difficulty breathing and was not at her
baseline status. The patient continued to be increasingly
anxious to go home and decided the leave AMA.  The patient
understood the risks, but felt that she stable enough to return
home.  The patient was setup with follow-up appointments and
will return for an outpatient bronch in approx one week.
.
#) Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]
- Neurology consulted for possibility of MG component to
respiratory status, however given NIFS were -80 it was thought
that her MG was under control. She was continued on her
prednisone, mestinone, and cell cept. She had one episode of
diplopia that self-resolved.

#) Tracheomalacia
 s/p Y stent

# Anxiety/panic d/o: The patient had continued anxiety during
her admission.  She was continued on paxil 15 mg daily.
Additionally, the patient was treated with xanax 0.125mg prn.

# DM: stable, followed FSG and covered with RISS
.
#Tachycardia: Pt had sinus tachycardia and was started on 30mg
diltiazem. The patient was stable and her sinus tachycardia was
likely secondary to anxiety.  She was not continued on diltiazam
upon discharge.
.
#Diarrhea: The patient had compliants of loose stools.  The
patient states that these symptoms had occured for awhile prior
to admission.  She stated it was well controlled by immodium
prior to admission.  It was felt that her loose stools were
likely secondary to her Mestinon and she was restarted on
immodium.
