Pertinent Results:
[**1-10**] Echo: Pre Bypass: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated
with Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. 3.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mild to moderate anteroapical hypokinesis. 4. 4. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root with focal
calcification of the sinus of valsalva. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. 6. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(area <0.8cm2). 7. The aortic regurgitation vena contracta is
>0.6cm. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 8. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Post Bypass: 1. Patient is being AV paced and on an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine. 2. Anterior wall, septum,
anterior septum are hypokinetic. LVEF 35% 3. RV function is
normal. 4. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position.
Valve appears well seated and the leaflets move well. Trace
central aortic insufficiency seen. 5. Unable to obtain
transgastric views to check for gradient across the aortic
valve.
[**1-11**] Head CT: 1. Hypodensity involving the right middle frontal
gyrus, which may represent infarct, age indeterminant, or
chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes. MRI with
diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive and is recommended
to further assess. 2. Left parietotemporal subgaleal fluid
collection. MRI with and without contrast or CT with contrast is
recommended to further assess for rim enhancement which may be
seen in abcess. Alternatively, this may represent a simple
subgaleal fluid collection. 3. Air fluid levels in the
bilateral, left greater than right, maxillary sinuses may
represent acute sinusitis. 4. Moderate microangiopathic small
vessel ischemic changes. Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
[**1-21**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate echo filled
pericardial effusion most c/w pericardial hematoma. Mild
symmetric left ventricular left ventricular hypertrophy with
good global biventricular systolic function. Normal functioning
aortic bioprosthesis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Provisional Findings Impression: JRld [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2129-2-4**] 11:03 AM
Improved, almost complete resolution of fluid overload.
Persistent left lower

and
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2129-1-10**] Mrs.[**Known lastname 2643**] underwent Coronary artery bypass graftingx
2(left internal mammary artery grafted to the left anterior
descending artery, Saphenous vein grafted to the Obtuse
Marginal)/Aortic Valve Replacement (#21mm CE Magna Tissue
valve). Cross clamp time:108 minutes/CardioPulmonary Bypass
time:134 minutes. Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9379**] operative report
for further details.She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU stable but in critical condition
requiring Epinephrine and Propofol drips. Postoperative course
will now be broken down by systems:

NEURO: Mrs.[**Known lastname 2643**] experienced seizure like activity on
postoperative day one. Head CT scan showed hypodensity involving
the right middle frontal gyrus, which may represent infarct, age
indeterminant, or chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic
changes and moderate microangiopathic small vessel ischemic
changes,with mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss-per radiology.
Initially post seizure, Mrs.[**Known lastname 2643**] showed upper left extremity
weakness which fully resolved during her hospital admission by
day 7. [**1-11**] Neurology was consulted and recommended maintaining
systolic blood pressures around 140 mmHg. Warfarin and Aspirin
were continued. No further seizure activity was noted for the
remainder of her hospital stay and remains neurologically intact
without gross sensory/motor deficits.

CARDIAC: Developed atrial fibrillation following extubation on
postoperative day three. Despite treatment with Amiodarone, beta
blockade and calc
