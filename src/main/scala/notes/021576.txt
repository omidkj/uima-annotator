Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   84 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin who was transferred from New
[**Location (un) 30389**] [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 188**] for management of subdural hematoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 14475**] on [**2175-2-1**], for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation treatment.  She
was found on the ground on [**2175-2-9**].  Initial CT scan was
noted for bleed but she subsequently developed decreased
mental status.  Repeat CT scan on [**2175-2-10**], revealed left
subdural hematoma with midline shift.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
where, on presentation, she was somewhat awake and was able
to squeeze the left hand on command, but was not able to move
the right side of her body at all.  She developed increasing
somnolence and was taken to the Operating Room for a
craniotomy and evacuation.

She was initially transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  There, she continued to have very poor mental status.
She occasionally appeared able to follow commands, but was
not displaying purposeful movements of the upper or lower
extremities.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on [**2175-2-22**], for management of recurrent fevers
to a temperature of 101.0 F, to 102.0 F., as well as for a
failure to wean off the ventilator.

She had a tracheostomy in place and while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit received trials where she was allowed to
breathe on her own off the ventilator.  She usually was only
able to breathe for several hours before she would fatigue
and would have to be put back on the ventilator.

She continued to spike temperatures to 101.0 F., to 102.0 F.
The source of these fevers were unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] sputum, blood
and urine were cultured multiple times and were always
negative.  A CT scan of the chest did not reveal any obvious
source of infection.

Her mental status continued to be poor; she was unable to
speak.  She did not appear able to make purposeful movements
and in general did not display any improvement in her
neurologic status.  Given her overall poor prognosis and her
very low probability for a meaningful recovery, the family
decided on [**2175-3-3**], that they wished to withdraw care for
her on the evening of [**2175-3-4**].

Addendum to Discharge Summary to follow.
