History of Present Illness:
76-year-old woman with h/o DM2, HTN, HL, CVA on warfarin with
residual L sided weakness presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 19421**] office on
[**2125-2-1**] and was found to be in afib with RVR with HR 150s.
Patient denied any symptom at that time. She did report some
dyspnea with exertion in [**Month (only) 956**].

Of note, patient was recently found to have a breast nodule on
mammogram which is being worked up. She has been having
significant anxiety over this.

On presentation to the ED, afeb, HR 140, BP 181/124, 97%RA. Her
exam was unremarkable. CE neg x 1. ECG showed afib with rate in
the 140s, without any ischemic changes. INR 3.7. She received
metoprolol 10 mg IV x 2, 5 mg IV x 4, labetolol 10 mg IV x 1,
metoprolol 25 mg PO x 1. Her HR decreased to 105-115, and BP
135/87. Was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.

On arrival to floor, patient was asymptomatic.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Reports/Imaging
[**2125-2-2**] TTE The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). An eccentric,
anteriorly-directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral stenosis. Severe eccentric mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

[**2125-2-5**] Carotid Series Complete:Impression: Right ICA no
stenosis .
Left ICA no stenosis .

Rib films: There is bibasilar atelectasis, and there are
bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate. The heart is
enlarged. In addition, there are multiple non-displaced rib
fractures in the lower right. No definite displaced rib
fractures are seen on the left. This could be better assessed
with CT if this is a clinical concern.

CXR [**2125-2-1**] IMPRESSION: Mild heart failure with bilateral
pleural effusions. Likely atelectasis at the lung bases,
although repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CXR [**2125-2-7**] IMPRESSION:Retrocardiac atelectasis. Worsening
bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2125-2-10**] Rib Xray: here is bibasilar atelectasis, and there are
bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate. The heart is
enlarged. In addition, there are multiple non-displaced rib
fractures in the lower right. No definite displaced rib
fractures are seen on the left. This could be better assessed
with CT if this is a clinical concern.

[**2125-2-12**] Cardiac Cath: report not yet available

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM

# Atrial fibrillation: Afib likely [**12-25**] atrial enlargement from
valvular disease. She does have a history of hypothyroidism, on
replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No excessive alcohol or
caffeine. Initially she did not respond to beta blockers and so
was rate-controlled with diltiazem. She then converted to SR
spontaneously and was maintained in SR with disopyramide. Her
QTc was prolonged at ~500 after starting the long-acting form of
the drug. Patient was transferred to the CCU for better
monitoring while the disopyramide washed out. She then developed
torsades and cardiac arrest as below. After torsades resolved,
her medications were subsequently adjusted so she was on
diltiazem for rate control, amiodarone 200mg PO BID x 2 weeks
(then 200mg daily) for rhythm and rate control and digoxin 0.125
daily. For anticoagulation her coumadin was held for breast
biopsy and cath. She was placed on a hep gtt for ppx while
awaiting procedures. She was discharged on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] with
bridge to coumadin. She was [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 20387**] [**Male First Name (un) **] lower dose of
coumadin given interaction with amiodarone and will need close
monitoring of INR. For her outpatient dental procedure (prior to
cardiac surgery), she will hold the warfarin without a lovenox
bridge. She was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.

# Torsades de pointes/Cardiac arrest: Pt was transferred to CCU
on [**2125-2-6**] for management of torsades de pointes. She was given
4mg Mg IV and started on standing Mg repletion. Disopyramide was
discontinued since she was felt to have long QT and torsades
secondary to disopyramide. She was noted to have increasing
ectopy on telemetry [**2125-2-6**] in pm and again went into VT with
loss of consciousness and pulse. Code blue was called.
