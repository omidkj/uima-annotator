Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91849**] was admitted to the Neurosugery service for
evaluation and surgial planning.

We obtained a medical consult for surgical clearence given his
age and medical history.

He had Carotid dopplers to evaluate his carotid stenosis in the
setting of reported severe stenosis and TIA's. The study showed
less than 40% stenosis, and he was determined to be relatively
safe to undergo a craniotomy for Subdural hematoma evacutation.

We plan to proceed with surgical evacuation of this subdural in
one week given that he has been taking plavix at home.

A physical therapist evaluated the patient and they felt that
the patient needed to be placed in rehab until he returns for
surgery.  On [**2133-12-24**], pt was stable for discharge to [**Hospital **]
Rehab Hospital.  He will follow-up accordingly.
