Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6180**]
Chief Complaint:
admission for chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
chemoembolization
transfusion of 3U of PRBC
RIJ central line placement

History of Present Illness:
62 year-old man with morbid obesity, alcoholic cirrhosis,
admitted for chemoembolization of his recently-diagnosed
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a long history of alcoholic cirrhosis with a
history of heavy
consumption (>80 grs/day) of alcohol use over the past 40 years.

In [**2145**], he developed decompensation with evidence of
encephalopathy, ascites and portal hypertension.  Over the
subsequent 2 years, he had ongoing problems with advanced liver
disease including admissions for encephalopathy, ascites, lower
extremity edema, anemia and renal failure.

The patient has been followed since [**2-22**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
alcohol related cirrhosis, and has been managed on Lasix,
Aldactone, lactulose and Inderal.  Due to his morbid obesity, he
was not deemed a transplant candidate.  Recently he has had a
decrease in his appetite and occasional nausea and vomiting.
While his AFP was not particularly high (7.0), his LFTs were
slightly abnormal with an alkaline phosphatase of 213, and
increase of his AST to 397 and ALT to 98.  An ultrasound in
[**Month (only) 1096**] showed a large 13cm mass in the right lobe of the liver
of 13 cm.  Biopsy of this mass was read as consistent with
hepatocellular carcinoma.

He was quickly referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who discussed with
him his options.  Given that he was not a surgical candidate
with his cirrhosis and that he is not a transplant candidate,
his options were extremely limited.
Patient agreed on the recommendation of chemoembolization.

Prior to the procedure, patient reported no pain, nausea,
vomiting, new fatigue.

Vital signs remained stable throughout procedure.  Embolization
of artery with gelfoam and chemotherapy (adriamycin).  Also
received versed, fentanyl, papaverine, xanax, vistaril,
dilaudid, allopurinol, Unasyn, prochloperzine peri and post-op.

Post-procedure, patient report feeling slightly nauseous, but no
vomitting, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
-alcohol cirrhosis with encephalopathy and ascites, not a
transplant candidate due to his morbid obesity
-diverticulitis requiring hemicolectomy about 30 years ago
-morbid obesity


Social History:
Retired construction worker and singer.
He is married, but separated and lives alone.
Wife is still supportive and comes to help him.
He has good relationships with his three children.
He no longer drinks alcohol and does not smoke.

CXR post procedure: clear

[**2150-1-1**] CT of ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION:
1) Large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right
groin and along the right flank. There is extensive tracking of
hemorrhage within the retroperitoneum to the mesenteric root.
This finding was discussed immediately with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who
was caring for the patient.

2) High density material within the right lobe of the liver,
opacifying mutliple tumor masses, consistent with
chemoembolization performed on same date. These findings are
consistent with the patient's known history of hepatocellular
carcinoma.

3) Persistent nephrograms within the kidneys, as well as
excreted contrast within the renal collecting systems. In the
setting of a noncontrast examination contrast given earlier in
the day, this finding could be related to acute tubular
necrosis.

4) No bowel obstruction or perforation.

5) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (1) 49691**]
Post procedure the patient was transferred to the floor. At
approximately 22:15 the house officer was called to the bedside
because the patient was found to be more somnolent and confused
by the nursing staff. Vitals were checked at that time and the
patient was found to have a SBP of 74 by doppler. The patient
was immediately placed in Trendelenberg and given a 500cc bolus
of NS. A second peripheral IV was placed and a stat HCT was
drawn. The MICU team was called. HCT=>31.7 down from 41
pre-procedure. There was a high suspicion for retroperitoneal
bleed given the patient's hypotension in relationship to the
procedure. An ABD/PELVIC CT was done which revealed a large
right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right groin
and along the right flank. The patient was transferred to the
MICU and transfused 2U of PRBC. Vascular surgery was also
consulted who agreed with the plan of serial HCTs and medical as
opposed to surgical management at this time. A right IJ central
line was placed for access as well.

[**Date range (1) 28479**]
During the patient's MICU stay, he developed acute renal failure
with a creatinine increase from 1.1 to 2.0 as well as atrial
fibrillation, both thought to be related to his hypovolemia and
poor perfusion state [**12-24**] to his retroperitoneal bleed. His HCT
remained stable and he was transferred back to the floor.

[**1-6**]
A day after transfer, the patient developed a fever and was
empirically started on levofloxacin. A CXR, UA, blood and urine
cultures were obtained. The patient's respiratory status
continued to worsen and he became hypotensive likely [**12-24**] to an
overwhelming infection likely of intraabdominal origin from
necrosis of liver post-procedure or pulmonary source due to his
poor ventilatory status (body habitus and fluid overload). The
patient's overall prognosis and chance for recovery was very
poor. Discussion was held with the patient's family, medical
team, and primary oncologist and the patient's code status was
designated as DNR/DNI and he was made CMO. His infection was
treated with antibiotics and his pain was treated with IV
morphine. The patient expired on [**1-7**] from respiratory failure
and PEA arrest.
