Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
gangrenous left heel and right heel/great toe ischemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access;contralateral
second-order catheter placement with bilateralextremity runoff &
abdominal aortogram. ([**2108-12-6**])
2.Right lower extremity bypass graft with nonreversed saphenous
vein graft. ([**2108-12-10**])
3.Left femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass with in situ
saphenous vein graft. ([**2108-12-12**])


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 65 M h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2085**], CHF (EF ~20%), DM2, ESRD on HD
(? h/o [**Year (4 digits) 2091**] with urosepsis, on since [**10-18**]), admitted [**12-6**] for
bilateral foot gangrene s/p b/l femoral bypass on [**12-11**] (right
leg) and [**2107-12-13**] (left leg) transferred from vascular service for
syncope in setting of V fib.
.
Patient admitted on [**12-6**] after noted to have gangrenous changes
of both heels while at rehab. Underwent bypass sx w/o
complication. On [**2108-12-13**] pt was finishing ultrafiltration ~1pm
(renal note dated early), when he was noted to have a syncopal
event for ~10seconds, with telemetry suggestive of VT/VF. He
regained consciousness. Per pt, he had no further syncopal
episodes. CODE BLUE called ~13:15 for a syncopal event. Pt was
hemodynamically stable upon arrival, alert, oriented, breathing
without difficulty. EP was called, and per EP interogation of
ICD initially felt to have AF with intermittent conversion to
NSR, then VT with attempt to ATP unsucessfull resulting in VF
which was shocked x 1.
.
Of note, the prior evening, patient developed hypotension with
sys bp in 60's of unknown etiology and was started on
phenylephrine gtt with improvement in BP. Per surgical service,
this was in the setting of slow VT, though it is unclear whether
slow VT was the sole cause of hypotension (ddx includes sepsis,
bleeding, adrenal insufficiency POD#1). He was being treated
with cipro/flagyl/vanco empirically.
.
Patient had been in and out of the hospital since end of [**Month (only) 359**]
with recent admissions at OSH for CHF exacerbation, UTI and
syncopal episode [**10-18**] [**1-12**] afib with RVR. Discharged to rehab.
Noted to be in V-tach at rehab during syncopal episode in 3rd
week of [**Month (only) **]. per pt, CPR was administered and he was
defibrillated. However, upon reevaluation of rhythm by his
cardiologist, thought to be in afib with aberrancy. No history
of syncope prior to [**10-18**]. At that time, amiodarone was
increased and patient was again discharged to rehab. He was also
started on hemodialysis for unclear reasons (?allergic reaction
to [**Last Name (un) **]).
.
On review of symptoms, positive hx of L LE DVT (~[**2104**]). Denies
any prior history of stroke, TIA pulmonary embolism, bleeding at
the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative. Currently w pain in b/l legs
with movement. No dysuria. Does report vomiting, approx [**3-16**]
episodes post op. Approx 3 episodes today. Denies nausea.
Passing flatus, no abdominal pain. Last BM 2 days prior.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations. Sleeps on 2 pillows.
Chronic nonproductive cough for 3 years.

PMH: ESRD/HD, HTN, CHF (preop EF 20%, 2+ MR),s/p AICD placement,
CAD s/p MI [**2085**], hypercholestereolemia, gout,IDDM, diabetic
neuropathy


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Patient is married, lives with wife. Lives in [**Location 11269**]. Able
to complete ADLS without difficulty. Retired, in charge of
construction and engineering in [**Location (un) 511**] division of [**Company **]. Quit ETOH in [**2100**]. Prior that would drink 6pack of
16oz beer/day + [**12-12**] hard alcohol/day for 15 years. No
hospitalization for ETOH, NO hx of DTs.

Family History:
 There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
.
65 M with MMP including CAD s/p MI, CHF(EF 20% s/p BiV/AICD),
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, Type II DM, ESRD on HD,
admitted for gangrenous heels [**1-12**] PVD s/p femoral bypass with
course complicated by syncopal episode and V-fibrillation s/p
AICD cardioversion.
.
# Bilateral femoral bypass: Underwent surgery on [**12-11**] and [**12-12**]
for right and left femoral bypass. Procedure was uncomplicated
with good distal pulses post procedure.
.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive requiring pressors.
Initially started on neosynephrine drip. Following day patient
had syncopal episode secondary to Ventricular tachycardia and
Code Blue was called. Given low SVR, normal PA diastolic,
borderline leukocytosis and two possible infectious sources
including BL gangrene and a mass on the RA lead of his AICD,
hypotension was felt to be due to sepsis. Although he initially
had a low cardiac index, this was thought to be consistent with
CHF with EF of 20%, and unlikley to be due to cardiogenic shock.
Attempted to wean neosynephrine, but MAPS dropped down to the 55
range. He did not respond to a 1L fluid bolus so a levophed drip
was started to provide pressor support with some inotropy.
Patient continued to require pressure support for the remainder
of his course in the intesnive care unit. Pancultures were sent
and antibiotic coverage was advanced to vancomycin and zosyn.
However patient minimally improved.
.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Hx of MI. No evidence of ischemic changes on
ECG. mild trop leak likely [**1-12**] renal failure, as CK and MB flat.
Continued ASA. ACE and beta blocker held in setting of
hypotension. Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out ischemic
source of troponic leak. However cardiac enzymes remained flat.
.
# Rhythm: Hx of atrial fibrillation on coumadin since [**2105**].
Recent admission to OSH for syncopal episodes thought to be [**1-12**]
atrial fibrillation with RVR. Being followed by EP during this
admission for episodes of asymptomatic slow V-tach and afib,
plan had been to cardiovert AFIB, and then ablate slow
monomorphic VT, however patient later developed polymorphic VT.
The patient had multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardiat.
Trend has been that he converts from a paced rhythm, to atrial
fibrillation, and then degenerates into either polymorphic or
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Shocked once by ICD and
three times externally overnight on [**12-15**], and given 2g of
magnesium. EP was consulted, recommending to d/c amiodarone
given polymorphic VT in the setting of a prolonged QT interval
450-500, start lidocaine gtt and aggressive repletion of
electrolytes. Patient was started on mexilitine. However later
due to altered mental status was unable to take oral
medications. Patient became increasingly unstable with
persistent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation unresponsive to
defibrillation by his AICD or externally. As team was unable to
convert rhythm, prognosis was poor, he was unstable and
re
