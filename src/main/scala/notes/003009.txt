Chief Complaint:
Urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation (from OSH)
Extubation [**2121-5-6**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1313**] is a 75y/o gentleman with a DM2, HTN, and history of
nephrolithiasis (no interventions in the past) who is
transferred with urosepsis and an obstructing ureteral calculus.
.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-5**] due to 2 weeks of
feeling generally weak and nauseated, with occasional emesis.
Of note, he had been started on Cipro 11 days prior for UTI,
with no relief, and had been on Nitrofurantoin for the past 4
days.  He started feeling more fatigued so he presented to
[**Hospital1 **] ER where VS were: T 99.2, HR 112 (but up to 130), BP
97/52, RR 20, POx 100% 2L NC.  He was found to be in AFib with
RVR to 130 requiring Diltiazem 10mg IV x3 with subsequent drop
in BP so was switched to Lopressor IV.  18 Fr foley was placed
releasing 4 liters of purulent urine.  Was started on
Vanc/Zosyn.  He was admitted to their ICU where CT showed
moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right secondary
to an obstructing calculus just above the UVJ measuring about 4
mm.  Urology attempted a right ureteral decompression but was
unable to advance past the stone so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for I.R.-guided urostomy tube placement.  Of note, patient was
intubated for the procedure and remains so.  He reportedly had
hypotension in the OR (low blood pressures not documented) so he
required Neosynephrine and Levophed.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated. Arrived
only on Levophed which was just turned off.

2. Bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening at the lung
bases bilaterally with associated minimal central
lymphadenopathy.
3. Severe calcified atherosclerotic disease.
4. Trace left pleural effusion.

TTE:
Technically suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF
= (?) 35 %). Anterior and septal hypokinesis is present, and
extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis is present. The
right ventricle is not well seen but may also be hypokinetic.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1313**] is a 75y/o gentleman with nephrolithiasis, DM2, and
HTN presenting with urosepsis, [**Last Name (un) **], and AFib in the setting of
obstructive uropathy and urinary retention.
.
#. Obstructive uropathy with infection: urosepsis.
Pt presented from OSH with concerns for urosepsis.  CT at OSH
showed moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right
secondary to an obstructing calculus just above the UVJ
measuring about 4 mm.  He was placed initially on broad spectrum
antibiotics (vanc/cefepime) initially.  This was narrowed to
ceftriaxone when urine culture from OSH was reported to be > 100
K E.COLI resistant to Levofloxacin, Bactrim and sensitive to all
other agents. Planned for a two week antibiotic course.
Percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR (pt was kept
intubated for the procedure) on [**2121-5-6**].  This was complicated
by bleeding from nephrostomy tube when pt was started on heparin
gtt for afib.  IR reassessed the tube and found it to be in
calyx instead of kidney; this was replaced ON [**5-9**] and bleeding
from nephrostomy tube resolved. Creatinine > 4 on admission from
obstructive [**Last Name (un) **], now trending down to 1.4 after nephrostomy tube
placement.  Patient was discharged on IV ceftriaxone, last day =
[**5-18**] for total 2 week course.

# [**Last Name (un) **] and urinary retention: Creatinine > 4 on admission, now
1.4  s/p nephrostomy tube placement.  Urology was consulted who
recommended initiation of tamsulosin and voiding trial in [**2-14**]
days.  Patient failed subseuqent voiding trial with 750 cc of
urine in his bladder.  He was intermittently straight - cathed,
but it became increasingly difficult likely secondary to his
BPH.  Thus, a foley was placed prior to discharged.  Per urology
recommendations, the foley should remain in place until the
patient sees his urologist.
.
#. AFib with RVR: new-onset, in the setting of infection.
Per OSH records, pt had no known h/o AFib but was in afib with
rvr at OSH.  Rate-control was attempted with several different
agents including metoprolol, diltiazem, and esmolol drip.
However, he became hypotensive on these agents.  He was then
started on an amiodarone drip.  Given his CHADS of 3 and
increased risk of stroke with potential cardioversion on
amiodarione drip, he was started on heparin gtt. This was
complicated by bleeding from foley as well as nephrostomy tube.
Cardiology consult was obtained who recommended stopping
amiodarone drip and placing pt back on metoprolol.  Metoprolol
doses were adjusted several times for continued eleva
