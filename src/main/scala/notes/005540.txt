Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6174**] is an 86yo female with PMH significant for PVD,
HTN, COPD, and OA. She initially presented with to the ED with
low back pain on [**1-14**] and an abdominal U/S was done at the time
which was negative for AAA. She was then discharged home. She
then represented to the ED on [**1-16**] with persistent LBP. Her blood
pressure was stable at the time and she was given a dose of
Levaquin given concern for pneumonia. She was then transferred
to the medical floor for pain control and further management.
During her time on the floor her SBPs were noted to be low
ranging from 68-112. Baseline BP per OMR is between 120-150's.
At 1am on [**1-18**] she was triggered for hypotension with SBP 86/P.
She received two 500cc fluid boluses with mild improvement in
her BP. At this time, her Cr was also noted be higher to 1.9 and
her EKG showed new flipped T waves. She received ASA at this
time.

This morning the patient was triggered again at 9am hypotension
with SBP~70's and then 90's with doppler. Her oxygen saturations
also dropped to 91 on 2L. ABG at the time was 7.20/40/72/16. Her
O2 was increased to 5L. Given her rising LFTs, Cr, hypotension,
and increasing oxygen requirement the patient was transferred to
the MICU.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**1-16**]): Limited study with bibasilar opacities likely
reflecting atelectasis and small left effusion.  Evolving
pneumonia cannot be excluded. Emphysema.

2)Cxray ([**1-17**]): Bibasilar atelectasis is most likely chronic.  No
obvious pneumonia. Emphysema. Dilated esophagus. Thoracic
vertebral wedge fractures.

3)Abdominal xray ([**1-18**]): No evidence of acute abdominal
pathology.

4)Abdominal U/S ([**1-14**]): 1.  No evidence of abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
2.  Dilated common bile duct, unchanged or slightly improved
since the [**2140**] study. 3. Stable distension of the gallbladder
with no finding to suggest cholecystitis.

5)ECHO ([**1-18**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 6174**] is an 86yo female with PMH as listed above
who presents with hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and
transaminitis.

1)Shock: Patient was hypotensive on the floor with SBP between
60-90. Initial differential included cardiogenic vs. septic
shock. Cardiogenic shock was concerning given her evolving ECG
changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient denied any
chest pain or SOB. Septic shock was also of concern given her
leukocytosis and ? of an infiltrate on cxray. She also has a
history of an MRSA pneumonia but no report of fevers, chills, or
productive cough. The cxray is concerning for an infiltrate. She
presented with a severe metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate,
and evidence of end organ damage upon transfer to the MICU. In
the MICU she had a central line placed with monitoring of her
CVP and SVO2. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotic
coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl. She was also
started on a heparin gtt since cardiac ischemia was thought to
be the cause of her acute decline. She underwent an ECHO which
was suggestive of RV failure which was thought to be consistent
with an underlying pulmonary embolism. Given the severe end
organ damage, the patient was initially made DNR but dopamine or
dobutamine could be used. The next day the family decided that
the patient should be made CMO and care was withdrawn. Patient
passed away the afternoon of [**2144-1-20**].

2)Transaminitis/abdominal pain: Patient presents with elevated
LFTs in the 1000's. This was consistent with shock liver. The
patient is also on a large dose of Tylenol although the former
is more likely. Cholecystitis was also on the differential given
concern of tenderness on exam and leukocytosis. Surgery was
consulted and did not feel that the clinical picture was
consistent with this diagnosis. Enteric ischemia was also of
concern. She was guiac negative. No further imaging was done
given her poor prognosis.

3)Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr per OMR is 1.1-1.2. Increased
to 2.2 on transfer to MICU. Likely ATN in the setting of shock.
She was given several fluid boluses with little improvement in
her renal function.

4)NSTEMI: On the day of admission, patient was noted to have
evolving EKG changes from ST depressions to T wave inversions.
No complaint of chest pain or SOB. Cardiac enzymes were also
elevated. At this time cardiogenic shock was high on the
differential. Cardiology was consulted and given poor prognosis,
did not think she was a candidate for an intervention. Likely
demand ischemia secondary to shock.
She was continued on ASA and
