Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
metastatic cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided needle biopsy of RUL mass

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 year old man with history of COPD who
developed neck spasms in [**Month (only) **], PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] revealed lung
tumor, with inconclusive results biopsy x 2 (via bronch). Per
PCP C/T-spine CT done, and C-spine CT shows C6 tumor. He reports
that approximately two weeks ago he developed R shoulder
weakness, tingling, and pain that would radiate to his right
hand. At the same time he developed R buttock pain, with
intermittent R leg pain. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital **] hospital for further C-spine work-up and treatment. He
was initially admitted to the Neurosurgical service for the
concern of spinal cord compression. He had MRI c/t/l spine that
showed diffuse infiltration of the vertebral bodies w/o frank
cord compromise. He was transfered to oncology for further
management.
.
Currently he denies pain in his arm. He states that he is weak
in the shoulder and elbow on the right side. He has no numbness
or tingling of his right hand. The left shoulder is also weak
but not as much as the right. His legs feel strong to him.
.
ROS: no chest pain. no shortness of breath. no cough. no
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. he feels constipated. no bowel or
bladder incontinence. no jaundice. no fever/chills/sweats

IMAGING:


Brief Hospital Course:
62yo M w/ COPD admitted with right shoulder pain and weakness
found to have large lung mass, with lesions to brain (5 solitary
lesions), spine (C5 and T11) and possibly the kidney, unknown
primary.

1.Lung Mass and HYPOXIA: Lung mass presumed to be the primary
lesion, given the multiple lesions in ipsilateral and
contralateral lung consistent with advanced disease. Previous
biopsies only obtained necrotic tissue, so unable to identify
primary malignancy prior to patients death.  Throughout the
course of his admission he became progressively more hypoxic and
tachycardic due to diffuse cancerous involvement of lungs
bilaterally as well as associated emphysematous changes.  In
addition, he likely developed a post obstructive pneumonia.  He
was intubated on [**12-25**] for hypoxic respiratory failure according
to the patient and his wife's wishes.  He was treated with
vancomycin and zosyn for post obstructive pneumonia.  Given the
massive involement of his lungs by tumor it was very unlikely
that he would ever come off of ventillatory support.  In
addition given the late stage and wide spread metastasis of his
cancer his prognosis was very poor.  This was discussed with the
patient and his wife prior to intubation.  Following his
intubation, the decision was made to make him comfort measures
only and withdraw ventillatory support on [**12-27**].  He died within
one hour of withdrawing ventillatory support.  He will have a
post mortem autopsy according to the family's wishes.

2. METASTATIC DISEASE: Pt has metastatic disease to brain,
contralateral lung, and spine (C5 and T11). Also possible that
he has disease in his kidney, given the abnormal 4.5 x 3.4cm L
renal mass seen on CT. Also has rising LFTs and RUQ tenderness,
raising concern for liver mets. Most likely etiologies are
metastatic lung ca vs. metastatic RCC.  Neurologic status began
to progress to involve bilateral arms so he was initially
started XRT to C-spine, however this was stopped once his
condition progressed to respiratory failure.  He was continued
on dexamethasone for brain/spinal mets and seizure prophylaxis.


3. LEUKOCYTOSIS: Most likely due to combination of steroids and
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with vancomycin and
zosyn.

4. TRANSAMINITIS: Elevated LFTs and RUQ pain are concerning for
liver metastases. INR 1.4 so may have synthetic dysfunction as
well (though pt's nutritional status is also poor which could be
contributing).  This was not evaluated further due to decline in
patient quality of life and change of goals of care to comfort
measures only.
