Radiology
=========
CT abdomen/pelvis
1. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia with distal esophageal wall
thickening, new
from prior study. Findings likely reflect esophagitis, and can
be evaluated
with endoscopy and/or upper GI.
2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3. Fibroid uterus.
4. Oblong hyodense lesion adjacent to the left wall of the
bladder, measuring
3.2 cm, similar in size from [**2181-12-5**]. This appears
separate from the
ovary, and is of uncertain significance or origin. An MR is
recommended for
further evaluation
.
CT Head
There is no evidence of infarction or hemorrhage. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. The calvarium and soft
tissues are normal. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear.
.
CXR
In comparison with study of [**3-1**], the cardiac silhouette is again
at
the upper limits of normal in size with no evidence of vascular
congestion,
pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
