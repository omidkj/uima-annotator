IMPRESSION:
1. No new focus of parenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Evolving known right internal capsule and right pons

TEE (Complete) Done [**2146-10-5**] at 4:19:52 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. A pleural effusion is
seen.
CONCLUSION: No valvular vegetations or paravalvar abcess seen.
No evidence of endocarditis.

EEG Study Date of [**2146-10-4**]
IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking
state
secondary to a right hemispheric breach artifact. There were no
focal,
lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-10-13**] 4:50 AM
IMPRESSION: Mild interval improvement of retrocardiac
atelectasis with
persistent moderate left effusion.
