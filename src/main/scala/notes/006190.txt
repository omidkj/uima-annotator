Pt has had a long course concerning her recent diagnosis of
chronic cholecystitis. This was origianlly diagnosed in [**Month (only) **]
based on CT scan. Surgery was consult but per discussion with
family was felt not to be a surgical candidate. At that time she
had a perc. cholecystomy placed by IR and started on
Abx(initially cipro/flagyl and then switched to zosyn), bile
grew back only [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans which ID did not recommend
treating. She then underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**2-9**]. She was then sent to rehab where she continued to have low
grade fevers, and leukocytosis. She was found to be cidff
positive despite not having any diarrhea and started on flagyl.
CT scan on [**3-3**] showed diffuse colitis consistent with cdiff
infection.

In the ED she was found to be hypotensive not responsive to
fluids. She was intubated and right IJ with sepsis catheter was
placed. She got a total of 5L of fluid. She was started on
levophed as well. She was given levofloxacin, flagyl, and
vancomycin and decadron. She was also noted to be in significant
ARF, hypernatremic

CT Abd
1. Diffuse colitis, which compared to prior CT from [**2102-3-3**], appears worse.
2. Fluid-filled loops of proximal small bowel with decompressed
distal segment which may be suggestive of early or partial
small-bowel obstruction, No definite transition point is
identified.
3. Dilated contrast-filled stomach for which NG-tube
decompression is recommended.
4. Bilateral diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity as
well as consolidation within bilateral bases concerning for
aspiration pneumonia and superimposed early ARDS picture.
5. Distended gallbladder with probable adjacent pericholecystic
fluid. Ultrasound may be preformed to evaluate for acute
cholecystits if clinically warranted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt arrived to the floor in severe septic shock.  She was on
levophed, but continued to have a drop in her pressures.  Also
began have desaturations despite full oxygenation supprt.  She
required addition of vasopressin and high dose dopamine.  She
continued to get IVF's.  CXR showed pulmonary edema vs ARDS due
to sepsis.  She was given braod spectrum antibiotics of vanco(IV
and PO), zosyn, flagyl.  Also given steroids.  Despite this
treatment she continued to deteriorate.  Her BP continued to
drop and given her poor prognosis a discussion was held with the
family and decided to procede with aggressive care however
patient was made DNR.  She passed away at 0125 [**2102-3-7**] with her
family at the bedside.
