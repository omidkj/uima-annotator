History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 67F w/ myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and
post-intubation tracheal stenosis s/p stenting [**4-23**], presenting
from interventional pulmonary clinic with worsening dyspnea and
stridor.
.
In [**Month (only) 958**]-[**2109-3-8**] she was at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with MG crisis
requiring prolonged intubation and plasma exchange. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 89937**] when she was diagnosed with
post-intubation tracheal stenosis. This was a contact stenosis,
and ideally she would have gotten tracheal reconstruction from
thoracic surgery. However she was not a good candidate (on
steroids), so she got a balloon dilation with improvement in
symptoms. On [**4-23**], she got a stent for stridor. In pulmonary
clinic today, for scheduled follow-up, had audible stridor and
noted to be dyspneic with mild activity.
.
On the floor,  she states that her dyspnea has been progressive
since leaving the hospital, particularly over the past week with
coughing fits. Denies sputum, fevers or sick contacts to me. She
states her dyspnea is at its worst when supine and with minimtal
exertion of 20ft. States that her audible stridor has also been
worse over the past week.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, urinary incontince X 2 months since
hospitalization, no dysuria, malodor
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies arthralgias
or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Interventions/Radiographs:
==========================
CXR
[**2109-6-9**] Appearance of the trachea is unchanged since the prior
chest x-ray of [**Month (only) **] the 30th. The lungs appear clear. Cardiac
size is normal. There is no failure.

[**5-28**]
PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Small apical nodules and
pleural
thickening is identified, findings consistent with prior
granulomatous
disease. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There
is no
vascular congestion or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and
hilar
contours are within normal limits. Evaluation of the trachea is
limited on
this single frontal chest radiograph.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process or evidence of
pneumonia.

CXR [**5-29**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-28**], there is no interval
change.
Again there is mild hyperexpansion of the lungs but no acute
focal pneumonia or pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
67F w/ myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and post-intubation tracheal stenosis
s/p stenting [**4-23**], presenting from interventional pulmonary
clinic with worsening dyspnea and stridor, admitted to the MICU
for respiratory failure. Patient's breathing improved. On
[**2109-5-29**], patient taken to OR for bronchoscopy, stent removal,
and balloon dilation. Patient returned to MICU with stable vital
signs. Stridor and respiratory distress recurred, stabilized
with heliox. Patient was taken back to OR the same day,
underwent second bronchoscopy and was re stented with long
metallic stent and re-dilated to 12 mm. Observed in MICU for a
day and transferred to Medicine [**Hospital1 **] for further monitoring in
anticipation of tracheal reconstruction with Thoracic Surgery.
.
# Tracheal stenosis with stridor: Stenosis was result of
prolonged intubation in during previous hospitalization in
[**Month (only) 958**]-[**2109-3-8**] for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]. The decompensation had
to do with migration of the stent-tube. She underwent
bronchoscopy with removal of the stent. She decompensated and
was placed on heliox. She underwent a second bronchoscopy with
placement of a longer stent as a bridge to definitive tracheal
reconstruction by thoracic surgery. In order to undergo surgery,
her prednisone was tapered down to 10mg daily. Observed in MICU
for a day and transferred to Medicine [**Hospital1 **] for further
monitoring in anticipation of tracheal reconstruction with
Thoracic Surgery. On the floor, after a maneuvering herself for
a shower, patient suddenly felt short of breath. O2 sat remained
in the mid-high 90s, however patient felt anxious, diaphoretic,
and SOB and so was transferred to the MICU for observation until
going to the OR for her tracheal reconstruction 36 hours later.
Procedure was uneventful, area of stenosis was resected, trachea
was anastomosed, and patient was transferred to the SICU
post-op. She passed a bedside swallow evaluation on post
operative day two and had her diet advanced slowly. By post
operative day 2 she was returned to the regular floor and had
her JP drain at the surgical site removed. On the floor her head
was kept in bolsters except when she was up and out of bed
walking. On [**2109-6-11**] she had a bronchoscopy to evaluate the
anastomosis that showed wide patency of the anastomosis, and the
anastomosis looked completely intact.  She respiratory status
improved she continued to make steady progress.
.
# myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: Currently on prednisone taper which has
precluded surgery in the recent past; prednisone was decreased
as above to make surgery possible. Also continued CellCept and
pyridostigmine bromide. Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. She was given
stress dose of hydrocortisone during her operation and returned
to her pre-op dose of prednisone on post operative day 2. This
is off her current steroid taper but endocrine service stated
that she is OK to continue on prednisone 10mg daily after
surgery if she is asymptomatic, which she has been.
.
# DM: Insulin sliding scale while in house.  Of note, she has
anaphylaxis in response to artificial sweeteners. Her insulin
sliding scale had to be adjusted because of her Hydrocort stress
dose and return to pred
