Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2158-9-21**] 1. Left mini thoracotomy and placement of epicardial
left
    ventricular pacing lead x2.  The lead leads are the
    following:  Number 1 is [**Hospital 18121**] Medical reference
    number [**Serial Number 18122**], serial number [**Serial Number 18123**].  This was the one
    that was hooked up to the device.  The capped second
    lead in an [**Hospital 18124**] Medical lead, reference number [**Serial Number 18122**],
    serial number [**Serial Number 18125**].
2. Removal of old single chamber pacemaker.
3. Placement of new biventricular dual chamber pacing
    system.  It is a St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical model number PM3210,
    serial number [**Serial Number 18126**], item number [**Serial Number 18127**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of
systolic congestive heart failure, moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation, coronary artery disease s/p multiple
angioplasties with recurrent in-stent restenoses, s/p coronary
artery bypass grafting and patent foramen ovale closure in
[**2154-12-23**], recurrent atrial fibrillation s/p atrioventricular
nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker, hypertension, Wegener's
granulomatosis, chronic kidney disea s/p renal transplant and
prior stroke, who presented with shortness of breath.  For the
past two days, the patient has been experiencing progressively
worsening shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
orthopnea, along with increasing abdominal girth and weight gain
of four pounds.  Of note, he ran out of his daily Lasix 100 mg
prescription, which he receives by mail order, so he was only
able to take 50mg on [**9-11**] and nothing on [**9-12**].  He believes that
his difficulty breathing began at the time of taking the
decreaed dose of Lasix.  He saw his cardiologist, Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**]
in clinic on Friday [**9-8**], at which time his weight was 181.5
pounds and he noted dyspnea on exertion of one flight of stairs.
 Friday [**9-8**] was also his birthday, and the patient thinks that
he may have taken in a bit more fluid that day than usual.  He
was formerly evaluated by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] on [**2158-7-13**] for
biventricularpacemaker placement, but the left ventricular lead
was unable to be placed; the patient subsequently underwent
atrioventicular nodal ablation with a ventricular lead placed on
the right ventricular apex.  Afterwards, from [**Date range (1) 18128**], he was
readmitted with congestive heart failure exacerbation but
improved with adjustment of his diuretics.

15 years), cerebral [**Date range (1) 1106**] accident, gastric reflux,
Anxiety/Depression, obstructive sleep apnea, coronary artery
bypass grafting/closure of patent foramen ovale 1/7/[**2154**]/, left

contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left

4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
