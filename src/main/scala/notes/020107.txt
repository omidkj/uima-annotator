Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
81 yr male with history of Afib on coumadin, dyslipidemia, HTN
originally presents to OSH with acute shortness of breath on
[**8-31**].  He describes worsening SOB over the past month that has
been on and off as well as orthopnea that has been present for
some time.  Patient describes sitting in front of his TV when
the acute SOB came on suddenly.  He denied any accompanying
chest pain.  Tried himself on his fentanyl but when his symptoms
did not abate, he presented to OSH ED.  He was found to have ST
depressions and TWI in the inferior and lateral leads.
Troponins were in the indeterminate range (0.04) on admission
and stayed at 0.04 prior to transfer.  CXR was consistent with
acute pulmonary edema.  Patient had a new oxygen requirement,
requiring 6L on NC.  Patient was admitted to the OSH ICU.  He
was given 40 mg of lasix with some improvement of his symptoms.
OSH planned to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
catheterization.  Prior to transfer he was noted to be
hypotensive with SBPs in the 90s.  They were concerned for his
BP and so did not continue lasix.  He became more short of
breath and was placed on a NRB.  His BP recovered slightly and
so they gave him some IV lasix just prior to departure from the
OSH.  His last INR check was 2.9.  Patient also states he has
not been compliant on his medications recently.
.
On review of systems, patient had some ankle edema for a month
as well as orthopnea.  Denies chest pain and syncope.  Denies
fever or chills.  No cough or sputum production.  No blood in
stools.  No weight loss.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yr male with history of Afib on coumadin, dyslipidemia, HTN
originally presents to OSH with acute shortness of breath on
[**8-31**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concerns for NSTEMI.
.
# SOB: Patient found to have pulmonary hypertension with
extremely high PA pressures to 110 in cath lab.  Intubated in
cath lab.  Respiratory status improved and he was extubated and
weaned from oxygen.  PA pressures came down to 40s and swan-ganz
catheter was removed.  Pt received lasix diuresis which appeared
to help symptoms.  Patient also received Abx for possible
pneumonia but he remained aymptomatic and afebrile so Abx were
discotninued prior to discharge.  Etiology for SOB and pulmonary
HTN is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] will need follow-up regarding pulmonary
HTN.

# CORONARIES:  concerns for NSTEMI.  Troponins at OSH 0.03,
0.03, 0.04.  EKG shows LV hypertrophy and scooping ST segments
in the inferolateral leads which may be secondary to digoxin.
Underwent cath (see report below) with no evidence for CAD.
Discharged on baby aspirin and statin.
.
# PUMP: ECHO below showed normal LVEF but evidence for pulmonary
hypertension.  Etiology for pulmonary HTN is unclear.  Recommend
close follow-up.
.
# RHYTHM: afib, on warfarin at home.  Last INR at OSH was 2.98.
On admission, was in afib with HR in 60s and therapeutic INR.
Discontinued digoxin.  Continued atenolol and warfarin on
discharge.
.
# HTN: history of hypertension managed with atenolol.
Normotensive on admission.  Became hypotensive in cath lab and
was started on norepinephrine.  Blood pressures stabilized and
he was restarted on atenolol and low dose lisinopril.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: history of hyperlipidemia on statin.  Last
lipid panel was at OSH: T chol 189, TG 156, HDL 49, LDL 109.
Continued simvastatin

Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
no
angiographically apparent CAD.  The LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA were
without
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures with mean RA pressure of 20 mmHg and LVEDP of 40 mmHg.
 There
was severe pulmonary hypertension, with mean PA pressure of 60
mmHg,
with PVR of 432 dynes-s/cm5.  The systemic BP was normal on
neosynephrine, with SBP of 100 mmHg.  There was no aortic
stenosis
detected by LV pullback.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent CAD.
2. Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.  LEVF > 55%
