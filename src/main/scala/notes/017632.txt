Temporary femoral HD line removal
Femoral HD line placement


History of Present Illness:
59M with MMP including ESRD on HD, h/o recurrent line infection
with current femoral tunneled catheter in place, now admitted
with fevers from HD unit. Pt was feeling well until [**5-14**]
morning, when he developed rigors during dialysis-- he was found
to have a fever, and was subsequently given one dose of
vancomycin and gentamicin, and brought to the ED. Of note, pt's
usual HD schedule in MWF, but was changed to T/Th/Sat this week
due to death of his father last week.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 103.5, with HR 104, BP 120s/60s.
Bladder scan showed urine in bladder, but ISC unsuccessful. When
seen on the floor early this morning, pt was sleepy and only
awoke for few seconds, then fell asleep again. Unable to obtain
complete history from patient due to somnolence.
.
Of note, pt has had multiple admissions for MSSA line sepsis,
most recently in [**2117-12-24**], during which time a femoral
catheter was removed and replaced in the R groin. He completed a
course of cefazolin in [**Month (only) **], and was seen by ID at that time.

==================================================

Chest X ray [**2118-5-14**]:
The lungs are low in volume with minimal atelactasis in both
lung bases. The
cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinal silhouette and
hilar
contours are normal. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions. There is a
healed rib fracture on the right.
IMPRESSION:
Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2118-5-16**] TTecho:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with near akinesis of the inferior wall and inferior septum and
moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-1-6**],
the findings are similar (LVEF was overestimated on the prior
study)

[**2118-5-19**] TEecho:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF
30-35%) with inferoseptal wall akinesis and inferior wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets
consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for valvular vegetation, abscess or
mass. Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild
mitral regurgitation


Radiology Report US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT Study Date of
[**2118-5-16**]

FINDINGS: Transverse and sagittal images of bilateral upper
extremities were obtained. Three nonfunctioning fistula grafts
are identified; one in the right upper arm, one in the left
upper arm, and one in the left forearm. No flow was identified
within these grafts on color Doppler imaging. There is no
subcutaneous fluid collection seen in either arm. No suspicious
soft tissue mass is identified.

IMPRESSION: No collection identified in either arm at the sites
of the old
fistula grafts.

Brief Hospital Course:
# MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures obtained on [**5-14**] grew MRSA.
The patient was continued on vancomycin by HD protocol.  His HD
line was initially retained despite purulence coming from the
catheter site.  However, on hospital day # 2 he developed
hypotension in the setting of receiving lisinopril.  He was
transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis.  There his BP was
checked in his legs as he had a history of bilateral UE fistulas
and clots, it was much improved to 110-120s. He was however
tachycardic to 120s, and this improved with IVF. He was 4 liters
positive for his MICU stay. On [**5-16**], his femoral line was
removed by IR.  ID was consulted and recommended vancomycin, no
gentamycin. A TTE was negative for vegetation, but the patient
was still febrile as high as 104. An U/S of his bilateral old
fistulae was done and showed no abscess or infected clot. A TEE
was later performed and also negative for vegetations.  Renal
followed closely and the patient was given a 24 hr line holiday
before placing a temp line for hemodialysis.  He was dialyzed
