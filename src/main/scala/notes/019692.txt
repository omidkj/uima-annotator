Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for ethanol septal ablation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Alcohol septal ablation.
Pacemaker placement.


History of Present Illness:
71 year-old female patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with history of
symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Last Name (un) 4068**] several days ago for
evaluation of palpitations and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for
cardiac catherization and ethanol septal ablation. Pt reported
to OSH that she had transient episode of palpitations earlier
this week which resolved spontaneously. Pt has been followed
closely by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]; medications as below but of
note, amiodarone and nadolol were decreased due to bradycardia.
On presentation was found to be in AF complicated by ASx
hypotension with SBP's in 70's and bradycardia overnight.
.
Echocardiogram revealed moderately dilated LA, symmetric LVH,
and severe LV outflow tract obstruction, consistent with
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 3+ MR also noted.
Compared to echo on [**2133-6-14**], the degree of MR appeared
increased, and severe outflow gradient persistent.  The patient
was transferred to cath [**Year (4 digits) **] where she underwent an ethanol
septal ablation complicated by Complete Heart Block, for which a
temporary ventricular pacing wire was placed. Preprocedural
echocardiogram showed dilated left and right atria as well as
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion was normal with an overall left
ventricular systolic function being normal (LVEF>55%). There was
a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction(peak
resting subvalvular gradient of 87 mmHg). Remaining echo
unremarkable besides moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient paced but hemodynamically
stable. Pt without major compliant other than some mild back
pain. No groin pain. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. Pt
confirmed history as mentioned above.

BRIEF HISTORY:   71 yo female with known history of HOCM
presents with
palpitations and shortness of breath. Patient has history of
paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin and amiodarone. She presented to
[**Hospital **] with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and an echo
performed
revealed concentric LVH with septal diameter of 2.0cm and
posterior wall
diameter of 1.9cm. LVOT gradient of 70mmHg at rest and grade 3
MR with
normal valvular morphology. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further
evaluation with diagnostic catheterization and possible ethanol
septal
ablation for treatment of HOCM.


INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Assessment of coronary anatomy and HOCM

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 5 French JR4 catheter,
advanced to the RV position through a 5 French introducing
sheath.

Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Temporary pacing: was secured by placement of a 5 French bipolar

Electrode catheter in the right ventricle.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

**PTCA RESULTS
  SEPTAL

PTCA COMMENTS:     Intial angiography revealed normal coronary
arteries
with a single large septal vessel. Left ventriculography
revealed a LVOT
gradient of 100mmHg. We planned to perform ethanol septal
ablation to
treat her HOCM. Heparin was commenced prophylactically. A 6F
XBLAD guide
engaged the LCA providing adequate support. A Temporary pacing
wire was
inserted into the RV prophylactically. The 1st Septal was wired
with a
Choice PT wire and the vessel was then occluded with a Maverick
2.5x9mm
balloon. Contrast was injected through the balloon under echo
surveillance. The correct speed of injection was identified and
the
ethanol was then injected. A total of 1.4CC of ethanol was
injected
slowly into the septal vessel with the balloon inflated and
under echo
surveillance and fluoroscopy. Patient became pacemaker dependent
during
procedure (underlying LBBB). LVOT gradient reduced significantly

(resting gradient at end of procedure was 12mmHg). Patient was
sent to
CCU pacemaker dependent with temporary wire insitu. Plan for
permanent
pacemaker if no improvement within 24 hours.



COMMENTS:     Alcohol septal ablation for HOCM. 1.4cc of ethanol

injected. LVOT gradient reduced from 100mmHg to 12mmHg. Patient
became
pacemaker dependent during procedure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Significant LVOT gradient reduction (100mmHg>12mmHg) with
ethanol
septal ablation. Patient became pacemaker dependent dur
