noted approximately 1 cup of BRBPR after a BM and in the shower
the AM of admission. The PCA also noted that his stool was
normal color and that the patient appeared pale and somnolent.

after drinking Gatorade. At the OSH, the patient was hypotensive
in the 70s and had a Hct of 24 for which he received 2U of PRBCs
and 3L IVF. He underwent NGL at the OSH, which was negative. He
was started on omeprazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Also of
note, he was intermittently hypoglycemic at OSH but here his
glucose is 133. In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable with a
repeat Hct of 35, he was found to have UTI and was hypothermic
with a rectal temperature of 92. He was started on levofloxacin.

in [**7-27**] after an episode of BRBPR and found to have hemorrhoids.
Of note, the patient was discharged on [**10-9**] after ICU
