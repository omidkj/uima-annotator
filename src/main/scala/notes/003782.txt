Past Medical History:
1) DM2 diagnosed [**2114**] with triopathy: Creatinine has been as low
as 0.8 in the last couple of years, however widely fluctuant, as
high as 2 in the recent past. 0.9 in [**1-7**].
2) COPD, on home O2. Multiple episodes of respiratory failure
requiring intubation in recent years. Most recently, was
admitted in [**12-6**] with a perforated transverse colon requiring
partial colectomy and transverse colostomy. This course c/b
anticipated respiratory failure and anticipatory tracheostomy,
pseudomonal and MRSA PNA. Also with acalculous cholecystitis
requiring cholecystostomy tube. Had G-tube placed.
3) OSA on CPAP
3) VRE
4) s/p tracheostomy, as above in [**1-7**]
5) HTN
6) CHF: During hospitalization in [**10-20**] it was thought that
failure contributed to his respiratory failure. Last echo was in
[**12-6**] at which time LVEF thought to be roughly normal, however
very poor study and RV not visualized. Not on lasix.
7) Anemia of chronic disease, multiple transfusions in the past

8) s/p BKA for chronic LE ulcer
9) TIA in [**2125**].
10) Difficult intubation; fiberoptic guidance in [**Month (only) 359**] of
[**2131**].
11) Urinary retention.
12) Osteoarthritis.
13) Depression.
14) C. Difficile in [**2129**].
15) Hypogonadism.
16) Morbid obesity
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Bilateral carpal tunnel release in [**2123**].
2. Hydrocele repair in [**2126-4-3**].
3. Quadriceps tendon repair in [**2127**].
4. Status post partial resection of transverse colon, end
transverse colostomy, mucus fistula, jejunostomy tube and
percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2132-12-16**].

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
========
CXR [**4-12**]: Tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube, and right PICC
line remain in place, with a right PICC line continues to
terminate in the right subclavian vein. Cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged, and there is persistent increased pulmonary
vascularity as well as perihilar haziness and bilateral moderate
pleural effusions. Overall, there has not been a significant
change in degree of CHF.
.
LENI RLE [**4-12**]- IMPRESSION: Technically difficult exam, but no
evidence for DVT
.
TTE [**4-5**]: Suboptimal technical quality.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size  and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

PICC [**2134-3-25**]- IMPRESSION:
1. The tip of the right-sided PICC line in the distal portion of
the right subclavian vein.
2. Moderate congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small
bilateral pleural effusion. Bibasilar patchy atelectasis
.
LENI B/L LE's- IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
