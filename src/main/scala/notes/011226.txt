PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
67M CAD, DM2, COPD on 4L of home O2, HTN, asbestos exposure
(asbestosis?), OSA on nocturnal Bipap, admitted to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital on [**2128-5-3**] with subacute respiratory distress, started
on broad spectrum antibiotics, transfered to MICU this AM
because of worsening respiratory distress, found to have
multifocal pneumonia, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Patient has been admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] multiple
times in the last few weeks.  He was admitted most recently to
[**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2128-5-3**] at which time he was not able to provide much
clinical history but had been having worsening shortness of
breath as well as significant diarrhea and fever to 103F,
stating that he had been feeling sick for a long time.  He was
noted to be somewhat somnolent, easily falling asleep, increased
oxygen requirement.  He had also reported increasing weight and
leg edema over the last several days to weeks.  He was started
on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro in the ED for hospital-acquired
pneumonia coverage after right-sided infiltrate was seen on CXR.


On morning of transfer, patient's O2sat was noted to desat to
50% on Cpap while on the floor, so he was palced on high flow
non-rebreather with improvement in O2sat to 96%.  He was given a
dose of IV lasix 80mg x1.  ABG showed hypoxemia and hyercapnea,
though hypercapnea was presumed to be at his baseline.  CXR done
also in setting of spiking fevers showed new developing
infiltrate.  He was transfered to CCU for worsening multifocal
pneumonia and heart failure.  ABG was 7.38/60/107 on 10L O2 by
facemask. Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival, the patient was in no acute distress but having some
difficulty breathing.  He was transitioned from non-rebreather
during transport to CPAP on 6L NC.  He did have a large loose
bowel movement on arrival.  States that cough is worsening but
can not cough out sputum.  He denies nausea currently, but
states that he did have an episode of emesis earlier today.
Patient states that abdomen has been increasingly distended over
the last several weeks, as well as increased lower extremity
edema.  He believes he has gained 40 lbs in the last couple of
months.  Over the phone, his wife believes the patient had an
aspiration episode at some point in the last few weeks, though
unclear when, perhaps at home; wife has been in the hospital for
a few weeks, so she does not know details of recent history
well.

Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] [**Date range (1) 89899**] for presumed
COPD exacerbation triggered by viral illness, including
self-limited nausea/vomiting, diarrhea.  He had a fever to
100.8, no pneumonia seen on CXR, negative blood cultures.  He
was given a dose of IV solumedrol and started on a prednisone
taper.   He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 17717**] for ankle edema and
atypical chest pain, diuresed effectively, thought to have poor
compliance with low sodium diet.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI.  Gained 30-40 lbs in last 1-2 months.  Has had
recent fevers at OSH.
(-)  Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies
current nausea or abdominal pain.  No dysuria.

residual stenosis noted. Post procedure patient had left facial
droop and left hemiparesis, treated with IV TPA- no residual
deficits.
2.  Hypertension
3.  hyperlipidemia
4.  Diastolic CHF, s/p admission to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
[**2127-5-26**] for exacerbation

6.  Diabetes
7. Sleep apnea
8. ?Asbestosis
9. s/p epigastric hernia repair
10. s/p laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (patient reports difficulty
"waking up" after surgery)
11. pancreatitis
12. s/p tracheostomy many years ago in setting of severe sleep
apnea

grandchildren. Enjoys fishing.

Imaging:
[**2128-5-7**] CXR: There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal tip is
low and has an unusual course with the distal tip to the left of
midline. This may be within the azygos vein and should be
readjusted for more optimal placement. The catheter will have to
be pulled back at least 4-5 cm before readjustment. The cardiac
silhouette is prominent but stable. There is prominence of the
pulmonary interstitial markings as well as more focal areas of
consolidation at the lung bases. This may be due to combination
of fluid overload as well as developing infiltrates,
particularly at the lung bases. No pneumothoraces are seen.
There is calcification along the right hemidiaphragm which is
stable since the [**2126**] study and may be due to pleural plaques.

[**2128-5-8**] KUB: There is contrast seen throughout the colon
extending into the rectum. There are mildly prominent loops of
small bowel which are air filled in the left abdomen. Overall,
these findings are nonspecific and there are no signs for
small-bowel obstruction. No extraluminal contrast is seen. There
is no free air in the abdomen or pelvis.

[**2128-5-9**] CXR: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and there is
persistent vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness.
Asymmetrically distributed more confluent opacities are present
in the right mid and left lower lung regions, and are slightly
worse compared to the recent study. This may reflect
asymmetrical edema, but superimposed infection is al
