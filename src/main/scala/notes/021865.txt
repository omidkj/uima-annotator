History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for new coffee
ground emesis, unknown quantity. Per report started this
afternoon with 2 episodes over 10-15 mins. Not on
anticoagulation and no recent NSAIDs. Per report her daughter (?
[**Hospital 802**]) saw her 2 days ago and noted that she was not acting
herself. Says AOx2 at baseline, does not actually have advanced
dementia.

Per d/w [**Hospital 802**] [**Name (NI) 382**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since [**2193-3-23**]. She had
falled at home, had humerus fracture, post-op stayed in bed too
long, lost strength, placed in rehab, didn't move and basically
became unable to function. So transferred to nursing home part.
She does not have dementia. Occasionally sundowns. Per [**Year (4 digits) 802**] if
she is hydrated and well-fed she speaks normally. Usually AOx3,
knows how much money she has in the bank. Lately she has not
been eating or drinking, [**Year (4 digits) 802**] called them and told them they
need to make her eat and hydrate her. Lost [**1-25**] lbs in last
month. [**Month/Day (3) **] saw her last week and felt she was ok, and her
personal assistant ([**Last Name (un) **]) saw her 2 days and felt she was
altered, and noted she was looking for her dead sister, which is
clearly below baseline.

In ED initial VS t 104 hr 78 bp 145/50 rr 22 sat 100/2L. She was
noted to be responsive but AOx0. Guiaic negative. No episodes of
emesis in ED. Received 2L NS. Started on vanc/zosyn for UTI.
Some question of an aspiration pneumonia but no acute pulmonary
process on CXR. GI consulted and felt no indication for emergent
scope of NGT, fine to just monitor serial HCTs overnight and
start IV PPI.

On arrival to the ICU she said she "has been better", is
minimally conversational, appears comfortable.

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. No children. [**Hospital **] is her HCP and quite
involved with her care.
ADLs: Does not pay her own bills, cannot dress by herself due to
strength and joint problems, uses a diaper according to her
[**Hospital 802**] because that is their policy. Last walked about 1 year
ago. Her [**Hospital 802**] (who is a PT herself) feels this is because her
nursing home has not pushed her enough. Per OMR note [**2194-1-20**]
she was eating and drinking and participating in activies,
somewhat depressed, wheelchair bound and needs help with some
ADLs.
