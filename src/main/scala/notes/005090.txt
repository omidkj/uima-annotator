melena. Apparently the patient was admitted last week for a
colonoscopy. The patient had a colonoscopy on [**2148-3-15**] which
revealed polyps in the transvere colon, sigmoid colon, ascending
colon, and the hepatic flexure which all underwent biopsy. Post
biopsy he had a fever and was diagnosed with RLL PNA on [**2148-3-16**].
He was discharged home on a 7 day course of levofloxacin. Since
discharge, the patient noted purple streaks of blood in his
stool starting this AM, and has had 3 BM today. He denies

admit to some orthostasis and dizziness earlier today.

to 86. He was guaiac positive. NGL was negative for UGI bleed.
Hepatology saw the pt with plan for colonoscopy in the AM.

ECHO [**3-25**] [**2147**]

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There
is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area
0.8-1.19cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-12-7**],
there is now
moderate to severe aortic stenosis.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. If clinically
indicated, a TEE may
be better to exclude a small valve vegetation.



Brief Hospital Course:
 GIB:  The patient was initially in the MICU, where he was
stable and quickly transferred to the floor. The patient's
course was stable. His initial Hct was 29.8 within his baseline,
with his repeat Hct being 28.4. His INR was 1.5. He received 1U
of FFP, 1u of platelets and vitamin K 10SC.
The patient remained HD stable. Colonoscopy was performed and
the area of prior polypectomy was embolized, cauterized
successfully. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 for further
mgmt.   The patient continued to have persistently guaiac
positive stools, however his Hct remained stable on the floor.
He had no further episodes of blood loss or melena and was
scheduled for an EGD as an outpatient.
.
# FEVER: The patient spiked a fever on the floor which quickly
resolved. He has moderate AS and was not given abx prior to
scope on [**3-15**]. Post-procedure, spiked to 103 and had rigors.
Cultures were negative and patient was felt to have a pneumonia,
so was diagnosed w/ 7d course of levofloxacin (last dose 3/31).
Was not given any other abx before scope. ? if patient could
have had a transient bacteremia peri- or post-procedure, so an
echocardiogram was obtained which showed no vegetations.
Numerous blood cultures also showed no growth.
.
# CIRRHOSIS/COAGULOPATHY: No evidence of encephalopathy. Lasix
was held. The patient had EGD in [**1-31**] which showed 3 cords of
grade II-III esophageal varices. He is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was
given blood products/vitamin K prior to scope.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Likely related to GI bleed. Resolved and the
patient was slowly re-started on his blood pressure medications.

.
# h/o AFIB: NSR currently. Digoxin was continued. Diltiazem was
initially held but then restarted. No anticoagulation given
liver dysfunction.
.
# DM: FS QID + ISS.
.
# HYPONATREMIA: Resolved. It was previously likely in setting of
cirrhosis.
.
# FEN: Advance diet to regular. No further IVF. Checked lytes
daily, repleted prn.
.
# ACCESS: 2 LBIV
.
# PPX: Pneumoboots, PPI, no bowel regimen currently

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis:
Bleeding from polypectomy site
Aortic stenosis
.
Secondary diagnosis:
Hepatitis C
Cirrhosis
HCC
Atrial fibrillation
DM - diet controlled


Discharge Condition:
Good. Afebrile, BP and HR stable.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation of bleeding from your rectum.
Repeat colonoscopy was performed and it found that you were
bleeding from the site of your polypectomy. The bleeding was
controlled with injections and cautery. Your hematocrit remained
stable throughout your admission, but you were given blood
products to lower your bleeding risk peri-procedure.
Post-colonoscopy, you developed a fever and were started on
antibiotics in case of infection, particulary on your aortic
valve. You remained afebrile for the rest of your
hospitalization and all cultures showed no growth at time of
discharge. You had an ECHO performed which showed a worsening of
your heart murmur, but no infection on your valve. You were
discharged
