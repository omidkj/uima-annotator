back pain

History of Present Illness:
66 year old male with known metastatic thyroid CA to spine,
brain, ribs presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office for routine follow-up
today. The patient has back pain but no numbness or tingling.
The
pain in his back is more of a dull ache and is not nearly as
painful as the pain he had in his neck prior to the cyberknife
treatment he had at C1 in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year. He has not had any
urinary incontinence but did notice stool staining in his
underwear twice this week when he woke up in the morning. He has
had controlled bowel movements since then and reports no loss of
sensation in the groin or buttock region.

The patient noticed that his right leg felt slightly weaker
recently, but he had a right hip replacement and attributed the
weakness to that surgery.  The patient had an MRI of the
thoracic
spine which showed a new large lesion almost completely
occluding
the canal. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] sent him to the ER for neurosurgical
evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine. [**2160-8-1**]

IMPRESSION: Bony metastatic disease involving the T4, T5, T9,
and T10
vertebrae. Spinous process metastasis at T5 indents the spinal
cord and
results in 50% narrowing of the spinal canal with slight
indentation on the spinal cord. Epidural metastasis on the right
side of the spinal canal at T9 level displaces the spinal cord
to the left side and results in slightly more than 50% narrowing
of the spinal canal with moderate cord compression. Other
changes as described above.

IMPRESSION: Bony metastasis to right pedicle and body of the L1
and superior portion of L2 vertebra as described above. No
evidence of epidural mass or spinal cord compression.

BONE SCAN. [**8-4**]

IMPRESSION: 1. Osseous metastasis in multiple levels of the
thoracic and lumbar spine as described above. Uptake in some
vertebrae might be related to degenerative changes but a
differentiation cannot be made on the base of this study. 2.
Osseous metastasis involving multiple bilateral ribs. 3. Osseous
metastasis involving bilateral distal femora. 4. Increased
uptake surrounding the femoral component of the right hip
prosthesis in the right acetabulum likely related to
post-operative changes. However, residual underlying metastasis
cannot be ruled out completely.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurological surgery service on
[**8-1**] for treatment.  On admission, he was started on
dexamethasone, maintained on levonox fo prior history of
pulmonary embolism and maintained in a TLSO.  In preparation for
surgery on [**8-4**], a medicine consultation was obtained for
surgical risk stratification. CT exam also showed a T9
destructive lesion.  Also, bone scan showed evidience of mets at
multiple levels of the thoracic and lumbar spine, ribs, and
femurs.

On [**8-5**] he had an embolization by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and on [**8-7**] he had
T1-T12 Fusion.
On [**8-8**] he had good strength but was not following commands. He
received 2u PRBC and his repeat HCT was 28.9 On [**8-10**] Sputum Cx
sent. SVT w/[**Month/Year (2) 5509**] so a dilt drip was started. One drain was
removed.

On [**8-12**] bilateral pleural effusions were tapped by IR and on the
following day the 2nd drain out was removed and he was
extubated.  On [**8-14**] he was re-intubated. The next day his mental
status improved, was following some commands and went to the OR
for trach/peg. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transitioned to a trach mask on [**8-16**].

On [**8-18**] he had A-fib with rapid rate and was on esmolol drip.
Staples were removed that day. The esmolol was turned off on
[**8-19**] and he was transferred to the step down unit. The patient
had drainage from the JP site so a chest CT was obtained which
did not show pleural or thoracic fistula. On [**8-21**] he was in
a-fib again with [**Month/Day (4) 5509**] and was sent back to the ICU. Cardiology
was consulted to help manage his heart rate/rhythm. He converted
to sinus rhythm while in the ICU.

The patient had drainage from his JP site on [**8-24**] that was
purulent, tan, thick material. On [**8-25**] thoracics was consulted
and they determined that there was no indication for surgery
since the pleural effusions were improved. It appeared that the
drainage was only from the JP site and not from the previous
thoracentesis site. The JP site was still leaking but the
drainage was thin and yellowish. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] placed new sutures
over the area and by the next day ([**8-26**]) the site was completely
dry the sutures need to stay in place until [**9-12**]

On [**8-24**] a sputum culture came bac positive for pseudomonas so
Zosyn was started. ID was consulted and agreed that this should
be continued for 7 days. The drainage from the JP site grew out
proteus for which Zosyn was also appropriate. Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was
treated for HSV 1 infection on his lips with acyclovir as well.

He was transferred to step down unit again on [**8-26**] but then to
the MICU on [**8-28**] for lower GI bleed and melena. Pt was transfused
1 U prbcs and underwent a colonoscopy which showed:Polyp in the
ascending colon, Diverticulosis of the left > right, Ulcers in
the distal rectum (biopsy. Recommendations from GI were:
Follow-up pathology results. Hold anticoagulation for now and
avoid rectal tubes.
He was transferred to the MICU service on two different
occassions due to a GI bleed and atrial fibrill
