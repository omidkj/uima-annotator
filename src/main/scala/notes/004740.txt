Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Tylenol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Debridement of right 3rd toe and excision of the distal phalanx.
PICC line placed.


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness (source - patient who is tangential,
though oriented): 86 y.o. male with PMHx of atrial fibrillation
on Coumadin, COPD, DM, colon CA s/p left colectomy and iron
deficiency anemia who presents to the ED with a chief complaint
of vomiting blood. Patient reports a history of 4 days of
antibiotics (Augmentin) for a foot infection. He had been
experiencing foot pain for appoximately 2 weeks prior to the
initiation of antibioitics and for this, he was taking Advil [**Hospital1 **]
every day. He reports experiencing some dark stools throughout
this time and on the day of presentation, experienced an episode
of hematemesis for which he presented to the ED. He denies
abdominal pain, fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath,
palpitations. He does also note some drops of blood in the
toilet, but no frank hematochezia.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T - 97.7, BP - 131/45, HR - 77,
RR - 16, O2 - 97% RA. Hct was low at 15, down from baseline of
low 20s and INR was elevated to 8.3. NG lavage showed coffee
grounds which did not clear with 500ccs and rectal exam revealed
black stool that was frankly guaiac positive. GI was consulted
and planned for EGD once admitted. Patient was ordered for 10 mg
of vitamin K as well as 2 units of FFP and PRBCs. Patient's labs
were also notable for acute on chronic renal failure with
BUN/creatinine of 124/3.6 (creatinine up from baseline of 1.5 -
2.0). In the setting of this acute renal failure, troponin was
elevated to 0.13 without ischemic changes on EKG. Patient was
thus admitted to the MICU for further management of his severe
anemia with renal failure and a troponin leak.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was interactive and in no acute
distress with stable vitals.

CXR [**2203-6-10**]:
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are low lung
volumes.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is left
basilar
atelectasis. There is no right effusion or pneumothorax.
Pulmonary
vasculature is normal. Osseous structures are grossly normal.
IMPRESSION: Left basilar likely atelectasis.
.
X-rays of right toes [**2203-6-17**]:
FINDINGS: There is abnormal soft tissue swelling and ulceration
in the distal aspect of the right third toe. There appears to be
exposed bone, as well as gas at the distal tip of the third toe,
highly suspicious for osteomyelitis.
The cortical definition of the third distal to until [**Hospital1 **] is
also irregular consistent with cortical destruction. There is
extensive osteopenia. Vascular calcifications are present. There
is cortical thickening along several of the metatarsal shafts,
likely chronic.
.
Right third toe debridement [**2203-6-14**]:
Acute osteomyelitis.
.
Fundoscopic mucosa biopsy [**2203-6-16**]:
Gastric fundic mucosa, biopsy:  Focal foveolar hyperplasia.

DUPLEX DOP ABD/PELVIS LIMITED & Abd ultrasound complete [**2203-6-17**]:
FINDINGS: There is somewhat limited evaluation of the liver due
to body
habitus and inability to suspend respiration. No intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation is seen. On dedicated Doppler
interrogation, there is normal flow and waveforms within the
portal and hepatic veins, as questioned. The proximal common
duct measures 3 mm in diameter. There is significantly limited
visualization of the pancreas. There is limited visualization of
theaorta. The gallbladder is normal. The right kidney is normal
