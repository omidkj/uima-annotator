CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-2-15**] 12:29 PM
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
Reason: Please perform High Resolution cutshemoptysis,
localization
Field of view: 36
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 yo male with hx of onset of persistent hemoptyis, 3
bronchocopies non-diagnostic. outside CT? RUL ground glassCXR
?generalzied hazy ground glass
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please perform High Resolution cutshemoptysis, localization and
r/o bronchiectasis,
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Persistent hemoptysis.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT contiguous images of the chest from the thoracic
inlet through the level of the adrenals were obtained without
injecting of the IV contrast media. The 5 and 1.25-mm slices
were reconstructed for evaluation.
The heart is normal. Multiple coronary calcifications are seen.
No pericardial effusion is present. Multiple small mediastinal
lymph nodes are seen which do not meet the criteria for
pathological lymph node enlargement. The aorta and pulmonary
trunk are normal within the limits of this unenhanced chest CT.
Multiple apical pleural bullae are seen bilaterally, more
prominent on the right. No pneumothorax is seen. A widespread
centrilobular emphysema is seen mostly within the upper lobe,
but the lower lobes are involved as well. Some amount of
subpleural emphysema is also present bilaterally. Small blebs
are seen within the lower lungs.
Prominent thickening of the bronchial wall is seen mostly on the
right, especially within the right middle lobe. Ground-glass
opacity is seen within the right middle lobe with areas of air
cavities within it which may represent blebs surrowneded by
consolidation. Some element of volume loss within the right
middle lobe is also present.
Widespread areas of patchy ground-glass opacity are seen within
the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, and of small amount in
the right upper lobe.
A 1-cm pulmonary nodule with indistinct spiculated borders is
seen within the right middle lobe, series 102, images 143-148.
In addition, multiple small tiny nodules are seen scattered
bilaterally, but most prominent on the right.
The images of the upper abdomen reveal multiple small
calcifications within the pancreas mostly within the body and
tail which represent most probably chronic pancreatitis.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral centrilobular and subpleural emphysema most
prominent in the upper lung lobes.
2. Ground-glass opacities most prominent in the right middle and
right lower lobe and may represent infectious, inflammatory
noninfectious process as well as hemorrhage.
3. An ill-defined 1-cm nodule in the right middle lobe is seen.
Further followup with chest CT is recommended in three months.
4. Multiple tiny nodules are spread over the right lung which
may be related to the diffuse above-described process.
5. Thickening of the bronchial wall and small bronchiectasis
more prominent in the right perihilar region and right middle
lobe.
6. Chronic pancreatitis.

TRANCATHETER EMBOLIZATION  [**2194-2-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Selective arteriography of 2 additional right bronchial
arteries (not visualised on the study of [**2-18**]) supplying the
right upper lobe demonstrated abnormal tortuous distal vessels
associated with contrast blushing. No active extravasation was
demonstrated in this distribution and no spinal artery was
visualized. Given the current active hemoptysis, embolization of
these 2 additional bronchial arteries with 300-500 micron
particles was performed. Hemostasis was achieved in the superior
vessel and significant reduction of blood flow was achieved in
the inferior vessel.
2. Selective arteriography of the main right bronchial artery
confirmed complete stasis of blood flow in this distribution
consistent with right bronchial artery embolization on [**2194-2-17**].
3. Selective arteriography of the left bronchial artery
demonstrated normal- appearing vessels.
4. At procedures end, there was cessation of active hemoptysis
and no neurologic deficits appreciated.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
Reason: please perform high res CT scan of chest
Field of view: 36
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p empolization of vessels of RUL
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please perform high res CT scan of chest
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 59-year-old man with embolization of right upper
lobe vessel.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest are obtained
without the administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
COMPARISON: Chest CT dated [**2194-2-15**].
FINDINGS: The evaluation of pulmonary and mediastinal
vasculature is somewhat limited due to lack of intravenous
contrast. Small mediastinal nodes are seen, however, there is no
significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Coronary
artery is calcified. The heart is normal in size, and there is
no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion.
In the lung window, again note is made of centrilobular
emphysematous change. Note is made of peribronchial thickening
in right middle lobe, with patchy opacities, slightly improved
compared to the prior study. Again note is made of 8 mm somewhat
spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe, which needs followup
in three months. Note is made of small cyst in the left lower
lobe. The central airways are patent.
In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, calcified
pancreas is seen.
There is no susp
