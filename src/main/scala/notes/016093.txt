Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 13983**] is a 62 year-old
female with a past medical history significant for mitral
valve replacement secondary to rheumatic heart disease,
hypertension, high cholesterol, cerebrovascular accident in
[**2141**] and asthma who presented to the C-Med service with new
onset of congestive heart failure.  The patient had a mitral
valve stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease and had
this valve replaced with a St. Jude valve on [**2143-10-16**].  She
had been doing quite well until about four weeks prior to
admission when the patient noted an abrupt change in her
exercise capacity.  She noted dyspnea on exertion with
minimal activity and even at rest.  Her primary care
physician sent the patient for an echocardiogram which showed
a notable decrease in her ejection fraction from 50 percent
previously down to 10 to 20 percent with severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis.  After the echocardiogram the
patient's primary care sent her to the emergency department
for heparinization while the INR comes down in anticipation
of a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was comfortable on admission
except for her dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Mitral valve replacement St. Jude
valve secondary to mitral valve stenosis for rheumatic heart
disease.  2) Hypertension.  3) High cholesterol.  4)
Cerebrovascular accident in [**2141**] leaving her with residual
right sided weakness and lastly asthma.  o known drug
allergies.

occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Was positive for coronary artery disease.
Sister had a coronary artery bypass graft at the age of 51.
Mother developed coronary artery disease in her 50s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, blood pressure
was 158/81, heart rate 83 and regular, respiratory rate 18,
saturation 99 percent on room air.  In general in no apparent
distress.  Neck: positive jugular venous pressure with pulse
noted at 10 cm, positive jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  S1 mechanical, S2, irregularly irregular,
soft diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lung clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nontender. Extremities:  no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic examination: 4/5
strength in the right upper extremity, 5/5 strength
elsewhere. Cranial nerves intact.  Dysphagia which is
chronic, status post patient's cerebrovascular accident.

LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram on [**2144-2-14**] showed a
moderately dilated left atrium, a mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction estimated to be 10 to
20 percent, depressed right ventricular systolic function, no
aortic stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, mitral valve
replacement well seated, severe mitral annular calcification,
3+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension,
significant pulmonic regurgitation.  Left ventricular
function significantly worse with ejection fraction noted to
be down from 50 percent on echocardiogram nine months prior
to this current echocardiogram.  Cardiac catheterization in
[**2141-10-25**] showed no significant coronary artery
disease, left ventriculogram showed no wall motion
abnormalities.  Hematocrit on admission 38.7, white count
6.8, platelet count 176,000.  Coagulation profile:  INR 2.6,
PTT 34.6, PT 19.7, creatinine 1.2, BUN 21, glucose 94.  Chest
x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with cardiac enlargement, no
congestive heart failure, no infiltrate, pneumothorax or
effusion.  Electrocardiogram:  atrial flutter with variable
block at 75 beats per minute, biphasic T waves in 1 and AVL,
V4 through V6, ST depressions in V5 through V6, atrial
flutter was noted to be new since electrocardiogram from
[**2143-10-15**].

IMPRESSION:
This is a 62 year-old female with a history of mitral valve
replacement in [**2143-9-24**], hypertension, high cholesterol
and stroke with residual dysphagia admitted for cardiac
catheterization to evaluate for an ischemic cardiomyopathy.
he patient was also found to have new atrial flutter since
[**9-24**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1) New onset congestive heart failure with
marked decline in ejection fraction:  The patient's Coumadin
was held and the patient was started on intravenous heparin
so that she could be anticoagulated for both her valve and
atrial arrhythmia until cardiac catheterization.  The cause
of the new onset heart failure was thought to be either
secondary to 1) repeated microembolic events, 2) a large
embolus or thrombus in the LAD transiently during the
patient's mitral valve replacement, 3) the etiology was not
determined to be secondary to the mitral valve itself as the
echocardiogram showed the valve to be well seated, and 4) it
could be ischemic cardiomyopathy, or 5) a viral
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was continued on aspirin,
Diovan, Toprol and Lasix as well as well as the Torvastatin
prior to cardiac catheterization.  The patient had a TEE on
hospital day umber two.  This revealed a left appendage
thrombus.  Therefore, the patient was not a candidate for DC
cardioversion of the atrial flutter.  For management of the
atrial flutter she was rate controlled and kept on heparin.
The left atrial appendage thrombus was likely a complication
of the mitral valve replacement surgery and with time would
likely dissolve.  The patient was able to go for a cardiac
catheterization on [**2144-2-19**] after her INR had come down.  The
findings of cardiac catheterization were as follows.  Cardiac
output was 3.5 with a cardiac index of 2.12.  The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was a mean of 15, right atrial
pressure of 5, the PA pressure was 42/18 with a mean of 27,
left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 16, right
ventricular pressure 42/0 with an end of 5.  This was
interpreted as mild elevation of the pulmonary capillary
wedge and PA pressure.  Left ventriculography showed mitral
regurgitation, global left ventricular hypokinesis with no
mitral regurgitation.  Coronary angiography showed only a 10
to 20 percent plaque within the left main.  In the LAD there
were very minor irregularities, left circumferential minor
irregularities, RCA no significant abnormalities and there
was said to be no evidence of macro emboli in the coronary
arteries.  Therefore, based on the cardiac catheterization
the cardiomyopathy was not secondary to ischemia.  The
patient had no signs or symptoms of a viral cardiomyopathy
with no viral prodrome, no elevation of white blood count, no
history of fevers or chills.  Therefore, it was thought that
patient's global cardiomyopathy was likely secondary to
transient emboli to the LAD during her mitral valve
replacement surgery.  It was decided with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
heart failure service to have the patient sent for a
metabolic exercise stress test with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4001**].  This was at
Dr.[**Name (NI) 13590**] request to 1) assess baseline function, and 2)
as part of a workup for possible future transplant surgery
depending on the results.  Regarding the patient's cardiac
left atrial appendage clot, cardiac surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **].
They felt that surgical ligation of this clot was risky and
would not decrease the risk of embolization from this clot.
On [**2144-2-20**] the patient was noted to have oozing of blood at
the cardiac catheterization site in he right groin.  This
resolved with compression.  The patient's PTT level was kept
tightly between 60 and 80 on the heparin drip.  The
cardiology fellow injected the groin with an epinephrine-
Lidocaine injection and this resulted in sensation of
bleeding.  On the morning of [**2144-2-21**] the patient was noted to
he light headed and hypotensive with blood pre
