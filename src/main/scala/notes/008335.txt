Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 39536**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 60 yo M c schizophrenia, psychiatric admissions, had fall
this morning.  Took unspecified amount of acetaminophen (likely
12 * 500 mg tablets) and then brought to ED after being found by
[**Hospital3 **] staff.  In ED received activated charcoal,
acetylcysteine; serum acetminophen level at 142.8 approx 3 hours
post ingestion. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].   Likely time of ingestion is
11:30-12:30.  On exam, pt. is tangential, uncooperative, and
poor historian.  Reports no abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
multiple psych admissions
chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia
homelessness
psych med non-compliance
s/p multiple elopement

Social History:
Homeless, currently residing at [**Location (un) 976**] Rest Home.  Prior
history of ethanol abuse.  The patient has no living family
members with whom he is in contact.
Learning disability (per previous d/c summary from [**Hospital1 **]).
Attends church every day while at [**Location (un) 976**].


Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
VS - 77, 124/98, 95% RA, 12, 96.5
HEENT - anicteric sclerae, OP clear, MMM
LUNGS - CTA
HEART - RRR, S1, S2
ABD - soft, NT, ND, neg Murphys, liver 3-4 cm within costal
margin
EXT - high frequency resting tremor; no asterixis
NEURO - alert and oriented; tangential.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT: There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. There are associated atelectatic changes at
both lung bases. A few small blebs are seen at the right lung
apex, and there is linear scarring at the left lung apex. There
is no focal consolidation. Secretions are seen within the upper
trachea. Bronchi are, however, patent to the segmental level. A
few small nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are
present.
A left subclavian central venous catheter is present with its
tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Images of the upper
abdomen demonstrate markedly distended stomach with air,
debris/foodstuff, and high-density presumably oral contrast
material within it.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar effusions and associated atelectasis.
2. Distended stomach as described above.

Abd u/s:
1) Diffusely echogenic and coarsened hepatic parenchyma, likely
consistent with fatty infiltration, though more severe forms of
liver disease such as cirrhosis/fibrosis are not excluded.
Probable area of focal fatty sparing anterior to the hepatic
artery in the right lobe.
2) Unremarkable Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature.
3) Small right pleural effusion.
4) Trace amount of free fluid within Morison's pouch.
5) Contracted gallbladder, not well evaluated on this study.

Head CT:  There is a small area of left frontal lobe
encephalomalacia, indicating previous infarction.  There is no
acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  No major vascular
territorial infarct is identified.  The ventricles and sulci are
prominent consistent with age-related involutional change.
Unchanged focal areas of decreased attenuation within the
periventricular and subcortical white matter likely represent
microvascular infarctions.  Linear foci of increased density
over the bilateral frontal lobes may represent partial volume
averaging effect.  The visualized osseous structures, mastoid
air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.
.
CXR: PA film, rotated.  Clear lung fields, distinct
hemi-diaphragms, clear heart borders.

Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 60 yo M c psychiatric history admitted for

charcoal and NAC in the ED and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
monitoring.  His LFTs peaked on HD3 w/ (ALT=3477, AST=2345,
AP=1586) and have trended down since this point.  His UOP and Cr
have remained normal throughout the course and his NAC was
discontinued several days before discharge.  Hepatotoxic drugs
were held

afebrile and was w/out cough.  His O2 was weaned throughout his
stay and he was stable on RA at the time of discharge.
