[**2148-10-28**] disability and rehab for pulmonary rehab.  She was
admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2148-10-29**] for shortness of breath.  The patient was
originally admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for five days of chronic
subjective left-sided swelling.  Patient was found to have a
low hematocrit and transfused two units of blood cells.
Upper extremity Dopplers were negative for deep venous
thrombosis.  Stools were guaiac positive.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed
without evident source of bleeding.

Regarding her COPD, patient's pulmonary function tests were
repeated showing poor baseline and severe obstructive defect.
FEV1 was 19%.  Patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for
pulmonary rehab on [**2148-10-28**] and respiratory status
decreased at [**Hospital1 **].  Arterial blood gases showed a PCO2
of 90; however, her baseline is approximately 70.  Patient
was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenous and Lasix
40 mg intravenous and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].

In the Emergency Department the patient was placed on
bilateral positive airway pressure, and arterial blood gases
repeated showing a pH of 7.25, PCO2 of 81, and PO2 of 54,
which was similar to her gas on discharge from MTH.  Patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for COPD exacerbation and BiPAP.
Patient refusing BIPAP in the SICU was treated with
Venti-mask and nasal cannula.  O2 saturations were 95 to
100%. Patient was given two days of Prednisone at 60 mg to
complete approximately a two-week taper.  No further diuresis
was required.  There are no clinical indications for
antibiotics during this course.  Patient remained afebrile
without cough or sputum.

with daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on admission:  98.3, blood
pressure 151/62, heart rate 116, O2 95% on face mask at 10
liters per minute.  Exam notable for an obese female.
Uncomfortable in bed.  Neck:  Soft and supple.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, tachycardiac; S1,
S2 present.  Lungs were with distant breath sounds
bilaterally with expiratory wheezing and bibasilar crackles.

LABORATORY DATA:  Notable for gas of 7.26, 78, 71 which
improved to 7.32, 72, 77.  PFTs from [**2148-10-28**]:  FEV1/FVC
ratio 19% of predicted.  Sodium 137, potassium 5.4, chloride
96, bicarbonate 34 approximately at baseline, BUN 33,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 167, lactate 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Patient was treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure
with BiPAP, however, patient refusing BiPAP and managed with
Venti-mask and nasal cannula.  Patient maintained O2 sats
greater than 93%.  Patient was continued on nebulizers p.r.n.
Patient was placed on Prednisone taper.  No current
indications for antibiotics.  O2 was weaned for sats greater
than 95%.  Currently patient is satting 93% liters at 4
liters.

2.  Hyperkalemia:  Patient found to be hyperkalemic with
maximum value of 6.1.  Patient was given two doses of

last checked was 5.6 and decreasing.

3.  Type 2 diabetes:  Patient was started on Glyburide 2.5
and continued on Metformin 850 t.i.d.  Patient has had
difficulty maintaining glycemic control secondary to constant
use of steroids.  Given diabetic and cardiac diet.

4.  Hypertension:  [**Last Name (un) **] withheld secondary to potential renal
effect and concern for hyperkalemia.  Patient was started on
Hydrochlorothiazide.  Blood pressure elevated but stable.
Patient was also started on Nifedipine for increased blood
pressure control.

5.  Anemia:  Patient noted to have a hematocrit of
approximately 30 on admission; however, this noted to be her
baseline and currently stable.  No significant changes in
