History of Present Illness:
46 yo male presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with intermittent chest pain
for 3 days. NSTEMI with ongoing active sternal [**9-19**] CP & diaph.
EKG w/T wave changes in lateral leads; mild inferior ST
depressions. First Trop was 10.10 @ 1250 and CKMB of 229. He was
loaded with 325mg ASA, 600mg Plavix, started on intergrillin,
heparin, and nitro gtts and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 18**], pt
taken to cath lab where 3VD was found. No intervention performed
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in CT [**Doctor First Name **] preferring to wait until Tues for
proceedure to allow plavix washout. In holding area after cath
pt started having CP again and nitro was restarted and patient
was sent to the CCU for monitoring w/concern that he might need
a balloon pump.
.
Pt reports that his chest pain started on Monday. It was a
squeezing sensation that was mostly consitent with brief spells
of 3-5min where it would remit. There were no particular
aggrevating or alleviating factors. He reports radiation to his
R jaw and diaphoresis on an off during the pain. He denies
radiation to the arms or back, lightheadedness/dizziness,
nausea, vomiting, or SOB/DOE/Orthopnea since his pain started.
Before Monday, he had never had pain like this. 3-4 months agao
he does report episodes of "palpitations" where he felt as if
his heart was beating very fast without chest pain or SOB. He
saw his PCP about this and was given a heart monitor but the
monitor never picked up any abnormal rhythms and the sensation
of palpitations went away and has not returned. There were no
issues with SOB/DOE leading up to his current presentation
although he thinks he has decreased exercise capacity due to
being "fat and out of shape". He denies abdominal pain,
constipation, diarrhea, leg pain/weakness, headache, ear pain,
nasal discharge, cough, wheezing.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2105-9-2**]):
Briefly: LMCA- normal, LAD 50% prox, 80-90% mid, 90% diagonal,
Left cx
60-70% ostial, 60% mid, RCA 60% prox, 60% mid, 60% distal

Echocardiogram-Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.

POST-BYPASS: Initially after separation from bypass, there was
normal right ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle
displayed the same focal and overall function noted in the
pre-bypass study. About 30 minutes after separation, both
ventricles developed moderate to severe global hypokinesis with
a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. Epinephrine and
milrinone infusions were started and function returned to
baseline. The mitral regurgitation was somewhat improved - now
mild to moderate. The tricuspid regurgitation was initially
worsened - up to moderate - but improved to mild after
ionotropes were started. The thoracic aorta was intact after
decannulation.

Final Report CHEST RADIOGRAPH
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a new right-sided PICC line. The line is
malpositioned in the right internal jugular vein, the tip is not
visualized on the image. Re-positioning of the line is required.
A wet read was delivered at the time of image acquisition.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise
unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24861**] is a 46 year old man who presented with chest pain
and an NSTEMI from an outside hospital with three vessel disease
on cardiac catheterization but still was having intermittent
chest pain despite significant medical management.  He was
referred for coronary artery bypass grafting and his
pre-operative work-up was completed. He underwent surgery with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**9-4**]. He was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on milrinone, epinephrine, amiodarone and propofol
drips. His drips were weaned on POD #1 and he was extubated on
POD #2. He transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin
increasing his activity level. The chronic pain service was
consulted to help manage his narcotic needs.
Once on the floor his hospital course was largely uneventful.
He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight, Beta blockade
was begun and titrated up as tolerated hemodynamically.  A PICC
was placed the in midline position for a
