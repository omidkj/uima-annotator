Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve on [**2174-8-16**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16905**] is a 70-year-old woman who was
referred with critical aortic stenosis.
In [**2173-10-18**], she suffered a syncopal episode and presented
to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital where evaluation documented critical
aortic stenosis by both catheterization as well as
echocardiography.  Coronary angiography at that time
demonstrated
an occluded proximal LAD, moderate diffuse disease in the LCx,
and an occluded RCA.  There was a patent SVG to the right
coronary and a patent SVG tot he LAD. Quantitation of her aortic
stenosis yielded a mean transvalvular gradient of 46 mmHg and a
valve area of 0.6 by Fick estimate. At that time, the patient
reportedly had a significantly elevated pulmonary arterial
pressure of systolic of 115mmHg, though no wedge pressure was
available in the report. She was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50180**] of
Cardiothoracic Surgery at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] and deemed to be
prohibitively high-risk candidate for traditional aortic valve
surgery.

Over the ensuing six months,  the patient has had recurrent
episodes of syncope as well as falls due to gait instability.
She
has continued to have exertional chest pressure, but no
palpitations and she has been hospitalized several times
following falls at home. She has profound dyspnea on exertion
(NYHA Class III) and has had several episodes of syncope per
month. She now reports onset of chest discomfort after 15 feet
of
walking.
     She has met inclusion criteria for Corevalve study and does
not meet exclusion criteria. Her findings have been reviewed,
submitted, and accepted for the Extreme arm Corevalve study.
     Since last seen in office, she is only able to ambulate
short distances (room to room) due to shortness of breath. She
comes in this am somewhat lethargic and diaphoretic, blood
glucose was 43, she was treated with 1/2 amp of D50w, and oral
juice, blood glucose 188. Patient somnolent, family reports she
took 2 doses of clorazepam at 2am. Patient reports she has been
anxious about procedure and has been unable to sleep. Answers
questions appropriately, somnolent unless verbally stimulated.
ABG done on baseline O2 3L nc. Acceptable findings.

NYHA Class: III-IV

colon, with no evidence of obstruction at this point.
4. Pulmonary nodules that, based on the size, should be
reevaluated in one year.
5. Status post CABG with what appears to be patent bypass to
distal LAD and PDA.
6. Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes that might be reevaluated
on subsequent study.
7. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
8. Right hypodense kidney lesion as well as hypodense liver
lesion that should be correlated with ultrasound.
9. Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid with multiple nodules that
