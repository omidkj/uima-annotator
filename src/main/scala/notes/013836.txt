CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The main airways are patent to the
segmental level. There is right lower lobe consolidation, with
air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonia. Fluid tracking
along the right middle fissure. Patchy infiltrate superior to
the dominant area of consolidation, likely also a component of
the infectious process. Fluid tracking along the major fissure
as well. Atelectasis at the base. The right lung is otherwise
clear. The left lung is essentially clear with mild atelectasis
at the base. There is no evidence to suggest significant
interstitial lung disease. There are no pathologically enlarged
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes. The heart and
pericardium are unremarkable. A right-sided IJ catheter is in
place. There is no evidence to suggest a mass obstructing the
right lower lobe bronchus. Contrast bolus is not adequate to
evaluate for pulmonary embolus, however, there is no evidence of
major central embolus. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen
demonstrates no abnormalities. The gallbladder is distended but
demonstrates no evidence of stones or other signs to suggest
cholecystitis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia. No evidence of
obstructing mass. No evidence to suggest interstitial lung
disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:

In the MICU, the pt. was maintained on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin after a CT scan was performed and confirmed a RLL
infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia.  He improved substantially
on this antibiotic regimen.  This, in conjunction with nebulizer
treatments, allowed the pt. to be slowly weaned down to 4L O2
via NC at the time of transfer to the floor.  His blood pressure
remained stable for the duration of the MICU stay and at no
point did the pt. require pressors.
All of the pt's other medical problems remained stable.  At the
time of transfer, the pt. offered no complaints and felt well.
He stated that he is breathing very easy on the nasal cannula.
He reported he had felt afebrile for roughly 24 hours.

The following issues were addressed upon transfer to the floor:

1. Right lower lobe pneumonia: Respiratory culture grew out
strep pneumoniae.  Once sensitivies were resulted, the pt. was
changed from IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin to oral
levofloxacin.  His leukocytosis trended down over the remainder
of the hospitalization and he was successfully weaned off of
supplemental oxygen to the point where he was breathing
comfortably on room air at discharge. He did experience some
episodes of hemoptysis which were felt to be due to his
underlying pneumonia. He was given morphine prn for back and
radicular pain exacerbated by cough.  Blood cultures were
without growth at the time of discharge.

2. Anemia: The pt. was discovered to be iron deficient and was
started on iron supplementation.  His hematocrit remained stable
for the duration of the hospital stay.  It was recommended that
he undergo a colonoscopy as an outpatient.

3. HTN: Once the pt's blood pressure was determined to be
stable, he was restarted on his usual outpatient regimen of HCTZ
and amlodipine.

4. H/O IV drug abuse: The pt. was maintained on his usual dose
of methadone during the hospital stay.
