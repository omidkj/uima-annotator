Allergies:
Keflex / Percodan / Duragesic / Procardia / Augmentin / Iodine;
Iodine Containing / Fentanyl / Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
84 yo F w/ hx of CAD s/p angioplasty [**2160**] (anatomy unknown),
extensive PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, PAF on coumadin, and h/o
GI bleed in [**2181**] who is transferred from [**Hospital3 19345**] after reportedly presenting with hematemesis with a Hct
of 16 and CP. The pt denies any episodes of hematemesis and
states that she presented to the hospital in the setting of
increasing frequency and severity of non-radiating SSCP. She has
had "stable angina" for several years after her POBA in '[**66**] but
this has worsened over the past few months to the point that she
will have these symptoms at rest. Three weeks ago, she had [**2-7**]
episodes of melena. Her PCP referred her for a EGD/colonoscopy
that showed minor gastritis without any gastric or duodenal
ulcers and severe diverticulosis to the cecum. She did not
undergo a capsule endoscopy.
.
Four days prior to admission, she had a repeat episode of
melena. She denies BRBPR or hematemesis. This was accompanied
with worsening ? pleuritic SSCP with SOB. She was then evaluated
at the OSH where she was found to have a Hct of 16, INR 3.7,
troponin I 2.10, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in lead I, aVL, V3-6.
She was transfused a total of 5 units pRBC and given FFP to a
Hct of 33.1 and INR 1.4 at the time of transfer. ASA, coumadin,
and cilostazil were held and a protonix gtt was started. GI was
consulted and held off on scoping her in the setting of
stuttering chest pain not completely relieved with a nitro gtt
and IV morphine, worsening EKG ST depressions on EKG, and a
troponin I peak to 57.27, CK 711, and MBI 11.1. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac and GI evaluation.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, and hemoptysis.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She does complain of
rest calf pain for which she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on
[**11-1**] and the plan was for an angiogram via the L brachial
approach with possible catheter based intervention.  All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. + LE edema, chest pain, SOB as above.

Pertinent Results:
Cath ([**11-15**]): 2VD with subtotally occluded RCA-difficult target
for PCI and in setting of rapid afib, GI bleed prefer medical
therpapy for now
LMCA: short vessel
LAD: diffuse mild
LCx: 60% irregular OM1; distal diffuse 60% before LPL
RCA: serial 90% proximal. mid and distal with compewtitive flow
to R PDA from L-->R collaterals.  very difficult to engage RCA
due to turtuosity and root anatomy
.
CK peak: 1316
.
Echo ([**2184-11-17**]):
left atrium is normal in size
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, with the
basal segments contracting best (LVEF = 35 %)
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild to
moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral
.
Echo ([**2184-11-18**]): No evidence of endocarditis. Moderate mixed
global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Otherwise no change.
.
CTA, chest ([**2184-11-17**]): 1.  Pulmonary emboli involving the left
lower, right middle, and right lower lobes.  2.  Multiple patchy
opacities in the lungs, including a more discrete nodular
opacity in the right upper lobe measuring 8 mm.  Differential
includes infectious and inflammatory etiologies.  Particularly
given the more discrete right upper lobe nodule, followup within
three months is recommended to demonstrate resolution.
3.  Suggestion of right subclavian vein thrombus in this
non-tailored studies with chest wall and paraspinal collaterals.
4.  Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes. 5.  Extensive
atherosclerosis with aortic valve calcifications as well.
.
US abd ([**2184-11-19**]): There are layering gallstones without
cholecystitis.  The liver shows no focal or textural
abnormalities. The right kidney measures 10.4 cm.  The left
kidney measures 9.4 cm.  There are no stones or hydronephrosis.
The spleen and visualized portions of the pancreas are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Limited views of the kidneys.  No stones or hydronephrosis.
2.  Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
.
Abd portable ([**2184-11-20**]): Mildly dilated air-filled small and
large bowel loops.  Air is seen within the rectum; findings may
represent an evolving ileus.
.
CT head ([**11-20**]):
There is loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and mild
focal
effacement of the left MCA territory with preservation of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter and sulci within the ACA and PCA territory.
Also noted is a asymmetrically dense left MCA.  Together these
findings are consistent with left MCA occlusion and infarction.
There is a small amount of mass effect exerted on the left [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of the lateral ventricles, however, no shift of the midline.  No
additional areas of infarction are identified.  There is no
hydrocephalus. There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION:
Large left MCA territory stroke likely secondary to left MCA
thrombus.  Mild mass effect exerted on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the lateral ventricle, with no evidence of herniation.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and
treatment of her medical condition.  She appeared to be in acute
heart failure when arriving to the CCU thought [**2-6**] transfusion
of red blood cell products at the OSH and given the history of
SOB, fatigue and crescendo angina ov
