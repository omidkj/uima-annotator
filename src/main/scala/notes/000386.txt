ADDENDUM:

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to undergo a
left femoral artery to anterior tibial artery bypass
operation which he successfully underwent on [**2115-8-6**]. He
tolerated the procedure well. However, after the procedure
anesthesia elected to keep the patient intubated overnight in
order to protect his airway. He was a difficult intubation
during induction of anesthesia, and it was felt that to
protect his airway he should remain intubated until he could
be successfully weaned in the post anesthesia care unit. His
blood gas at this time was 7.39/36/438/23 on 100% FiO2. This
was weaned to 40%. The patient was successfully extubated the
following morning without incident. He was then transferred
to the VICU.

On postoperative day 1, the patient's vital signs remained
stable. The patient remained in the PACU until late on
postoperative day 1 when he was transferred to the VICU. He
was continued on his home diabetic regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]. He was
monitored q. hour with hourly Doppler checks, and the
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries were noted to be
biphasic on Doppler exam.

On postoperative day 2, the patient's vital signs remained
stable. His laboratories were also within normal limits, and
it was felt that he could be transferred to the regular
vascular floor.

The patient continued to recover well on postoperative days 3
and 4. He got out of bed with physical therapy and was able
to walk successfully. During this time there was some
question about the frequency of his anti-rejection
medications for his transplants, and the renal medical
transplant service was consulted. After drawing a Prograf
level which came back at 5.4, at the low end of normal, the
renal transplant service recommended decreasing his regimen
of Prograf to 4 mg twice daily and decreasing CellCept to 500
mg twice daily.

After the patient had successfully undergone a course of
physical therapy in which he was able to walk stairs and his
laboratory values remained stable, it was felt the patient
was ready for discharge home. He was discharged on [**2115-8-10**].
