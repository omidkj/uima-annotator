Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization x 2
BMS to SVG-OM

History of Present Illness:
PCP: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5936**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 52542**] OSH; Primary Cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5310**]
CC:[**CC Contact Info 52543**].
The patient is a 60 year old male transferred from [**Hospital1 3325**] with NSTEMI. His past medical history is significant
for CAD s/p MI at age 30 s/p CABG in [**2164**] at [**Hospital1 756**] (LIMA->LAD,
SVG->L-PDA, SVG->OM2) with Cypher to SVG->OM2 in [**2170**], DMII,CHF
(EF unknown) and HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on Friday
after 1 week of increasing chest pain in intensity and
frequency.

The patient states he had been chest pain free after his most
recent cardiac cath in [**11/2170**] until 6 months ago when he started
to notice SSCP with minimal exertion that would last 1-2 minutes
and resolve spontaneously 2x/month. Over the past few months,
his chest CP increased to 2-3 times a day and resolved with 2-3
sublingual nitroglycerins.

He informed his cardiologist at this time who recommended a
repeat catheterization months ago but the patient failed to do
so due to insurance reasons. He states, however, that he has
been compliant with all his medications, especially Plavix, and
his diet.

In addition, the patient notes increasing shortness of breath
with minimal exertion. At baseline, he can climb 12 steps in his
house without difficulty. Now, after 12 steps, has to sit down
secondary to shortness of breath. He can barely shop for
groceries secondary to angina and shortness of breath. Admits to
orthopnea over past 1 week, no [**Location (un) **], no PND.

On Sunday, the patient awoke from his sleep with 12/10
substernal chest pain that radiated to his midscapular region,
across his back (anginal equivalent to MI) and jaw associated
with SOB, nausea,diaphoresis. The patient took  2 SL nitros and
the pain resolved within 20 minutes. He did not call 911.

From Monday to Thursday, the patient noted increasing episodes
of CP while at rest and worsening SOB with minimal activity. He
saw his cardiologist on Tuesday who recommended elective cath on
Thursday. However, an elevated Cr was detected and the cath was
delayed.

Then, Thursday night, the chest pain worsened and he spoke to
his cardiologist on Friday who referred him to the ED. He drove
himself and a friend to the ER at [**Hospital3 3583**].

At [**Hospital3 3583**], his EKG showed :

Sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm,, NL axis and QT. LVH. Peaked T
waves V1-V3. 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions with TWI I,II,III,AVF,V4-V6.
1-2 mm STE in V1-V2.

His labs were significant for a K of 5.1, Cr 1.7, WBC of 9, Hct
34, CK 178, Troponin I 2.57.

His CXR at [**Hospital3 3583**] showed a RML pneumonia.

He was given ASA and started on a heparin drip and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, the patient was chest pain free. He was continued on
a Hep gtt, given a Plavix load of 600mg x1, Nitro gtt,
Metoprolol 5mg IVx1, Metoprolol 25mg PO x1. Cardiology evaluated
the patient and recommended adding integrillin.

His EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] showed:

NSR 94 bpm, NL axis, 1-2 mm STE V1-V2, deep S qaves V1-V3. [**Street Address(2) 52544**] depressions in V5-V6, I, AVL, III, III, and AVF with
TWI.

His troponin-T was 0.62, MBI 9.8, CK 153, MB 15. Cr 1.7, K 4.2.
Hct 32.

He was admitted for NSTEMI.

Last cardiac cath [**2170-12-4**]:

Left-dominant,LMCA patent,ostial LAD 80-90% stenosis, totally
occluded after S1.LCX with 70% lesion after OM1. Grafted OM2
occluded proximally.OM3 80% stenosis. LPDA occluded. RCA
occluded proximally with collaterals from LCX. Stump occlusion
of SVG->PDA.SVG->OM2 with 90% proximal stenosis, LIMA to LAD
patent. Markedly elevated LV filling pressures (LV 141/26 mmHg),
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (52/25 mmHg). Cypher
SVG-OM2.

No echo here.

ROS: Positive nonproductive cough with recent RUL pneumonia
treated with antibiotics that caused watery diarrhea - last
episode 4 days prior. No fevers/chills. No bloody stools.
Occasional palpitations with shortness of breath. + bilateral
calf pain with exertion - relieved at rest.

ECHO Study Date of [**2173-12-25**]
EF 20%.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right ventricle is not well
seen but there may be right ventricular chamber enlargement.
Right ventricular function is difficult to assess. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with slightly better contraction in the
inferior wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.
