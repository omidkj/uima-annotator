Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
89F with multiple medical problems who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2192-10-23**] d/t hypotension from E. coli urosepsis in setting of
poor PO intake, hypovolemia, and poor IV access/fluid
administration. Briefly, the patient is s/p recent 1 month
admission to [**Hospital3 **] for COPD exacerbation, complicated by
AIN [**12-28**] Cipro, and hypernatremia, discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab.
She was admitted to the MICU on [**10-23**] w/ urosepsis and
hypotension, and required dopamine and dobutamine for septic
shock with cardiogenic shock component and was given stress dose
steroids for adrenal insufficiency. She was initially treated
with Linezolid, meropenem, and gentamycin which was narrowed to
ceftriaxone once E.coli identified (completed 10 day course).
She was called out to floor on [**10-28**] and remained HD stable with
tapering of steroids (finished [**11-14**]). On [**11-6**] the patient was
hypothermic and blood cultures were drawn and demonstrated
Stenotrophomonas bacteremia; she was started on Bactrim which
was changed to ceftaz on [**11-13**] due to worsening renal failure
with plan for 14 day course.  2 days after finishing Ceftaz she
became hypothermic on the floor (temps to 91) and hypotensive.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**11-22**] - where she responded
to IVF/warming blanket.  She was started on stress dose
steroids.  Stat Abd CT only showed left pleural fluid collection
(although study inadequate due to lack of contrast).  Blood
cultures have remained negative since [**11-8**].  Urine has grown
yeast, she is s/p one dose of fluconazole for yeast in her urine
with continued yeast despite this dose. She had a renal US today
to evaluate for possible abscess and received a second dose of
fluconazole.
.
In regards to ARF, patient developed AIN at OSH d/t cipro and
was prerenal d/t septicemia. Her renal function improved daily
as HD's improved, with renal following. Developed exacerbation
while on bactrim, which was stopped. Cr drifted down to a low of
1.0, but she has been intermittently diuresed d/t whole body
anasarca, leading to worsening renal function again - lasix was
stopped on [**11-21**]. Additionally, there was concern for HIT as PF4
was positive but SRA negative so no longer on treatment with
argatroban for HIT. Also, patient has had significant whole body
edema d/t RV failure and hypoalbuminemia and she was
intermittently diuresed as above.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, night sweats, fevers, chills, weight loss,
night sweats, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision,
sore throat, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, any new rashes,
denies dysuria, hematuria, increased urgency, diarrhea,
constipation, hematochezia, melena, epistaxis.  All other
systems reviewed in detail and negative except for what has been
mentioned above.

.
[**10-23**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size in the cardiac
silhouette that may represent increasing heart size, or perhaps
a pericardial effusion.  There is no evidence of failure.
.
[**10-23**] Head CT: A hypodense focus in the right lentiform nucleus,
which could represent subacute infarction.  Please note
sensitivity of MR is much higher than the present CT in
detecting acute brain ischemia.
.
[**10-24**] Echo: Conclusions:  1. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 2. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity  size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).  3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular  systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid  regurgitation.]
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.  5.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  6.The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  7.Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.  8.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  9.There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared
with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2189-6-11**],  the RV is now mild to moderately dilated with severe
TR.
.
[**10-25**] Renal US: Evidence of some bilateral renal cortical
atrophy.  No signs of obstruction.  Small left effusion noted
.
[**10-29**] KUB: Moderate amount of air and stool throughout the colon.
 No
dilated bowel.
