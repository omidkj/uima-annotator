Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-11-17**] - Pericardiectomy
[**2132-11-14**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This 64-year-old gentleman has a significant past medical
history of esophageal carcinoma with resection, neoesophagus
reconstruction, radiation and chemotherapy approximately ten
years ago.  He was seen in cardiology follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] on [**2132-10-15**] for continued complaints of
dyspnea on exertion.  He reported dyspnea after walking one
block
or climbing one flight of stairs.  The patient previously
underwent noninvasive evaluation including a nuclear stress test
on [**2132-7-8**] where he achieved 83% of his age predicted maximum
heart rate, developing dyspnea, with nuclear images
demonstrating
no abnormal myocardial perfusion defects.  He was not noted to
have ischemic EKG changes either but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] felt that
due to the low-level work load the test was inconclusive.   He
also underwent an echocardiogram on [**2132-10-1**] which
graded his MR as mild-to-moderate which was again felt to be
suboptimal due to the presence of neoesophagus which is
reportedly not in close proximity to the left atrium as is the
norm.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] reports a moderate degree of improvement in
this
gentleman's symptoms after initiation of an ACE inhibitor and
diuretic.  He has thus referred Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] for a right and left
heart catheterization along with ergometry to assess his level
of
mitral regurgitation, any ischemic component of the symptoms and
also to rule out any cardiomyopathy that may have been caused by
his history of chest radiation.


Past Medical History:
Esophageal cancer, s/p resection, neoesophagus, radiation, and
chemotherapy
Hypertension
H/O pneumonia last [**Month (only) 116**]

Social History:
He is married with two grown children.  He does
not smoke and drinks [**1-9**] glasses of wine 3-4 times per week.  He
works as an insurance [**Doctor Last Name 360**].


Family History:
His father had heart disease and a MI at age 59.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-11-19**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-6-4**],
there is no longer a trivial/small pericardial effusion seen.

[**2132-11-14**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed LMCA and two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had a ?
eccentric 40% ulcerated plaquing with slight contrast staining.
The LAD
had a 50% stenosis just after a large D1; there was a 50% mid
LAD
stenosis after a smaller D2; there was a 60% distal LAD
stenosis; there
was slightly slow flow consistent with microvascular
dysfunction. The
LCx had mild diffuse plaquing, and supplied a tortuous LPL; the
distal
AV groove LCx was occluded after LPL and filled slightly by
antergrade
vasa and right-to-left collaterals; there was a proximal LPL 40%

stenosis; there was slightly slow flow consistent with
microvascular
dysfunction. The RCA had mild diffuse plaquing throughout; there
was a
fistulous connection into the RV; there was diffuse plaquing in
the RCA;
there was diffuse plaquing in the RPL; there was slow flow
consistent
with microvascular dysfunction.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left sided
and
severely elevated right sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 22
mmHg,
mean PCW of 27 mmHg, and RVEDP of 24 mmHg. There was mild
pulmonary
arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 39 mmHg. The cardiac
index
was preserved at 2.0 L/min/m2. Prominent but not giant V waves
weP
and PASP, as well as lack of respiratory variation in early
LVEDP and
PCW argued against constrictive physiology. There was normal
systemic
arterial pressure with SBP of 125 mmHg and DBP of 77 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. After upsize for 9 French RFV sheath, ICE was performed by Dr

[**Doctor Last Name 13177**] and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 22628**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**]. Imaging was suggestive of
moderate-severe
eccentric mitral regurgitation arising from the posterior
leaflet
without evidence of flow reversal into the pulmonary veins.

[**2132-11-17**] ECHO
This is an intraoperative epicardial study. TEE not performed
secondary to history of esophageal surgery. Views are very
limited. Only the basal portions of the ventricles can be
visualized. The sections of the left and right ventricles that
are seen dispaly low normal systolic function. Due to the
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function cannot be reliably assessed. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild tricuspid
regurgitation and, likely, mild to moderate pulmonic
insufficiency. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] helped perform the study and,
therefore, was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-11-14**] for further
work-up of his dyspnea and suboptimal stress test. He underwent
a cardiac catheterization which revealed moderate mitral
regurgitation and two vessel coronary artery disease. The
cardiac surgical service was consulted and Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2132-11-17**], he was
taken to the operating room where he underwent a pericardectomy
only as he had severe constrictive pericarditis related to his
esophageal radiation. Only mild mitral regurgitation was noted
postoperatively. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was then transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. Plavix was started for his mild coronary
artery disease. He was fluid restricted for hyponatremia. He
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day four. He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6955**] as an outpatient. As his blood
pressure was still somewaht low postoperatively, his ace
inhibitor (Lisinopril) was resumed. This will be deferred to his
cardiologist as an outpatient.
