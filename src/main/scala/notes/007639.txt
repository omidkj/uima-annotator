                            **FINAL REPORT [**2174-4-1**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2174-4-1**]):
      Culture workup discontinued. Further incubation showed
contamination
      with mixed skin/genital flora. Clinical significance of
isolate(s)
      uncertain. Interpret with caution.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    >100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions,
regardless of
         resistance Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be
reported as
         also RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
