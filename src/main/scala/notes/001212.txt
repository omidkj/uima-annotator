Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]/CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease with two-vessel
disease on [**7-3**] who had a catheterization that showed total
occlusion of the right coronary artery and 50% left anterior
descending without percutaneous intervention, history of
hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes, who presented with
the acute onset of progressively worsening substernal chest
pain radiating to her right arm, throat, teeth and back.

She also complained of abdominal pain that followed the chest
pain.  She denied nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis.  She
reported that the pain was 8 out of 10 and was associated
with shortness of breath and radiation as above similar to
the episode in [**2112-7-2**] prior to her catheterization.

She has had no recent changes in her exercise tolerance.  She
denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She did report
orthopnea, and she did report increasing lower extremity
edema.

In the Emergency Room was started on a Nitroglycerin drip,
Lopressor, 2 mg Morphine x 2 with resulting decrease in her blood
pressure and resolution of her chest pain.

CK 181.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute,
3-[**Street Address(2) 109324**] depressions in V3-V5, leads I, II and
AVL, normal axis.

CT of the chest showed diffuse aortic atheromatous disease,
no PE, no abdominal aortic aneurysm, no dissection.

Dense left anterior descending, right coronary artery
calcifications, mural thrombus in the aortic arch, question
of small intimal flap, no PE.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Medicine Service initially.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had improved, diffuse
downsloping ST depressions after heart rate and blood pressure
went down with elimination of chest pain.  This was concerning
for coronary ischemia, especially in a patient with known two-
vessel disease on catheterization in [**2112-7-2**], who was
hypertensive and diabetic with positive cardiac biomarkers.

She was treated with Aspirin, Lipitor, Heparin drip,
Nitroglycerin and Integrilin with a plan for early cardiac
catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention.  She was
placed on telemetry for.

However, given the concern for a possible intimal flap on the
aorta, MRI was planned to clarify the issue of early
dissection flap in the aorta; however, the study could not be
completed, and the patient was sent back to the floor where she
had some episodes of nausea, tiredness and frustration after
awaiting all day for this test.  She described some back pain,
and Morphine was prescribed.

The Cardiology fellow spoke with the patient, and the patient
clearly said that she did not want to go back for completion of
her MRI and that she was consistent and understood the
consequences including myocardial infarction or death.  She
was very adamant about this, and it was decided to respect her
wishes, since she seemed to be mentating normally at the time and
understood the consequences of her decision.

The plan was to do an early morning MRI to definitively rule
out dissection flap which would then allowing cardiac
catheterization and full adjunctive anticoagulation if
necessary.

The medical intern at the time had again spoken with the patient
regarding the risks of refusing MRI, and the patient was
aware of the possibility of aortic dissection and the risk of
hemorrhage and death.  She had capacity for decision
making at the time.  Plan was for MRI in the morning.

At around midnight that night, the patient suffered an
asystolic, PEA, ventricular fibrillatory arrest which required
intubation and chest compressions.  The patient was
noted to be posturing at the time.  She was resuscitated using
ACLS protocol and sent to the CCU Cardiology fellow spoke with
the sister regarding this situation, and the patient was
transferred to the CCU Service. Her care was transferred at this
point to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and the CCU team.

In the CCU, the patient was ventilated and hemodynamically
monitored. During the day, the patient was transfused with packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.5, both for better
oxygenation carrying capacity, as well as precatheterization.

2.  Cardiovascular:  We continued Aspirin and increased her
beta-blocker, titrated to a goal heart rate of 60s.  We
continued Aspirin and statin and oxygen.  Her blood pressure
medication was changed to Hydralazine from ACE inhibitor
since she was not tolerating any p.o., and we continued to
follow her peak CKs.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable during her hospital
course in the CCU with no evidence of recurrent hemodynamically
significant arrhythmia. No difference in blood pressures was
noted in both arms.  Because of continued hemodynamic stability
without clinical evidence of propagating aortic dissection,
investigation of possible aortic dissection was not undertaken
until her neurologic prognosis was determined.

3.  Myocardial:  Her ejection fraction was 20-30%, and she
was given appropriate afterload reduction.

4.  Conduction:  She had a history of asystole, question of
ventricular fibrillation. There appeared to be a stable
rhythm.  She continued to be monitored on telemetry.

5.  Respiratory:  The patient was placed on AC ventilation. The
plan was to decrease her FIO2 and hope for improvement of her
ventilation; however, it was noted that in reducing support, she
had no spontaneous respirations on the ventilator.

6.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine increased moderately
after her arrest.  Urinalysis exam showed muddy brown casts and
consistent with acute tubular necrosis due to transient ischemia
after the arrest. We followed her urine output and minimized
nephrotoxic agents and repleted her potassium.  The creatinine
stabilized at 2.4 which was consistent with previous baseline
values.

7.  Infectious disease:  The patient had a urinary tract
infection, and she was treated with Levofloxacin.  Urine
cultures were pending at the time.

8.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had elevations in her liver
function transaminases and had initial bilious emesis, although
not consistent with cholestatic picture. The patient ha
