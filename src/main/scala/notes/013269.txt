CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman s/p AVR/ replacement asc. aorta-
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
HISTORY: Effusion.

Single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates
cardiomegaly. There has been interval removal of the right
internal jugular central venous catheter. The left costophrenic
angle was excluded from the imaged field of view. There are
probable small, bilateral, persistent pleural effusions.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists. The patient is again seen to be
status post median sternotomy. The trachea is midline.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
akinetic; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral -
akinetic; anterior
apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - akinetic;
lateral apex -
akinetic; apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated [**Last Name (Prefixes) 8813**] root. Focal calcifications in
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 8813**] root.
Moderately dilated [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] aorta. Focal calcifications in
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] VALVE: Three [**Last Name (Prefixes) 8813**] valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed [**Last Name (Prefixes) 8813**]
valve leaflets. Severe AS. Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of mid and distal inferior, lateral, and
posterior walls.
Right ventricular free wall motion is low normal. The [**Month/Day (2) 8813**]
root is mildly
dilated. The [**Month/Day (2) **] aorta is moderately dilated. There are
simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three [**Month/Day (2) 8813**] valve
leaflets. The
[**Month/Day (2) 8813**] valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe [**Month/Day (2) 8813**]
valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) [**Month/Day (2) 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
There is mild TR.

Post-CPB The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. There
is mild
global LV systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of mid to
distal
inferior, lateral, and posterior walls. LV EF= 35-40%. Normal RV
systolic
function. A bioprosthesis is located in the [**Month/Day (2) 8813**] position. It
is well seated
and displays normal leaflet function. There is no visible AI.
There is no
AS.([**Location (un) 109**]=1.7 cm2). There is mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8813**] graft is in
situ. No new  [**Last Name (Titles) 8813**] pathology is seen.

HISTORY: 67-year-old woman with right groin pain and swelling.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common
