Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization - [**9-22**]


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 4115**] [**Known lastname 3510**] is a 84 year old female with a history of
dementia and hypertension who is transfered from an OSH for
further management of NSTEMI. She initially presented to the OSH
with shortness of breath in extremis. She vomited on arrival.
Vital signs were HR 140, BP 155/87, R 30, O2 sat 77% RA. She had
received lasix 40 mg IV enroute by EMS. At the OSH she received
Bipap, nitro gtt, and another dose of lasix 40 mg IV and her
symptoms resolved. Labs returned with Troponin-I 4.10 and WBC
21.9K. EKG showed small ST elevations in III and V1 with larger
ST depressions in V2-V6. Per report patient denied chest pain.
Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial vital signs were pain 0, T 97.6, HR 96,
BP 116/69, RR 20, O2 sat 99% 2L. CXR showed vascular congestion.
EKG showed 1mm ST depressions V4-V6. Cardiology was consulted
and recommended heparin gtt and aspirin without plavix. She
received aspirin 325 mg and was started on a heparin gtt. She
also received ceftriaxone 1 g IV and azithromycin 500 mg PO for
possible pneumonia.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was comfortable, pain free,
and denied any shortness of breath. She did not remember being
short of breath the day before.
.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Dementia
Patient denies prior cardiac history, but states she has a poor
memory.

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital3 **]. Is able to walk without assistance. No
tobacco use. Occasional glass of wine.

Family History:
Patient unable to remember.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VS: T 97.6, BP 115/67, HR 91, RR 18, O2 sat 94% RA, wt 64.2 kg
Gen: Pleasant, elderly Caucasian female in NAD
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, OP clear, MM moist
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy
CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, [**3-5**] early systolic murmur at the LLSB

Pulm: Bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, good air movement
Abd: + BS, soft, nontender, nondistended
Ext: Trace edema in left ankle, feet are warm, pulses not
apprecaited.
Neuro: Oriented to person only. Did recognize she was in a
hospital, thought it was winter. CNII-XII intact. Strength 4+/5
throughout.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**9-21**]): 1. Bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
2. Right base opacity, which could be further evaluated with
oblique
radiographs or PA/lateral after appropriate interval treatment.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
[**Month/Year (2) **] ([**9-21**]): The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral akinesis. The inferior septum is hypokinetic.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely even
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with inferior/inferolateral ischemia/infarction. There is
moderate to severe mitral regurgigation likely mediated by
posterior leaflet tethering. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**9-22**]): 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrates
occlusion of the right coronary artery. The distal right
territory is perfused by collaterals from the left anterior
descending
artery. There is disease in the left anterior descendign with
multiple
<50% lesions in the proximal  and mid portions of hte vessel.
The
circumflex artery is without angiographically apparent flow
limiting
disease. The first obtuse marginal artery is a small vessel that
is
subtotally occluded.
2. Limited hemodynamics measurements demonstrated normal
systemic blood
pressures and a markedly elevated left venticular filling
pressure of 33
mmHg.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to cross and open a totally occluded mid
RCA
complicated by distal dissection and intramyocaridal
extraluminal
contrast.
4. Atrial fibrillation developed with placement of the guide.
5. [**Month/Year (2) **] showed no pericardial effusion.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to open totally occluded RCA complicated
by
dissection and intramyocardial contrast.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with 6F
angioseal.
