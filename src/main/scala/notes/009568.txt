HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 64 year-old white male was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  He was admitted there on [**2121-5-27**] after
presenting to the Emergency Department with complaints of
seven days of weakness, fatigue and shortness of breath.  He
had undergoing a low anterior colon resection on [**3-27**] for
rectosigmoid carcinoma and his postop course from that was
apparently uneventful.  On [**4-26**] he received 2 units of packed
cells when he was found to be anemic with a hematocrit of 27.
In the Emergency Department he was significantly dehydrated
with acute renal failure with a BUN of 56 and a creatinine of
3.1.  Intravenous fluids resuscitation precipitated pulmonary
edema requiring emergency intubation.  He was given Lasix
with no response.  His white blood cell count in the
Emergency Room was [**Numeric Identifier 15362**].  He was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for sepsis and respiratory failure and required
large amounts of fluid.  He had a significant murmur and
there was evidence of anterolateral ST depression on the
electrocardiogram.  His troponin was 10.9.  He was started on
Unasyn and Levaquin and was then diuresed.  A Swan was placed
and revealed a cardiac index of 1.9 and he was placed on
Dopamine and his cardiac index increased to 2.9.  An
echocardiogram revealed mitral valve vegetation, mitral valve
prolapse with a large mobile anterior leaflet vegetation,
which flopped into the antrum and moderate mitral
regurgitation.  An abdominal CT was performed, which revealed
no evidence of significant intraabdominal fluid collection or
other anatomical abnormalities.  He was started on tube
feeds.  Gentamycin was added. He had blood cultures, which
were positive for strep Viridans and was sensitive to
Penicillin and Ceftriaxone.  His creatinine did continue to
improve with a creatinine of 2.1 on hospital day number five.
He remained in pulmonary edema, remained intubated and he was
transferred for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post lower
anterior resection for large invasive rectosigmoid carcinoma
in [**3-27**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital, status post inguinal hernia
repair 20 years prior to admission.  History of
diverticulitis.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Nexium q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Unasyn 3 grams intravenous q 8 hours.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg intravenous q day.
3.  Epogen 10,000 units subq q week.
4.  ________ albumin with Lasix q 12 hours.
5.  Heparin 5000 units subq b.i.d.
6.  Morphine prn.
7.  Ativan prn.
8.  Dopamine drip at 2 mg per kilograms per minute.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke cigarettes and drank in
the past, but has not had a drink in one month.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a thin white male intubated.
Vital signs were stable. His temperature was 98.8.  His HEENT
examination normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck was supple.  Full range of
motion.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids 2+ and
equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs have rhonchi on the
left.  His cardiovascular examination is regular rate and
rhythm with a [**2-27**] holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen was slightly
distended and nontender with a well healed surgical scar.
Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was transferred to the CSRU.  He was
seen by dental who had a limited examination due to the ET
tube, but saw no evidence of dental infection.  He was seen
by cardiology.  ID also saw him and they recommended
discontinued Levofloxacin and continuing the Unasyn.  He
remained in the unit and transesophageal echocardiogram
revealed severe mitral regurgitation with partial flail
leaflets and a 1.8 by 1.1 cm vegetation.  He had a balloon
placed and that remained in and on [**6-6**] he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times four with left internal
mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, reverse saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery, obtuse marginal and diagonal and a mitral
valve replacement with a #29 Mosaic porcine valve.  The cross
clamp time was 146 minutes, total bypass time 164 minutes.
He was transferred to the CSRU on Propofol in stable
condition.  He remained intubated and was on neo and Propofol
on postop day one. He was switched at that point to
Ampicillin 2 grams intravenous q 6 hours and that was
recommended to have a four week course.  His balloon was
removed on postoperative day number one and he remained on a
pressure support wean.  He was extubated on postoperative day
three.  He did have a hoarse voice and difficulty swallowing.
He was fed with tube feeds.  He had a bedside swallowing
evaluation, which they felt he was aspirating, so he was kept
NPO and on tube feeds.  He continued to progress very well,
although he was markedly fatigue and weak.  He did go into
atrial fibrillation on postop day five.  He converted with
Amiodarone and Lopressor.  He did continue to have frequent
bursts of atrial fibrillation that would be very short and he
eventually was anticoagulated.  He was seen by EP who
recommended the Amiodarone and they wanted upon discharge for
him to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor while he was having his
Amiodarone load for two weeks following discharge.

Eventually he was transferred to the floor on postoperative
day number six and he continued to slowly improve.  He did
have another swallowing evaluation and they felt he could
have nectar thick liquids and regular food, which he was slow
to eat at first due to loss of appetite, but has been
improving with that.  He also requires Boost pudding and
thick shakes.  He was on heparin and Coumadin, slowly
anticoagulated.  His pacing wires were discontinued.  He
continued to improve and on postop day number twelve was
transferred to rehab in stable condition.
