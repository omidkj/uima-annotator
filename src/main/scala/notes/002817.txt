CXR [**2194-7-28**]
There is mild postoperative widening of the superior
mediastinum. Heart size is normal. A pleural tube overlies
region of previous nodule in the left lower lung. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. ET tube, right jugular
introducer, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. The
tip of the endotracheal tube is probably less than 2 cm from
either the carina or the underside of the clavicles, with the
chin extended. Withdrawal of the tube by approximately 15 mm
would put it in optimal placement.

CXR [**2194-8-6**]
Nasogastric tube should be advanced at least 6 cm to move all
the side ports into the stomach. ET tube is in standard
placement. Moderate enlargement of the postoperative cardiac
silhouette is stable and unremarkable. There is no pleural
abnormality. Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**8-4**]. No
pleural abnormality.

ECHO [**2194-7-31**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
3. There is no pericardial effusion.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2194-7-10**],
there has been no significant change.

[**2194-7-28**] EKG
Normal sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] was electively admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-7-28**]
for surgical management of her coronary artery disease. She was
taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. The pulmonology service
was consulted for hypoxia. An echo was obtained which ruled out
tamponade. Subcutaneous heparin was started for pulmonary
embolism prophylaxis. As no ventilatory problems were
identified, other findings were consistent with pulmonary edema
and diuresis was optimized. She continued to be hypoxic and
BIPAP was started. She was transfused with red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. On postoperative day three, Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**]
was reintubated for respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy was
performed which showed normal airways and a bronchoalveolar
lavage was sent for culture. Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
given her fevers and she was pan cultured. A blood cultured
revealed coagulase negative staph in one bottle and she
clinically improved on antibiotics. Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**] slowly weaned
from the ventilator and was again extubated on postoperative day
ten. Diuresis was continued. On postoperative day eleven, Ms.
[**Known lastname 32857**] was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. Her
drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol. Ms. [**Known lastname 32857**]
made slow but steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day fourteen. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an
outpatient.
