Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, dry cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Right Internal Jugular Catheter

History of Present Illness:
89yo M PMHx CHF (EF13%), CAD s/p MI, lacunar infarcts presents
with 1 week of malaise and a nonproductive cough.  Over the last
week, pt has felt R arm tingling but no focal weakness.  He has
had a dry cough that is worse at night.  Patient has
progressively become weaker, had difficulty walking/getting up
from a seated position, and experiencing lightheadedness.  On
day of admission, patient fell while putting on pants and could
not get off of floor for 20 minutes at which time his wife call
EMS.  Denied any CP, SOB, fevers, chills, abdominal
pain/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Pt has been eating/drinking well.
.
On presentation to the ED initial vital signs were 98.4 85 90/43
16 96%RA. Exam was unremarkable. Labs were remarkable for WBC
12.7, Hct 36.0, Cr 2.2 (baseline 1.7).  CXR demonstrated
possible multifocal PNA vs congestion. NCHCT was without acute
intracranial process.  Patient was started on levofloxacin,
vanc, flagyl.  During ED course, SBP trended down to 80s and was
not response to 2L NS bolus.  Patient had RIJ placed and was
started on levophed; he was admitted to MICU for further
management and evaluation.
.
On the floor, patient was comfortable, concerned about the
tingling in his R hand but otherwise felt well.  Patient did not
complain of SOB, but did demonstrate a dry cough.  On review of
systems patient only complains of bilateral knee pain from
arthritis.  Patient says his wife is diligent in giving him low
sodium diet.

EXAM: Chest single AP upright portable view.
Scattered patchy ground-glass opacities are seen concerning for
multifocal
infection with possible underlying mild edema. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable with the cardiac silhouette top normal to mildly enlarged
and the aorta calcified and tortuous.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-7-24**] 1:29 PM
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
major vascular territorial infarction. There is no shift of
normally midline structures. Ventricles and sulci are prominent,
particularly the frontal extra-axial spaces, compatible with
age-appropriate atrophy. There are extensive multiple rounded
hypodensities in the white matter surrounding the basal ganglia
bilaterally compatible with old lacunar infarcts. There is no
fracture. Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2104-7-25**]):
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST CT W/O CONTRAST ([**2104-7-26**]):1. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Multifocal consolidation consistent with multifocal
pneumonia, amiodarone toxicity is considered less likely.
3. Aortic arch, descending aorta and coronary artery
calcification.
4. Calcified pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos
exposure.
5. Slightly increased attenuation in the liver may be due to
amiodarone
deposition.

REPEAT CXR ([**2104-7-28**]): Improvement of pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 M with CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p MI, p/w hypotension, malaise,
and dry cough, treated for CAP with 10 day course of
levofloxacin.

Shock of Unknown Etiology - Patient presented to the ED for 1
week of malaise & non-productive cough which is worse at night.
In the ED, patient became hypotensive with systolic BP in the
80s that was refractory to 2L fluids, so patient was transferred
to the MICU. Put on levophed drip in ED, but
