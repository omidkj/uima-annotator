History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 yo M with h/o HTN who initially presented to an OSH
2 days ago complaining of fevers, SOB and now is being
transferred in the setting of respiratory failure. History is
obtained from OSH records and pt's family. Per OSH d/c summary,
pt was being conservatively treated for URI sxs 5 days prior to
presentation to OSH with ? unknown abx, cefclor, promethazine,
and codeine but did not feel better and thus was admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**7-6**]. At the time, he was reportedly
complaining of subjective fevers, chills, rigros, sore throat,
shortness of breath, and cough without hemoptysis. No diarrhea,
abd pain, n/v, myalgias.
.
On presentation to OSH, febrile to 104.3, O2 sat 91% on RA -->
96% 4L NC, RR 18. WBC 4.7 with 86.3% neutrophils, plts 106K, Na
128, Cr 1.2, HCO3 29. CXR revealed multi-focal PNA (L>R). Flu
swab negative. Sputum cx, urine legionella, HIV still pending.
He was placed on respiratory isolation for r/o TB for unclear
reasons other than his history of being from [**Country 3587**]. He was
treated with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and
bactrim (added on [**7-8**]). However, on am of transfer, pt noted to
desat from 97% on 2-3L NC to 77%, requiring NRB. Pt also noted
to be tachypneic with RR in 30s, febrile to 101-102 in spite of
tylenol. ABG 7.44/35/71/24 on NRB. CXR revealed nearly complete
white out of left lung.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt is intubated and not responsive
to sternal rub.

echo-
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
55 M w HTN, who originally presented to OSH w fever/SOB, and was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in hypoxic respiratory failure
in the setting of multi-focal PNA.
.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt required intubation
before transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He had prolonged fevers without
identifable cause. Required high PEEP requirement while on
Vanc/Zosyn/Levo. He had a multifocal PNA on CXR and required
proning to increase oxygenation. He had a low CD4 count despite
negative HIV test at [**Hospital1 **] and OSH. There was concern also for PCP
and he was also treated with steriods and bactrim. Bactrim was
later stopped and then later restarted. Steriods were stopped
and then restarted and later tapered. Differential included CAP
vs interstitial inflammatory process (acute interstial pna,
acute eosionphilic pna) vs vasculitis. Vasculitis less likely
with no hemorrhage on bronch on [**7-22**], and negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA,
and anti-GBM. Infectious work-up showed: HIV 1 and 2 negative,
PCP negative, [**Name9 (PRE) 20890**] and glucactomanna negative, Legionella
antigen negative, viral culture negative, blood cultures
negative, toxo negative, CMV negative, ehrlichia negative,
mycoplasma negative. Urine culture yeast only. Neg Hep C/B. Met
Hb normal. Had a dose of caspo on [**7-16**], was discontinued
following discussion with ID. Echinococcus, LCM, hanta virus,
and Entamoeba negative. Due to high levels of PEEP initally BAL
and bronch were not able to be completed until [**7-22**]. Cx from BAL
grew a small amount of yeast and was negative for PCP and virus;
AFB was negative as well. ID closely followed the pati
