History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**],
severe aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite
recent aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent
hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), and
ESRD recently restarted on HD who returns w/SOB. She was
admitted on [**2174-7-22**] for CHF exacerbation and discharged
yesterday. She was initally treated with Lasix, went into
worsening renal failure, and started on hemodialysis. Her course
was also complicated by upper GI bleed, of which an EGD showed
multiple AVMs. She required total of 5 units of PRBCs and by
discharge, HCT was stable at 26. She received her last
transfusion yesterday at HD.
Pt was discharged to rehab. She ate well for dinner under 2 gm
of sodium diet. She report feeling warm the evening prior to
admission but was afebrile. She still felt warm and diaphoretic
this morning. Again, she was afebrile per her husband. She did
have increased productive cough with mostly clear, occasionally
blood-tinged phlegm. She then became acutely short of breath
while lying down. She denied any CP, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting. She asked to return to the hospital.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were: T98, BP 150/80, HR 130, RR 42,
O2 sat 92% on ?RA. BiPap was started and her BP fell to 72/38,
and Bipap was switched to NRB. She was started on neo gtt and BP
came up to 130s/60s. BiPap was restarted with O2 sat of 100%. A
CVL was placed int he R groin. She also received ceftazidime and
vanc. She was transferred on NRB off neo.
.
On review of symptoms, her husband denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery. She continues to complain of
leg pain for which she was taking neurotin and vicodin.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. She does have dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea at baseline. She has never had ankle edema
in the past.

CXR ([**2174-8-9**]):  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
left-sided pleural effusion has slightly decreased in extent. At
the right, there is no secure evidence of pleural effusion on
today's examination. Unchanged is the cardiac silhouette.
Vascular signs of overhydration are not present on today's
examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**], severe
aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite recent
aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent hospitalizations for
CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), upper GI bleed from AVMs,
and ESRD recently restarted on HD who returned w/SOB, dialyzed,
and discharged back to extended care facility.
.
# CHF Exacerbation:  Patient initially presented with volume
overload on CXR and acute shortness of breath, was placed on
facemask, then later weaned to nasal cannula.  The patient was
emergently dialyzed, and subsequently her shortness of breath
resolved.  The patient was continued on low O2 nasal cannula,
followed via serial CXR's, and was given her outpatient dose of
carvedilol.
.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other
coronaries w/o obstructive disease. Patient had CP the night
before admission and ECG showed J Point elevation.  Patient was
given O2 and cardiac enzymes were sent.  Patient was chest pain
free subsequently, EKG's were done which showed some minor
elevations, but none concerning enough in lieu of her existing
LBBB.  Patient was continued on her beta blocker, CE's were
followed and remained within the range of 0.11 which is her
chronic level and not concerning given the lack of an acute
rise, and her existing chronic kidney disease.  Plavix and ASA
were held given her recent upper GI bleed.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:  Worsened after valvuloplasty in [**4-21**]. Last
TTE [**7-27**] w/aortic valvular area of 0.5 cm2.  No realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.
.
# Anxiety:  Patient has had considerable anxiety on this
admission and during her stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  The patient was
amenable to and was given a prescription for citalopram.
.
# ID:  Pt presented with leukocytosis, though it later resolved
along with the rest of her CBC values, suggesting an inaccurate
measurement.  Pt had been afebrile and most recent WBC has
decreased to WNL.  U/A was positive but contaminated and pt had
long history of positive U/As with negative UCx, recently
completed 5 day course of cipro.  Pt recently ended course of
Vancomycin for strep veridins bacteremia. Blood and Urine
cultures were negative throughout admission, TTE negative for
any endocarditis.
.
# Upper GI Bleed: Hct suspiciously high.  No sig. bleeding.
Continued protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Acute on chronic RF on Dialysis: Pt was given emergent
dialysis the
