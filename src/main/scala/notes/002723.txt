Chief Complaint:
Soreness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right sided CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old female with hepatitis and stage III
chronic kidney disease who presented with one day of soreness,
weakness, and nausea/vomiting as well as worsening of her
chronic diarrhea.  She has had an increased frequency of her
bowel movements and loose stools for months per her report, but
this had been dramatically worse over the week preceding
admission.   This was non-bloody, liquid diarrhea with greater
than 10 bowel movements per day and one episode of fecal
incontinence.  This was associated with generalized and
intermittent mild cramping abdominal pain.  She denied fevers
though she did feel subjectively chilled.  On the evening prior
to admission she developed some nausea in association with her
diarrhea and vomited one or two times.  This emesis was
non-bloody.  She also developed weakness and diffuse myalgias
with soreness in multiple areas particularly her back,
shoulders, and legs.  She had some mild, non-productive cough
but denied shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**] or other respiratory symptoms. Of
note, the patient was recently discharged from the surgery
service on [**2184-6-7**] after a five day admission for SBO that
responded to conservative management.

In the ED initial vital signs were T 97.0, P 64, BP 132/74, RR
16, O2 Sat 100% on RA.  Labs revealed a leukocytosis, acute
kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis with ABG of 7.18/38/65.
CXR and CT abdomen were unremarkable.  She received vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and metronidazole for empiric treatment of colitis
and ? pneumonia.  She was also started on IV fluids with
bicarbonate and admitted to the ICU secondary to her acidosis.

Review of Systems: Positive per HPI.  Otherwise negative
particularly for headache, facial pain, rhinnorhea, congestion,
cough, shortness of [**Date Range 1440**], chest pain, palpitations, dysuria,
or hematuria.  No weight loss or night sweats.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year old female with hepatitis C, chronic diarrhea
and history of polysubstance abuse presenting with metabolic
acidosis, diarrhea and renal failure.

1) Metabolic acidosis: The patient presented with a non-gap
metabolic acidosis and low bicarbonate consistent with chronic
GI losses.  On evaluation of previous labs she had a chronically
low bicarbonate, which may be due to the chronic diarrhea she
reported has been an issue for months.  With fluids with
bicarbonate she normalized and actually exceeded the normal
range.  Generally, focus of work up for low bicarbonate was on
trying to find the etiology of her chronic diarrhea (see below)
though she was also worked up for adrenal insufficiency.
Cortisol stim test was within normal limits virtually ruling out
adrenal insufficiency and thus her chronic diarrhea was
considered the most likely cause of her chronic acidosis.

2) Diarrhea: The patient reported diarrhea being worse in the
week or so prior to presentation but overall she was reporting
months of increased stool frequency.  Of course, given multiple
recent hospitalizations the first concern was that this could be
secondary to C difficile colitis but this was not found on toxin
assay.  Other concerns remained for other infectious etiologies
of chronic diarrhea like cryptosporidium, giardia, or more
rarely cyclospora or microsporidia but these assays were all
negative and the patient had no clear risk factors (despite
history of IVDU, HIV had recently been tested and negative).
Other etiologies considered were non-infectious inflammatory
conditions like IBD or celiac sprue.  ESR was elevated but the
patient had no other signs of inflammatory bowel disease and her
CT showed no inflammatory segments.  TTG-IgA was within normal
limits thus making Celiac Sprue unlikely.  GI consult was
obtained and assisted with this work up and eventually took the
patient for colonoscopy and upper endoscopy.  These were grossly
normal and biopsies were pending at the time of discharge.
Regarding management of her diarrhea she had a fecal management
system placed in the ICU that was removed on the day prior to
discharge.  She was given choleystyramine and loperamide with
some improvement in her diarrhea.  Ultimately the etiology of
the patient's diarrhea remained unknown at the time of
disch
