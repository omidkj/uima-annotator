[**2105-9-11**] KUB showed:
1. Dilated small bowel loops containing residual oral contrast
and air-fluid levels, which in the right clinical circumstances
could be reflective of small-bowel obstruction.
2. Residual contrast filling the right collecting system
suggestive of
partial or full obstruction of the renal right collecting
system.
3. Nasogastric tube looped above the diaphragm, likely in the
patient's
hiatal hernia.

[**2105-9-13**] KUB showed:
In comparison with the study of [**9-11**], the contrast material from
the right renal collecting system has cleared. There is still
mild dilatation of small bowel loops containing some residual
oral contrast from a previous CT scan and demonstrating
air-fluid levels on the decubitus view. In the
appropriate clinical setting, these findings could be consistent
with small bowel obstruction.

[**2105-9-16**] KUB showed:
There are several air-filled minimally dilated loops of small
bowel seen particularly in the right abdomen. It appears that
the contrast seen in the small bowel on the prior studies has
advanced to the colon. There are several air-fluid levels seen
within the small bowel on the upright image.  This has the
appearance of persistent small bowel obstruction. The
nasogastric tube has been removed.

[**2105-9-24**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed:
1. New ground glass opacities and small foci of consolidation,
most severe in the right upper lobe, is concerning for evolving
aspiration pneumonia given large hiatal hernia and recent
history of emesis. Differential diagnosis does includes
asymmetric pulmonary edema if the patient has underlying mitral
valvular disease.
2. Mild anasarca and mild fluid overload with minimal
interlobular smooth
septal thickening.
3. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum consistent with recent
exploratory
laparotomy.
4. Small bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis. Mild
cardiomegaly.

[**2105-9-27**] CXR showed:
Consolidation in the right lung has spread from the juxtahilar
right upper lobe to much of the right lower lung, accompanied by
increasing moderate right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe
atelectasis persists. Pleural surfaces are heavily calcified.
Heart size is enlarged but difficult to assess because of
adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC.

[**2105-10-1**] KUB showed:
1. Residual oral contrast is seen within the colon to the rectum
without evidence of distention. This reflects a prolonged
transit time, but no evidence of obstruction.
2. Air-filled loops of small bowel without evidence of
obstruction, improved compared to the prior.
3. No other significant change compared to the prior study.

[**2105-10-5**] Video swallow showed:
Frank aspiration with appropriate cough response with nectar
consistency.

[**2105-10-9**] CTA chest showed:
1. Acute pulmonary embolism involving a right upper lobe apical
segmental branch.
2. New left upper lobe airspace consolidation and worsening
right upper lobe airspace consolidation that is concerning for
multifocal spread of infection.  Superimposed mild interstitial
pulmonary edema.
3. Stable prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and left hilar lymph
nodes, likely reactive in nature.
4. Several foci of intraperitoneal free air, newly apparent
since post-surgical CT from [**2105-9-24**].
5. Calcified pleural plaques indicative of prior asbestos
exposure.
6. Findings compatible with tracheobronchomalacia.

[**2105-10-10**] CT abdomen/pelvis showed:
1. Loop of bowel containing air and oral contrast may be trapped
between the right lobe of the liver and the right thoracic wall,
although it does contain new oral contrast since the CT chest
performed several hours prior. There is fluid around the dome of
the liver and around this loop of bowel.
2. Two locules of air at the dome of the liver. Although no
definite evidence for perforation is present, it is not
excluded. The locules of air may represent residual air from
abdominal surgery, although this surgery occurred several weeks
prior, which would be unusual.
3. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
4. Extensive airspace opacities in the lungs concerning for
infection.
5. Nasogastric tube looped on itself within a hiatal hernia with
the tip extending superiorly into the esophagus.
6. Parastomal hernia but no bowel obstruction.
7. Pleural plaques.

[**2105-10-16**] CT head showed:
No acute large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline
structures or mass effect is present. The ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and
configuration.
There is diffuse bihemispheric left greater than right
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypoattenuation,
consistent with small vessel
ischemic disease. However, no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation
is noted.  There is calcific atherosclerosis of the vertebral
arteries and both carotid arteries. The orbits are unremarkable.
The visible mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well
aerated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the ACS service in the Emergency
Room and admitted to the hospital for conservative treatment of
his partial small bowel obstruction with IV hydration, gastric
decompression with a nasogastric tube and serial exams. He was
seen by the Urology service initially as he had a ureteral stone
noted incidentally on his Abd CT that was done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
He had no pain and no elevation of his creatinine therefore this
incidental finding would be worked up if it did not pass on its
own.  He did have some low urine output which responded to IV
fluids but that was secondary to low intravascular volume as
opposed to renal failure from an obstructing stone.

His [**Last Name 16423**] problem was that of his bowel obstruction.  His NG
tube was replaced due to persistent vomiting and eventually his
abdomen was soft however his ostomy was not active.  After
waiting 6 days for resolution he was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2105-9-17**] for an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and
a small bowel resection.  He tolerated the procedure well and
returned to the PACU in stable condition. His pain was
controlled with a PCA.  A PICC line was placed on [**2105-9-18**] for
