History of Present Illness:
 74f who was diagnosed with L MCA aneurysm one week ago.
Today had complaints of headache and became aphasic. Taken to
OSH
where her MS decreased and she was intubated. CT head showed SAH
and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. On

Patient Passed at 1O:04 am on [**4-14**]


Pertinent Results:
[**4-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1.  Endotracheal tube in proper position.
2.  Nasogastric tube with side port at the gastroesophageal
junction.  Could be advanced several centimeters for proper
positioning.

[**4-7**] CTA Head: IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilobed 11 x 7 mm aneurysm arising from the left M1/M2
junction, the
likely source of the large left frontal intraparenchymal
hematoma with
extensive neighboring subarachnoid and subdural blood products.
2.  Moderate right word subfalcine herniation.
3.  Moderate suprasellar and mild quadrigeminal cistern
effacement, concerning for early uncal/transtentorial
herniation.
4.  Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter terminating
in the
approximate region of the third ventricle.

[**4-7**] Cerebral Angiogram: IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent
cerebral angiography, which revealed an aneurysm of the left
middle cerebral artery that was coiled subtotally.  Since her
exam was poor, at some point, she will be brought back to finish
this if she makes a satisfactory recovery.

[**4-7**] CXR: An NG tube is present, the tip extends beneath the
diaphragm and overlies the lower mid abdomen, question within
distended stomach.  The lung bases are grossly clear.   The
sideport lies in the left mid abdomen, again, likely in a
distended stomach. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.

[**4-7**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval left frontal craniectomy with improved but
persistent rightward shift of normally midline structures and
mild effacement of the basal cisterns on the left.
2.  Increased density of large left parenchymal and extensive
bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely secondary to interval
administration of
contrast and additional extravasation.
3.  External ventricular drain catheter terminates below the
left lateral
ventricle, with tip possibly outside the ventricular system.

[**4-8**] EEG: *** pending

[**4-8**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Status post left frontal craniectomy
and ventriculostomy drain retraction, stable appearance of left
intraparenchymal and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage with mild
improvement of midline shift, but persisting sulcal and
ventricular effacement.

[**4-9**] EEG: ***pending

[**4-9**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been advanced
slightly, now terminating about 2.5 cm above the carina.
Central venous catheter has apparently been slightly withdrawn
since previous study with tip now at or just below the
cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within
normal limits.  Appearance of the lungs is essentially unchanged
except for slight obscuration of a small portion of the
peripheral right hemidiaphragm.  It is uncertain whether this
represents a focal area of right basilar atelectasis or
consolidation, or if it reflects a newly developed small right
pleural effusion.  Attention to this area on followup radiograph
may be helpful in this regard.

[**4-9**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Status post left frontal craniectomy
and ventriculostomy with persistent large parenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage causing increased hmass effect.  The tip
of the EVD in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle,
which is being compressed by adjacent mass effect.

[**4-10**] EEG: ***pending

[**4-10**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. indeterminate diastolic function. No pathologic
valvular abnormalities.

[**4-10**] CXR: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change.  Monitoring and support devices are
constant.  No change in appearance of the lung parenchyma and
the cardiac silhouette.  A previously seen blunting of the
lateral aspect of the right diaphragmatic contour is no longer
present.

[**4-11**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
monitoring study because of severe diffuse encephalopathy and
interhemispheric asymmetry
suggesting greater left hemisphere pathology and particularly
greater
left mid to posterior temporal pathology. There continues to be
multifocal independent interictal epileptic activity
predominantly over
the right central and temporal regions with rare discharges over
the
left hemisphere. Compared to the prior day's recording, there is

worsening encephalopathy and worsening left temporal cerebral
dysfunction noted in this recording.


[**4-11**] CXR: FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**4-10**], there is
poor definition of the hemidiaphragms, especially on the right,
consistent with small layering effusions and compressive
atelectasis at the bases.  No evidence of vascular congestion.
The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.8 cm
above the carina.  Nasogastric tube and left central catheter
are unchanged in position.

[**4-11**] CTA: IMPRESSION:
1.  Minimal vasospasm of the M1 segment of the left MCA proximal
to the coil.  The distal opercular branches are patent.  There
is no vascular occlusion.
2.  Stable intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage
involving the left
temporal and frontal lobes with no change in the mass effect
from the prior
study.  No evidence of herniation.

[**4-12**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
monitoring study because of a severe diffuse encephalopathy with
a burst and burst suppressive pattern and asymmetric attenuation
of voltage over the left temporal region and, to a lesser
degree, left central region. There were no clear electrographic
seizures and only a few potential interictal
discharges identified.

[**4-12**] CXR: The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.  The NG
tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are
unremarkable.  There is small amount of bilateral pleural
effusion, unchanged since the prior study with no evidence of
interval development of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Right
midline tip is at the level of mid portion of right subclavian
artery.

[**4-12**] CT Head: Little change in comparison to prior study from
the day before with stable appearance of large left
fronto-temporal intraparenchymal hemor
