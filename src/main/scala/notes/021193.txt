History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24049**] is a 72 year old gentleman with Crohn's disease,
recent admission for CMV colitis s/p left colectomy ([**2167-3-5**])
who presents with maroon from his ostomy bag. The patient
reports that he was in his usual state of health until around
9:30pm when his ostomy bag was noted to be half full of [**Year (4 digits) **].
He had previously emptied it an hour ago and was normal
appearing. He emptied the bag and called 911.
.
In the ED VS 99.1 53 125/57 16 99%RA. His ostomy bag filled up
twice within an hour with [**Year (4 digits) **] for ~1L [**Year (4 digits) **] loss. He became
hypotensive to the 60's/40 and a femoral cordis was placed. The
massive transfusion protocol was initiated and he was rapidly
given 2U pRBC and 2L IVF and BP improved. His Hct on admission
was 26.2. Additionally, his bloody output stopped and a 3rd unit
was hung. He also underwent NG lavage that cleared after 500cc.
He was started on IV protonix. He was evaluated by GI who will
plan to EGD +/- colonoscopy in the AM if he remains stable.
Surgery also evaluated the patient in the ED. Vitals on transfer
was 97.0, 93 126/49, 18 100% 2L.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24049**] is a 72 year old gentleman with Crohn's disease and a
recent admission for CMV colitis s/p left colectomy ([**2167-3-5**])
who presented with a gastrointestinal bleed into his ostomy bag.

.
#. GI Bleed: Patient presented with profuse bleeding into his
ostomy bag. Hematocrit was 26.2 on admission (baseline 25-30).
NG lavage was performed in the ED and cleared after 500 cc of
saline was administered and aspirated. The patient was started
on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]. The rapid transfusion protocol was activated
and he received a total of 5 units pRBCs. He was initially
hypotensive with systolic SBP in the 60s in the ED. The
patient's [**Hospital1 **] pressure normalized after pRBC transfusion and
IV hydration. His hematocrit subsequently remained stable at
32-34 for the remainder of his hospital stay. A colonoscopy and
EGD were performed and revealed nonbleeding diverticulosis of
the ascending colon and angioectasias in the stomach body at the
lesser curvature, respectively. The patietn remained
hemodynamically stable for the remainder of his hospital course.
Stool studies were sent that were negative for an infectious
etiology, including salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, vibrio,
yersinia, and E.coli 0157:H7. CMV VL was undetectable. The
patient was transitioned to an oral PPI prior to discharge. He
was instructed to continue the PPI twice a day for two weeks and
then subsequently to take it once a day. The patient was given
GI follow up as an outpatient. The patient was instructed not to
take his ASA for his CAD at d
