HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
male with an extensive past medical history who presented
with the chief complaint of drowsiness and swelling.  The
patient was in his usual state of health until a few days
prior to presentation at which time the patient's wife
noticed a foul odor and the appearance of urine in the
patient's ostomy bag.  The patient also noted subjective
decrease in his urine output during this time as well as
increased dyspnea on exertion.  The patient denied any
orthopnea or PND.  However the patient did note a slight
increase in pedal and scrotal edema over these past few days.
The patient also complains of increased sleepiness during
this time.  He denies any chest pain but the complaint of
chronic diarrhea since last [**Month (only) 116**] to [**Month (only) **].

The patient had no complaints of abdominal pain, no cough, no
fevers, no chills, no nausea, no vomiting.  He does describe
a slight sensation of unsteadiness over the time but denied
any frank problems with balance or vertigo.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year-old man with
multiple medical problems now presenting with acute chronic
renal failure.  The patient has had previous episodes of
acute renal failure with creatinine as high as 9.0 which has
presented with similar symptoms to today's presentation.
The patient was noted to have a mild acidemia with a pH of
7.30 with an anion gap of 18 with no other indication for
acute hemodialysis.

The patient was also noted to have evidence of a urinary
tract infection based on white blood cell count in a
urinalysis and was therefore started on Ciprofloxacin.

A Renal consult was obtained in order to evaluate for the
possibility of initiation of hemodialysis.  Otherwise the
patient's cardiac regimen was continued without change and
further plans were deferred until a decision regarding
hemodialysis was obtained.

Over the next few hospital days the patient and his family
considered initiation of hemodialysis.  During this time the
patient did not demonstrate any uremia symptoms and was found
to be volume overloaded but with normal oxygenation and
ventilation.  Lasix was given prn in order to maintain the
patient's fluid balance at -500 cc, and the patient's
medication regimen was changed to include three tablets of
PhosLo for a persistently elevated phosphate as well as
initiation of bicarb for a low bicarb noted on routine
laboratory tests.

Interventional Radiology consult was placed in order to
evaluate for placement of access for initiation of
hemodialysis.  This was performed on [**2168-12-13**].
Hemodialysis was to be initiated beginning on [**2168-12-14**].

Of note during placement of the Perma-cath by Interventional
Radiology on [**2168-12-13**] there was a questionable infusion of 10
to 15 units of Heparin and the patient was to begin
hemodialysis on [**2168-12-14**]. However over night the patient had
persistent bleeding from the Perma-cath site and then
subsequently from the ileostomy site.  Coagulation studies
were checked which demonstrated an INR of 1.9 and PTT of 150.
Over the course of the day the patient's hematocrit
vacillated from 28.4 to 29.2 to 27.5.  The patient was seen
by Interventional Radiology and the catheter was flushed with
normal saline without extravasation. The patient's blood
pressure remained stable and his heart rate remained within
the 80s.  A pressure dressing was applied.  The patient was
closely followed.

The next therapy which was initiated was protamine infusion
for Heparin reversal.  However since this require unit
nursing care the patient was transferred from the floor to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit. At the time of transfer the
patient's picture was somewhat confusing as the Heparin that
was used on the procedure on the 30th should have been gone
by the 31st.  However the patient's coagulations were
markedly elevated and this again did not coincide with the
small dose of Heparin.

At the time of transfer to the MICU the patient was treated
with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, and protamine. He was
also given a dose of DDAVP to improve his platelet function
in the setting of renal failure. The patient received a total
of 50 mm IV of protamine, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma,
DDAVP times one and vitamin K times one.

During his course in the MICU the patient had one episode of
hematemesis and continued to ooze from his Perma-cath site,
although his urine had cleared.  The patient's PTT and PT
resolved status post the above therapy to a PT of 13.6, a PTT
of 28.5 and an INR of 1.3.  However the oozing continued from
the Perma-cath site and the patient's hematocrit dropped to
24.1. Subsequently the patient received two more doses of
DDAVP, received a dose of Premarin. Interventional Radiology
injected thrombin into the Perma-cath site with only very
minimal oozing following this procedure.

Given the length of the duration of the oozing status post
the patient's last Heparin administration it was felt that
the most likely source of his bleeding was uremic platelet
dysfunction.

Given the patient's low platelet count and the suggestion of
uremic platelet dysfunction a Hematology / Oncology consult
was obtained who recommended treating the acute bleeding
episode as was being done and agreed with the suggestion that
the patient's platelets were likely dysfunctional secondary
to uremia.  The low platelet count had been present
chronically and was felt to be potentially secondary to
medications (including Remeron, Allopurinol, Amiodarone,
Hydralazine, and Lipitor) and recommended checking a
reticulocyte count to see if the bone marrow was responding
appropriately. There was no need to be concerned about
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia given the chronicity of the
patient's thrombocytopenia.

In addition a GI consult was obtained once the patient had an
episode of frank hematemesis.  The gastrointestinal consult
team suggested monitoring the patient's hematocr
