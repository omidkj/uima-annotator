History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 8922**] is an 85 y/o M with PMHx s/f CAD with multiple DES
and BMS, HC, HTN, AFIB and PVD who presented on [**5-11**] after 1 day
of shortness of breath and chest pain. On [**5-10**], he was helping
his wife in the nursing home, walking with her and began feeling
SOB and chest pain, which was unusual for him. He described cp
as midline sub-sternal, without radiation.  No n/v, light
headedness, syncope, PND, orthopnea. It continued to progress
without improvement until yesterday when he was unable to sleep,
and his son brought him to the [**Name (NI) **].

His prior coronary events have included symptoms of h/a, and
chest pain.

In the ED, initial vitals were stable (Temp: 97.7 HR: 76 BP:
121/67 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 95 Normal). EKG revealed Sinus, ST
elevations in leadII andIII with reciprocal ST depressions
anteriorly, new from previous. He was determined to have NSTEMI.

Labs and imaging significant for:
CE CK-MB 11 (8a, 3a), Trop-T 0.45 (8a), 0.46 (3a)
H/H 9.4/30.8
Lytes: K 3.9, Mg 2.3
UA: RBC 24
Patient was given plavix loading dose. On arrival to the floor,
patient was in no acute distress and chest pain free.  He was
subsequently started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt in preparation
for [**5-14**] cath.  Over the course of the 23rd, the patient was
noted to be increasingly hypoxic with O2 sats ~85% on 4-6L O2
NC.  He was triggered and given lasix 40 x 2 with minimal urine
output or improvement in respiratory status.  Trops increased to
0.67 at 1900.  Repeat EKG was markedly improved from admission
with q waves in III, AvF and small ST deppression in I and V3.
ABG was 7.38/44/66.  CXR showed pulmonary edema.  Subjective
improvement in respiratory status was noted with duonebs x 3.
However, given his continued worsened respiratory status he was
transferred to CCU.

Imaging Studies/Procedures

CXR: There are bilateral increased interstitial opacities with
bibasilar. atelectasis. Minimally enlarged cardiomediastinal
silhouette which appears stable in size in comparison to the
prior study. Otherwise, the lungs are without a focal
consolidation. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion

TTE:
Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size. No ASD
or PFO detected by saline contrast at rest (intubated, sedated,
unable to perform maneuvers). Moderate regional left ventricular
dysfunction as above with overall moderately reduced systolic
function. Mildly dilated aortic root. Mild mitral regurgitation.


RHC/Coronary Angiography/PCI:
Hemodynamics (see above):  The right and left heart filling
pressures were elevated (PCWP = 24 mmHg).  There was no evidence
of an intracardiac shunt by oximetry.  The V waves did not
suggest acute mitral regurgitation. There was no equalization of
the diastolic pressures suggestive of pericardial tamponade.

Coronary angiography:  right dominant

LMCA:    Very heavily calficied with 40-50% distal left main

LAD:       The proximal LAD had minor lumen irregularities.
The
1st diagonal branch was a small caliber (2.0 mm) vessel but
bifurcated and supplied the bulk of the posterolateral wall.
There was a 80% calcified focal mid LAD. The distal LAD was a
2.5
mm vessel with 30-40% diffuse lumen irregularities.

LCX:       There was a 40-50% in-stent restenosis within the
stent; there was a 90% stenosis within the mid LCX prior to a
large OMB3.  The OMB1 was a small vessel without focal stenoses;
the OMB2 was a medium sized vessel with diffuse disease.  The
OMB3 was a large vessel just distal to the LCx lesion and
diffusely diseased with 30-40% diffusely lesions in its more
proximal segment. The LCX gave right to faint left to right
collaterals to the PDA.

RCA:      There was a 99% stenosis in the mid RCA with TIMI 1
flow into the distal vessel.  This was likely the culprit vessel
(along with the LCx).  There were 40-50% stenoses diffusely
distally into a very disease RCA and right posterolateral
branches.

ASSESSMENT
1.	NSTEMI due to RCA occlusion v. LCX high grade stenosis
2.	Refractory chest pain and ischemia despite maximal medical
therapy
3.	Successful drug eluting stent placement RCA and LCx
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Aspirin 325 mg daily for one month then 81-162 mg daily
thereafter
2.	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
3.	Integrilin x 18 hours in the absence of bleeding
4.	Staged PCI of the LAD for recurrent/residual ischemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
85M with history of extensive vascular disease (both cardiac
with multiple stents, and peripheral including carotid), who p/w
NSTEMI and worsening respiratory distress while awaiting cath.

ACUTE

# NSTEMI: Patient initially presented with CP and SOB x 1 day
and admitted to the cardiology service.  Initial EKG revealed
Sinus, ST elevations in leadII andIII with reciprocal ST
depressions anteriorly, new from previous.  ASA, Plavix, Nitro
gtt and hep gtt were started and cath
