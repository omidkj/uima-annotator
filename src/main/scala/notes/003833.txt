Admission Date:  [**2131-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-11**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
(status post cardiac catheterization in [**2130-12-1**] with
stent placement to the circumflex artery and a questionable
history of myocardial infarction 25 years ago), hypertension,
and chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CMI
Service after and elective catheterization was performed on
[**2131-9-4**] due to increasing dyspnea on exertion times
one to two weeks and increasing frequency of chest pain.

The cardiac catheterization was complicated by bradycardia
which required 0.5 mg of atropine.  The first obtuse marginal
was opened by angioplasty, but stent was unable to be
deployed.

Status post catheterization, she was noted to be stable with
an initial blood pressure of 144/65 and a heart rate of 60.
Three hours status post catheterization, she was noted to
have a decreased blood pressure to 60/40 with a heart rate
still in the 60s.  Her hematocrit was found to be 29 (down
from 36).  She was given atropine with an increase in heart
rate to the 100s.  She was started on a dopamine drip with an
increase in blood pressure to the 90s to 110s/60s to 70s.
Her right groin was stable and without hematoma.  The
Integrilin was discontinued.  She was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management.

On transfer, she denied any chest pain or shortness of
breath.  No leg pain.  No new low back pain.  She has chronic
midback pain.  She did complain of diffuse abdominal pain.

ALLERGIES:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a former heavy tobacco
smoker.  She had over a 50-pack-year history.  She recently
quit.  Social alcohol.  She currently lives in a nursing
home.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother died of a myocardial infarction
at the age of 70.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's vital signs in the
Coronary Care Unit revealed initial blood pressure of 77/48,
increased to 122/40, heart rate was 96 (in atrial
fibrillation), and she was saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Generally, she was a pale elderly female in no
apparent distress.  She appeared comfortable.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were
anicteric and pale.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light.  The mucous membranes were moist.  No thrush.  Neck
examination revealed jugular venous pulsation not appreciated
at 30 degrees.  Chest examination revealed the lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally except for coarse upper
airway sounds.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
irregular rate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  No radiation.  The abdomen revealed
mild diffuse tenderness to palpation.  No rebound or
guarding.  Bowel sounds were present.  There was no [**Doctor Last Name **]
sign.  Extremity examination revealed the right groin was
without hematoma or bruits.  Fingers and toes were cold and
clammy.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were
dopplerable bilaterally.  Neurologic examination revealed she
was alert and oriented times three, enunciating effectively.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories of
significance on admission revealed hematocrit fell from 36 to
29 and increased to 32 after 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  Complete blood count was within normal limits.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization in [**2130-8-31**] revealed right coronary artery with 80% proximal
circumflex, mild left axis deviation, left circumflex was
stented, left middle cerebral artery was normal, pulmonary
artery pressures were 31/16, left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure was 17.

Catheterization on [**2131-9-4**] showed first obtuse
marginal with 99% which received percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty with 20% residual stenosis.  They were
unable to pass a stent at that time.  Left main coronary
artery was within normal limits.  Left anterior descending
artery with mild disease.  Right coronary artery with 100%
stenosis which filled with collaterals.

A transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2130-12-1**] showed an
ejection fraction of 50% to 60%.  Her left anterior
descending artery was dilated.  Mitral regurgitation of 1+.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

Persantine MIBI in [**2131-5-1**] revealed an ejection
fraction of 60% with an apical ischemia, some fixed
inferoseptal defects.

Electrocardiogram prior to catheterization revealed atrial
fibrillation, heart rate of 54, a Q wave in lead III, early R
wave transition.

Electrocardiogram status post catheterization revealed a
right bundle-branch block and 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions in
leads V3 to V6, atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125.

Electrocardiogram at [**Street Address(2) 104875**] depressions
(less than 1 mm) in leads V3 to V6.

An electrocardiogram at [**Street Address(2) 104876**] changes had
resolved.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was felt to be at an
increased risk of bleed given that she had just had cardiac
catheterization, and her hematocrit had dropped.  Her aspirin
and Plavix were held.  The Integrilin was discontinued.

The patient had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and
pelvis on the morning after admission which showed that she
had a right retroperitoneal 5 X 6 hematoma.

A follow-up computed tomography on [**2131-9-6**] showed that
the hematoma was stable, so no further action was taken at
that time.  Vascular Surgery was consulted and did not feel
that intervention was necessary.

Of note, on the computed tomography, the patient was noted to
have a 5-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm which was asymptomatic.
Vascular Surgery said that they would follow that as an
outpatient.

The patient had serial hematocrit levels checked.  Throughout
her hospital stay, her only required 3 units of packed red
blood cells.  Her hematocrit levels remained stable
afterwards, and she had no signs of further bleeding or
infection at her groin site.

(a)  Coronary artery disease:  She was continued on her
Lipitor.  Enalapril and beta blocker were started after her
blood pressure had stabilized.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and remained negative.  The patient did require pressor
support during the first 24 hours of her hospital admission.
She was initially on dopamine which was discontinued due to
tachycardia which was causing some demand ischemia.  She was
placed on Neo-Synephrine and weaned off as her blood pressure
tolerated.

Her ejection fraction was 60% (per echocardiogram in [**2130-12-1**]).  She had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart
failure throughout her hospital course.  A repeat
echocardiogram was not done at this time as it was not
clinically indicated.
