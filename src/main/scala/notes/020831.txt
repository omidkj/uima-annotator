Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization/RCA angioplasty

PEG placement [**1-28**]


History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with h/o DM2, HTN, CVA ([**2132**]) with residual L sided
weakness, PVD, h/o DVT now on coumadin, PVD s/p ABF bypass
([**2136**]) c/b thrombectomy ([**2147**]) who presents following syncopal
episode. Patient was in USOH until yesterday when patient
developed onset of "indigestion" lasting for several hours,
relieved on its own. Patient then awoke this AM feeling weak
"like her legs were giving out." She thought it was secondary to
low blood sugar. Patient denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations at that time. She syncopized and fell and
EMS was called.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, VS: BP 130-60 HR 38 RR28 FS 384. Noted
to have ST elevations in II,III, aVF with reciprocal depression
in I and aVL. CODE STEMI was called, patient was 2mg of atropine
for bradycardia, ASA, SL nitro, plavix 75, integrilin, bblocker
and transferred to the cath lab. Patient underwent balloon
angioplasty to RCA for total occlusion. No other intervention
was performed due to her diffuse disease.
.
On review of symptoms, history is positive for DVT, stroke and
dyspnea on exertion. Denies joint pains, cough, hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, + dyspnea on exertion with minimal activity. Requires a
walker for ambulation. Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cardiac catheterization [**2154-1-4**]:
Successful POBA of the mid RCA.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  RCA vessel.
4. Referral for CABG as definitive treatment

CT head [**2154-1-5**]:
COMPARISON: [**2153-12-20**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head.
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated are bifrontal subdural hygromas,
unchanged. There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures. There are periventricular white matter hypodensities
bilaterally consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions.
There are punctate hypodensities within the basal ganglia
bilaterally consistent with chronic lacunar infarctions. An old
cerebellar infarct is demonstrated again and is unchanged. There
is no evidence of new infarction. Vascular calcifications are
seen within the vertebral and cavernous carotid arteries. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Stable head CT. No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage.

   RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-1-31**] 8:26 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman s/p CABGx3
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
INDICATION: 67-year-old woman status post CABG. Evaluate for
pleural effusions.

COMPARISON: [**2154-1-25**].

SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: No large pleural effusions were seen. There
may be small radiographically occult pleural effusions. The
right lung base demonstrates better aeration compared to prior
study suggesting resolving atelectasis. Bilateral lung
parenchyma demonstrates good aeration. No focal areas of
opacification are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette, heart size are within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION: No definitive evidence of pleural effusions. No
significant changes since then [**2154-1-25**].
