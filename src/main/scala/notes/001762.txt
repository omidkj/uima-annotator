Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This 78 year old male with history of a.flutter, AS, COPD,
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy stopped taking his
medications one week ago and presents today with SOB, LE
swelling, ataxia.  He also has decreased exercise tolerance,
increased DOE, PND, anorexia.  He has had documented heart rates
in the 130-140s for the last 9 months.  He was scheduled for
cardiac catheterization to evaluate coronary arteries and aortic
valve next monday with possible a.flutter ablation and possible
AVR.  At baseline he can climb about 15 steps before becoming
SOB.  No chest pain or syncope.

On arrival to ED heart rate was 170 and BP 94/79 goat 20mg Dilt
IV, 540 mg XR, azithro and CTX, BP dropped to 80/70s and HR
dropped to 130s in regular a.flutter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt expired at end of hospital course.

In the ED Mr. [**Known lastname **] x-ray showed evidence of right sided
pleural effusion with some collapse/consolidation.  He refused a
decubitus film at that time.  Our plan was to try to tap his
effusion in the morning.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] arrived at the floor and was
monitored overnight.  He was given Vitamin K to correct his INR
and placed on a Heparin gtt with the plan to send him for a
TEE/flutter ablation in the morning and tap his effusion.  He
was found to have a Sat of 83% on 4L NC the morning after
admission.  He was placed on 100% non-rebreather and his Sats
improved to high 80s.  His ABG on this was pH 7.41, pCO2 52, pO2
50.  He was given Diltiazem 90 PO, Nebulizers.  He continued to
have low o2 saturations and was transferred to the CCU for
further monitoring.

On sedation for intubation, the patient's BP dropped and he
required levophed to maintain his pressures. He had an TEE that
was negative for clot.  He continued to be tachycardic to the
160-180s, and was taken to the EP [**Known lastname **] for ablation +/- pacer
placement on the afternoon of [**9-24**].  Then in the EP [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
attempt at cardioversion was attempted which was not successful
in attaining SR.  Ablation of the isthmus was performed, with
termination of the A flutter and reversion to A fib.  Ibutolide
was given to stop the A fib, with SR in the 70s occuring but
with BP still low and QTc 550msec.  Once back in CCU, pt had
reversion to A flutter.

His hospital course in the CCU:

1. CARDIOVASCULAR
A. RHYTHM: the patient initially responded to Amio gtt with
reversion to sinus brady.  However, he did not tolerate a
conversion to Amio PO, went back into A fib/flutter but with
rate at around 100bpm which is relatively controlled for this
gentleman who generally has a HR in the 140-160s.  The patient
was maintained on Amio gtt thereafter.

B. PUMP: CHF with poor systolic and diastolic function; required
pressors on and off throughout his CCU stay, including levohphed
and dobutamine, which were difficult to wean; the patient has
severe AS but is not a candidate for surgery given his lung CA,
would consider valvuloplasty as last resort.  Pt developed
cardiogenic shock and had non-operable end-stage heart disease
with critical AS.  He was made DNR and his goals of care were
shifted from a curative strategy to palliation.  He passed away
[**2166-10-11**].

C. CORONARIES: unclear disease, unlikely to get cath given his
lung CA

2. PULMONARY: Pt with non-operable stage 3B NSCLC.

3. RENAL: repleted lytes, K and Mg in particular, qd

4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: PNA, leukocytosis
gave levo/flagyl for post-[**Last Name (un) **] pna, then started on Vanc for
presumed line sepsis

5. HEME: coagulation profile abnormality with INR 1.7, which
responded somewhat to vitamin K; unclear if from shock liver vs
NPO and abx

6. GI: s/p ileus, now tolerating tube feeds; cont tube feeds,
bowel regimen

7. NEURO: intubated/sedation, no acute needs

8. PSYCH: med noncompliance, wanted to leave AMA initially but
agreed to intubation, cath. Will assess capacity when extubated

9. Prophylaxis: anticoagulated, ppi while intubated, bowel
regimen
