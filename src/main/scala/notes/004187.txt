Admission Date:  [**2142-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-3-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2095-3-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea and fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old female
with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma that was diagnosed at
the age of 17 and was treated with MOPP and radiation therapy
to the left lung which resulted in progressive fibrosis.

She had been doing well and was in her usual state of health
until she began to note fatigue and eventually more
difficulty breathing over the course of two months prior to
this admission.  She also noticed bilateral lower extremity
edema which she had never experienced before.

She presented to the Emergency Department where a chest
computed tomography showed a large right-sided pleural
effusion with mediastinal shift to the left.  She was
admitted to [**Hospital6 733**] Medicine for diuresis on
[**2142-3-3**] and became increasingly dyspneic and
disoriented that night with an arterial blood gas with a pH
of 7.27, PCO2 of 86, and a PO2 of 81 requiring transfer to
the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease (as above).
2.  Status post splenectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
estrogen 0.625 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former high school teacher;
English and software teacher.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor
revealed temperature was 99.2, blood pressure was 100 to
130/50 to 60, heart rate was 95, oxygen saturation was 100%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, and respiratory rate was 30.  In
general, she was a thin ill-appearing female but pleasant,
and in no apparent distress.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Nasal cannula was in place.  Her lungs revealed decreased
breath sounds in the entire left lung field when compared to
the right.  Her cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were
appreciated.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination
at this time revealed no pedal edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
upon transfer revealed white blood cell count was 9.4,
hematocrit was 36.9, and platelets were 473.  Her Chemistry-7
was remarkable for a blood urea nitrogen of 20 and a
creatinine of 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  DYSPNEA ISSUES:  As mentioned, she was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit on [**3-4**].  There, she received a
Cardiology consultation for her dyspnea and found new heart
failure.

She had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed tricuspid
regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and right ventricular
hypertrophy, and severe right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.

She was started on digoxin and Aldactone.  She did briefly
transfer out to the floor but then went back to the Intensive
Care Unit for hypercarbia to 120 on arterial blood gas as
well as mental status changes.

On [**3-5**], she was back in the Intensive Care Unit with a
trial of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure which was followed
by intubation.  The patient was placed on levofloxacin for a
presumed pneumonia/tracheal bronchitis.  She also had a
bronchoscopy on [**3-9**] which showed no significant airway
narrowing.  She was continued on diuresis at this point but
was switched to furosemide for a rash that seemed to be due
to the spironolactone.

On [**3-14**], she was extubated and tolerated this well.  She
was continued on furosemide at approximately 20 mg p.o. q.d.
and remained even with her intake and output.

The patient tolerated the trial of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure at night; initially with lower settings that had
been previously initiated.  She was encouraged to wear this
if possible at night, and she was working respectively
therapy to try to achieve levels for comfort during the day
as well as at night, as this was felt beneficial.  As an
outpatient, she should continue the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure regimen to help improve her hypercarbia at baseline
with PCO2 noted probably in the 60s to 70s.

2.  RASH ISSUES:  The patient did develop a maculopapular
rash on her abdomen and chest.  This was thought to coincide
with the initiation of Aldactone for diuresis.  The patient
was switched to furosemide three days later and tolerated
this well with complete resolution of the rash.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Docusate sodium 100 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Hydroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.12h. (if the patient
to be immobile in rehabilitation).
6.  Estrogen conjugated 0.625 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Lung fibrosis secondary to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy.
2.  New diagnosis of right heart failure secondary to high
pulmonary artery pressures to the lungs bilaterally.
3.  Right-sided pleural effusion; improved with diuresis.
4.  Hodgkin's disease.
5.  Status post splenectomy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to have a intensive physical therapy with
her oxygen at 1 liter per minute on nasal cannula until she
can be weaned off this.  She did exhibit some desaturations
with ambulation, and this will be worked on with greater
conditioning at rehabilitation.
2.  The patient was also to follow up with the Pulmonary
Clinic (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**3-29**] at 9:30 a.m.
3.  The patient was also to call her primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 100634**] who was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with the plan.
