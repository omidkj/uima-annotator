SOB.  States that she developed a cough 2-3 days prior that was
productive of a green phlegm which she attributes to an asthma

and had newly started Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] x approximately 10 days for
LE swelling, which has improved.  This AM complained of SOB and
home health aide thought she looked unwell so called EMS.  Had
sat 91% on RA and was given supplemental O2.  Initial EMS VS
96/62, 74, 24 and 91%/RA and noted to be in AFib (no EKG to

100/4L.  On initial ED exam was wheezing and rhonchorous.  Got
Combivent and felt much better.  Given 40mg po KCl.   120mg
Methylprednisone, 750mg Levofloxacin.  She was then noted to
have decreased BP, with low of 75/45.  She was given 2L NS,
still SBP 70s, RR 20, 100/4L, and HR 102 when trying to get on

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F with FTT and asthma, admitted with productive cough and
hypotension.

1.  Hypotension: resolved. Likely due to failure to thrive and
chronic poor intake, in the setting of continuing
antihypertensives.  She was also found to have a UTI on
admission.  The son confirms that she has had poor po intake,
and recently started lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] x10 days for LE edema, and
patient appeared hypovolemic on admission.

The patient was admitted to the MICU and fluid resuscitated. She
completed a course of Levaquin for UTI. The patient developed
pulmonary edema subsequent to IV fluids and required 4 L
supplemental oxygen but remianed comfortable. She was treated
for possible asthma exacerbation with albuterol and prednisone
taper. The patient was also noted to be in acute renal failure
in the setting of diuretics and poor oral intake, which resolved
with hydration. On the day of transfer to the floor, the patient
received 5mg IV Lasix to aid with diuresis and was resting
comfortably.
-Please follow up blood cultures from [**2-18**]

2. History of Hypertension: Patient initially hypotensive on
admission. HCTZ and Lasix were held. After stabilization with IV
fluids, BPs ranged from  130s-160s/50s-90s. However, given that
she presented with hypotension and dehydration, all
antihypertensives were held.
Patient can resume lasix at 20mg po every other day. Discontinue
HCTZ. Please assess fluid status, kidney function, blood
pressure. If appears fluid depleted, consider discontinuing
lasix.
.
# Asthma: Patient was treated with Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizers, and prednisone taper. She will need to finish 2 more
days of Prednisone 20mg po qd after discharge. She was not
require oxygen for 48 hours prior to discharge.

.
# Acute Renal Failure:  resolved.  Likely [**12-26**] Lasix, HCTZ and
poor po intake.  With elevated bicarbonate c/w contraction
alkalosis.  Resolved with IV fluids. No further fluids given
volume overload. Patient was encourage to take oral fluids.

.
# [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia: Continued on Methyldopa & Seroquel.
.
# Rhuematoid arthritis: Continued on Plaquinel.
.
# Osteoperosis: With score @ Lspine -1.2, at femoral neck -3.3.
Did not tolerate Actonel. Continued on Calcium / Vitamin D
