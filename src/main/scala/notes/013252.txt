History of Present Illness:
84F with PMHx significant for asthma, PMR, DM2, HTN & h/o STEMI
'[**29**] c/b ischemic bowel requiring ileostomy who presents with
respiratory distress. Patient reports that 5 days ago she
started to have rhinorrhea and a cough. The following day she
reports having shaking & chills in the evening (was afebrile).
The next day, the patient's sister came to visit her and the
patient felt too ill to get out of bed. Her sister called the
pt's PCP who recommended that she start azithromycin. Patient
actually started taking azithro the following day (2 days prior
to admission) and felt better enough to go her PCP's office
where she had a chest xray that did not show any acute
intrathoracic process. The patient was also noted to have thrush
and started on a 14-day course of clotrimazole troches. The
following day (the day prior to admission), the patient felt
worse; on the day of admission, the patient's sister tried to
call her with no answer. [**Name (NI) 1094**] sister went over to patient's
house where she found home health aide ringing the doorbell
outside; apparently patient was too dyspneic/tachyneic to answer
the door. At that point, they called 911 and the patient was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In transit, she received an
albuterol/ipratropium neb and IV magnesium.

In the ED, inital vitals were 100.8 116 148/55 32 92% NRB.
Non-rebreather was removed and patient was satting 94% RA with
RR 35. She was placed on 4L nasal cannula for comfort with SpO2
99%; RR decreased to low 20s. On exam, the patient appeared
tachypneic and was using some accessory muscles; only able to
speak short sentences. Labs were significant for WBC 20.5 with
81% neutrophils and 5% bands. Lactate 3.6. U/A without evidence
of infection. CXR showed bibasilar opacities, new from
[**2133-3-26**], which may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or
infection. The patient was started on levofloxacin 750mg IV as
well as ceftriaxone 1g. She also received Solu-Medrol 125mg IV
and another albuterol/ipratropium neb. Dyspnea improved and the
patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. VS on
transfer were 133/39, 115, RR 30, 99%4L NC.

On arrival to the ICU, the patient appears in have mildly
increased work of breathing, but is not using accessory muscles
and is able to speak in full sentences. She reports that the
nebs helped most with her breathing. Has a wet, productive
cough, although has not brought up any sputum. She denies any
fevers or chills (aside from once, 4 days prior to admission).
Currently states that her breathing is improved but she still
has mild shortness of breath.

COMPARISON: [**2133-3-26**].

FINDINGS: A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained
portably. Lungs are mildly hyperinflated, unchanged. Since two
days ago, there are new bibasilar opacities, which may represent
atelectasis, aspiration or infection. [**Hospital1 **]-apical
pleuroparenchymal scarring, right worse than left, is unchanged.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are stable. Moderate dextroscoliosis is unchanged.
An old healed left rib fracture is seen.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, new from [**2133-3-26**], may
represent atelectasis, aspiration, or infection.
.
EKG: sinus tach w/sinus arrhythmia @ 124bpm, LVH,
interventricular conduction delay, STD V4-6 (old), mostly
unchanged from prior, although with faster rate
