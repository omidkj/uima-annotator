Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
dislodged G-tube, fever/malaise, now tx'd back from unit after
resolution of oversedation s/p ativan


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
52 yo M with EtOH induced cirrhosis and chronic Hepatitis C s/p
liver transplant x 2 (first on [**2169-2-25**], then repeated [**2169-5-28**]
after graft failure from rejection/ Hep C activation),
complicated by hepatic artery stenosis who was admitted [**2169-9-21**]
with fever, abdominal pain, malaise and nausea X 1 week. The pt
states that he has been having worsening malaise with fevers to
101 X 1 week. Has had acute on chronic abd pain, diffuse with
RUQ focus, w/worsening nausea. No vomiting/diarrhea. No stool
changes. No dysuria. No headache. Denies CP, +mild SOB, no
cough.
.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt febrile to 101, VS o/w stable. Pt received Ceftriaxone
2 gm X1. CT abd/pelvis demonstrated mild intrahepatic biliary
dilatation; patency of major vessels; bilbasilar opacities,
atelectasis vs infection; ascites, anasarca. U/S demonstrated
small amount of ascites, not enough to tap. Tx surgery
re-advanced G-tube and secured.
.
It was felt that the interferon was causing his fever, malaise
and nausea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on CXR so started on
levofloxacin. He continued to have nausea so was given several
antiemetics and a large dose of ativan 2 mg IV on [**9-23**] and was
transferred to the unit for decreased responsiveness and was
monitored overnight. He did well after the ativan wore off and
is stable to return to floors. Currently, he complains of
diffuse abdominal pain worst in the periumbilical region only
slightly worse than baseline. He reports that it is worse
w/eating. He has noticed that his stool has been lighter than
usual and that his urine is darker than usual. Also endorses
that he looks more jaundiced than baseline. He does report that
he is passing flatus and having stools. Denies melena/BRBPR,
dysuria/frequency/urgency. Denies CP/SOB.


Past Medical History:
- Chronic Hepatitis C
- EtOH cirrhosis
- s/p 2 liver transplants, the first performed on [**2169-2-25**], and
the second performed on [**2169-5-28**], likely because of graft loss

- hepatic artery stenosis, s/p stenting on [**7-18**] (placed on ASA
and Plavix)
- h/o varices in [**2162**]

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo M h/o hepatitis C, ETOH cirrhosis, s/p liver tx X2
p/w G-tube dislodged, now replaced, and fever/malaise, s/p
transient decreased responsiveness secondary to ativan, stable
upon return to floor, now with FTT.
.
# Interferon therapy: probable cause of low grade
fever/malaise/abdominal pain/failure to thrive-
## Fever: most likely drug fever, but ?infiltrate on admission
CXR; continued presumptive tx as CAP with levofloxacin, course
complete, but continued ABx therapy for SBP prophylaxis.
## abdominal pain- probable [**1-26**] baseline hepatic failure,
increased distention and discomfort w/tube feeds, LFT's
stable/improved through hospital course. Day prior to d/c home,
d/w nutrition- decreased rate and extended length of time for
tube feeds which pt tolerated much better. Continued supportive
care including Simethicone/antiemetics, started lasix for
ascites, held on aldactone for now b/c pt on Prograf.
.
# elevated LFTs, s/p transplant: initially rising
bilirubin/alt/ast, peaked HD4, then trended down for the rest of
his hospital course. Pt was not encephalopathic during this
admission; CMV [**2169-9-26**] negative; continued Mycophenolate 250
[**Hospital1 **], tacrolimus(goal [**5-3**])-last trough [**2169-10-6**] low at 3.8- pt's
dose of Tacrolimus was increased to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] from once daily;
lactulose, ursodiol, ribavirin, and interferon continue
throughout hospital course.
.
# hep C: viral load([**2169-9-26**]) 1.96mil Iu/mL decreased since
starting interferon/ribavirin therapy; maintained on ribavirin
and IFN throughout hospital course.
# pancytopenia: Leukocytopenia secondary to interferon/marrow
suppression in the context of chronic disease and possible
splenic sequestration in the context of liver disease.
Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to interferon, liver disease.
Anemia in the context of chronic disease, liver disease with
splenomegaly and spur hemolysis. B12 and folate normal on last
admission. All cell lines appear to be at baseline; continued
filgastrim, Epo throughout hospitalization.
.
# s/p hepatic artery stent: continues to be patent, maintained
on ASA, plavix.
