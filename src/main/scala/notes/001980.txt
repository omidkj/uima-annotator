Imaging and studies

[**2113-3-27**] - AP CXR - IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study without
gross signs of pneumonia or CHF.

[**2113-3-27**] ECG - Normal sinus rhythm. Leftward axis at minus 14
degrees. Increased R wave in the right precordial leads. ST-T
wave changes in leads I, II, aVL and V2-V6. No previous tracing
available for comparison. While non-specific these ST segment
depressions are suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

[**2113-3-28**] - Transthoracic ECHO - The left atrium is mildly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 70 year old woman with COPD and hypothyroidism s/p
thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer who presented from her [**Hospital1 1501**] with
lethargy and was found to be hypoxic, hypotensive, and have a
UTI.
.
# Septic shock/Urinary tract infection. The urinary source was
suspected. She had clearly positive UA in [**Hospital1 1501**] patient; urine
culture grew out Strep viridans, an unusual urinary pathogen.
She had no evidence of pneumonia. She had no recent antibiotic
exposure or diarrhea to suggest C.diff. Blood cultures remained
negative. ECHO was negative without evidence of vegetation
(Strep viridans is more associated with endocarditits than UTI).
Pressors were quickly weaned off and patient's mental status
improved. She was initially treated with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin ([**3-27**]) but continued only on
ceftriaxone when urine culture grew out Strep viridans. She will
continue to receive Ceftriaxone at her nursening home for 3 days
and then oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin) for full course. Her
home blood pressure medications were initially held, she
received several IVF boluses, and metoprolol was restarted on
[**3-29**]. We did not restart nifedpine, HCTZ, or [**Last Name (un) **] on discharge.
These medications can be restarted when her kidney function
normalizes. She SHOULD NOT RECEIVE HCTZ AT SUCH HIGH DOSE (50
mg) as this will results in numerous side effects without
significant reduction in blood pressure. If her GFR decreases,
she should not receive HCTZ at all, and Lasix can be used
instead for hypervolemia. If she develops bacteremia from Strep
viridans, TEE and colonoscopy ( colon cancer) should be
considered.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient has a history of
stage 3 ARF on CKD. She was prerenal on admission from volume
depletion and creatine improved with IVFs. She may have also had
some component of ATN from ischemia/hypotension. No reason for
postobstructive process.
.
# Atrial fibrillation. No documented history of Afib. She had
Afib on morning of [**3-28**] after receiving norepinephrine and 500
ml of LR for hypotension. Afib resolved spontaneously after
about half hour and likely caused by atrial distention from
fluid bolus. Given her lack of history of a fib and quick
conversion, anticoagulation was felt to not be indicated. She
laready receives ASA and Plavix for unclear reasons (other than
? H/O CAD/PVD from NH notes)
.
# AMS. She was lethargic at nursing home, in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and upon
admission to MICU. There was nothing focal on exam to suggest
focal CNS process. She is an elderly woman with polypharmacy on
a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
failure.  Her mental status rapidly improved over the 2 day ICU
stay and was back to normal on discharge. ICU team held sedating
medications during ICU stay (depakote, risperidone, wellbutrin,
trazadone).  Upon leaving ICU, wellbutrin and depakote were
restarted.
.
# Anemia. Hct drop likely dilutional in the setting of receiving
IVFs for septic shock. No signs of bleeding on exam, guiac
negative.
.
# Hyperkalemia. In ED patient had K of 6.3.  Likely combination
of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 1501**] in this setting, and [
