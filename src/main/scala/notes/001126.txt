Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  [**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD, chronic distolic heart
failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure
presents after a gastrointestinal bleeding, syncope and acute
renal failure.
.
1. GIB:  Baseline HCT > 34.  On admission 31 in the setting of
dehydration.  Remained hemodynamically stable. Repeat hct of
26.2 prompted transfusion of 1U PRBCs. EGD on [**12-28**] showed
multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers, not actively bleeding. H
pylori was positive. Patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI,
Clarithromycin, and Amoxicillin. HCT stable at 32 on discharge.
Aspirin and  Plavix were held. GI recommended holding plavix for
total of 2 weeks, and Aspirin for 4-5 days. Restarted ASA on
discharge. Plavix to be resumed on [**1-11**]. Please monitor HCT.
Please continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] for total of 6 weeks (started [**12-28**]).
Patient was found to be H. pylori positive, and was started on
Amoxicillin and clarithromycin on [**2184-12-30**].

.
2. Left retrocardiac opacity: Crackles on exam and elevated
white count. T 96.6, has been low for several days, with HCO3 of
17. CXR [**12-31**] showed worsening infiltrate.
-continue amoxicillin and clarithromycin from H.pylori therapy
for pneumonia. Patient's GFR is 7.


.
3. Syncope: Thought to be secondary to GI bleed and dehydration.
 EKG without any acute ischemic changes.  Three sets of cardiac
enzymes negative.

.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr up to 4.5 but recent
baseline 1.7-2.2.  However has been slowly trending up.
Nephrology was consulted. Thought to be prerenal. Seemed to be
improving on discharge, with creatinine down to 2.9 with IV
fluids.  This will need continuous monitoring as an outpatient.
Continues to have good urine output.  - send urine lytes
.
5. UTI: Developed urinary urgency and frequency, UA consistent
with UTI. Started on 7 day course of ciprofloxacin on [**1-3**].

6. CAD: Known CAD s/p multiple PCI.  Inferior NSTEMI on
[**2184-12-11**].  Last PCI in [**2179**]. Held Asa and plavix in the
setting of GI bleed. Carvedilol was held briefly, and restarted
prior to discharge.
