CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-3-9**] 11:27 PM
FINDINGS: AP supine portable view. The patient is rotated. The
patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates 2.4
cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube terminates in the body
of the stomach. The left upper lobe consolidation appears
larger, which is probably due to rotation. There is increased
opacification of the left lower lobe. There is a hazy opacity
over the lower left hemithorax, which may represent a layering
pleural effusion. There is no right effusion. Heart size is
stable.
IMPRESSION:
1) Satisfactory position of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
2) Interval progression of left lower lobe consolidation. Stable
left upper lobe consolidaiton.
3) Possible left pleural effusion.
*
TTE ([**2143-3-9**])
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. No evidence of endocarditis seen.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2142-12-26**], there has been no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 45 yo man with h/o HIV (CD4=227) and multiple past
pneumonias presents with acute LUL pneumococcal pneumonia ans
sepsis.

PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA AND SEPSIS
The patient presented with a cough productive of brown sputum,
pleuritic left sided chest pain, and a large left upper lobe
infiltrate on his CXR.  In the emergency department he became
tachypnic, hypoxic and hypotensive, with pressures that were not
responsive to fluid boluses.  He was intubated, started on
pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the
MICU.  His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia
with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).  He underwent a
broncheoalveolar lavage, from which cultures have remained
negative.  Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was
initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade
fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started
on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question
of ventillator associated pneumonia.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2143-3-15**] and was transferred to the floor the
following day.

On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he
seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening
leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.  Serial
CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity
but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural
effusion.  On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a
significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.  The MET
service was called in for a thoracentesis. 600cc was removed
from the left lung, and sent for testing, which revealed an
exudative effusion without malignant cells.  Cultures were
negative.  An induced sputum was also done (as the patient was
not clearing his secretions) and grew sparce OP flora. Repeat CT
scan one week later showed marked resolution of LLL effusion. He
had evidence of progressing pneumonia, with new right sided tree
and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. However clinically he appeared to be
improving, with decreased oxygen requirement and no further
fevers. Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted
for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left
sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated. Given the
known suseptibility of his pneumococcus he was started again on
IV levofloxacin 500mg daily and cefepime and vancomycin were
discontinued. He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and
was therefore switched to PO regimen. His primary infectious
disease physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss his case.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely
until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to
document clearance of his infection. At that point he may need
chronic suppressive therapy, possibly with pe
