Pertinent Results:
Admission [**Location (un) **]:
A suggestion of somewhat vague ill-defined opacity involving the
left lower lobe, although this is compromised somewhat by AP
portable
technique and body habitus and may reflect an element of soft
tissue
attenuation. If further imaging is desired to help management,
consider PA
and lateral views in the radiology suite for more sensitive
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo M with recurrent aspiration pneumonia after esophageal
resection who presents with pneumonia initially required NRB,
stabilized in ICU and transferred to floor.  Treated for
health-care associated PNA with 8 days of IV vancomycin and
zosyn.  Discharged [**Last Name (un) **] off of oxygen with visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 74253**]s teaching.

#. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: Thought to be [**2-13**] aspiration
given multiple prior aspiration-associated PNA.  Treated as HCAP
given recent hospitalization (discharged on [**2158-3-14**]).   To
complete 8 days of iv vancomycin and zosyn, last dose on
[**2158-5-6**]. Also discharged on Guaifenesin prn.  Patient's
sulfacrate was stopped and PPI was decreased as they were
thought to increase risk of PNA by altering stomach acid.
Additionally, patient has been seen multiple times by speech and
swallow at previous admission and has been instructed on
specifics to reduced risk of aspiration.  Spoke with CT surgeon
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4667**] [**Doctor Last Name **] who said there was not a surgical role.

#. Hemoptysis: Had on admission, but only one episode.  Possibly
[**2-13**] bronchiectasis due to recurrent pneumonias though not [**Month/Day (2) 65**].
on recent CT chest. Pt has been ruled out for TB by neg. AFB x3,
latest sample from [**2158-3-13**]. Did not have repeated episodes.

#. COPD Exacerbation.  Treated with short prednisone burst og 60
mg for 6 days, last dose [**2158-5-4**].  Should have outpatient follow
up with [**Hospital **] Clinic for repeat spirometry given recurrent
pneumonias.

#. Diarrhea: Resolved prior to discharge. Likely viral as family
members have it as well. C. diff was not checked as patient did
not have stool.

#. DM2: Held home metformin and covered with SSI.  Restarted
home metformin upon discharge.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.

#. Chronic Back Pain: Pain was well controlled on home regimen
of vicodin, lidocaine patches, celebrex, Duloxetine, Doxepin.
