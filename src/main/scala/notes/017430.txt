CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: evaluate findings on chest xray - Right lung apical
round sm

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man s/p CABG MVRepair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate findings on chest xray - Right lung apical round
smoothly marginated lobular density representing likely
extrapleural hematoma is also unchanged. New nodular opacity in
the right midlung zone
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: shellfish allergy

CT OF THE CHEST ON [**5-19**]

HISTORY: Right apical collection following heart surgery. New
lesion right mid lung.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was
performed without intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] reconstructed as
contiguous 5 and 1.25 mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal
images, read in conjunction with chest radiographs from [**5-12**]
through [**5-18**].

FINDINGS:

A high-density (60 [**Doctor Last Name **]) extrapulmonary collection along the right
posterior costal surface of the upper lobe is either
extrapleural or loculated in the pleural space stretching from
the second through the fifth ribs, with greatest diameter 51 x
40 mm, at the level of the third posterior interspace. There is
no transthoracic extension and the adjacent rib is intact. A
small-to- moderate right and small layering left pleural
effusions are not clearly hemorrhagic. A small, vertically
oriented precardiac hematoma in the upper chest and lower
peridiaphragmatic component, 2:26 and 45, are commonly seen
after median sternotomy. There is no pericardial effusion.

A small irregular opacity in the right upper lung, 3:25-28 is
continuous with a small amount of fissural thickening, and
corresponds to the opacity seen on chest radiographs on [**5-18**]
and [**5-15**], following removal of the right pleural tube are
probably small areas of atelectasis or contusion associated with
thoracostomy. There is no pneumothorax. Aside from relaxation
atelectasis at the lung bases and in the posterior dependent
lungs, lungs are clear. There is no edema or pneumonia.

IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent large right upper extrapleural or loculated
pleural hematoma, little changed since the earliest
post-operative films on [**2145-5-12**]. Small layering
non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions have probably been present
through the entire post-operative course.
2. Small right upper lobe lesion probably related to since
removed right pleural tube.
3. Insignificant small mediastinal hematomas, common
post-operatively.

Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None

Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Emergency TEE performed in the CSRU due to declining cardiac
index and mixed
venous saturation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the RAA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in
the right atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
mildly depressed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is
mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are
three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72823**] is a 59 year-old gentleman who was refferd to
[**Hospital1 69**] for exertional chest pain
and dyspnea.  A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed
severe three vessel disease.

On [**2145-5-12**] Mr. [**Known lastname 72823**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass
graft times three, a mitral valve repair, patent foramen ovale
closure, left atrial ligation, and a MAZE.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  He tolerated the procedure well
and was able to be transferred in critical but stable condition
to the surgical intensive care unit.

In the surgical intensive care unit the patient was extubated by
post-operative day two.   He was weaned from his pressors.  His
chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.  He had atrial
fibrillation while in the unit and was therefore placed on
heparin, coumadin, and amiodarone.  On post operative d
