Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
lower GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R femoral cordis placement
Endotracheal intubation
L radial arterial line placement
Femoral artery cannulation and mesenteric angiography

History of Present Illness:
70M with history of metastatic and locally recurrent colon
cancer s/p LAR and multiple subsequent resections and history of
GI bleeds from sites of recurrent tumor, presenting from OSH
with large LGIB.  He appeared to be very actively bleeding there
with clots.  He was transfused 2 units PRBCs at OSH.  Dopamine
was started for hypotension and NGT was placed.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Initial BP
83/p and he apparently had a seizure in triage.  He was
hypotensive at times to the 50s systolic.  He had a R femoral
Cordis placed and was intubated.  In the ED massive transfusion
protocol was initiated.  He received at least 12 units PRBCs, 4
FFP, 1 cryo, 1 platelets, 6 liters of NS.  Hct after 9 units was
17.  Also received antihistamines and steroids for contrast
allergy and likely need for IR intervention.  GI was consulted
and noted limited ability to intervene given rapid bleed.
Surgery was consulted and felt patient would be poor surgical
candidate and recommended IR intervention.  IR discussed
possible intervention with family, who wished to proceed with
potential angio and coiling.
.
Patient went to the IR suite for attempt at angiography.  Upon
arrival to IR patient hypotensive to 60s-80s systolic.  Rapidly
required max doses of dopamine, neosynephrine, and levophed in
addition to blood and saline products via rapid infuser.  Approx
10 units PRBCs, 3 FFP, 1 platelets were given in addition to >12
L saline.  MICU attending met with family and decision was made
for patient to be DNR in event of cardiac arrest.
Unfortunately, IR could not localize bleeding in SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
Family was notified with plans to bring patient up to MICU for
transition to comfort care.  Further blood product transfusions
stopped and he was supported with saline.


Past Medical History:
- Colon adenocarcinoma with mets, s/p LAR and subsequent
resections with at least 2 GIBs ([**5-/2118**] and [**9-/2118**]) resulting
from recurrent tumor and ulcerations.  Diagnosed in [**2113**].  Had
adjuvant chemo with continued progression.
- COPD
- Hyperlipidemia
- HTN
- Bells palsy
- DM
- CAD s/p MI and PCI with stenting in [**2111**]


Social History:
Lives with wife.  [**Name (NI) **] current smoking or EtOH use.

Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
(upon arrival to MICU, following angio)
HR 109, BP 77/42, R30, 80% on FiO2 1, PEEP 5.

Intubated, sedated.  Not responding.
Tachycardic, regular.
Abdomen obese, no mass appreciated.
Extrem cool without appreciable edema.
Large active bright red blood from rectum (saturating towels
underneath patient; dripping from angio table during IR
procedure)

Brief Hospital Course:
70 M with advanced locally recurrent and metastatic colon cancer
with history of multiple bleeds from sites of recurrence,
presenting with large, brisk lower GI bleed, presumed from same
source.  He arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with low Hct, significant
coagulopathy (likely consumption), and hemodynamic instability.
GI, surgery, and IR were consulted.  GI unable to intervene
given briskness of his bleed.  Patient too unstable and
coagulopathic for surgical intervention.  IR was pursued at last
attempt/heroic measures.  Unfortunately no bleeding was seen and
thus no embolization was possible.  Throughout his course at the
two hospitals, he received at least 24 units PRBCs, 7 FFP,
platelets, cryo, calcium, and at least 20 liters of saline.
Despite these measures he continued to show evidence of
refractory hemorrhagic shock, requiring maximum doses of 3
pressors.  The gravity of the situation was discussed with the
family before and during angiography, and they understood that
beyond IR there were no options.  The inability to embolize was
discussed with the family and patient was thus supported with
non-blood products until arrival to the MICU in order to spend
last moments with family.  As saline infusions were stopped,
with continued full pressor and vent support but knowledge that
patient would pass within minutes, patient went into asystolic
arrest.  He was pronounced dead at 3:05am.  Autopsy was declined
by family and ME.
