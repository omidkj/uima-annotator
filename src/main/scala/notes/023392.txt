PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.3, pulse 98, blood pressure 160/90, respiratory rate 19,
saturating 100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  General:  She was
a somnolent, flaccid, minimally responsive woman who does
withdrawal to sternal rub.  Head and neck:  Notable for
pupils that were 2-3 mm and reactive.  The sclerae were
anicteric with dry oral mucosa.  Cardiac:  She had a regular
rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Lungs:  Apneic periods,
respiratory rate 10.  She had no wheezes or crackles
anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft, moderately distended with
hypoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema, warm and
dry.  Neurologic:  Notable for flaccid extremities.  Her toes
were upgoing bilaterally.  Rectal:  Guaiac positive brown
stool.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 45.7, with 42%
polys, 28% bands, 9% lymphocytes, 10% eosinophils, 4%
atypicals with a hematocrit of 27.7, platelets 553,000.  Her
PT was 13.4, INR 1.2, PTT 35.2.  Her Chem-7 was notable for a
sodium of 142, potassium 6.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 17,
BUN 37, creatinine 1.7, glucose 146, ALT 24, AST 44, alkaline
phosphatase 720, T. Bilirubin 0.9, amylase 7, lipase 8,
albumin 2.5, ammonia 35.  Her serum tox was negative.  Her
urinalysis was notable for greater than 50 red cells, 21-50
white cells, moderate bacteria, [**2-28**] epis.

Chest film showed low lung volumes.  No pneumonia or CHF.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed multiple hepatic
masses with a common bile duct stent, question of pneumobilia
and cholelithiasis.  She had no cholecystitis, ascites, and
normal flow.

Her head CT was negative.

Her abdominal CT was notable for multiple liver lesions,
pneumobilia, focal linear area of low-density throughout the
midspleen, but no colonic wall thickening, abscess, or free
pelvic fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  The patient was
seen in the ED by the Toxicology Service.  She was given
Narcan in the Emergency Department with an improvement in her
responsiveness.  She was admitted to the ICU for closer
monitoring of her respiratory status.  While there, she was
given Narcan p.r.n. but was soon stable enough for floor
transfer and on the second day of admission was transferred
out to the floor.

Overnight, she developed acute respiratory distress with 02
saturations in the 70s and she became hypotensive and
nonresponsive.  She developed abdominal breathing and the
patient who had already been made DNR/DNI was not able to be
improved with conservative measures.  Her family was called
who agreed to make her CMO.  At 11:15 a.m., the patient died.
This will also serve as her death notice.

2.  With respect to her other medical problems including her
leukocytosis, likely secondary to Clostridium difficile, and
acute renal failure, these became secondary issues once she
developed severe respiratory distress.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Deceased.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

The patient's family agreed to do a postmortem examination to
further investigate her cause of death and underlying disease
process.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
2.  Clostridium difficile infection.
3.  Narcotic reuse.
4.  Likely pulmonary embolus.
