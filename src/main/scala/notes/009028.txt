Echo [**2113-5-12**]
The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and sludge is
present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened with calcified leaflet tips and mild thickening of the
subvalvular apparatus. There is mild mitral annular
calcification. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic
deformity and mild mitral stenosis (MVA 2.4 cm2, mean gradient 7
mmHg at 100 bpm). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild rheumatic mitral stenosis. No significant
mitral regurgitation. Left atrial appendage sludge without
formed thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-9**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of
possible Mitral Valve repair/Replacement. Preoperative workup
consisted of Transthoracic echo, pulmonary function tests, and
Heparin bridge initiated. [**5-13**] she was transferred to CVICU due
to an episode of transient dizziness,respiratory distress and an
acute change in speech which fully resolved. Neurology was
consulted, Heparin continued. Head Ct scan negative for
hemorrhagic or ischemic event. No further episode occurred. Per
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], Ms.[**Known lastname **] is not an operative candidate due to her
multiple comorbidities.  HD# 10 she was cleared for discharge to
rehab. Follow up appointments were advised.
