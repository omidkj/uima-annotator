History of Present Illness:
78 y/o man with PMH significant for COPD, hepattis C, and past
CVA admitted to the MICU on [**8-27**] following an ASA overdose. Pt
initially was brought to BICM from [**Location (un) 15383**] [**Hospital **] Facility following a fall. Per report, pt was found on
the floor after staff heard a "thump". Per second hand reports,
the pt has left the ALF in the past to do "drugs" and reports
that he drank ETOH on the night prior to admission.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt's VS were 97.3  79  126/93
20  96% RA. He denied SOB, tinnitus, and nausea/vomiting. He was
alert but agitated per notes when his baseline is reported to be
alert and oriented x3. In the ED, his ASA level was significant
at 50 mg/dL. He denied recent ASA use but reported that he had
taken it in the past. Rest of her urine and serum tox screen was
negative. Other labs were significant for a serum bicarb of 12
and an anion gap of 19. Urine pH was 6.0 and urine ketones were
positive. ABG was 7.48/19/06 thus consistent with a primary
respiratory alkalosis and primary metabolic alkalosis. Central
access was obtained and the pt was given 1 amp of bicarb then
place on a bicab drip. Pt was then admitted to the MICU for
further care.

cervical spine with loss of intervertebral disc space height at
multiple levels and vaccum disc degeneration. Loss of vertebral
body height and sclerosis seen at C3, C4, and C5. Pt is s/p
laminectomy of C3 through C7. Mild retrolisthesis of C3 on C4
and C4 on C5. Also mild anterolisthesis of C7 on T1. Disc
herniations are seen at C3/4, S4/5, and C5/6. Soft tissues are
unremarkable.
.
CT head ([**8-27**])- No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or edema.
Small-to-moderate amount of periventricular white matter
hypoattenuation consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-shite matter differentioation appears intact throughout.
Opacified right sphenoid sinus with sclerotic sinus wall
indicative of chronic sinusitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o man with PMH significant for COPD, hepattis C, and past
CVA admitted to the MICU on [**8-27**] following an ASA overdose.
.
1. Overdose - The pt was followed by the toxicology and renal
services. Pt was continued on a bicarb drip in the MICU and 5 mg
SQ vitamin K for coagulopathy. Pt's potassium was also
agressively repleated. He did not require hemodialysis. On
[**8-28**], the bicarbonate drip was discontinued per toxicology
recommendations. He was called out to the floor and remained
stable while there.  Psychiatry was consulted and felt that the
overdose was not a suicide attempt and may have been the result
of underlying dementia.  His lytes were followed closely and
repleted prn.
.
2. Altered mental status- The pt is oriented only to himself and
has very poor short term memory at baseline likely secondary to
a strong pmh of alcoholism.  On admission he was acutely
agitated and oriented x0.  However, this cleared well throughout
his admission and he returned to baseline prior to his d/c.
Psychiatry felt that he had underlying dementia and recommended
outpatient monitoring for this condition.  He was originally
maintained on a CIWA scale but this was d/c prior to his d/c.
He also required a sitter early in his admission but this also
was d/c prior to his discharge.
.
3. COPD - His breathing, per pt report, was at baseline on the
floor and no interventions were attempted.
.
4. Gerd - the patient was maintained on protonix during his
admission.
.
5. Fall - The etiology of his fall was either mechanical or
related to his aspirin overdose.  He was evaluated by PT who
recommended that he be d/c to a rehab facility and this was
done.
.
