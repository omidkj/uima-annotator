Imaging:
CXR ([**2205-5-26**]):
1. Lines and tubes are in adequate position.
2. Ill-defined bibasilar opacities, nonspecific, yet may
represent a
component of aspiration.
3. Heart size upper limits of normal without acute pulmonary
edema.
.
[**2205-5-27**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal to mid
inferolateral wall. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE COPD EXACERBATION:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] is a 61 yo female with a history of multiple prior
intubations for COPD.  On arrival to the ED on [**2205-5-26**], she was
febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic and satting only in the
mid-80's on a non-rebreather.  She was in respiratory distress
using accessory muscles and speaking in short sentences.  ABG
showed a respiratory acidosis, and she was intubated in the ED.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar opacities and she was started
empirically on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.  She was also given
solumedrol and nebulizers for a COPD exacerbation.  She was
admitted to the ICU for further care and continued on
levofloxacin for a CAP.  On [**2205-5-27**], her steroids were changed
to prednisone 30 mg QD and she was continued on a taper (she was
discharged on prednisone 10 mg QD).  On [**2205-5-30**] she was
extubated; she required intermittent BIPAP over the following 36
hours for hypercarbia, but was eventually able to be weaned to
2L NC after administration of IV lasix.

GASTRITIS:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] was noted on OG lavage in the ED to have some
coffee-ground return and brown guaiac-positive stool.  She has a
known history of gastritis.  She was continued on a PPI and Hct
remained stable throughout.

CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE, MITRAL REGURGITATION:
An echocardiogram was obtained this admission which showed an EF
of 55% and moderate MR.  She was started diltiazem and
lisinopril for afterload reduction.
