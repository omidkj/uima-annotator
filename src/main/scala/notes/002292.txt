Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
# Bilateral lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
# Tunneled dialysis catheter

History of Present Illness:
70F h/o CRI (Cr 1.7-2.3), uterine cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis,
s/p diverting colostomy c/b GIB, PCM, CAD s/p CABG/PCI,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis [**2-6**] possible psittacosis, admitted
for increased bilateral lower extremity edema.
Pt had been previously admitted 1 month ago for afib management
and was started on quinidine as renal function did not allow for
initiation of dofetilide.  Outpatient furosemide 120mg TID had
been stopped during that admission, then restarted at 120mg
daily.  Weight increased from 219 to 236 pounds, with worsening
leg swelling and dyspnea on exertion.  Outpatient labs revelead
worsened renal function, with last Cr=3.3 four days prior to
this admission.
.
On ROS, pt denied any interval chest pain, although did
experience palpitations with chronic afib, and denied any
infectious symptomatology.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Imaging:
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-9-30**] 10:18 AM
IMPRESSION:
1) Stable, moderate pulmonary edema.
2) Stable cardiomegaly.
.
ECHO [**9-30**]:
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
distal septal and apical akinesis suggested. The inferior wall
is not well seen. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
probably preserved (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
If clinically indicated, a repeat study with contrast (Definity)
may aid in regional LV systolic function determination.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2139-10-6**] 9:01 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No deep venous thrombosis in left common femoral, superficial
femoral, or popliteal veins.
2. 3.4-cm septated fluid collection corresponding to the
palpable abnormality in the left lateral ankle, a finding that
is of uncertain significance but could represent hematoma,
synovial cyst or infectious collection, among other entities.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 11:52 PM
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-30**]
through earlier in the day:
Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion have worsened
today consistent with cardiac decompensation though moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged and there is no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusion. There are no focal abnormalities in the lungs
to suggest pneumonia. Transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2139-10-7**] 1:52 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is little
change. Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with fullness of the pulmonary vessels and a
dual-lead pacemaker device in place. No evidence of acute
pneumonia.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-10-8**] 8:21 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe and lingular pneumonia. Multiple small
peribronchial nodules likely from chronic small airways disease.
Follow up imaging after treatment is recommended to document
resolution and follow up nodules.
2. Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is not possible on this
no
