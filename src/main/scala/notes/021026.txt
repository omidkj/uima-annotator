IMAGING:
[**2116-3-13**] CXR: 1. Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, recommend
further evaluation with CT. 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process
on a background of marked panlobular emphysema related alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency.
3. Stable-appearing MediPort with its tip projecting over the
cavoatrial junction.
.
[**2116-3-13**] CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. No concerning pulmonary nodule seen.
3. Bilateral bronchial wall thickening with distal plugging in
the right lower lobe in the region of similar disease on prior
studies. This may suggest chronic infection/aspiration, but
without gross consolidation.
4. Severe emphysema, with appearances both typical centrilobular
emphysema and some accentuation at the bases consistent with
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency related emphysema. Bibasilar
atelectasis. Bibasilar mild bronchiectasis.
5. Few slightly prominent right hilar lymph nodes; however,
nonspecific, could be reactive.
6. T7 and T9 compression fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo Man with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency, subsequent severe
emphysema on home O2, IDDM, Osteoporosis, and chronic pain on
methadone presenting with 2 weeks of increasing dyspnea and
productive sputum consistent with COPD exacerbation. His course
was complicated by a short MICU stay for better control of
hyperglycemia in the setting of starting oral steroids. He
improved and was discharged with close follow up.
.
# COPD EXACERBATION: Given initial presentation of dyspnea,
worsening hypoxia, increased sputum production and underlying
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency, the patient was started on
Azithromycin, Prednisone, B2 agonists and anticholinergic
nebulizers for suspected COPD exacerbation. He was provided
Guaifenesin for cough and supplemental oxygen to maintain O2
sats above 90%. CXR was negative for focal opacity. CT chest
with angio was obtained in the ED and was negative for pulmonary
embolism or focal consolidation; however, there was bilateral
bronchial wall thickening with distal plugging in the RLL
suggesting chronic infection vs. aspiration. His sputum sample
had heavy growth of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and his antibiotic
regimen was switched to Levaquin. His outpatient [**Month/Day/Year **]
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6174**] at [**Hospital1 112**]) was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with our
management plan. The patient improved symptomatically and
returned to his baseline oxygen requirement of 3L via NC. He was
able to ambulate with only mild dyspnea (baseline) and O2
saturations of 92%. He was discharged with prescriptions for 3
days of Levaquin 750 mg daily (to complete a 5 day course) and 3
days of Prednisone 10 mg daily (to complete a 10 day taper). He
will follow up with both his Primary Care Physician and
[**Name (NI) **] after discharge.
.
# HYPERGLYCEMIA: The patient has a history of Type 1 Diabetes
Mellitus for which he follows with [**Last Name (un) **]. His last Hgb A1c was
12. He reported a recent history of weight loss, likely
secondary to chronic disease and hypercatabolic state in the
setting of poorly-controlled blood glucose levels. Once started
on steroids for his COPD exacerbation his blood glucose levels
became increasingly difficult to control. He required large
amounts of Humalog and very frequent Nursing attention, so was
transferred to the MICU for potential insulin gtt and close
monitoring. He never developed an anion-gap acidosis or symptoms
of DKA. His basal and sliding scale insulin regimen were
adjusted and he was transferred back to the floor. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and provided recommen
