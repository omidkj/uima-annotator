Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
41 yo F with DM1, s/p renal transplant in [**2140**], CAD s/p [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH for DKA.
.
Initially presented to OSH (Southern [**Hospital **] Medical center) with
n/v, altered mental status on [**6-14**] x 2-3 days. Her initial VS
were: T 91.4, BP 82/53, RR 32, O2 sat 95% on RA. Her inital glu
was 1148, AG 36, PH 6.9, bicarb was 4. She was given NS and
started on an insulin gtt and admitted to the ICU. Anion gap at
2PM on day of transfer was 13. Pt arrived with insulin gtt
running. Total amount of fluid she recieved at OSH is unclear.
Pt has history of frequent recurrent DKA episodes with no known
precipitating factors. She states that she stopped taking her
insulin because she was feeling sick from her menses with
diarrhea.
.
Of note, her Creatinine, which runs 0.9- 1.0 at baseline, was
2.1 on admission. Repeat CRT at 2PM on day of transfer was 1.2.

.
She was also initially noted to be in Aflutter and
spontaneuously converted to NSR. Her EKG showed TW-inversions in
lateral leads. Her troponin I was 0.11 on admission and
increased to 12.0. This was felt to be due to demand ischemia by
the OSH ICU team. A cardiology consult was obtained at the OSH
and the pt was started on Lovenox, ASA, Plavix, Integrellin.
.
Recently admitted [**4-25**]/- [**2144-4-26**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation
due to dietary non-complaince. She was ruled our for MI by
enzymes x 3.

There was also moderate 2+ mitral regurg and moderate pulmonary

[**2144-1-1**] that showed reversible defects in the territory
ofthe LAD and left circumflex similar in appearance to a prior

Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old female with type 1 DM, s/p renal transplant
transferred from OSH with DKA, NSTEMI, possible left lingular
PNA.
.
DKA: secondary to pneumonia and dietary/insulin non-compliance.
AG gap closed with IVF and insulin, and presenting symptoms
resolved  [**Last Name (un) **] followed Pt through course.
.
NSTEMI: Pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**5-2**]. TropT 0.72 on admission,
trended down to 0.27. EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] unremarkable.  Continued ASA,
plavix, BB, statin, acei
.
BACK PAIN: MRA failed to show disection. Diminished with
resolving DKA.  Given Morphine Sulfate 2 mg IV Q3-4H:PRN
.
MELENA: in setting of lovenox and integrillin, stopped soon
after admission. Still on aspirin and plavix.  EGD showed
erosion in the fundus, esophageal candidiasis, but otherwise
normal egd to second part of the duodenum
.
NEPHROPATHY: s/p cadaveric renal transplant: Creatinine improved
from admission suggests likely prerenal failure.  Continue
prednisone/sirolimus/tacrolimus + ACEi + bactrim.  Renal
transplant floowed Pt's course.
.
LEUKOCYTOSIS/LEFT LINGULA PNA. R/o infection. Elevated WBCs may
be due to stress-dose steroids started on admission. Blood
cultures negative.  Given levofloxacin to cover for
community-acquired PNA.
.
D/N/V: Patient with gastroparesis. No concerning abdominal exam.
 Given antiemetics prn and reglan standing
