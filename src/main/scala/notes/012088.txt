Brief Hospital Course:
PT admitted the night before surgery. Pt taken to OR on [**12-13**],
and tolerated minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy well, and
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. Extubated on
[**12-14**], stable pulmonary status. Trophic tube feeds were
initiated through his J-tube on post-op day 3. Pt was encouraged
to ambulate, and was moderately compliant with this. Transferred
to the floor on [**12-15**]. A swallow study on post-op day 7 showed
good integrity of the anastomosis, and 2 of his 3 chest tubes
were removed, leaving one on the right. On [**12-20**], it was noted
that his chest tube drainage appeared chylous, and a PICC line
was placed to facilitate TPN, as his enteral tube feeds were
aggravating the leak. On [**12-22**], he was taken back to the
operating room for ligation of his thoracic duct, which
proceeded well (please refer to the operative note of Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for further details of that procedure). The continuing
drainage from the chest tube was noted to be non-chylous. He
began oral intake again on [**12-23**]. His chest tube was removed on
[**12-25**]. Although he was close to goal tube feeds as o this time,
it was difficult to get him to a shorter, nocturnal cycle.
However, he was on bolus tube feeds at home, and his discharge
instructions to [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA include plans to gradually
transition him to nocturnal cycling. He will stay on a liquid
diet until he sees Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in follow up.
