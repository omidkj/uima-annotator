Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p ERCP w/pancreatic stent and sphincterotomy.
.
PTC [**2175-2-6**]

History of Present Illness:
63 year old female who is a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] hospital
for suspected perforation after ERCP. Patient initially
presented
to [**Hospital3 **] hospital on [**1-31**] for a scheduled ERCP with
pancreatic stent placement and sphincterotomy for repeated
episodes of pancreatitis. Procedure was complicated by
persistent
bleeding after the sphincterotomy which treated with epinephrine
and bicapped with a 10 French bicap. Post procedure the patient
was admitted for abdominal pain during which the pain became
more
severe. The pain was described as sharp, constant and diffuse
with no allieviating or exacerbating factors. A CT scan revealed
retroperitoneal gas, likely bleeding perforation related to ERCP
with no demonstration of active leak. The patient was then
placed
on IVF had an NGT placed and was started on IV antibiotics. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and care

ERCP [**2-17**]:
1. A previously placed plastic stent placed in the pancreatic
duct was found in the major papilla
2. There was surrounding edema in the major papilla.
3. Successful removal of the previously placed plastic
pancreatic stent
[**2-1**]: CT Abd(OSH) - retroperitoneal gas due to perforation, no
active leak, [**Year (2 digits) **]
[**2-4**]: CT Abd - Interval decrease in pneumoperitoneum with free
air seen around the porta hepatis, pancreatic head and
retroperitoneum. No peripancreatic fluid collections. Mild
intrahepatic biliary dilatation and CBD dilatation measuring up
to 9 mm in diameter. 1.6 x 1.3cm hypodense lesion in the L
kidney likely angiomyolipoma.
[**2-7**] PTC: Nondilated intrahepatic ducts with contrast passing
freely into the duodenum. No leakage or filling defects were
detected in the ducts. 6.7 French external [**Last Name (un) 12170**] catheter
placed from the R hepatic lobe, w/tip in CBD.
[**2-14**] CT: Interval resolution of free intra-abdominal air. No
fluid collection. Interval placement of PCT internal-external
biliary catheter, with associated [**Month/Day (4) **]. Small b/l pleural
effusions with basilar atelectasis. Hypoenhancement of upper &
interpolar aspects of R kidney, likely from impaired arterial
supply.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care

Neuro: The patient received IV morphine while NPO with good
result for occasional abdominal pain.
CV: The patient was put on metoprolol IV for blood pressure and
heart rate control.  She was closely monitored.  Her acute on
chronic heart failure was closely monitored; please see below.
Pulm: Incentive spirometry and ambulation were encouraged.
GI: The patient was made NPO on admission with an NGT.
She was stable and comfortable. On the morning of HD 3, she was
having increased abdominal pain, but did not look septic or have
peritoneal signs.
A CT was performed and showed b/l pleural effusions, perihepatic
edema, intrahepatic biliary dilatation, gastric dilatation, no
collections or free fluid in abdomen, no [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] free
fluid in pelvis, decreased retroperitoneal free air.
The NGT was removed on HD 3; following removal, the patient had
intermittent nose bleeds for which she received AFrin with good
result.  That evening, the patient had one bout of emesis of
about 200cc clotted blood.  The patient had complained of
continued nausea and epigastric pain at that time, and a
hematocrit and cardiac enzymes were monitored, which at that
time were stable.  The following day, Saturday [**2-5**], the
patient continued to have episodes of hematemesis; and NGT was
placed, and the patient required multiple (~4 u prbcs, and FFP)
transfusions for a GI hemorrhage.  The patient was transferred
to the ICU for constant monitoring and serial hematocrits.  The
patient's hematocrit stabilized by [**2-7**].  Throughout this
episode, however, the patient's total bilirubin rose to 8.8,
with an elevated direct bilirubin as well (4.3).  On [**2-7**], GI
was consulted for a possible ERCP, however they felt that this
was not the best option as the patient would have significant
edema and probable clot present.  Instead, the patient was taken
for a PTC; for details please see report.    As the patient
would be NPO for an indeterminant period of time, the patient
was started on TPN, and her electrolytes were routinely
monitored.
On [**2-9**], the patient's NGT was removed, and the patient's diet
was advanced to sips.  When appropriate, the patient's diet was
advanced, and her TPN was tapered down to nothing; she tolerated
the diet well.
The PTC drain was capped, but she did not tolerate this as she
had a rise in her LFT's, Tbili, Amylase and Lipase.
The drain was uncapped and she was doing well. Please replace
drain output 1/2cc/cc with LR.

GU: She received IVF when appropriate, and her urine output was
routinely recorded. When the patient appeared to be fluid
overloaded, with pulmonary congestion and shortness of breath,
she received Lasix, and was eventually transitioned to her home
Lasix dose which she had not been receiving throughout her
hospitalization.
Endo: The patient was put on an insulin sliding scale
Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed routinely, and she
was transfused when appropriate.
ID: The patient was continued on IV antibiotics for 10 days.
Proph: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on subcutaneous heparin with
pneumoboots throughout her stay.

On discharge, the patient was doing well, vita
