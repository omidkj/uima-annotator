History of Present Illness:
This is a female patient with a h/o hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, CAD s/p CABG and end stage renal

her calves which has progressively worsened. She reports the
left hurts before the right and occurs after about thirty feet.

She does not experience rest pain and denies foot/leg
ulcerations.
Doppler studies done [**2137-6-19**] demonstrated monophasic waveforms
in
the entire right lower extremity suggesting severe femoral
artery
stenosis and/or occlusion. ABI??????s could not be calculated. The
left lower extremity demonstrate biphasic waveforms in the
femoral artery. The SFA, popliteal, PT and DP tracings were all

monophasic suggesting severe stenosis and/or occlusion involving

the left femoral artery. ABI??????s could not be calculated on the
left either.
She underwent CT of the abdomen and lower extremities on [**2137-6-27**]

revealing severe stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery.
Also reported was marked diffuse atherosclerotic disease
involving the iliac arteries and abdominal aorta. In addition
she was found to have focal severe stenoses in the distal
superficial femoral arteries of both legs with single vessel
runoff via the peroneal arteries to both lower legs.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU post-peripheral vascular
angiography with stenting to receive hemodialyis secondary to
her ESRD and the administration of a contrast load during
nagiography. She had dialysis on the night of admission without
incident, with the removal of 2L ultrafiltrate. She had
bilateral arterial sheaths in place which were removed by the
interventional fellow. She had no bruits and had dopplerable
distal pulses bialterally. She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who
cleared her for discahrge. She was discharged with follow up.
