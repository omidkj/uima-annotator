.
Cath. [**2145-10-20**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main was without
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The left
anterior
descending artery had no angiographic evidence of coronary
artery disease in the proximal portion. There was a 40% stenosis
in the mid-LAD. The distal LAD was without evidence of coronary
artery disease. The left circumflex artery had no angiograpic
evidence of CAD in the proximal, mid and distal segments.  The
right coronary artery had a 70% proximal stenosis and a 90%
mid-vessel stenosis.
2. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided
filling pressures.
3. Successful PCI of the proximal and mid RCA with two 3.0 x 13
mm Cypher DES, post-dilated with a 3.25 mm balloon.
.
Echo
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion  is normal (No obvious wall motion
abnormality is seen.)
3. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is mild  aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral  regurgitation is seen.

CXR [**2145-10-22**]: Right lung cleared and perihilar interstitial
abnormality in the left lung, which could represent either
persistent edema or interstitial pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 year old female with htn, hyperlip s/p IMI and on
cath stents to RCA placed was noted to be in rapid afib on the
floor post cath.
.
## Cardiovascular -
# ischemia - Pt with RCA disease now s/p DES, pt was started on
integrillin for 18 hours however this was stopped after pt was
noted to have some bleeding from the gums.  She was started on
ASA/Plavix/Statin/BB. BB were held as they worsened pt's
breathing.  Low dose BB and ACEi can be started by PCP after
discharge if BP tolerates it. Home on statin/plavix/asa/NTG SL.
.
# pump - On initial exam pt was hypotensive and was given fluid
boluses to maintain MAP>60.  Echo shows EF 55%. Patient sent
home lasix 20mg po qd given 2+ lower extremity edema on exam and
daily goal of 0.5-1L negative.
.
# rhythm - Given a. fib with RVR and hypotension pt was
transferred to CCU, pt received 2 shocks at 300J which were
unsuccessful in maintaing sinus rhythm.  Later converted on own
to sinus.  The following day after albuterol neb, reverted to AF
with RVR but with stable BP.  Metoprolol without effect, Dilt
drip initiated and then pt spont converted to sinus again after
1 hour.  She stayed in sinus rhythm for 24 hours.  However on
tele she was noted to have some episodes of a.fib/flutter, most
of these were short and pt spontaneously converted back to sinus
rhythm.  She was started on warfarin for anticogulation.  Also
started on amiodarone 400MG TID.  Goal 400 mg tid X 3 days, 400
mg [**Hospital1 **] X 7 days, 400 once a day X 2 wks, 200mg therafter.  Given
on/off a. fib pt was also started on diltiazem XR for rate
control. On day of discharge, INR 1.1 so warfarin increased to
7.5mg qhs with planned INR/PT check [**10-27**] PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) 702**]
results.
.
## bleeding gums - likely secondary to integrillin which was
discontinued and pt had no further episodes of this.
.
## asthma - fluticasone and atrovent nebs.  Would  avoid
albuterol to prevent further tachycardia.  Pt was also noted to
have interstitial pattern on cxr and completed Azithromycin x 5
days for likely interstitial pna. Home on oxygen 2L nasal
cannula.
.
## HTN - Intially started on BB, however given worsening
wheezing and asthma BB was discontinued and can be reconsidered
as outpt.  Should also start ACEI as tolerated.

asa, zestril, hctz, albuterol.
