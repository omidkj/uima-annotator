Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Cardiac catheterization with Bare Metal Stent placement to LAD
2.Intubation for respiratory distress associated with acute
pulmonary edema
3.Right IJ line placement for central venous access


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 61 year-old man with a PMH significant for HTN
who presented to the ED on [**2108-10-18**] at 3AM complaining of
progressively worse chest and abdominal pain for >1 day.  He was
unable to give a complete history as he was in extreme pain and
discomfort. He described having increased sensation of pressure
on his sternum and he also had shortness of breath which was
worse when sitting vs. standing.
.
In the ED Mr. [**Known lastname 11013**] initial vital signs were BP of
150-190/100-136, HR ranged 120-140, and RR=19-25.  IV
nitroglycerin was started and the patient was ruled out for an
aortic dissection with a CT torso.  The patient was in
respiratory distress for presumed acute pulmonary edema as
evidenced on CT. He was intubated for airway protection. An EKG
showed rate 109, NSR, with a left axis deviation and ST
elevations in V3 and V5. CK cardiac enzymes were flat.  He
received ASA, eptifibitide drip, clopidogrel load of 600 mg, a
heparin bolus and a code STEMI was called.
.
He was transferred emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab
where he was found to have an occluded LAD distal to D1, into
which a BMS was placed. He recieved 40mg of IV furosemide and
started bicarbonate IVF at 125cc/hr.
On CCU admission the team was unable to take a full ROS as the
patient was intubated and sedated, however, the patient's last
discharge summary indicated recent complaints of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and chronic lower back pain.
.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**2108-10-18**]):
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
normal. The LAD was occluded after D1 with collaterals from the
RCA. The LCX and RCA had minimal disease. Successful PTCA,
thrombectomy and stenting of the proximal LAD (distal to the
first diagonal) with a Driver (3x30mm) bare metal stent
postdilated with a 3.0mm balloon.  Final angiography
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See
PTCA comments).
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a
6F Mynx closure device. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
systemic arterial hypertension with BP 152/106.  Primary PCI was
delayed due to the patient requiring emergent intubation in the
emergency department for acute pulmonary edema. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
 One vessel coronary artery disease.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction managed by acute PTCA,
thrombectomy and stenting of the proximal left anterior
descending artery with a bare metal stent. Primary PCI delayed
due to emergent intubation for acute pulmonary edema. Successful
closure of the right femoral arteritomy site with a 6F Mynx
closure device.

CTA CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2108-10-18**]):
CTA OF THE CHEST: No acute aortic pathology including no
dissection. No filling defect in the main pulmonary arteries to
suggest embolism. Nonenhancing region in the anteroapical
portion of the left ventricle is compatible with infarction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pericardial effusion.
Both lungs demonstrate diffuse thickening of interstitial
marking and consolidative changes compatible with moderate
pulmonary edema, which in some region al
