Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 female with h/o atrial fibrillation (on coumadin),
aortic stenosis (mod/severe), cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40-50%), DM2,
who presents from rehab hospital with several days of increasing
shortness of breath.  She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
after a prolonged stay for a right psoas phlegmon s/p CT guided
drainage.  She was discharged 7 days PTA, and reports initially
feeling well upon discharge.  Beginning two days after arriving
at rehab she began to get worsening lower back pain (same pain
from abscess drain), that would cause her "BP to rise and HR to
rise" and subsequently would get SOB.  She then began PT and was
doing well.
.
On Sunday (3 days PTA) she became significantly more SOB, and
her family describes her as clamy.  She had increasing orthopnea
at this point, with worsening peripheral edema and wt gain.  She
[Of note, she had been maintained on lasix during her last
hospitalization, but lasix was not continued as a standing order
on discharge as she was felt to be euvolemic.]  The following
day she was given 20 mg lasix twice, and had a CXR done.  She
continued to gain weight and feel increasingly SOB, feeling as
if "there was no more breath left."  On the day of admission,
be hospitalized.
.
She has not had any chest pain, cough, fever, chills HA,
diarrhea, consitpation, urinary symptoms.  She things her urine
output was less at the rehab.  She describes intermittent clamy
feelings when getting SOB.  She has had no appetite and
decreased PO intake.
.
ROS: as above
.
ED COURSE: She was triaged with a requirement of 5L NC to
maintain sats in mid 90s; she was afebrile, normotensive.  She
was found to be in AF with RVR (to 150s - 160s).  She was given
40mg IV lasix, and then subsequently given 80mg IV lasix, to
which she put out ~1L.  She was given dilt 5mg IV x 3, and
subsequently dilt 15mg IV x 1, with only modest effect on her
HR.  A CXR showed worsening CHF with pulm edema and a left
pleural effusion.  Her ECG showed AF at 115, no acute changes
from prior.  She was also given one dose of IV levaquin for
presumed respiratory coverage.

STUDIES:
.
Chest CT:
This non-contrast-enhanced study demonstrates interval increase
in size of bilateral pleural effusions, left slightly greater
than right which are moderate in size. Mild basilar atelectasis.
They are no pathologically enlarged nodes within the
mediastinum, axillae, hila. Stable cardiomegaly. Coronary
calcifications. No pericardial effusion. Ground-glass opacities
again noted bilaterally, appear more prominent with associated
septal thickening, likely presenting pulmonary edema. Again
noted are few scattered nodules, less than 5 mm bilaterally.
Previously seen lesion in right psoas not clearly visualized on
this study. Probable dropped gallstone in hepatorenal recess. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Osseous structures are stable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in size of bilateral moderate pleural
effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Interval worsening of bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity,
likely representing pulmonary edema. No definite evidence of
emphysematous change.
3. Bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules, unchanged. Recommend follow
up to ensure stability.
.
MRI L-spine:
FINDINGS: Again scoliosis of lumbar spine is seen. At T12-L1,
increased signal is seen within the disc with some enhancement
indicative of discitis. There is abnormal signal seen in the
adjacent endplates indicative of marrow edema. Again paraspinal
soft tissue abnormalities with fluid collection are seen
indicative of abscess. Compared to the prior study, the
paraspinal fluid collections have slightly decreased. The
persistent signal changes and slight
enhancement within the disc could be secondary to evolution of
inflammatory change within the disc and [**Known firstname **] not necessarily
indicate worsening of discitis. Further followup is therefore
essential. There is no evidence of new inflammatory changes seen
within the spinal canal.
Increased signal is seen within the L1-2 and L2-3 discs on the
inversion recovery images which was not identified on the
previous study. There is no enhancement seen in this region.
This finding [**Known firstname **] be secondary to technical differences or due to
fluid within the disc from increased motion. Further followup is
recommended to exclude inflammation at this level. Mild
degenerative changes and bulging from L3-4 to L5-S1 level are
again noted.
The distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. No
evidence of compression of the distal cord is seen.
IMPRESSION: 1. Changes of discitis and osteomyelitis at T12-L1
level are noted with slightly increased endplate signal changes
and subtle enhancement within the disc. This could represent
evolution of inflammatory changes from discitis. No new soft
tissue abnormalities are seen to suggest worsening of the
inflammatory changes. 2. The paraspinal fluid collections are
still noted indicating abscesses which are decreased in size
from the previous study.
3. Increased signal is seen within the L1-2 and L2-3 discs which
is a new finding since the previous study and it could indicate
fluid within the discs or early inflammatory changes. Followup
is recommended.
