LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly
dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:  PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the
inferior septal wall from the mid-papillary to apical area..
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. There is mild (1+)Aoritc Regurgitation
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS:
1.Preserved biventricular function. LVEF 50-55%.
2. Mitral regurgitatioin is now mild to moderate without
structural defect of the valve
3. Aortic Regrugitation remains mild
4. Aortic contours remain intact
5. Remaining exam is unchanged
6. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.



Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**11-4**] where he underwent a
CABG x 3. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition. He was kept intubated overnight due to a difficult
intubation and was extubated on POD #1. He was transferred to
the floor on POD #2. His pacing wires were removed, he was
started on diuresis, and progressed slowly from a PT standpoint
due to depression & anxiety.  He had some tachypnea w/wheezes
and sputum production.  He was empirically started on
ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia.  His x-ray revealed right
upper lobe opacity, but despite 3 attempts, it was not posiblt
to abtain an appropriate sputum specimen for culture.  He
improved clinically on the Ceftriaxone, so he will be discharged
on PO Bactrim for another week of treatment for presumed
pneumonia.  On [**11-11**], the patient was seen by the psychiatry
service at the request of the pateint's wife.  They recommended
Zoloft, with low dose Ativan prn.  A TSH was sent and was 1.1.
He has remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready for
discharge home with visiting nurses on POD12.
