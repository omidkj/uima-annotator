HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old male
with history of gastritis with one prior episode of melena a
few years ago which was not worked up and a history of
alcohol abuse transferred from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] to [**Hospital6 1760**] Medical Intensive Care Unit
with diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed status post four
units of packed red blood cells.  Patient received an
additional one unit of packed red blood cells at [**Hospital1 18**].

Patient was diagnosed with a Dieulafoy's lesion in [**Male First Name (un) 36290**].  EGD here on [**2107-1-23**] revealed a short segment of
Barrett's esophagus, erythema, and friability of the body of
stomach and duodenum and angiectasia of the body of the
stomach treated with thermal therapy in addition to the
second part of the duodenum, which was also treated with
thermal therapy.

On presentation patient was vomiting blood and nearly passed
out.  He states that he has not been feeling good and has
been extremely tired for the past couple months.  He is
unsure if he has had black stools in the past.  He denies
history of peptic ulcer disease or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs use, positive increased stress
secondary to losing his wife less than a year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.3, heart rate 66, blood
pressure 144/78, respiratory rate of 20, satting 95% on room
air.  In general, he is in no apparent distress.  HEENT:
Sclerae anicteric; pupils equally reactive to light and
accommodation; extraocular movements intact; oropharynx is
clear except for break down in lesion noted on the buccal
mucosa.  Neck:  No lymphadenopathy or jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary:  Diffuse inspiratory wheeze; no
rhonchi or rales.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular irregular; no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen:  Normoactive
bowel sounds; soft but appears distended; nontender; no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema except the left fingers appear cyanotic distal to the
left wrist cast but are warm to touch.  Neuro:  Alert,
oriented times three; cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  Admission hematocrit 29.2,
INR 1.2, ALT 80, AST 97.  Blood cultures no growth.  Troponin
T 0.16, 0.10, 0.05, CK-MB ranged from 2 to 6.  TSH 1.2,
sodium 129, serum osmolality 263, urine osmolality 570, urine
sodium 30.

EKG:  Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 77 beats per minute;
no ST elevation or T-wave inversion.

Chest x-ray:  Stable cardiomegaly; no failure or infiltrate.

Urinalysis:  Negative nitrate, leukocyte esterase, 3 to 5
white blood cells, 0 white blood cells, no bacteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 78-year-old male with history
of gastritis with gastrointestinal bleed in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**]
status post a total of five units packed red blood cells with
EGD here showing two angiectasias treated with thermal
therapy, also with stomach and duodenal erosion.  Hematocrit
stable but slowly trending down.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  Patient status post one unit
packed red blood cells during his stay in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Patient bumped appropriately to this
transfusion; however, his hematocrit again decreased the
following day.  Patient was continued on a q. day proton pump
inhibitor.  His hematocrit remained stable on the floor;
however, he continued to have black bowel movements, and this
was followed for an additional 24 hours.  His hematocrit
remained stable for a total of 48 hours.  He was thus
discharged with plan for follow-up EGD in six weeks.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Patient noted to have troponin leak in
the context of a significant gastrointestinal bleed.  This
was likely thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in the
context of a decreased hematocrit requiring increased cardiac
output.  No ischemic changes were noted on EKG, and patient
ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.

Patient was continued on restarted beta blocker.  Initiated
this at admission.  No indication for angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor.  Patient did not receive daily aspirin
secondary to the context of a gastrointestinal bleed.
Patient instructed to seek outpatient follow up for lipid
panel and further management of his cardiac health.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient unaware
of diagnosis.  He was managed with Albuterol p.r.n. wheezing.
He maintained his oxygen saturation on room air with little
intervention.

4.  History of alcohol abuse:  Patient maintained on the CIWI
Scale; however, no evidence of tremulousness, anxiety,
diaphoresis, or palpitations.  Repeated reinforcement was
given for absence of alcohol in the context of a
gastrointestinal bleed as this will increase his risk for
occurrence.  Patient was maintained on thiamine and folate.

5.  Hyponatremia:  Patient noted to have hyponatremia.  Urine
and serum osmolality in addition to urine sodium consistent
with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone possibly
secondary to pulmonary disease versus stress.  Patient was
maintained on a 1.5 liter fluid restriction.  His sodium
remained stable.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  TSH was noted to be within normal
limits.  Patient's risk factors for atrial fibrillation
include COPD and alcohol use.  No anticoagulation was
initiated secondary to his gastrointestinal bleed.

7.  Persistent low-grade fever with bandemia:  Concern for
pneumonia considering patient developed an oxygen
requirement.  A PA and lateral chest x-ray was obtained.  No
infiltrate was noted.  Likely, his fevers are secondary to
atelectasis.  Patient was discharged without instructions or
prescription for antibiotics.  Urinalysis and blood cultures
were negative this admission.

8.  Smoking cessation:  Patient counseled regarding the
importance of smoking cessation in the context of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  He was started on Bupropion for aid
with his attempt to quit tobacco.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good; hematocrit stable for past 48
hours; satting well on room air; sodium stable.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to home with services.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Multivitamin one q.d.
4.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Albuterol one to two puffs inhaled q. 6 hours p.r.n.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Atrovent two puffs q.i.d.
9.  Bupropion 150 mg p.o. q. a.m.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Patient is to follow up with his primary care provider,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within one week to check his blood count and
sodium and for further management of COPD and aid with
quitting alcohol and tobacco in addition to restarting his
Coumadin.
2.  Patient is to follow up for repeat EGD [**2107-3-14**].
