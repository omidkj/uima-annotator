History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Location (un) 101272**] is a 54 year old female with a history of
hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, htn, and a recent episode of
bronchitis treated with a Z-pack until [**1-21**], who presents with
c/o dizziness. The pt was at her baseline at 9AM on [**1-24**] when
she became lightheaded at rest and presyncopal when she stood.
The symptoms did not resolve with PO fluids, so the pt went to
[**Company 191**]. She had a syncopal episode after standing up in the [**Company 191**]
waiting room. She was arousable but diaphoretic. BP 80/palp, HR
40's. On moniotr, HR sinus brady. FSBG prior to fluids was 143.
O2 sat 98% on RA. Of note, her verapamil was recently restarted
for elevated BPs at home and she began taking a large amount of
the herbal supplement [**Company **].
.
In the ED, she was hypotensive to SBP in 60s and HR in 40s. She
received 0.5 mg of atropine x 2 without significant effect.
Peripheral dopamine was started with a modest increase in SBP to
70s. A RIJ cordis was placed in case pacing was needed. She
received 5 mg of glucagon with HR increase from 40s to 70s. She
was eventually intubated for airway protection. Dopamine was
maxed out and levophed was started. She also received 1 gram of
ceftriaxone and 10 mg of dexamethasone as well as 3L NS. ABG
7.31/42/178. Lactate 0.9. Serum and urine tox screens were
negative. CT head was unremarkable with the exception of tiny
locule of air overlying R temporal region. CXR without airspace
consolidation. CTA showed no PE or dissection but did show
diffuse bowel wall edema, periportal edema, ascites, gallbladder
wall edema, and mildly edematous pancreas. Toxicology was
consulted who was concerned about CCB toxicity given precipitous
decline and refractory response to dopamine.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient has been weaned off of his
levophed and is maintaing SBPs in 110s to 120s and rhythm was
sinus brady in 50s which normalized. CCBs were held; ASA was
continued; nadolol was continued for variceal protection.
Electrophysiology was consulted. They thought the episode was
likely vagal with dehydration with ?flu, URI. Not likely med
overdose. The pt's sedation was weaned and was extubated without
incident. Her urine output normalized. She continued to have a
productive cough and was placed on droplet precautions and a DFA
was sent.

=====
- [**1-24**] CTA torso: 1. No PE or thoracic aortic dissection. 2.
Tip of the ET tube terminates in the right main stem bronchus.
3. Periportal edema, diffuse bowel wall thickening, and small
amount of ascites which may relate to increased permeabilitiy of
vessels and/or hypoalbuminemia in the face of aggressive
resuscitation. The IVC is normal in caliber. 4. Mildly edematous
appearance of the pancreas, which may be related to fluid
status, however correlation with labs is recommended to exclude
pancreatitis. 5. Distended gallbladder with wall edema, which
may relate to liver dysfunction and overhydrated fluid status.
Cholecystitis is not entirely excluded but considered less
likely. Correlation with physical exam and history is
recommended. 6. Area of low attenuation in the expected region
of the thyroid bed, incompletely imaged, which may represent
fluid or goiter. Correlate with physical exam. 7. Nodular
contour of the liver and atrophy of the left lobe, which is
compatible with cirrhosis.
.
- [**1-24**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
- [**1-25**] CXR: The patient was extubated in the meantime interval
with removal of the NG tube. There is interval improvement in
the degree of pulmonary edema which is currently still present,
mild. Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
.
- [**1-28**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no left ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2152-5-1**], the findings are similar (mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy was also present on review of the
prior study with 12mm walls).


Brief Hospital Course:

htn, who presents with hypotension, bradycardia, and
hypothermia. She was intubated and placed on pressors for shock
of unknown origin. She made a rapid recovery and was extubated
