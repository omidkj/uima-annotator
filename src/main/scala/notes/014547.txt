Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Celebrex / Naprosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88 y/o F with PMHx significant for NSTEMI
([**9-/2139**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD (on home O2), and
tobacco abuse, admitted on to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2141-2-27**] with sudden
onset of severe SSCP radiating down left arm. Of note, the
patient is a poor historian, which was exacerbated by the
benzodiazepines that she received in the cath lab. Most of the
history was obtained from records from [**Hospital3 **]. The patient
initially presented to the ED at [**Hospital3 417**] last night with
SSCP radiating down her left arm. She was found by EMS to have
chest pain, SOB and EKG changes with "st-elevations". She
received 3 SL NTG and was brought to the ED. In the ED there,
she was treated with morphine, fentanyl, albuterol, bilaudid,
tordal, and xanax. She was thought to not be having a STEMI and
was managed medically with heparin, aspirin and a plavix load.
Overnight, her troponins were noted to become positive
(0.2->5.39); it was also felt that she had ECG changes
consisting of ST elevations and TWI in V3 through V6. At first,
she declined cardiac cath; however, she later became agreeable
to the procedure and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for the procedure.
Vitals prior to transfer were afebrile, HR 60's-80 SR, 20,
104-120/50's, 3 liters with sats 98.
.
She could not lie flat for a catherization and on exam in the
holding area was in acute distress, anxious and gasping for air
with BP 119-140/82-90, HR in 70-80, RR 25 and SpO2 100 on 2.5L.
Ultimately she calmed down and had less laboured breaths in an
upright seated position. She was given nebs, lasix (60 mg IV),
valium, and nitropaste. She was then admitted to the CCU for
optimization of the respiratory status overnight with plans to
cath her in the morning.
.
Of note, the patient had similar symptoms in 10/[**2138**]. At that
time, she presented to [**Hospital3 **] and was found to be having an
NSTEMI. She refused cardiac catheterization and was treated
medically. Since that time, her functional status has declined
steadily such that she rarely leaves the house and has 3 step
DOE. Recently, she stopped several of her medications (plavix,
imdur, and her beta blocker). She is currently on only Norvasc,
Hyzaar, and aspirin.
.
The patient's lab work at [**Hospital3 **] was significant for the
following cardiac ezymes:
[**2-27**] at 2235--> CK 76 (3.4MB) and Trop 0.02
[**2-28**] at 0420--> CK 177/26.7 and Trop 5.4
[**2-28**] at 0953 --> CK 183/25.1 and trop 3.5

CXR ([**2141-2-28**]) - FINDINGS: No previous images. There is
hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
disease. No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or
pleural effusion.
Of incidental note is apparent dense calcification in the
descending aorta.
.
[**2141-3-1**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with near akinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle. A
left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Akinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle.
This could be due to stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) or
multi-vessel CAD or focal myocarditis. No significant valvular
abnormality.
.
[**2141-3-2**] Catherization:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated biventricular filling pressures.
3. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 F with Hx of NSTEMI, dyslipidemia, HTN here with dyspnea and
chest pain [**1-24**] NSTEMI and possible CHF.
.
# Dysnpea: Likely multifactorial. Pt has a known history of COPD
with a significant smoking history. Also, catherization showed
elevated filling pressures and echo showed inferior hypokinesis.
The patient was agressively diuresed and given standing
nebulizer treatments and her breathing improved to baseline.
Patient was offered nicotine patch, but she refused. On
discharge she was on RA when stationary needing supplemental O2
for ambulation. She was told to resume home nebulizer/inhaler
regimen.
.
# CORONARIES / NSTEMI: Pt with a history of known NSTEMI in
[**9-29**], at which time she refused cardiac catheterization.
Catherization showed left circumflex lesion but no stent was
placed. The patient was medically managed with aspirin, plavix,
statin, and beta-blocker.
.
# PUMP: Likely chronic systolic CHF w/ EF of 40% and inferior
hypokinesis. Takotsubo was considered in the differential but
mos likely [**1-24**] significant h/o CAD and prior ischemia. Patient
will be discharged on Hyzaar and spironolactone. VNA will follow
up and labs will be faxed to her PCP.
.
# RHYTHM: sinus rhythm
.
# Hypertension: Patient was managed with home Hyzaar and
beta-blocker.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Continue simvastatin.
.
# Osteoarthritis: No acute issues.
.
# Neuropathy: No acute issues.
.
# Delirium: Patient had 2 episodes of delirium in late
evening/early AM this hospitalization. Patient has been using
benzodiazepines at home and complained of anxiety while
hospitalized so was written for home benzo (alprazolam) prn.
This was likely precipitant and patient's delirium quickly
resolved when off all benzos. Told to stop home [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 50690**]
