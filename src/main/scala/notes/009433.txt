Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-7-10**] - Mitral valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical),
Tricuspid valve repair with MC3 annuloplasty system, atrial
septal defect closure.


History of Present Illness:
58 year old woman with severe mitral stenosis and underwent a
mitral valvuloplasty at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2197-7-7**]. Valve area increased
from 1 to 1.7cm2 and the procedure was complicated by a
formation of a secundum ASD. She also has moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation with moderate PA systolic hypertension.
She reports dyspnea with exertion for the past 6 months,
occuring after walking for about 10 minutes or climbing 1 flight
of stairs. She does report leg fatigue when she walks for any
extended period of time.  She now presents for admission for
heparin bridge to surgery.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2199-7-10**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is dilated. An
atrial septal defect (0.6 cm) is present. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe valvular mitral
stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: A well-seated valve prosthesis is seen in the
mitral position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean
gradient =3 mmHg). Trivial (normal for prosthesis) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The atrial septum appears intact with no
residual interatrial flow by Doppler. Tricuspid Valve Ring in
place with improvement of regurgitation (mild-moderate).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-7-9**] for intravenous
heparin in preparation for her cardiac surgery.  [**2199-7-10**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she underwent a
mitral valve replacement(#[**Street Address(2) 11599**].[**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical), a tricuspid
valve repair(#28mm [**Doctor Last Name **] MC3 annuloplasty ring) and closure of
an atrial septal defect.Cross clamp time= 78 minutes.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time=100 minutes. Please see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **]
operative note for further details. Postoperatively she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. She awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty. All
lines and drains were removed in a timely fashion. She continued
to progress and was transferred to the stepdown unit.
Betablocker and diuresis was initiated. On POD#2 her temporary
pacing wires were removed and IV heparin and coumadin were
initiated for her mechcanical mitral valve.The remainder of her
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. She progressed
well with physical therapy and was cleared for discharge by
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on POD#6. All follow up appointments were advised.
Coumadin dosing/INR draws will be followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
