Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo with ESLD, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy,
and hypotension transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for Liver Transplant.

1. ESLD: Hepatology consulted while patient at [**Hospital1 18**], however on
transplant list at [**Hospital1 **]. Underlying etiology likely [**2-22**] alcohol
and hepatitis C.  Patient maintained on low sodium, low salt
diet w/ lactulose.  Abdominal US showed moderate ascites but not
enough for a diagnostic tap.  No ursodiol at this time as per
the liver team.  Pt to be transferred back to [**Hospital1 498**] for possible
transplant in the future.

2. Hypotension - unclear cause.  Pt was cardioverted out of
flutter into NSR with improvement in HR but no real improvement
in SBP.  Pt also with TTE showing EF=25% and 4+ MR which is
likely contributing.  [**Name (NI) 24995**] pt is afebrile, he has an
increasing WBC, could be septic (SBP vs other source).  Pt
started on empiric vanco/ceftaz/fluconazole.  Swan was inserted
early in patient's ICU course, revealing increased right-sided
filling pressures with a PCWP=12.  CO/CI were calculated both by
Fick and thermodilution; by thermodilution, CO's were 3-4 L/min
(inaccurate given MR); by Fick, CO was 8L/min (but obscured by
septic state). Pt required pressors for bp support.  Pt also on
steroids initially, but these were stopped after cosyntropin
stimulation test showed an appropriated bump.  Hypotension is
likely a combination of systolic dysfunction, tachycardia
(decreased diastolic filling) and possible septic physiology.
Currently patient is on levophed 0.119 mcg/kg/min w/ MAP of 58.


3.  ?Infection/pna- although there was no clear source of
infection, pt did have possible LLL pneumonia on chest X-ray and
CT and grew sparse pseudomonas from sputum.  Pt started on
antibiotics, 14-day course: Vancomycin (started [**10-30**], stopped
[**11-9**]), Ceftazidime (started [**11-1**], d/c [**11-7**]).  Pt also was C.
difficile positive and was started on Flagyl (started [**10-30**],
continue for 7 days after discontinuation of other antibiotics).
 Pt remained afebrile with no leukocytosis.  Vancomycin and
Meropenem were restarted after pt had an episode of hypotension
[**11-9**].  Vanco should be continued until [**11-13**], Meropenem should
be continued for an [**8-31**] day course for possible vent-associated
pna.

4. Tachycardia: likely a.flutter; pt was initially cardioverted
into NSR, digoxin started.  Pt then reverted back into flutter
with rate in 130's.  Pt spontaneously converts between NSR,
afib, and sinus tach with HR 80-90's throughout the hospital
course.  Episodes of tachycardia have been treated w/ metoprolol
5 mg IV prn and with conversion of CVVHD to run patient
euvolemic vs taking fluid off.

5. ARF: hepatorenal, vs pre-renal, vs ATN from hypotension.  Pt
was on CVVH, and renal is following, dialyzing as necessary.  US
of kidneys was wnl, meds being renally dosed.  Pt continued on
CVVH throughout hospitalization. UOP over last 24 hours = 20 cc.

6. Coagulopathy - likely [**2-22**] poor synth fxn, s/p vit K.  No
evidence of DIC by labs.  Patient has had intermittent episodes
of coffee ground output from the NGT w/ stable hemodynamics.
This was managed w/ FFP and is no longer an issue. No active
bleeding at this time.  Pt is s/p EGD that was within normal
limits/did not show any varices, active source of bleeding.

7. thrombocytopenia - [**2-22**] cirrhosis, transfusing <40

8. anemia - macorcytic c/w liver dz
-check iron studies; c/w some component of anemia of chronic
disease.  Pt was transfused throughout hospitalization for
Hct<26.

9. MS change - [**2-22**] hepatic encephalopathy/uremia/sepsis.  It was
unclear what his baseline mental status is, and this will need
to be assessed when he is less sedated, not septic.

10. FEN - TFs via Dobhoff were continued in-house (Deliver 2.0
at 40 cc/hr plus 45g Promod)

11. proph - aspiration precautions, head of bed up, pneumoboots,
lactulose

12. Access R IJ HD line ([**10-29**]), L radial A-line, changed over
wire ([**11-2**])
