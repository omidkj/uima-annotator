Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with 3VD CAD s/p MI in [**2156**], POBA LCX, CHF with EF
25% with worsening RV function, dyslipidemia, HTN, rheumatic
heart disease, AV stenosis s/p valvuloplasty x2 with recent CHF
exacerbation c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Patient had been doing well at rehab.
Bumex was restarted [**12-12**]. Last night developed SOB and was sent
to [**Hospital **] Hosp ER where they felt she was hypovolemic and
treated with 2L IVF and sent her back to [**Location (un) **]. This am, the
patient experienced worsening SOB. She was treated with
Morphine, Bumex 1mg x 2, and [**2-2**] of a 1/150 SL nitro x 2 b/c pt
c/o chest tightness. After taking nitro the pt's BP dropped to
90/s the later returned to baseline 100s. At time of transfer
her O2 sat was 94% on 2Lnc but will dip down to 88% with talking
or sips of water.
.
On the floor the patient was complaining of dry mouth and thirst
and drinking water. She denied SOB, chest pain, or any other
discomfort. She denies cough, fever, chills. However, she stated
she had had some delirium at the rehab due to double dose of
morphine but was unclear about the exact events. She is aware
that she is at [**Hospital1 **].
.
The patient has severe aortic stenosis with low output (EF =
25%), and she underwent a valvuloplasty in [**Month (only) 216**]. She also has
diffuse disease of the LAD and RCA. Cardiac catheterization
confirmed significant gradient in setting of low EF, so another
valvuloplasty was performed, which dropped the gradient from 31
to 23 mmHg. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
stable afterwards. She was given Lasix. Her groin site was
closed.

Pertinent Results:
[**12-17**] Echo:
FOCUSED VIEWS AFTER AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY: The left atrium is
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

After initial valvuloplasty inflation: Trace to mild aortic
regurgitation.

After final valvuloplasty inflation: Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Gradient across aortic valve consistent with
moderate to severe aortic stenosis.

Compared to study from [**2160-12-3**], the gradient across the aortic
valve is reduced (mean gradient 35 mm Hg to 25 mm Hg). The
severity of aortic regurgitation is slightly increased.

[**12-18**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25
%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Severe pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-12-3**],
the degree of aortic regurgitation has probably increased. The
velocity across the aortic valve is similar but some of this
velocity is due to increased aortic regurgitation. The degree of
stenosis across the valve is probably slightly less (although is
calculated as the same). The other findings are similar.
.
[**12-20**] CXR MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-4**] through 19:


Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has not improved.
Left lower
lobe is still collapsed. Right basal atelectasis has worsened,
but previous
small right pleural effusion has decreased. There is no
pulmonary edema or
pneumothorax.
.
[**12-20**] CT ab/pelvis: ]
1. Hematoma along right medial pelvic wall extending from right
groin with
retroperitoneal extension on the right.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent opacities at
the lung
bases, likely atelectasis, cannot exclude superinfection.
3. Small pericardial effusion similar to prior.
4. Moderate atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and iliac
vessels.
5. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with 3VD CAD s/p MI in [**2156**], POBA LCX, CHF with EF
25-30%, dyslipidemia, HTN, rheumatic heart disease, AV stenosis
s/p valvuloplasty x2 with recent admission for CHF exacerbation
c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Pt now represents for increased SOB and hypervolemia,
partially [**3-4**] recent fluid boluses in OSH ED. She is s/p
valvuloplasty [**12-17**] and continues undergoing diuresis and pain
control for pelvic hematoma. On [**12-20**] patient decided
definitively to become hospice/comfort measures only, and
discussed with her family who suported her decision. She also
also began experiencing decreased urine output and worsening
creatinine. She became increasingly delirious and agitated with
significant discomfort and was discharged to [**Hospital 4470**] Rehab for
end of life care.
.
# GOALS OF CARE: Patient decided that she wanted to transition
to hospice, have comfort measures only, and does not want to
continue planning for valve replacement. She spoke to her
daughter and expressed these wishes. She has stated on multiple
occasions that "I know I'm dying, I just want to be
comfortable." She became increasingly dyspneic and delirious
with chest pain. We attempted to diurese for comfort but her
kidney function is also decreasing and she has very minimal uop
