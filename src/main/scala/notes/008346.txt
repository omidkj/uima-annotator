CXR - FINDINGS: A double-lumen catheter is introduced over the
left internal jugular vein. A standard central venous access
line is placed in the right internal jugular vein, the tip of
the left catheter projects over the brachiocephalic vein, the
tip of the right catheter projects over the azygos vein.
Right-sided tracheostomy tube. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly and right-sided perihilar haze
could be indicative of mild pulmonary fluid overload. Bilateral
subtle fibrotic changes, most obvious in the retrocardiac lung
areas, could represent fibrotic scars after old infection. No
evidence of recent infectious lung disease.

PICC placement - IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically guided single lumen PICC line placement via the
right brachial venous approach. Final internal length is 41 cm,
with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old F with ESRD on dialyis, CAD s/p CABG, COPD, HIT+ on
coumadin, chronically ventilated, trach/PEG who is transfered
from [**Hospital1 **] for dialysis catheter replacement.
.
# HD line change: Pt was transferred for intermittently working
HD line. On CXR, line appeared short, which may be contributing
to mechanical difficulties. There was also some thought that
patient may have a persistant SVC also contributing to line
difficulties. IR guided change of line was performed after INR
was reversed with FFP. She was restarted on coumadin at
discharge. INR was 2.2 on day of discharge, her goal was [**2-1**].
.
# ESRD on HD: Per pt's daughter, she had some mild CRI of
unknown etiology prior to recent hospitalizations, followed by
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] became HD dependent after recent prolongued
hospitalization. She received 1 HD session with 2kg removal. She
did received 4000 units Epo with HD on [**2135-4-20**]. On day of
discharge, [**4-21**], she underwent another HD session and the new HD
line was working very well.
.
# Respiratory Failure:  She remained on the Vent without issues.
Of note, meropenam was stopped as [**Hospital1 **] note stated that she
should have 10 day course and first dose received on [**2135-4-6**]
(last should be [**4-16**]). Flagyl was continued as per [**Hospital1 **]
records. The need for continued Flagyl should be re-addressed at
[**Hospital1 **], as this can likely be stopped as well if it was also
started for aspiration pneumonia.
.
# PICC line placement: Pt arrived with RIJ. After discussion
with family, family was amenable to switching to single lumen
PICC. As she has stopped her IV meropenam, she may not have
long-term needs for PICC line and we recommend that this be
removed in favor of peripheral IV once needs for IV antibiotics
are clarified.
.
# COPD:  She continued spiriva and nebs. Her predinsone 15 mg
daily was continued. It was unclear how long her taper was
supposed to be. We recommend follow-up regarding duration of
prednisone taper and if she will be chronically on higher
steroid doses, she may benefit from ppx with bactrim.
.
# HTN:  She continued clonidine, labetalol, isordil, lisinopril

.
# Gastroparesis: continued reglan
.
# Depression/Anxiety:  continued paxil and seroquel
.
# Prophylaxis: PPI, therapeutic INR, bowel regimen
.
# Code Status: Full
