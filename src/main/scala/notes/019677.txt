History of Present Illness:
84M poor historian, with h/o multiple myeloma, COPD, PE, who by
report, presented to [**Hospital1 882**] ED earlier today after developing
left side SSCP while at the Infusion Center where he was
receiving Velcade infusion for multiple myeloma. He was
receiving 2U PRBCs with his infusion, and then described 15
minutes of new onset chest pain, without sob, n/v, diaphoresis,
which resolved spontaneously prior to arrival in the ED. He also
admitted to generalized weakness, and to falling x 3 earlier in
the day, but denied LOC, head trauma.
.
By report he also had a fever yesterday, and again this morning,
but was afebrile at the time he started his transfusion. He then
developed a fever, cough, and chest discomfort in the setting of
of blood transfusion, raising concern for transfusion reaction.

.
In [**Hospital1 882**] ED VS Tm 102 89 24 109/59 93%RA. Labs revealed WBC
2.5 (49% NEUTS, 1% EOS), HCT 27.5, PLT 113, Na 130, CRE 1.7, CK
30, Trop < 0.04, INR 1.09. CXR without clear infiltrate, ECG was
reportedly NSR with TWI in V3-6, 2, 3, avF. BCx, UCx sent. CT
HEAD was reportedly negative.
.
He was treated empirically with CTX, azithromycin. Regarding CP,
he received aspirin 325mg, with plan for additional blood
tranfusions to maintain HCT >30 given question of ischemia. BP
was noted to drop to 85/50, improving with 1L IVF to 96/60. He
then developed SSCP, and repeat ECG showed "T-wave
normalization" for which he was given sl ntg, nitro paste. He
was noted to have rales to the mid lung [**Last Name (un) 18100**], and CXR showed
"mild increased cephalization." O2 sats were 100% on NRB, and he
was given 20mg lasix, started on heparing gtt, and given 1U PRBC
for HCT 27. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
given lack of beds.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS= 102.8 95 104/58 21 94%4L. He then triggered for
RR 35. CXR without focal infiltrate. Given h/o PE, V/Q scan was
ordered. He was continued on heparin gtt, and empirically given
vanc/zosyn x 1 for a presumed pulmonary source, along with
solumedrol 125mg iv x 1. He is admitted to the MICU for
managment of tachypnea.

CXR - Bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis. Dedicated PA and
lateral
views recommended for future followup studies.
.
V/Q scan - 1. Severe central airways disease. 2. Matched
perfusion and
ventilation defects in the right upper lobe. In the setting of
severe central airways disease, there is a small possibility
that PE is present, but overall, there is low likelihood of
pulmonary embolus

[**2116-5-24**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Given the rapid progression of airspace disease, diffuse
aspiration pneumonia is likely. There is near complete occlusion
of the bronchus intermedius from secretions. Consolidation in
the right lower lobe becomes mass like and should be followed in
[**5-18**] weeks to ensure resolution.
2. Mediastinal adenopathy is likely reactive.
3. Calcification in the right main pulmonary artery peripherally
likely represents chronic PE. Contrast enhanced CT can confirm
this if indicated.
4. Right main pulmonary artery dilation to 3.1 cm likely
represents pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Distal trachea and right greater than left bronchus
tracheobronchomalacia is likely but can be confirmed on
dedicated imaging if indicated.
6. Calcified hilar lymph nodes likely represent the sequela of
prior granulomatous disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Influenza/Respiratory Failure: Pt triggered in ED for
tachypnea to the 30s. He received vanc/zosyn and solumedrol
empirically given concern for neutropenic fever. Dyspnea was
transient with resolution by time of arrival to MICU, and
hypoxia resolved by AM. It is possible that resp distress
occured in setting of pneumonia with fever accompanied by poor
rate ctrl in pt with afib and baseline cardiomyopathy, which was
further exacerbated by delivery of IV fluids at OSH per pt
history. Continued treatment for pneumonia given question of LLL
infiltrate on CXR. However, as not neutropenic with only first
dose of velcade today, abx pared back to ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. He was not diuresed here despite highly elevated
BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 4576**] here (baseline unknown) as appeared euvolemic in
setting of improved rate control. Of note, concern at OSH for
blood transfusion reaction which was ruled out on further
evaluation. Given low likelihood of pulmonary embolus on V/Q
scan and ruling out for MI by cardiac enzymes, heparin gtt
discontinued. Also discontinued steroids as thought to have poor
air movement at baseline with COPD but no acute exacerbation;
continued home meds. Patient was treated for two days on the
floor until he developed progressive dyspnea and tachypnea and
required readmission to the ICU. On arrival, patient was
intubated for respiratory distress. CXR showed the development
of a right lung consolidation with rapid progression of airspace
disease on CT chest. Nasal swab for influenza returned positive.
Treatment for influenza with oseltamavir was
