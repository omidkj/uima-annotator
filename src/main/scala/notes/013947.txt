Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: The patient is a 33 year old male with h/o PSA who
presented after cocaine/heroine intoxication s/p intubation post
sedation now extubated and AOX3.

1. Polysubstance abuse:
- The patient clearly overdosed on heroine and cocaine. On
further questioning, the patient was unable to provide more
details regarding the event.
- Addiction consult was placed but patient did not want to
participate in referral.
- The patient exhibited no further symptoms of withdrawal
throughout his stay.

2. Respiratory status:
- As mentioned, the patinet required intubation secondary to
sedation and inability to clear his secretions.
- The patient was given lasix in the ED for what they thought
was flash pulmonary edema. His CXR showed ?RL infiltrate but was
felt not to be significant given his clinical picture.
- He self-extubated himself and continued to sat well off of O2.

3. ID- ?RL infiltrate
- Patient did not spike fevers with no WBC with questionable RL
infiltrate on CXR. There was no evidence to support a pneumonia
and thus the patient was not treated with antibiotics.

4. Hepatitis C:
- The patient has received no prior treatment and his LFTs were
within normal limits.

5. Mental status change:
- The patient arrived to the FICY very sedated. This was most
likely due to the 20 mg IV haldol and 4 mg Ativan the patient
received in the ED. The patient was not fully cooperative on
physical exam but alert and oriented times three.

The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no further events
once he remained stable and was able to tolerate PO intake and
asked to follow up with his primary care physician.
