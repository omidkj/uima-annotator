Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o M w h/o DM2, CAD (s/p MI), asthma, and
recurrent DVTs in RLE, who is transferred from the MICU after
admission for hypoglycemia and hypoxemia thought to be [**1-23**] poor
PO intake.
.
Patient initially presented to his [**Month/Day (2) 3390**] with somnolence and was
found to be profoundly hypoglycemic w undetectable glucose on FS
and hypoxic to 85% at rest and 82% with ambulation. He had
missed breakfast but taken his usual insulin and he recently ran
out of his asthma meds. He was given glucose tabs and was
brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, his vitals were T=95.6, HR=67, BP=143/79, RR=16, and
SaO2=92% on RA. He had wheezes on exam at bases and peak flow of
250. His ABG on 3L O2 by NC showed respiratory acidosis
(pH=7.25, pCO2=82) and hypoxemia (pO2=83). He was treated with
levo and ceftriaxone for possible PNA; he received dexamethasone
for possible asthma exacerbation; and he was started on BiPAP
temporarily, but ABG/somnolence worsened. Since, he improved
clinically, he was observed on O2 by NC. His blood sugar slowly
normalized with dextrose and glucagon and the pt began eating
normal food. Because of concern about his respiratory acidosis
he was admitted overnight to the MICU, where he was treated for
reactive airway disease.
.
On admission to the floor, the pt has no complaints. Denies
CP/SOB. Denies HA/dizziness/visual problems. Denies abd
pain/N/V/Drh/constip. Has reg BM, non-bloody, non-tarry.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o M w h/o DM2, CAD (s/p MI),
asthma, and recurrent DVTs in RLE, who is transferred from the
MICU after admission for hypoglycemia, hypoxemia and acute on
chronic respiratory acidosis.
.
.
# Respiratory failure/Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis in
the setting of acute hypoglycemia. Pt's respiratory failure did
not seem to be due to either asthma or COPD given his relatively
normal pulmonary exam, radiological imaging and his lack of
pulmonary symptoms. PE was ruled out by CTA. Most likely
explanation is obesity-related hypoventilation (Pickwickian)
syndrome which could potentially have been exacerbated in the
setting of worsened hypoventilation from hypoglycemia/confusion.
Possible underlying lung dz suggested by bronchiectasis. Sleep
consult recommended nighttime CPAP. Pt is recommended to follow
up with pulmonary and sleep clinics. Discharged on
bronchodilators (advair, albuterol) and home O2 with activity
(pt's O2 dropped to 85% on RA with ambulation, setting in 90%'s
at rest).
.
.
# DM2/Hypoglycemia: Pt has DM2 with HgbA1c=7.2 (6/[**2161**]). He
presented with severe hypoglycemia in the setting of taking
insulin while fasting. Hypoglycemia resolved, glucose=227 on
transfer. Half of the home dose 70/30 insulin (20 units AM, 20
units PM) was given in the hospital and sliding-scale for
breakthrough hyperglycemia. The pt's glucose was in the
normoglycemic range at first, then in the mildly hyperglycemic
(150s-170s) range. Metformin was held, given that blood sugars
were in the normo-mildly elevated range. Pt was asymptomatic,
eating well, and discharged on the half-dose regimen and the
prior home sliding-scale, with follow-up in Dr[**Name (NI) 25189**] clinic.
.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, though likely secondary to
acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. Hypoglycemia/insulin
should cause hypokalemia. No evidence of cell breakdown or ARF.
No EKG changes. Treated with calcium gluconate, kayexalate,
albuterol and insulin in MICU. Resolved.
.
.
# Hypertension: treated with metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, switched
to Toprol XL 25mg daily. ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] was not started, but should be
considered.
.
.
# H/o CAD: EKG unremarkable. Trop = 0.01, CKMB = 6. BNP = 209 on
admission. Continued home regimen: aspi
