History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 y/o M with PMHx significant for HTN, COPD,
dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH), who was initially admitted to the
[**Hospital1 1516**] service earlier this evening for shortness of breath and
leg swelling. On presentation, he complained of worsening DOE
over the past few weeks, with associated PND and orthopnea. He
also was experiencing bilateral leg and scrotal swelling. He
triggered for hypotension in the ED and was given 1 L NS, with
improvement of his BP. ECG in the ED was noted to [**Location (un) 381**]
voltage, poor R wave progression, TWI in V5-V6; CXR showed BL
pleural effusions. Labs in the ED showed an elevated creatinine
to 2.2 from a baseline of 1.9, an elevated BNP, and a troponin
of 0.24 with negative CK. In the ED, he was given aspirin and
treated with azithromycin and nebs for CPOD exacerbation. On
admission, it was thought that the patient's symptoms
represented an exacerbation of his underlying heart failure. He
was given lasix (20 mg IV x 1) and carvedilol (3.215 mg x 1).
Within 1 hour of receiving these medications, his SBP dropped to
70/50 (from the 110's systolic). He was noted to have a pulsus
of 5 and low voltage on ECG. The cardiology fellow was called
out of concern for potential tamponade. The patient was
tranferred to the CCU for further management at that time.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient's VS were T 97.3; BP 66/32;
HR 55; RR 14; SaO2 98% on 2L NC. He complained of nausea and had
some episodes of dry heaves. He did complain of chest discomfort
during these episodes. He denied any shortness of breath. He
placed on peripheral dopamine and levophed while central access
was established. Emergent bedside echo revealed moderate LVH,
normal LV function, mild RVH and mild depressed/borderline RV
function. Attempts to float a Swan-Ganz catheter were
unsuccessful. However, the patient was quickly able to maintain
a stable blood pressure on a small dose of levophed.

On further questioning, the patient denied any recent fevers,
chills, night sweats, or recent illnesses. He admitted to a
chronic cough productive of clear sputum but denied any recent
changes in this. He denied any headaches, visual changes, chest
pain, nausea, vomiting, bowel changes, urinary symptoms, focal
numbness/weakness, or skin rashes. He did complain of a
"tiredness" in his neck today.

IMAGING
CXR ([**2120-1-27**]) - IMPRESSION: Marked enlargement of the previously
noted left pleural effusion with and emergence of a
moderate-to-large size right pleural effusion well. Atelectasis
in the lung bases is stable, although pneumonia or aspiration
cannot be excluded.

ECHO ([**2120-1-28**]) - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional systolic function. Mild mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.

RENAL U/S ([**2120-1-28**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis. Bilateral renal cysts.
2. Incomplete evaluation of renal vasculature. A repeat
examination can be
obtained when the patient is clinically more stable.

ECHO ([**2120-1-29**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
is a large left pleural effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion
