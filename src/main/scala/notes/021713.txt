Studies:

ECG ([**5-16**]): Afib with RVR (120s), nl axis, narrow QRS, Q in III,
with TWI in III/AvF, T wave flattening in inf leads, no ST-T
changes.

ECG ([**4-28**]): Sinus bradycardia. Broad QRS complex in lead III
with small Q waves in leads II and aVF - consider old inferior
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2199-9-27**] the ectopy is absent and bradycardia is now present.

Stress MIBI ([**12-10**]): Moderate, reversible perfusion defect in the
inferior wall, at the level of exercise achieved. Essentially
normal regional and global wall motion is identified.

TTE ([**10-11**]): 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly
depressed. 3. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
basal inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis. 4. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. 6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7.The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 8.There
is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the
prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2196-3-25**], the
overall LV function has improved while now there appears to be
basal inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis, which was not well
seen previously.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p ablation in
[**2197**], DM, CHF (EF 45%), h/o spinal stenosis and spondylosis
admitted for spinal fusion with hospital course complicated by
atrial fibrillation with RVR.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. spondylosis - The patient was admitted [**2200-5-12**] for an elective
surgery, which occurred in two parts over the first two days of
hospitalization. The first surgery, anterior fusion, was
uncomplicated. The second, posterior fusion, was notable for EBL
of 2.5L, with Hct drop to 23 and necessitation of transfusion of
5U PRBCs, 10U FFP, 1 bag plts. His peri-op course was
complicated by sinus tachycardia, then evidence of ischemia on
EKG, and volume overload (see below). His SICU course was
complicated by fevers and hypotension requiring brief use of
neosynephrine, which had resolved by time of transfer to the
floor. In terms of his spine, he recovered well from surgery and
was ambulating without needing inpatient physical therapy on
discharge. His pain was controlled with oxycodone.

2. atrial fibrillation - While in the SICU, the patient was
noted to have an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR that
spontaneously converted to NSR. He was hemodynamically stable
when he was extubated ([**5-15**]) and sent to the floor ([**5-16**]). In the
ICU, he was maintained on toprol 50mg daily and quinidine. On
transfer to the floor, he was given his home dose of metoprolol
(25mg [**Hospital1 **]) and, that day, went into afib with RVR to 160s. Per
his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], he was changed to
metoprolol 25mg q6h. He was asymptomatic and hemodynamically
stable otherwise. His HR remained persistently high, and he was
given metoprolol 5mg IV x3 with HR 100-130s. He was transferred
to the medical service for HR control. On admission to the
medicine service by night float, he was noted to have elevated
HRs mostly between 4-10am. His metoprolol was increased to 75mg
po tid from 100mg po bid. He was continued on quinidine 200mg
q6h and diltiazem 30mg qid. Throughout his hospital course, his
atrial fibrillation continued to be poorly controlled with rates
usually in the 110s. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] was consulted on the patient
and his heart rate was finally controlled by removing the
diltiazem, dyazide, and quinidine, increasing the metoprolol to
100mg po tid, starting digoxin, and diuresing approximately
-1L/day for several days. On discharge, his ambulatory heart
rate was in the 90s and he was stable in the 90s-100s. He could
not be cardioverted as he could not be anticoagulated for 2
weeks post-operatively per the spinal surgeons, with increased
risk in a patient who required FFP and platelets
post-operatively due to increased bleeding, ?coagulopathy. He
was given ASA 325mg daily as the best alternative.

3. HTN - This was well controlled with the metoprolol and
diltiazem being used for rate control. He was still controlled
once the diltiazem was discontinued. His dyazide was also
discontinued to allow some blood pressure room for uptitrating
his metoprolol and diuresing with lasix. He was discharged on
metoprolol and lasix.

4. CHF w/ EF 45% - He was noted to have significant peripheral
edema, despite clear lungs and no increased O2 requirement. He
was diuresed with goal I/O -1L for several days. Dyazide was
discontinued for blood pressure room while uptitrating the
metoprolol, and he was discharged on lasix and digoxin. He will
need to have his digoxin level check
