History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with h/o AF on Coumadin, sCHF (EF 25-30%, echo [**3-/2170**]),
recent right shoulder fracture, h/o large B Cell lymphoma
presented from OSH with AMS.  Patient is transferred from the ED
to the ICU given requirement for pressor support.
.
Per family report, patient has been confused for 1 week.  She
has been having right shoulder pain [**12-20**] recent fracture from a
fall in [**2170-8-15**].  She has been home since [**Month (only) 205**] after rehab
from the last hospitalization for CHF exacerbation, AF with RVR,
and C. diff colitis.  She was found down on the floor sleeping
this morning when family went to see her.  She lives downstairs
of her daughter, [**Name (NI) **].
.
Patient was transferred to OSH, where she was found to have FS
of 44 treated with 1 amp of D50.  There, her head CT, neck CT,
and pelvis X ray were negative.  Her right humeral neck fx on
[**2170-8-15**] was seen on OSH film as well.  CXR was reported
negative.  There, they noticed + UA, but it is unclear if she
had received any antibiotics.  She received 300 cc of IVF and 15
mg of Kayexylate for K of 5.8.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.4, 112, 110/80, 18, 98% 2L.
FSBS=124.  guaiac + brown stool.  Non-focal neuro exam.  UA was
found to be dirty, so she was given vancomycin and zosyn.  She
was also given thiamine.  Blood culture and urine cultures were
sent.  CXR was negative for infiltrate but + aortic
calcification.  CT abd/pelvis obtained given elevated lactate to
4.8, which showed + ascites, diverticulosis, atherosclerotic
changes, edema, and air in the bladder thought [**12-20**] Foley
catheter (wet read).  EKG c/w atrial fibrillation, LAD, and no
peaked T waves.  Then, BP trended down to the SBP 80s, so she
was given IVF boluses, total of about 2.3L by the time of
transfer (including OSH fluid).  She has a left EJ.  RIJ was
unable to be placed, so she got a left femoral CVL.  She was
started on levophed b/c SBP 70s prior to transfer.  Transfer
vitals pulse 89, rectal temp 97.8F, BP 77/56 (starting levophed
0.05 mcg/kg), RR 20, O2Sat 100% RA
.
On the floor, patient c/o dry mouth.  Denied SOB, F/C, N/V,
chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, urinary
frequency/urgency/dysuria, or weakness

CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate ascites.
2. No bowel obstruction. No apparent bowel wall thickening.
Suboptimal
study due to lack of IV contrast.
3. Moderate atherosclerotic changes in the vessels. Moderate
calcification
at the mitral annulus.
4. Similar bilateral renal hypodensities. Stable left adrenal
thickening.
5. Moderate anasarca. Soft tissue edema more on the left,
predominantly in
the left flank. Given the lack of IV contrast, no drainable
fluid collection
is seen.
6. Foci of air within the urinary bladder with a Foley in place
could be from
placement of Foley; however, correlate clinically for infection.


ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35
%) secondary to inferior posterior akinesis. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acou
