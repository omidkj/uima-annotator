History of Present Illness:
79yo F tobacco smoker from home hospice for CMML, who presents
with worsening SOB. The pt was initially placed to home hospice
several years ago when she was diagnosed with CCML (a from of
MDS) and given a prognosis of 6 mo. However she has done well
for several years at home and has recently reversed her code
status from DNR/DNI/CMO to full code. She however remained in
home hospice as they were providing additional care at home. Her
symptoms initially began with n/v/d which began on Tues night.
The vomitus was initially food only but then began to have dry
heaves. The diarrhea was described as loose, large volume,
frequent, [**Location (un) 2452**] stools. During a 4-6 hour period that night she
had continuous bowel movements which were initially formed but
then became loose. The diarrhea has since resolved and the pt
reports development of constipation with last BM on Wed. There
was no blood, mucous or black stools. Over the last two days,
the pt reports difficulty breathing, fevers to 101 at home
associated with chills, cough with white/clear sputum, and
chest/abdominal pain under the right ribs. The pain in the rib
occurs constantly but is worsened with cough. The pt also admits
to runny nose, sore throat and sinus congestion since this AM.
The pt denies any head ache, neck stiffness or photophobia. The
pt was given levofloxacin and steroid taper (Prednisone 60mg ->
currently 40mg) by the hospice nurses without any improvement.
The pt denies sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] travel. The pt reports receiving
pneumovax 6-8 years previously but did not get a flu shot this
year.


In the ED, the pt was found to be febrile to 100.4, with HR of
74, BP: 157/81, RR: 20, SaO2: 99% on Nebulizer. The pt was found
to have increased dyspnea and wheezing. The pt was given
solumedrol, as well as nebulizers and ceftriaxone 1g IV. The pt
initially improved with 1L NS and nebulizer treatments. However
she acutely desaturated to 85% on 4L NC. She was then started on
continuous nebs with some resolution of sx. The CXR demonstrated
a prominent aortic contour of unknown significance leading to a
CTA. In addition, the pt also complained of some abdominal pain
leading to an Abd CT as well.


In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt reports feeling as if the fever just broke,
but reports continued cough with sputum which is improving. The
pt also reports the abd pain has since resolved. The pt reports
being very thirsty.


Past Medical History:
1. CMML (Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). The pt was diagnosed
three years ago. Originally presented to OSH ED with diarrhea
and then found to have leukocytosis. BM biopsy subsequently
revealed the dx of CMML. The pt refused medications for sx
treatment of CMML except for laxative and antidiarrheals. The pt
is followed by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30396**] of [**Hospital3 **] whom she
sees every 6 months.

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
ECG [**2133-2-14**]: sinus arrhythmia (variable PR interval), nml axis,
nml intervals, nml QRS, RSR' in V1, V2, no obvious Q waves or
acute ST or T wave changes although lateral leads have some
minor ST depression that are diff to appreciate.
.
CXR [**2133-2-14**]: Evaluation of the lung bases is limited by blur,
likely related to patient's motion. Heart size and pulmonary
vascularity is normal. The aorta is unfolded with a prominent
ascending aortic contour. There is no pulmonary consolidation,
pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized osseous
structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Prominent ascending aortic contour of uncertain
clinical
significance.
.
CTA [**2133-2-14**]: (preliminary read) Multifocal opacities in both
lungs, most prominent in the lower lobes with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities in the right upper lobe consistent with infectious or
inflammatory process.
NO evidence of PE or aortic dissection, although evaluation of
the
retroperitoneal is severely limited by streak artifact from
orthopedic
hardware.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79yo F with CMML from home hospice who presents with
progressive sob, fevers and cough.  She was initially cared for
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she received vanco/levo for ? pneumonia and
nebulizer treatments for her long smoking history.  She was
repleted w/ IVF and given stress dose steroids given her recent
course of steroids.  She did well overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
never required intubation.  She was called out on the day after
admission where her course was significant for the following.
.
1. SOB: Her initial CT showed bilateral opacities suggestive of
pneumonia.  Her vanco/levo were initially continued as were her
nebulizers.  Because of her long smoking history, the patient
was given a rapid steroid taper and responded immediately to
this addition.  Because of her quick response to steroids,
absence of fever, and negative cultures, it was felt that her
presentation was more consistent w/ a COPD flare than a
pneumonia.  Her vancomycin was stopped but she was continued on
her levaquin and will complete a full course at home.  She
continued to improve throughout her hospitalization and passed
her PT evaluation w/out excessive SOB.
.
2. CMML: The patient has been at home under hospice care prior
to temporarily reversing her code status to full for treatment
of her SOB.  No interventions we
