Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-1-29**]
1. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a [**Company 1543**]
    CoreValve 26-mm device, model number MCS-P3-640, serial
    number [**Serial Number 82338**].
2. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
3. Ascending aortography.


History of Present Illness:
81F with critical calcific AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2), AF on coumadin (last
dose 2/17), s/p PPM for [**5-16**] for bradycardia/prolonged QT
admitted for IV heparin therapy prior to scheduled percutaneous
AVR scheduled for Tues [**1-29**].

The patient describes that she has been becoming progressively
short of breath over the last few months.  Per her [**Month/Year (2) **],
she is barely able to get out of the bed without becoming
winded.  She notes that she has "weak legs" and has to stop and
rest while walking.  She denies any chest pain, palpitations,
nausea, diaphoresis associated with her shortness of breath with
exertion.  She denies lightheadedness, loss of vision, or any
recent falls.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2115-2-6**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-31**],
the right ventricle is probably slightly more dilated and
hypokinetic than on prior study (the RV was probably mildly
dilated and hypokinetic on the prior study, although reported as
normal). Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is similar. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressures are slightly lower. The CoreValve
appears in good position with normal gradients.

Final Report:
 In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], there is some mild
engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggesting some increasing
pulmonary venous pressure in this patient with enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette and dual-channel pacemaker device in
place. CoreValve placement is again noted and the central
catheter remains in place.



Brief Hospital Course:
81F with PMH aortic stenosis presents for percutaneous aortic
valve replacement.

Pt was admitted preoperatively on [**1-27**] for heart failure
optimization and IV heparin bridge.  She was taken to the
operating room on [**2115-1-29**] for:
1. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a [**Company 1543**]
CoreValve 26-mm device, model number MCS-P3-640, serial number
[**Serial Number 82338**].
2. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
3. Ascending aortography.
She tolerated the procedure well and was trasferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
The patient woke from anesthesia neurologically intact and was
extubated. She remained in the ICU for monitoring until POD***.
From the ICU she was transferred to the cardiac stepdown floor,
while on the floor the patient was noted to be in acute
pulmonary edema, she was agressively diuresed and responded
appropriately. She was seen by physical therapy who worked with
the patient to increase her strenghtth and mobility.
It should be noted that pre operatively the patient was treated
for a urinary tract infection. A repeat urine culture revealed a
subsequent urinary tract infection with
ESCHERICHIA COLI. and ENTEROCOCCUS SP..

She was seen by the infectious disease service for recommended
antibiotic coverage, they felt there was a contaminated culture.
The urine culture was repeated and was negative.
On POD10 she was discharged home with visiting nurses.
