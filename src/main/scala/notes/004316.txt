Brief Hospital Course:
77-yo-woman w/ DM2, CAD, HTN, CRI and ARF, CHF presenting w/
improving tremor, improving acidemia secondary to uremia, also
w/ UTI and anemia.
.
1. Non-oliguric ARF on CRF, Uremia/Acidemia: ARF with Cr
increase from 3 to 6.1 was likely secondary to prerenal azotemia
from hypovolemia, given decreased PO intake over past 2 weeks,
though FENa of 4% supports intrinsic renal etiology. UTI is
another possible exacerbating factor, though unlikely as no
signs of pyelonephritis. The pt had evidence of uremia with
decreasing appetite, asterixis, and acidosis, no hyperkalemia.
The patient was admitted to the MICU on presentation for
management of uremia and acidosis.  A bicarbonate gtt was
initiated [**11-12**], and discontinued [**11-13**], after repeat ABG was
7.24/47/133/21.  Asterixis/tremor subsequently diminished.  The
patient was transferred from the MICU to the Medicine floor
service on [**11-13**].

The patient was followed by the nephrology team during the
course of her admission. Renal U/S performed [**11-13**] showed no
obstruction or hydronephrosis.
Given the pt's diabetes and worsening renal status, the
nephrology team recommended initiation of hemodialysis. The pt
received a tunneled right IJ catheter placed by IR on [**11-14**], and
started hemodialysis [**11-15**]. She received daily hemodialysis on
[**11-15**].  During her admission, the patient had weight,
fluid status, and electrolytes monitored daily.  She also was
started on Lisinopril by the nephrology team.  She was also seen
by transplant surgery, to discuss eventual need for AV fistula
placement for hemodialysis.  The patient was subsequently set up
for outpatient dialysis, and had her first appointment [**11-20**] at
11:15AM.
.
2. UTI: The pt was found to have a UTI on UA on admission, but
no fever or other signs of systemic infection.  Her acute
urinary infection may have contributed to her ARF. UCx >100,000
enterococcus, initially treated empirically w/ levofloxacin; the
patient received a full 3 day course which finished [**11-14**];
however, urine culture/sensitivities subsequently came back as
Levo resistant, and the pt's foley was removed, and she was
started on Vancomycin [**11-16**].  The pt was renally dosed, based on
trough levels; [**11-17**] Vanc trough was 6.8, and the patient
received an additional dose that day. Trough on [**11-18**] was 17.7,
and no further doses of vancomycin were given.  The pt remained
afebrile, with no elevation in white count.
.
3. CAD: The patient had a h/o CABG, stents, severe 3VD, w/ some
partially reversible defects on last PMIBI.  No cardiac symptoms
or EKG changes on admission. On admssion, troponin was elevated
at 0.06, however CK/MB were normal, and tropinin levels remained
constant; therefore, elevated troponin therefore most likely due
to renal failure.  On [**11-15**] during her first hemodialysis
session, the pt developed 5/10 chest pain which lasted 5
minutes, and spontaneously resolved, no associated symptoms. EKG
showed new left bundle (previously had IVCD) and peaked T waves.
 The patient never had any further chest pain, shortness of
breath or palpitations.  She remained on her home regimen of
ASA, Plavix, Metoprolol, Nitropatch, and statin.

4 Hypercarbia: The patient's ABGs showed respiratory acidosis
along with metabolic acidosis. The patient is a very obese woman
who reportedly snores at night, thus calling into question
possibility of pickwickean syndrome vs. sleep apnea.  Pulm
consult was requested, who stated that the patient has a
physiologically abnormal response to hypercarbia, and
recommmended obtaining a sleep study as outpatient.  During the
course of her admission, the team also attempted to limit
administration of narcotics, in order to minimize respiratory
depression. ABG's were checked daily until [**11-15**]; post-dialysis
ABG was attempted by multiple providers but failed, and pt
refused further attempts.  Renal team subsequently followed
bicarbonate levels on chem-10 during daily dialysis.
.
5. DM2: Controlled w/ home regimen of NPH 25units qam, Humalog
SS
.
5. HTN: Metoprolol, clonidine, nitro patch, lisinopril 2.5 mg qd
was started [**11-16**].
.
6. Anemia: Secondary to chronic renal disease, Hct decreased
from 42 [**11-12**] to 32.8 [**11-13**]. Guaiac negative. Possibly was
hemoconcentrated on admission, then hydrated resulting in
dilution. Erythropoietin was given at at each dialysis session.
Iron was discontinued, and the pt was started on nephrocaps.
.
7. Hypothyroid: Controlled w/ home regimen of Levoxyl.
.
8. FEN: cardiac/[**Doctor First Name **] diet
.
9. Proph: heparin sc, PPI, bowel regimen
.
10. Access: Peripheral IV - PICC attempted by RN but failed.
.
12. CODE STATUS:  Pt was initially DNR/DNI, however, pt
subseuqently discussed code status with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**11-15**], when
she stated that she wished to be full code, and would accept
intubation, shock, pharmacotherapy - ho
