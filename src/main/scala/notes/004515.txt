Unresponsive.

None.


History of Present Illness:
43 year-old male with diabetes mellitus type I complicated by
nephropathy s/p renal transplant ([**2188**]), hypertension,
hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and dyslipidemia admitted after
being found unresponsive.  Patient reports felling well recently
and this morning.  Presented to work, and was noted to be
confused; coworkers found him unresponsive and called EMS.  At
the scene, blood glucose 51.
.
Patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus type I.  He uses an
insulin pump.  Insulin pump is managed by himself.  He reports
blood glucose typically runs 80-140, and rarely down to low 20s
or 30s.  He is symptomatic during these episodes (cannot
describe particular symptoms), and symptoms resolve with PO
intake.  He recalls one instance when EMS was called for similar
incident; he received dextrose infusion and did not go to the
emergency department.
.
Of note, trasplant from living donor complicated by
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and
antibody-mediated rejection.  Eventually with graft failure, and
was placed on hemodialysis.  He was converted to peritoneal
dialysis approximately  3-4 weeks ago.  Recently with difficulty
with getting fluid off and worsening lower extremity edema.  To
help with diuresis, dextrose in PD increased to 4.25% from
1.5-2.5%.
.
In the ED, 63, 121/50, 12, 99% RA.  Initially unresponsive.
FSBG 30.  Received 1 amp D50 with response within 1 minute;
temporarily awake, alert.  Blood glucose rose to 130, then
trickled back down to 60 with associated fatigue  Received
additional 1 amp D50 with response, and currently on D5
continuous infusion.  Still fatigued.  Able to eat a [**Location (un) 6002**].
Laboratory data remarkable for creatinine 13.5, blood glucose
118, anion gap 18.  Serum tox negative.  LDH 268, LFTs
unremarkable.  Mild anemia, CBC otherwise within normal limits.
CT head without contrast negative.  CXR 2V with bilateral
atelectasis.  On tranfer to the ICU, 94.9, 72, 139/85, 10,
96%RA.  Blood glucose 200.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient reports feeling well.  Reports
15-pound weight gain and lower extremity swelling since starting
PD.  Also reports considerable fatigue since starting starting
PD due to being up at night to operate machinery.  He denies
fever, chills, headache, visual changes.  He has a nonproductive
cough.  Denies chest pain, shortness of [**Location (un) 1440**], palpitations,
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
myalgias, arthralgias.  He is anuric.

Brief Hospital Course:
43M with DMI c/b nephropathy s/p failed renal transplant,
hypertension, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and dyslipidemia
admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive.  Now awake
and alert.
.
#.  Hypoglycemia:  Differential diagnosis includes increased
insulin sensitivity secondary to PD, pump malfunction, decreased
PO intake, infection.  He does not take oral hypoglycemics (type
I).  Patient reports feeling well lately, does not report
infectious symptoms.  Case was discussed with [**Last Name (un) **] who
recommended patient continue with pump as he normally does and
will evaluate in morning.  The plan was to continue q2h FSGs,
complete an infectious workup and cycle cardiac biomarkers
(which were 0.6 then 0.5 in the setting of a Cr of 13.5).  The
patient however expressed a desire to leave against medical
advice.  He acknowledged the risk of a recurrent episode of
hypoglycemia overnight, with risks including death, and he
demonstrated his own competence in managing his diabetes.  He
was felt to be competent to make his own medical decisions and
was allowed to sign out AMA.

#.  Altered mental status:  Associated with
hypogylcemia/hypothermia.  Differential diagnosis includes
hypoglycemia, intoxication, infection, uremia.  Likely secondary
to hypoglycemia given rapid response with dextrose infusion.  No
evidence of substance abuse on serum tox screen; unable to send
urine secondary to anuric.  Currently AOx3, conversant, and at
baseline.
- Infectious/hypoglycemia workup, as above
- Dialysis, as below
.
#.  ESRD:
- PD per renal
- Continue cincacalet
- Discuss potential for increased insulin sensitivity on PD with
[**Last Name (un) **]
- Continue prednisone for prior failed renal transplant
.
#.  Diabetes mellitus, type I:
- Will add on A1c
- Q2 hour blood glucose checks, will space out if stable
- Insulin dosing per patient/insulin pump
- [**Last Name (un) **] recs
- Holding gabapentin [**2-2**] renal failure - will discuss with renal
if safe to use
.
#. Anion gap:  At baseline.  Suspect secondary to uremia.
.
#. LDH elevation:  Normal bilirubin.  Known to have metabolic
bone disease.
- Continue cinacalcet, as above

#.  Hypertension:  BP currently elevated.
- Continue amlodipine, metoprolol, lisinopril, valsartan
.
#.  Dyslipidemia:  Currently not taking statin.
