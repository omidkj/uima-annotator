61 year old woman with known right lower lung mass s/p right
VATS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for interval change
CHEST TWO VIEWS
INDICATION: 61-year-old woman with known right lower lung mass
status post VATS.
COMMENTS: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed,
and compared with previous study of yesterday.
Again note is made of atelectasis of the right middle lobe and
right lower lobe associated with right infrahilar mass. There is
associated small right pleural effusion.
Lungs are clear otherwise. The heart is normal in size. No
pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Continued right middle lobe and right lower lobe
atelectasis due to patient's known mass in the right infrahilar
region.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please drain; please send pleural fluid for gram stain and
culture
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT CHEST, LIMITED
There is a comparison exam from [**2157-2-23**].
CLINICAL HISTORY: Right pleural effusion, insert chest tube.
PREPROCEDURE CHEST FINDINGS: Non-contrast images of the thorax
demonstrate a large right pleural effusion and right middle lobe
atelectasis as seen previously. The left lung is clear.
Post-procedure images demonstrated no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 10-French pigtail catheter
into the right pleural space with aspiration of 15-20 cc of
serosanguineous fluid.

GUIDANCE FOR [**Female First Name (un) **]/ABD/PARA CE; PLEURAL ASP BY RADIOLOGIST
Reason: RT PLEURAL EFFUSION
INDICATION: Right-sided pleural effusion.
PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] and supervising.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 19-gauge
[**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was inserted into a pocket of fluid in the right
pleural space without difficulty. 2 to 3 cc of clear
serous-appearing fluid was withdrawn. This fluid was sent for
the requested Gram stain and culture. The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no immediate post-procedure complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic thoracentesis on the right.
The patient will return for a CT-guided pleural drainage
catheter placement on Friday, [**2157-2-25**].
These findings were discussed with the ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
