[**2131-4-16**] Carotid Ultrasound: On the LEFT systolic/end diastolic
velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are
388/167, 135/65, 32/17 cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is
52/13 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 82 cm/sec. The
ICA/CCA ratio is 7.5. These findings are consistent with 80-99%
stenosis. On the RIGHT systolic/end diastolic velocities of the
ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 99/39, 100/34,
68/25 cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 75/21 cm/sec. ECA
peak systolic velocity is 98 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.3.
These findings are consistent with < 40%stenosis.
[**2131-4-16**] Intraop TEE: PREBYPASS - 1. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
left atrium. No atrial septal defect of PFO is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with akinesia of the apex and
anterior wall. The anterior septum and inferior septum are
moderately hypokinetic. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. 6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST BYPASS - 1. Patient is in sinus rhythm receiving an
infusion of milrinone and norepinephrine. 2. LVEF slightly
improved post revascularization. LVEF 25- 30%. 3. Aorta is
intact post decannulation. 4. Mitral regurgitation is mild to
moderate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service. He was
maintained on intravenous Heparin and Nitro and remained pain
free. Preoperative echocardiogram showed LVEF 20-25% with 2-3+
mitral regurgitation - see result section for additional detail.
Preoperative carotid ultrasound revealed severe left internal
carotid artery stenosis - see result section for further detail.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended left carotid
endarterectomy six to eight weeks after cardiac surgery.
Preoperative course was otherwise uneventful. Just prior to
surgical revascularization, an IABP was placed given his
severely depressed left ventricular function.

On [**4-16**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. Given inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours
prior to surgery, Vancomycin was given for perioperative
antibiotic coverage. For surgical details, see dictated
operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. The
IABP was weaned and removed on postoperative day one without
complication. Due to persistent hypotension, he was slow to wean
from pressor support. Midodrine was initiated. Hemodynamics
gradually improved and he was eventually transferred to the
telemetry floor on postoperative day seven.

Over next couple of days he received further medical management
and remained stable without any complications. He worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility and on post-operative
day ten he was discharged home with VNA services and the
appropriate follow-up appointments.

Patient was unable to be started on ACE-inhibitor due to
hypotension post-operatively. He will follow-up with his
cardiologist for possible addition of an ACE.
