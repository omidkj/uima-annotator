[**2113-3-3**] CXR PA & Lateral: Pruning of the pulmonary vasculature
and emphysematous changes prominent at the lung bases are
consistent with patient's known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
There are no pleural effusions. There are no focal pulmonary
opacities identified to indicate pneumonia. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary process. Stable emphysematous changes at the
lung bases.
.
ECHO [**3-10**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
EKG [**2113-3-3**]: NSR, mildly tachy, normal axis & intervals, poor r
wave progression, essentially unchanged from prior tracings


Brief Hospital Course:
40 y/o M with alpha 1 antitrypsin dz, COPD, hepatitis C,
cirrhosis and DM I admitted with c/o SOB, cough with sputum
production & hyperglycemia.

#Cough/SOB/COPD exacerbation.  Pt with h/o alpha 1 antitrypsin
defic & assoc COPD who presented with SOB, cough.  CXR without
infiltrate but sputum culture grew S. pneumo.  He was treated
with levofloxacin x 5 days, pulse steroids x 3 days, nebs with
rapid improvement in his sx.  His breathing is quite comfortable
at this time and he is ambulating without difficulty. He is to
continue his home inhalers.  He is now off steroids.

#Hyperglycemia: Pt with history of brittle type I & labile blood
sugars. BS have been running high this week, likely [**2-4**] URI &
fevers. Pt presented with BS of 278 & gap of 12. Pt received IV
solumedrol & BS rose to 550 with Gap of 15. Urine was positive
for ketones & glucose.  He required admission to the ICU for
insulin gtt with q1hr BS checks.  He was closely followed by
[**Last Name (un) **] during ICU and floor stays.  As he has now completed his
steroid pulse, his sugars are easier to control.  He expressed
on several occasions that he wanted a more conservative lantus
and ISS as he has had some problems with morning hypoglycemia in
past.  He is now agreeable to Lantus 24 units bedtime and has a
sliding scale Apidra, copy provided for him at time of
discharge.  He has a f/u appt at [**Last Name (un) **] in 1 week
.
# Hepatitis C: Pt with active Hep C, last VL 29 400 in [**11-10**]
followed by GI at [**Hospital1 112**], and there is ongoing discussion regarding
initiation of interferon therapy, currently untreated.  Has has
had some mild RUQ tenderness, stable transminitis.  No evidence
of biliary obstruction on labs.
.
# [**Hospital1 **]: Pt with chronic [**Hospital1 11395**] followed by ENT, has white
plaques scattered over oropharynx on exam and precervical LN.
He was given nystatin swish and swallow and clotrimazole
troches.  HIV testing [**8-10**] was negative
.
# Depression/Panic disorder: Pt denying any current SI/HI, also
denies substance abuse since [**7-10**].
- continue amitriptyline, citalopram, and risperidone at prior
home doses
.
# Chronic pain: managed by pain clinic; Rx go through [**Hospital 191**]
clinic.
- continued on home regimen of amitriptyline, citalopram,
gabapentin, oxycodone, and methadone.
- he requested refills on the day of discharge, but I spoke with
his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] and it appears he was last given refill on
[**2-22**] (2 week supply).  As he was admitted [**2-/2034**], he should still
have approximately 5 days left.  He was instructed to call [**Hospital 191**]
clinic for refill.

# Hypothyroidism: continued home Synthroid 100mcg daily
.
# GERD: stable, continue PPI.
