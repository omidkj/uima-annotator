Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 37080**] is a 72 yo woman with CHF, COPD, s/p [**Hospital 106081**]
transferred from OSH with V Tach on amiodarone and neosynephrine
drips.  AICD did not fire.

Rhythm: Pt presented to OSH in V Tach and was converted to SR
with an amidarone bolus and maintained on an amiodarone drip for
18 hours.  She remained in a paced sinus rhythm without
symptoms.  Pt was seen by the EP service who adjusted her ICD to
begin anti-tachycardia pacing at 130 beats/min (AVP).  She
underwent an EP study on [**2180-2-21**], showing inducible VT upon
stimulation of the aorta.  No ablation was done.  Pt was
discharged on 25mg Toprol qd, decreased from her outpt dose of
50mg, because of hypotension to SBP = 80.

Pump: h/o CHF: Pt is on coumadin for cardiomyopathy with an EF
of 20%.  She did not have any symptoms of CHF during admission.
Restarted on outpt Lasix 20 qd.

Cor: Pt was hypotensive after conversion and placed on a
neosynephrine drip for one day.  Of note, pt has low blood
pressure at baseline.  Pt on ASA 81, Zocor, Toprol (decreased to
25mg qd).

Endocrine: Pt has h/o thyroid toxicity d/t amiodarone.  She was
hyperthyroid for > 1yr, on Tapozole.  Per her records, her
amiodarone was discontinued in [**2179-10-15**].  She subsequently
developed hypothyroidism on Tapozole, which was discontinued
during this admission.  On exam, pt does have a palpable nodule
but she is refusing fine needle biopsy at this time.  She will
need a biopsy as an out patient, and recheck of her TFT's.
