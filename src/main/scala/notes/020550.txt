[**2117-6-15**] CTA Chest :
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Status post left thoracotomy and left upper and lower lobe
wedge
resections with normal post surgical changes noted such as small
areas of
consolidation at the resection bed and loculated pleural
effusions with a
small gas component.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the right is
also significant. Otherwise, no new focal consolidations or
ground-glass opacities are present in the left lung to suggest
new inflammatory process.
3.  Chronic changes such as heavily calcified internal surface
of the right hemithorax with post-pneumonectomy fluid collection
and coronary artery calcifications are not significantly changed
compared with prior studies.

[**2117-6-16**] CXR :
Left lower lobe opacities have improved.  Right pneumonectomy
and
calcification of the pleura on the right is again noted and
unchanged.
Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right as before.
Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  Peripheral opacities in the
left lung are consistent with postoperative changes with a small
amount of fluid collection surrounding cervical chains, better
seen in prior CT from [**6-15**].  There is no evidence of
pulmonary edema.  Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has
decreased.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a left thoracotomy and left
upper lobe and left lower lobe wedge resection.  She tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
 She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was controlled
with an epidural catheter.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she had multiple
episodes of dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea. She was not
orthostatic but her heart rate was in the 100 range.  Her
symptoms were possibly from the epidural and she preferred to
have it removed and use oral medication.  After removal of her
epidural catheter and chest tubes she felt better but remained
tachycardic.  Her EKG was normal but her oxygen requirements
were high ( 4 liters @ 96%).  She had a CTA of the chest which
ruled out PE and subsequently underwent vigorous pulmonary
toilet.  She was also diuresed gently over 48 hours and her
oxygen saturations gradually improved.

Unfortunately due to her limited pulmonary reserve pre op, she
required oxygen both at rest and with activity.  She worked with
the Physical Therapist and persistently desaturated with any
activity ( 2L/85% ).  A pulmonary rehab program was recommended
so that she can eventually return home safely, possibly needing
oxygen indefinitely.

From a surgical standpoint her left thoracotomy incision was
healing well.  Pathology is pending.  She was tolerating a
regular diet though modestly and her pain was well controlled.
After a slow recovery she was discharged to rehab on [**2117-6-18**] to
help improve her respiratory function prior to returning home.
