Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, femoral central line placement, left PICC line
placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman who presented after being found down in a snow
bank outside her home; she was last seen 12 hours before she was
found. The daughter left for work around 6am, and when she
arrived home at 6pm, she found the front door open. She saw her
mother laying in a pile of snow in only a daydress,
unresponsive. She asked a neighbor to help her pull her out of
the snow, and then called 911. She reports that her mother goes
out every day at 10 am to get the mail.  When she arrived in the
ED, her temperature was 28C/82.4F (rectally per report). She was
intubated on arrival for airway protection. A left femoral line
was placed after an unsuccessful attempt at a right femoral
line. She was given 2 L of warmed NS, 2L of warmed LR, as well
as 400cc of warmed NS in NG and bear huggers were placed. A
trauma workup, including CT head, C-spine, CXR and CT abdomen
and pelvis were only significant for bibasilar atelectasis and a
right pleural effusion. ECG showed afib 52 with possible [**Doctor Last Name **]
waves in V4-5.  She was admitted to the medical ICU for further
management.

Past Medical History:
-s/p ORIF of left hip for intertrochanteric fracture in [**2181**]
-"[**Last Name **] problem"
-osteoporosis
-mild HTN
-Dementia (altzheimer's)
- biliary stricture

Social History:
No smoking, alcohol or drug use. The patient is widowed since
[**2147**], used to work as a shoemaker, and, prior to admission, was
still driving. Lives with her daughter, [**Name (NI) **], who has never
married and has no children or siblings. The patient has a

Radiology
[**1-14**] CT Abd/pelvis: There is a small calcified pleural plaque
noted within the left pleura. Moderate sized right-sided pleural
effusion with a small left-sided pleural effusion. Areas of
compression atelectasis are noted in the left base and there
appears to RML collapse. Heart size appears slightly enlarged
and there is mild left atrial enlargement. No focal liver
lesions are identified and there is mild biliary dilatation and
pneumobilia, likely related to biliary enteric tube with distal
tip in the proximal jejunum. Liver parenchyma is fatty
infiltrated. The gallbladder is slightly distended without
evidence of wall edema or periinflammatory changes and contains
a large 3 cm stone. There is a questionable small peripheral
splenic infarct, with stomach, intra- abdominal bowel, and right
adrenal gland all appearing unremarkable.  A 1.4 x 1.2 cm left
adrenal lesion is identified, incompletely characterized on
current contrast enhanced study. The left kidney contains
multiple simple cysts, the largest measures approximately 2.1 x
2.4 cm within the interpolar region. Right kidney appears
unremarkable. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
bilaterally. No free air or free fluid is noted within the
abdomen. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified. There is mild
atherosclerotic changes within the intra- abdominal aorta and
its branches, however celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] all appear
patent. There is an atrophic pancreas. Intrapelvic bowel
displays diffuse areas of diverticulosis with no acute
diverticulitis identified. Patient appears to be status post
hysterectomy. The bladder is slightly distended with no
enhancing masses identified. No free fluid is noted within the
pelvis and there is no pathologically enlarged pelvic or
inguinal lymph nodes identified.

[**1-14**] CT C-spine: No fractures of the cervical spine are
identified. There is intervertebral disc space narrowing at
multiple levels, greatest at C3/4, C4/5, and posteriorly at
C5/6. Mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis in the lower cervical
spine, related to small disc osteophyte complexes.
The thyroid is multilobulated, particularly on the left side.
Several thyroid nodules are noted, and one is concentrically
calcified on the left. There is a rounded opacity at the left
lung apex, and left pleural fluid noted at the apex of the
chest. There are dense carotid artery calcifications
bilaterally.

[**1-14**] CT Head w/o contrast: There is no evidence of hemorrhage or
shift of the normally midline structures. The ventricles and
sulci are prominent, consistent with moderate involutional
change. There is hypodensity of the cerebral periventricular
white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is a lacunar infarct of the right caudate. There is
mild-to- moderate mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air
cells, and rounded opacities within the posterior maxillary
sinuses consistent with retention cysts. The mastoid air cells
are clear. There is a sclerotic focus of the right frontal
calvarium, of indeterminate etiology.

[**1-14**] CXR: The left lung apex and chest wall are not included in
the study. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.3 cm
above the carina. There is atelectasis in the right lower lung.
No large pneumothorax is seen. There is a small right- sided
pleural effusion. Tubing material is containing two metallic
elements seen projecting over the lower abdomen. No fractures
are apparent.

[**1-15**] Pelvis plain film: No acute fracture or dislocation is
seen. There is osteopenia which limits evaluation for a
nondisplaced fracture. A left femoral vascular line is seen.
Patient is status post ORIF of the proximal left femur with a
dynamic hip screw. Vascular calcification is noted. Soft tissues
are otherwise unremarkable.

[**1-15**] Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left and right atria are
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left  ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The
right  ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  The tricuspid valve  leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**1-19**] Left upper extremity ultrasound: Thrombus within the
cephalic vein, a superficial vein. No deep venous thrombosis is
appreciated

[**1-24**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates
persistent bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal contours are similar in appearance. No
pneumothorax detected. Mild increased airspa
