History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman with several months of exertional chest pain.
Woke this morning (about 5 hours prior to presentation) with
chest pressure radiating to the arm, SOB. No diaphoresis, light

take 4 baby aspirin at home and then brought her to ER. In ED at
OSH tachycardic in the 120's, and prominent murmur on exam. EKG
with Q's in V1-V2, ST elevations in V1-V2-V3 with inverted
T-waves in precordial leads (EKG not available for review).
Treated with 600mg plavix, Heparin bolus without a drip, IV
lopressor, integrilin bolus and drip. Then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cath.
.
Cardiac Cath demonstrated a proximal LAD stenosis of 90%, LCx,
and RCA without disease. RHC demonstrated an O2 step-up from SVC
to PA of 63 - 86 c/w VSD. Estimated shunt fraction of 3:1.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and patient transferred to
CCU for managment. Plan on admission to CCU is for operative
repair of her VSD, and a LIMA to LAD.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**11-25**] and had a cardiac cath ( results above).
Referred for urgent CABG /VSD repair with IABP and Swan in
place. Ruled in for acute MI. echo revealed multiple wall motion
abnormalitites with with akinesis in anteroseptal and apical
areas.Underwent cabg x1/VSD patch closure the following morning
on [**2160-11-26**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred ot the CVICU in stable
condition on epinephrine and propofol drips. Epinephrine drip
weaned off on POD #1, and extubated early that afternoon.

IABP was removed on POD #2 and that evening, she developed
respiratory distress and becmae unresponsive. She was
reintubated with milrinone and phenylephrine drips started for
hypotension with SBP 100 at time of intubation. Thick brown
secretions were noted with ETT suctioning. Of note, her
creatinine rose to 2.1 from 1.0, and lactate rose throughout the
day with concern for ischemic bowel. Her pH also dropped to 6.99
and urine output continued to decrease.  Transplant surgery
consult done for evaluation. INR rose to 3.0 with a lactate of
14. She also developed A fib.TTE that evening showed no
pericardial effusion. TEE that evening showed small aspical VSD,
mild MR, severe TR, trace AI, small pericardial effusion, and
akinetic areas of the septum, anterior wall, apex, and distal
inferior wall. RV was also hypokinetic with a dilated RA.Concern
was high for bowel ischemia and renal consult was done for
evaluation for CVVH.

 Support continued with levophed, neosynephrine, vasopressin and
bicarb. Surgery team approached family about exploratory
laparotomy to rule out bowel ischemia as her abdomen became firm
and she remained unresponsive. Her LFTS rose into the thousands.
Her prognosis was very grave and the family stated the pt.would
not want surgery. They requested supportive care at that time.
She developed prolonged hypotension despite maximal support and
became bradycardic. CPR was started and the family was notified
at that time. They agreed with the decision to stop all measures
and the pt. expired at 1:10 AM on [**11-29**]. Family declined
autopsy.
