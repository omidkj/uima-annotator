CXR SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right-sided
subclavian PICC is seen; its tip can be followed to the mid SVC.
Mild cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
Left basilar opacity has progressed and may reflect atelectasis
and/or pneumonitis with adjacet increasing small effusion. Air
space opacity in the right upper lobe has progressed.
Constellation of findings compatible with progressed multifocal
pneumonia.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT IMPRESSION: Left upper extremity AV
fistula. No subcutaneous collection near the AV fistula.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Multifocal PNA: Patient presented with fever, cough, and
hypoxia and was found to have multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
Influenza DFA was negative. The patient briefly required a
non-rebreather to maintain oxygenation, but his respiratory
status rapidly improved, and by [**2103-12-4**], the patient was
maintaining good oxygen saturations on room air. The patient was
treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, a PICC line was placed, and
completed a 7d course of vanco/cefepime/azithro on [**2103-12-8**].  On
[**12-7**], he was noted to have increased choking despite ground diet
recommendation from speech & swallow consultation.  His oxygen
requirement increased from 1L to 3L in this setting, raising
concern for aspiration.
.
His PICC line was noted to be oozing, and withdrawn into a
midline position.  This was discontinued on [**2103-12-11**].
.
2. ESRD on HD: The renal service was consulted, and the patient
received hemodialysis per his usual schedule.
.
On the medical service, concern was raised based on erythema at
the site of his AV fistula.  This has been a chronic issue,
evaluated by his transplant surgeon in past, who recommended
accessing the fistula in different locations to reduce
irritation.  USN of fistula showed wall to wall flow, and no
evidence of superficial fluid collection.
.
3. Hypertension: All anti-hypertensives except metoprolol were
initially held due to concern that patient could become septic
as his infection evolved. Capropril was added in place of
lisinopril in order to allow closer titration in the ICU
setting.
.
Upon arrival to the medical floor his home regimen was resumed,
including lisinopril, minoxidil, amlodipine, metoprolol.  On
[**12-7**], he was noted to be frankly aspirating.  Speech & Swallow
evaluated the pt and he was made NPO again including pills as
below.  He resumed his oral medications once he was again
cleared by Speech & Swallow, and his Minoxidil was titrated up
to 5 mg po bid on [**12-11**] for persistent hypertension.
.
4. Alzheimer's dementia/agitation: The patient was initially
disoriented and agitated, pulling off face mask and climbing on
bed rails. This was thought to be secondary to dementia with
delirium in the setting of infection. Due to this, he required
olanzepine briefly.  With ongoing treatment of his underlying
medical conditions, his mental status and agitation improved,
and did not require further antipsychotics. He was also started
on scheduled Tylenol in case he has underlying pain which may
contribute to delirium. Imaging has been suggestive of
underlying degenerative disease of the spine.
.
5. Dysphagia - pt was evaluated by speech and swallow
consultation upon arrival to the medical floor.  His diet was
advanced to pureed solids, which he tolerated, however when
advanced to ground solids he was found to be frankly aspirating.
 He was made NPO on [**12-7**]. His swallow function improved with
improvement in his underlying medical conditions, and he
subsequently passed Swallow evaluation with recommendations for
nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
.
6. Hematuria - in the process of working up patient's delerium,
pt was straight cathed to confim patient is an
