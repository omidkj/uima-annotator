The date of discharge will be provided in an addendum to this
Discharge Summary.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 68 year old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
hypertension and questionable history of coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus
who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] from an
outside hospital for further work-up of bilateral upper lobe
consolidation.  In short, the patient was treated for a left
mastoiditis at the end of [**Month (only) **], early [**Month (only) 359**].  After
finishing treatment, the patient had severe headache and self
treated this with high doses of aspirin, approximately 12 tablets
per day for seven days.  He had persistent weakness and fevers at
home with documented temperature to 102.0 F., orally, and
presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**9-9**].  A chest x-ray
there showed bilateral upper lobe opacities and he was diagnosed
with atypical pneumonia and sent home on azithromycin.

The patient returned on [**9-11**] with continued weakness and had
some EKG changes over leads V3 and V4, and was admitted to
Telemetry but circumstances for that admission are unclear
from present records.

The patient was started on ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for
presumptive pneumonia and he apparently was hypoxic requiring
four liters, had a negative VQ and lower extremity Dopplers. The
patient had two chest CT scans that showed evidence for pneumonia
versus malignancy in the left upper lobe.  Given these atypical
opacities, he was ruled out for tuberculosis by sputum and had a
negative PPD, and after two days of ceftriaxone, he was switched
to Unasyn.

The patient's last fever spike was [**2115-9-17**].  The patient
has also developed some hemoptysis during his stay at [**Hospital3 **].  Bronchoscopy at that time was postponed secondary to an
increased bleeding time.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up of pulmonary
infiltrates.

At [**Hospital 487**] Hospital, the patient also had renal failure,
normocytic anemia and hyponatremia.  The patient denies history
of renal disease.  A renal consultation at the outside hospital
stated that his acute renal failure was secondary to effective
hypovolemia secondary to low albumin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Questionable coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
4.  He does have a documented history of hypertension.
5.  Glaucoma.
6.  Questionable history of chronic renal insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Lumigan eye drops o.u.
2.  Sliding scale insulin.
3.  Levaquin 500 q. day.
4.  Unasyn 3 grams q. eight.
5.  Tylenol p.r.n.
6.  Colace p.r.n.
7.  Phenergan p.r.n.

His home hypertension regimen consists of Clonidine 0.5 mg
twice a day; Nifedipine 60 q. day, Metoprolol 100 twice a
day; Hydrochlorothiazide 25, triamterene 37.5 combination
tablet q. day; Niacin 500 q. h.s.; Nitropatch 0.4 12 hours on
and 12 hours off.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He has a ten pack year smoking history.  He
quit 20 years ago.  Denies any alcohol.  He is retired and
not currently working.  He lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs on admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] were temperature 99.1 F.;
pulse 96; blood pressure 152/80; saturation of 93% on room
air.  He is a pleasant gentleman, mildly diaphoretic.  HEENT
examination showed pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Questionable exudate on
the soft palate.  Neck with no jugular venous distention.
Chest with mildly coarse breath sounds in the upper lung
fields; otherwise clear and resonant to percussion.  No
egophony.  Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities show three plus pitting
edema, dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 11.6,
hematocrit 29.0, platelets 251.  Sodium 129, potassium 4.3,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 18, BUN 39, creatinine 2.1, glucose
of 256.  Calcium 8.9, magnesium of 1.7, phosphorus 3.7.  He
had an INR of 1.3 and a PTT of 25.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   While the patient was on the floor, he had
experienced some back and abdominal pain and had a hematocrit
drop from 29 to 22 over a six hour period.  A CT scan of the
abdomen revealed a new acute hemorrhage, in the right peri-
nephric area.  He had a blood pressure drop to systolic of 90s
from his baseline of 140s.  He was transfused with two units of
packed red blood cells and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Urology was consulted at that time.

During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit he was transfused with a total of six units of packed
red blood cells and his hematocrit after this transfusion
remained stable between the ranges of 26 and 29. The patient also
responded to fluid boluses for brief episodes of low systolic
blood pressures.

The patient also had episodes of respiratory difficulty requiring
an increased oxygen requirement, including 4 liters nasal cannula
and scoop face mask.  The patient also had acute renal failure
with a creatinine which bumped into the low 3 range.  Work-up of
his renal mass demonstrated by MRI that his hematoma was stable.
The patient had a horseshoe kidney with good blood flow
throughout.  There was no enhancing lesion with gadolinium
contrast and there were multiple small cortical infarctions
throughout the kidney which was consistent with a vasculitis type
picture.

In terms of his respiratory difficulties, the patient received
cultures and was presumptively treated with antibiotics for
presumed pneumonia, however, culture data did not support a
diagnosis of pneumonia.  The patient did not spike any
temperatures during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit.

Review of records from the outside hospital revealed an elevated
C-ANCA which would help to explain both his respiratory and his
renal issues.  A presumptive diagnosis of Wegener's was made and
Rheumatology was consulted.  ANCAs were repeated which were
positive as well as the PR3 antibody which is specific for
Wegener's.  The patient was started on Solu-Medrol 250 mg four
times a day for three days and was switched to 110 mg of
Prednisone orally.  The patient was also started on Cytoxan 100
mg twice a day.  The patient did have good urinary output and
self diuresis with improving renal function on high dose
steroids.  He did maintain a good urine output with approximately
150 cc per hour of urine output.  This was encouraging in the
setting of starting Cytoxan and urinalysis after starting Cytoxan
did not demonstrate microscopic hematuria.

On his discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient
was hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit receiving no
intravenous fluids, with a stable blood pressure.  The patient
was placed on a partial list of his home hypertensive regimen. He
was continued on his Cytoxan and his Solu-Medrol was discontinued
and he was started on his 110 mg of p.o. Prednisone.

The rest of this Discharge Summary will be completed by
medical student [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2491**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 50153**], who will provide the rest of
the hospital course including discharge medications and plan.
