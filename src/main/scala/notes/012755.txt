CT Head [**10-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in foci of hemorrhage in the bilateral
frontal lobes  which may represent contusion or diffuse axonal
injury. If clinically  indicated, MRI would be helpful in
further characterization.
2. Small amount of hemorrhage in the bilateral posterior horns
without
evidence of hydrocephalus.

MRI: [**9-6**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings most consistent with diffuse axonal injury as
detailed above involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter junction in the
bifrontal and right temporal as well as basal ganglia and corpus
callosum. No MRI evidence for diffuse axonal injury within the
brainstem.

2. Left inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
CT-Head [**9-10**]

IMPRESSION:

1. Evolution of left inferior frontal lobe contusion. No new
foci of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage identified.

2. Stable mucosal thickening of the bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
Small amount  of fluid within the bilateral mastoid air cells.
EEG: [**9-5**]
SLEEP: No normal sleep architecture was seen during this study.

CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed normal sinus rhythm in a single EKG
channel.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of an
initial
background consisting primarily of diffuse [**1-16**] Hz delta activity
with
intermixed alpha activity. During the course of the study, the
delta
activity was gradually replaced by theta and some intermittent
alpha
background. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and
there
were no epileptiform features noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU. Neurosurgery was consulted, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt was placed
at bedside due to low GCS; he was loaded with Dilantin and
serial head CT scans were followed.

Neurology was consulted for the prognostic implications of
involuntary tongue movements. An EEG was recommended which
showed abnormal video EEG study because of an initial background
consisting primarily of diffuse [**1-16**] Hz delta activity with
intermixed alpha activity. During the course of the study, the
delta activity was gradually replaced by theta and some
intermittent alpha background. There were no areas of prominent
focal slowing and there were no epileptiform features noted.

Orthopedics was consulted for his radius, ulnar and malleolus
fractures, these were managed non operatively. He was fitted
with a splint for his radius/ulnar fracture.

Because he was difficult to wean from ventilator a tracheostomy
was placed and he was able to be weaned. A PEG was placed for
tube feedings for which he is tolerating. He was eventually
transferred from the trauma ICU to the regular nursing unit
where he has remained for the past several weeks.

He has been treated for a MRSA pneumonia x2 courses; the first
course failed as he was noted with fever spikes once antibiotics
were stopped. His Vanco levels were checked and the dosage was
adjusted; the Vanco was continued for another 10 days. he up to
his point has had no further fever spikes since his antibiotics
course was completed several days ago.

He was noted with a left heel deep tissue injury while in the
ICU; a wound care nursing consult was placed and several skin
care recommendations were made. His left heel site has small
opening approximately 1 cm slit at the proximal( superior edge )
There is mild erythema along the wound edge - approx 1 cm -
slightly pink.
The remaining intact tissue is very dry.

As for his mental status initially he was not responsive to any
verbal or physical stimuli but over the past 2 weeks he has been
noted to track with his eyes and turn his head toward the person
calling his name. He has also been noted with increased movement
in all 4 extremities.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for traumatic brain injury rehab.
