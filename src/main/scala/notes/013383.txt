DEBRIDEMENT AND BIOPSY OF OSTEOMYELITIS LESIONS

History of Present Illness:
83M history of hypertension, CAD, hyperthyroidism with resultant
hypothyroidism, depression, prior right basal ganglia bleed with
significant residual deficits including non-verbal at baseline
and suspected chronic aspiration and aspiration pneumonitis with
G-tube for severe malnutrition.

Patient is non-verbal at baseline so history was limited and
obtained from medical records and nursing home. Per EMS, it was
reported that he had increased shortness of breath. On EMS
arrival, initial pOx was 80% on RA. O2 sat en route was 85 % on
4 L NC and transitioned to CPAP for increasing respiratory
distress with pOx mid 90s. He was reported to have thick
purulent sputum with cough but no fevers. There were no other
localizing signs/symptoms of infection such as vomiting,
diarrhea, dark/bloody stools.

Of note, he was admitted from [**2115-5-20**] to [**2115-5-22**]. He was
brought in from nursing home for desats and displaced G-tube.
His hypoxemia was attributed to ? HCAP initially but he did not
complete an antibiotic course. Other causes were evaluated such
as volume overload. A prior ECHO performed on [**2-28**] showed only
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis, EF 40-50 %. It was
overall thought that the most likely cause of his transient
hypoxemia was aspiration pneumonitis given rapid improvement (3L
O2 on admission --> weaned to room air by discharge). Hospital
course was complicated by hypernatremia from dehydration

In the ED, initial VS were: 09:56   98.4 107 96/58 38 94% biPAP.

He had pulse ox anywhere from 89-95 on biPAP. He was tachycardic
to 110s and tachypneic to 30s satting high 80s and mid-90s on
biPAP. At baseline, he can squeeze hand on command but unable to
follow commands currently.

He was emergently intubated with 7.0 tube, 25 cm at lip with
usage of etomidate 20 mg IV x 1 and succinylcholine 100 mg IV x
1. Intubation was not difficult. An OG tube was placed. A right
IJ CVL was placed under sterile technique (documentation
received from ER). He was noted to have thick purlent sputum
from ETT.

He was given vancomycin 1 gm IV, cefepime 2 gm IV, levofloxacin
500 mg IV.

Even before intubation, his blood pressure was SBP 60-80s. He
received 2L IVF. He was placed on dopamine and levophed, weaned
off dopamine, and now only on levophed at 0.08 mcg/kg/min with
resultant SBP 110s. Fentanyl and midazolam were used for
sedation.

ECG was performed that showed [**2115-7-5**] NSR 93, NI, NA except
slightly leftward axis. TWF I, aVR, V1, TWI in V5-V6. Compared
to prior dated [**2115-4-30**], no significant change.

sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormalities. Dilated thoracic
aorta.

No abnormalities are seen within the distal phalanges of any of
the toes.  There is no evidence of osteomyelitis.
