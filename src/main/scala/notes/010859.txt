Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/ NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization on [**8-29**]
and second Cardiac Catherization on [**8-31**] with 2 BMS placed to
SVG on R-PDA.

History of Present Illness:
Presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with dyspnea, after he couldn't catch his
breath and felt like he needed help. The episode was acute in
onset, and was present at rest and exertion. It was associated
with diaphoresis. It was not associated with any chest
pain,nausea, or other complaints. For the last 6 weeks his sons
have noticed more shortness of breath with exertion and less
distances walked before he has to stop (approx 50 feet). They
are not sure what is causing this but feel like the humid
weather is adversely effecting his breathing. He also had a
recent admission to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**7-9**] for CHF exacerbation in
which he was diuresed and discharged after clinically improving.
Before this 6 week period he was functioning at a higher level
and was independently ambulatory with a prosthetic left leg. The
patient also has had a chronic nonproductive cough which has
been present for the last 6 months, associated with no fevers or
chills. He denies any orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, or palpitations. He is usually compliant with his
medications but sometimes forgets to take them 1 to 2 times a
month.
      At [**Location (un) 620**] he was ruled out for PE (on CTA which also saw
no signs of pneumonia , with bilateral effusion and basilar
atelectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy), and was felt like to
have a COPD exacerbation (according to patient he has never been
diagnosed with COPD,/ was never hypercarbic with ABG's on this
admission) or pneumonia (no clear evidence of pneumonia on the
CTA ), with positive troponins. He was started on nebulizers, IV
steroids and antibiotics. He was in atrial fibrilliation with
possible anterior inferior infarct. He was ruled in for NSTEMI.
He was started on heparin drip, plavix, lipitor, metoprolol 25
[**Hospital1 **], and serial EKG's. Third set of troponins increased to 1.14
from .23 initially. He was also given insulin and kayexalate for
hyperkalemia during the admission. He was also given lasix and
outputed well. Positive blood cultures from [**8-25**] which showed
gram positive cocci in clusters and was started on Vancomycin.
He remained afebrile. Infectious diseases suggested 3 more doses
of Vancomycin 1 gram after each hemodialysis session for next 3
times. He was never found to be fluid overloaded, except once on
physical exam during the admission when he was given a lasix
bolus as he still makes urine.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
Initial vitals at [**Location (un) 620**] were T-97, BP -132/67, HR 90, O2 sat
94% on 3L NC .
.
Vitals on transfer : T=95.6 BP=115/70 HR=78 RR=20 O2 sat= 98%
.
The patient on transfer is in no acute distress, and had no pain
or complaints. He is feeling better and does not feel short of
breath. His 2 sons who were present also agree that he looks
much better than a couple of days ago.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes,  Hypertension
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
-CABG: s/p CABG in [**6-/2131**]: LIMA-->D1, SVG-->OM2, SVG-->PDA
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2141-8-29**]: 1. Selctive
coronary angiography of this right dominant coronary circulation
demonstrated native 3 vessel disease. The LMCA was free of
angiographically significant stenosis. There was a 60% stenosis
in the proximal LAD. The first diagonal branch was totally
occluded. The LCX was a small vessel with diffuse disease that
gave rise to a very small OM1. A much larger OM2 was totally
occluded. The RCA was totally occluded in its mid segment.
2. Venous conduit arteriography demonstrated a SVG to OM2 that
was free of angiographically significant disease. A second SVG
to the R-PDA was 90% occluded in its mid segment by thrombus.
There was competative flow to the antegrade limb.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a 60% stenosis in
the mid segment of a LIMA graft to a large D1 at the site of a
kink in the vessel.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right heart filling pressures (RVEDP=30mmHg and LVEDP=28mmHg).
There was near equalization of diastolic pressures. There was no
evidence of ventricular interdependence with simultaneous RV and
LV tracings to suggest constrictive disease. A restrictive
process is possible. There was no clear evidence of a pulsus
paradoxus within the limits imposed by his atrial fibrillation.
The cardiac index was preserved
(CI=2.1L/min/m2). There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic
and diastolic hypertension (SBP=46mmHg and DBP=33mmHg). Systemic
arterial pressures were normal.Filling pressures elevated, mean
RAP 32, RV pressures 50-60s/20, PA pressures 46, EDFP 28, with
mean pressure of 34 but no ventricular interdepence.
During the procedure following given:Midazolam 1 mg IV, Fentanyl
50 mcg IV, ASA 325 mg P.O,  Clopidogrel 75MG

.
-PACING/ICD: none
