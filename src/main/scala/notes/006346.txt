Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of 3 vessel
CAD s/p CABGx3 and multiple stents, CHF, HTN, Hyperlipidemia,
CRF who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain overnight and
worsening SOB.
In general, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27983**] he was in his normal state of health
two days prior to admission; the day prior to admission he felt
fatigued, but didn't develop CP or SOB until lying in bed the
night prior to admission. At this time, he had difficulty lying
flat. He describes the chest discomfort as pressure and a
squeezing sensation in his neck; it was the same as CP that he
has had in the past. He took 3 nitros without resolution of
symptoms. This morning, he continued to have CP and started
having N/V- according to his wife this is not characteristic for
his usual CP.

Mr. [**Known lastname 27984**] wife explains that his functional capacity had been
decreasing over the past year in the setting of multiple CHF
exacerbations. However, he had been doing well since he was last
hospitalized in [**6-20**] for gouty arthritis and aspiration PNA. At
baseline, he can walk around the house and down his driveway but
not around the block. He can climb a flight of stairs slowly. He
does not get chest pain or shortness of breath with either
activity. He describes occasionally getting chest pain at home,
the last time two months ago, that always resolves with
sublingual nitro. He sleeps with 1-2 pillows and this has not
increased lately. He weighs himself daily and is usually around
164-166 lbs; he has not noticed this increasing lately and
weight on Saturday was 167 lbs. He denies any recent swelling in
his legs. He takes his BP daily; this morning it was 142/56; it
usually runs in the 120s systolic. He did develop a dry cough
this am, but did not have a cough prior. No fever, no recent
illness.

Admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**6-20**] for fever and joint pain that was
attributed to gouty arthritis. Patient was diuresed during that
admission and his Creatinine bumped and so he was discharged on
half home dose of Lasix; in [**9-20**] this was increased to 160 [**Hospital1 **]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who thought he was fluid overloaded in clinic;
lisinopril was decreased at this time to 20 mg po daily.

In the ED, vitals were VS 99.0 84 120/57 36 96% BiPAP. EKG
showed intraventricular conduction delay with ST elevations but
no intervention per cards fellow.  He was given 325 aspirin, 3
nitro total, now on nitro gtt.  Received levaquin/flagyl for RLL
PNA. On transfer to the CCU, patient was CP free on
non-rebreather.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-4**] Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular cavity size is normal with borderline normal free
wall motion. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with marked
global hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-12**], the
severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (may be related to
much higher systemic blood pressure). The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now lower. Bieventricular sizes and
systolic function are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2123**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**10-27**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 5:56 p.m.:

Right internal jugular line has been partially withdrawn and now
ends at or
just below the anticipated location of the superior cavoatrial
junction.
Multifocal pneumonia and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are
unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions are
stable. ET tube
in standard placement and nasogastric tube passes below the
diaphragm and out
of view. No pneumothorax.

[**11-3**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
right-sided central
venous access line has been removed. The lung volumes continue
to be low,
with an unchanged aspect of the bilateral, predominantly basal
parenchymal
opacities, likely to reflect a combination of pneumonia and
pulmonary edema.

Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Status post bypass surgery. No
evidence of
pleural effusions.

Video Swallow study:
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with
nectar
consistency.
