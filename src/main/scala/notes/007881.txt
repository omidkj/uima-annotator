Allergies:
Zithromax

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hip fracture, pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hip hemiarthroplasty

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F w/ chronic gait instability, multiple
cardiac issues (incl CHF and Aortic stenosis)  w/severe AS,
CHF,HTN, [**Last Name (LF) 2320**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] nodal delay, known pancytopenia/neutropenia,
who was admitted today to the orthopedic service after a fall at
her nursing home which resulted in a right femoral neck
fracture.  Per report she was being assisted to the bathroom at
her NH during the time of the fall, where she "lost her balance"
and fell on her right side. There was no head trauma or loss of
consciousness.  At baseline the patient requires a cane.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, her CXR showed multifocal PNA, renal
failure of unknown chronicity. She arrives to medicine for
management of her multiple medical issues, namely treatment for
her multifocal pneumonia, pre-operative evaluation of her
cardiac risk factors and management of her chronic medical
issues.

She was then transferred from the medicine service for Afib with
rate into the 140s and hypotensive with SBPs into the 80s. She
was planned to receive an ORIF of a right femoral neck fracture.
The fracture was after a fall in her nursing home. There was
reportedly no loss of consciousness.
.
 She acutely converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate into
the 130s-140s about 1500. She was given 5 mg IV Metoprolol and
became hypotensive with sbp's into the 80s and her mental status
deteriorated. She denied CP, SOB, but became obtunded. She was
then transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
 Upon transfer to the CCU, she was started on an amiodarone gtt.
Her BP was initially low with MAPs 50-52, but as her rate slowed
to the 120s her MAPs increased into the mid-50s. Since she did
not convert to sinus rhythm after 1 hour of amio infusion, she
was electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm after her HCP
consented to DC cardioversion.

IMAGING:
[**2143-8-25**] AP pelvis/R Hip AP/Lat - Right femoral neck fracture
.
[**2143-8-25**] CT C-spine
1. No fracture.
2. Multilevel spondylosis. Mild spinal canal stenosis at C5-6.
Narrowing of multiple neural foramina, as above. Grade I
anterolisthesis at C6-7, which is likely related to facet
arthropathy.
.
[**2143-8-25**] CXR
FINDINGS: There is bilateral lower lobe opacities with
obscuration of bilateral hemidiaphragms likely representing
infectious infiltrates. There is pulmonary vascular
redistribution suggesting an element of fluid overload. There
are
small bilateral effusions. There are some vague calcifications
projecting over the right lower lung, questionable etiology.
Compared to the study from earlier the same day the right lower
lobe infiltrate is slightly worse than the left lower lobe
infiltrate, is slightly improved.
.
[**2143-8-25**] ABD U/S
- contracted gallbladder filled with stones
- calcificied aorta, non-aneurysmal in calber (up to 2.3cm)
- splenomegaly (spleen 13.9cm)
.
[**2143-8-29**]: CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bibasilar
opacities greater on the left side, could be due to atelectasis
or aspiration pneumonia. There is no CHF. There is no advancing
pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
.
[**2143-8-31**]: TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. A probable thrombus is seen in the right
atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe AS, CHF, HTN,
[**Age over 90 2320**], who was admitted to the orthopedic service initially for
treatment of her R-femoral neck fracture, but then transferred
to the medicine service when it was realized that she had a
multifocal pneumonia on CXR. She was transferred to the CCU for
dyspnea and hypotension and ultimately she passed away at 4:10pm
on [**2143-8-31**] from a pulmonary embolism secondary to her hip
fracture.

# Hip fracture - patient originally presented with a right hip
fracture due to a witnessed fall at her nursing home.  She
underwent right hip hemiarthroplasty on [**2143-8-28**] with successful
fixation.  Her pain was not well-controlled post-operatively, as
doses of morphine were associated with significant hypotension.

# Pulmonary embolism - On the medicine floor after her right hip
arthroplasty, the patient experienced dyspnea, increasing oxygen
requirement, and hypotension.  Her continued hypotension and
elevated jugular venous pressure caused concern for pulmonary
embolus.  She was on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  She had a TTE
that showed a dilated right ventricle compared to the left side,
consistent with PE and she was started on a heparin gtt.  Her
respiratory status continued to deteriorate until her death.

# Pneumonia - Patient was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia on
admission to the hospital based on CXR findings.  She was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia acquired in a
healthcare setting (she lives in a nursing home) and received 7
days of this treatment.  Despite antibiotic treatment, her
respiratory status did not improve, likely secondary to PE as
above.

# Atrial fibrillation - patient was in atrial fibrillation with
RVR before transfer to the CCU.  She was hypotensive during th
