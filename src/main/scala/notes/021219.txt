Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
picc line placement
thoracentesis
chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
73year old man with history of right non-small cell lung ca s/p
pneumonetctomy, COPD, hypertension, sick sinus syndrome s/p
[**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] and ICD placement, BPH, and depression presenting with
shortness of breath.  The patient had been admitted [**2159-3-27**]
with dyspnea.  Extensive work up at that time included cardiac
catheterization which showed total occlusion of RCA, although no
intervention was done.  At that time, it was felt his symptoms
were multifactorial with contributions from his COPD and left
sided pleural effusion.  He underwent thoracentesis on [**2159-4-25**];
1300cc bloody fluid was drained.  Cytology was negative,
however, given patient's history, it was still presumed to be
malignant.  Pt subsequently discharged to home.
.
He presented to the ED [**2159-4-30**] with dyspnea and hypoxia,
initially on a 100% non-rebreather, with oxygen saturation in
the 60%'s.  He was subsequently intubated and started on empiric
antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia.  He also became
hypotensive after receiving sedation for intubation and was
transiently on pressor support.
.
He was admitted to teh MICU.  He remained intubated with
difficulty to wean from ventilator.  This was again thought to
be multifactorial, secondary to multifocal pneumonia, persistent
pleural effusion, COPD and poor pulmonary reserve s/p lobectomy.
.
He was treated with a 7 day course of meropenem ([**Date range (1) 19644**]) for a
multifocal pneumonia.  He underwent repeat thoracentesis to r/o
empyema/help improve respiratory status, which revealed a
chylous effusion thought to be due to disruption of thoracic
duct during his lobectomy in [**2158-9-27**].  A chest tube was
placed with persistent output.  On [**2159-5-8**], chest tube was
changed from suction to wet seal.  The patient was started on
TPN which theoretically will decrease chylothorax.  He was
continued on inhalers for treatment of his COPD.
.
The chylous effusion was followed by the pulmonary team, who
recommended the patient be kept NPO and be treated with 2weeks
of TPN.  Repeat CT showed persistant output.  As a result,
thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mechanical
pleurodesis. In the SICU, the patient developed a respiratory
acidosis and was intubated and extubated on [**2159-5-22**].
.
SICU course was also notable for complicated left subclavian
central venous access attempt with cannulation of the subclavian
artery resulting in signficant bleeding and requiring vascular
consultation.  Follow-up ultrasound did not show
aneurysm/fistula formation.
.
On admission the patient was also noted to have a left scapular
wound infection, persistent since his lobectomy in [**Month (only) **],
[**2158**].  He was seen by plastic surgery, who recommended treatment
with oxacillin which was discontinued.  There were no plans for
further surgery by the plastics team.   He continued to have
wound care addressed by the wound care service.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 73-year-old man status post right pneumonectomy with
respiratory distress. Evaluate for PE.

COMPARISON: [**2159-4-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest were obtained
with IV contrast. 100 cc Optiray. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted images were obtained.

CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status
post right pneumonectomy. The main and left pulmonary arteries
are patent without evidence of filling defects to suggest a
pulmonary embolism. There has been interval increase in the
left-sided pleural effusion. There has also been development of
a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms. There are
additional patchy ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe.
The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are stable in
appearance. The right hemithorax is stable in appearance. Again,
noted are enlarged right paratracheal nodes. Visualized portions
of the upper abdomen are stable in appearance.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Again, noted are significant deformities of the ri
