Several days prior to admission, she began to have diarrhea. The
day prior to admission, the patient had a large amount of
hematochezia (3 episodes of urgency w/ blood only, per EMS
report, approx 1L), associated with abdominal cramping, worsened
diarrhea, lightheadedness, then presyncope. She denies syncope
except possibly when w/ EMS, and denies any head trauma. Notes
diaphoresis, cold skin. Per report, this blood was a darker red

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo woman with PMH signficant for hemorrhoids s/p
hemorrhoidectomy admitted w/ GIB thought secondary to anal
fissure near site of surgical repair, with stable Hct and
hemodynamics throughout hospitalization.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. GIB - GI and surgery were consulted. The patient underwent
anoscopy in the ED, which showed a rectal tear, not actively
bleeding, near the site of her recent surgery. Given these
results, this was the most likely source of the bleed. She was
initially given 2 units PRBCs, then significant IVF while she
was NPO. Her hematocrit remained relatively stable. With stable
hematocrits and hemodynamics, as well as a possible source for
the bleed, no further intervention was indicated. The patient
had several hemoccult positive bowel movements prior to
discharge similar to those she had had in the past several
months, but no further episodes of large volume hematochezia.
Given the patient's celebrex use, she was started on a PPI. She
would likely benefit from EGD as an outpatient.

2. UTI - During the hospitalization, the patient had a foley
catheter in place and was noted to have cloudy urine. A
urinalysis showed pt w/ markedly dirty urinalysis. The foley
catheter was removed. She was treated with ciprofloxacin to
complete a 7 day course given the catheter-associated UTI. Urine
culture results were pending at discharge, but show E coli
sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

3. COPD - She was treated with nebulizers, advair, montelukast,
and supplemental O2 with goal SaO2 93% (this is home SaO2 at
rest). She was initially put on oxygen during the day but this
was weaned off prior to discharge. She was put on her home
regimen on discharge.

4. obstructive sleep apnea - She uses CPAP at home, but this was
held here given her settings were not known. She was instructed
to restart CPAP once home. She was put on supplemental oxygen
while asleep.

5. CHF - She was given IVF for most of the hospital stay. She
was discharged on her home regimen of lasix, dose unknown. She
may benefit from an outpatient ECHO given her history of CHF
without known recent evaluation.

6. psych - She was continued on effexor (a low dose as she did
not know her home dose), as well as ambien. Trazodone was tried
for insomnia, but was ineffective.
