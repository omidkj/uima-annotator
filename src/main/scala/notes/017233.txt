Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old lady with hx COPD, CABG-AVR ([**2-18**]),
atrial fibrillation, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who
presents with progressive shortness of breath and cough.

She reports the symptoms of shortness of breath are chronic and
have been worsening for the past year exacerbated by a
protracted hospital course in [**Month (only) 958**] for a CABG-AVR.  The
symptoms over the weekend have worsened and today, she called
her daughter who encouraged her to go to the emergency
department for evaluation.  She denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, GI sx, chest pain.  She reports her symptoms are not
easily improved with home nebulyzer therapy.  She denies sick
contacts and reports discharge from rehab in late [**Month (only) 958**]. She has
not been hospitalized or received antibiotics since that time.
She has no contact with small children or recent travel. Lives
alone. No h/o blood clots or cancer history. Quit smoking 15-20
years ago.  She was given azithromycin 1 month prior for
management of her shortness of breath and experienced no
improvement. She is on hme oxygen which initially was for just
at night but she uses continuously. Unclear oxygen requirement.
She sleeps with 2 pills, unable to lie flat. Denies lower
extremity swelling.

In the ED, initial VS were:  80 153/71 40 69%.  Initial labs
were significant for wbc Na 129, Hc03 33, cr 0.6, lactate 1.4
and troponin < 0.01. A CXR demonstrated an extensive right
infrahilar opacity and a patchy retrocardiac opacity that was
concerning for pneumonia in addition to mild vascular
congestion.  An EKG showed afib at 89 w/ lateral ST depressions.
 For her tachypnea, the patient was given albuterol and
ipratropium nebulyzer therapy  x 2 in addition to 125 mg IV
methylprednisone. For her possible pneumonia she was started on
vancomycin and levofloxacin. Given her worsening exam and
persistent tachypnea, a trial of biPAP was started which the
patient ultimately did not tolerate and refused.  Transfer to
the medical ICU was initiated when the patient did not improve
with initial medical therapy. Vitals on tranfer were: Vitals 100
156/100 34 100% on 4L.

On arrival to the MICU,  initial vitals were: 110 158/93 19 95%
on 2L NC. She was comfortable and reported her breathing was
improved since being in the emergency department.
