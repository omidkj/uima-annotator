History of Present Illness:
77 yo M w/ a h/o HTN, ESRD on PD (question secondary to
Wegner's), PAF (not on coumadin), Lung Ca s/p RU lobectomy, CAD
(60% LAD stenosis found on cardiac cath of [**9-/2176**]), sCHF (EF
35%) taken to [**Hospital3 6592**] for acute on chronic fall and AMS,
who is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Pertinently, the following history is obtained by [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital3 72204**] discharge summaries: The patient was recently admitted to
OSH ([**10-24**] - [**11-8**]) with several weeks of worsening mental status
and dyspnea. He was clinically volume overloaded and 15L were
removed via CAPD. It was deemed that the patient was not
performing PD appropriately [**3-13**] decline in memory and HD was
recommended by care providers. The patient's family refused and
his wife was noted to be trainned to deliver PD appropriately,
but implementation of this is unclear.

Per discussion w/ patient's wife, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been getting PD
daily, but missed a few days of PD prior to his last admission.
She also states that in his last admission, patient was treated
for a bacterial infection. She states that over the past few
months, patient has been having difficulty with ambulation, and
has had numerous falls. Since his discharge from [**Hospital 15405**],
patient has fallen at least three times, in the store, shower,
and on day of admission. Since discharge, he was instructed to
use a walker, which he has not been using. She denies episodes
of emesis, fevers, abdominal pain, cough, and headache. She
believs he has had normal bowel movements. He may have had some
chills while at home.

On day of presentation, patient had difficulty walking down the
stairs at his home. He sustained a fall, but wife denies
syncopal episode. She called EMS, who took the patient to [**Hospital1 6591**]. At the OSH he was thought to have R sided weakness and
head CT was "negative." He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED: VS: T 99.3, BP 204/116, HR 70, RR 20, O2 98% 4L. He
was found to have uremic breath, myoclonic jerks in upper and
lower extremities, and abdominal tenderness. Labs were notable
for Cr 10.3, BUN 68, AGap 28, K 5.5. Ca 7.7, Phos 10.1, WBC 9.4,
HCT 28.0. EKG showed no peaked Ts, TWI inferior leads. UA - WBC
26, RBC 61, Moderate Bacteria, Protein 300. CXR showed pulmonary
edema and with small pleural effusions. Nipride gtt was started
and patient's sbp dropped to 130. The gtt was then stopped and
he received Labetalol 20mg IV. Peritoneal cell count and
cultures were sent. 2g of ceftriaxone was given for suspected
peritonitis.
