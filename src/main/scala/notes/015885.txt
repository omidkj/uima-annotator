Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 year old female transferred from NH to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation of hypoxia and dyspnea, found to have bilateral
pulmonary emboli, and is admitted to ICU due to ?right heart
strain. Per, report she had a peripheral saturation of 64% at
her NH. She was put on 4L NC and sats increased to 80s.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  109/69, hr 62, rr20, sat 88 RA. bp
range 102-130/41-64. HR 65-94. 84-95% 3-4L NC.  A CTA confirmed
bilateral pulmonary emboli. Heparin gtt and bolus were started.
She also got a less than full dose of vancomycin (stopped as ct
showed no e/o pna) and a dose of ctx. Also ASA 325mg once. She
was given benadryl due to itching at the iv site during the
vancomycin infusion.
.
Transfer vitals af, hr 72, bp 102/61, rr 18, 94% 3L NC.  On
arrival to the MICU, she looked comfortable. She is demented.
Oriented to person only. She has no specific complaints but is
an unreliable historian.

CTA CHEST [**2181-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli, the largest of which
is in the right main pulmonary artery with findings suggestive
of early right heart strain. Recommended correlation with
echocardiography. 2. Bilateral ground-glass opacities in the
upper lobes are nonspecific. 3. Small hiatal hernia. 4. 12-mm
subcarinal lymph node, likely reactive. 5. 8 mm subcutaneous
nodule within the left anterior chest wall, possibly a sebaceous
cyst, for which clinical correlation is recommended. 6.
Cholelithiasis.

CXR [**2181-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with blunting of the left
costophrenic angle
suggestive of a small effusion.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2181-3-1**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right
ventricle with moderate systolic dysfunction. Normal global and
regional left ventricular systolic functino. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80F who was transferred from
her care facility to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of hypoxia and
shortness of breath. CTA demonstrated bilateral submassive
pulmonary emboli, and echocardiogram showed evidence of right
heart strain as above, so she was admitted to the medical ICU.
There, she remained hemodynamically stable and was started on
anticoagulation (initially with heparin gtt, then transitioned
to Lovenox therapeutic dosing; she was started on warfarin as
well for planned bridge). She was transferred to the general
medical [**Hospital1 **] on hospital day 2, where her breathing continued to
improve. She will likely require minimum of 6 months of
anticoagulation. Further work up for prothrombotic state
(malignancy, etc.) will be deferred to the outpatient setting.
She was discharged on a lovenox bridge (70 mg twice per day) to
be continued for 2 days after therapeutic INR. She was
discharged on coumadin 7.5 mg per day with instructions that
this is not a determined stable dose and will note close
monitoring - INR on discharge was 1.7. She did have a new oxygen
requirement upon discharge (84% on RA with ambulation).
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# DEPRESSION, FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA: Patient was alert and
pleasant but oriented only to self during this admission. She
was continued on her home doses of citalopram, divalproex,
buspirone, and risperdal.
.
# SLEEP APNEA: Patient unable to tolerate CPAP. No significant
complications were noted during this admission.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Hydrochlorothiazide was held during this
admission given concern for possible hemodynamic instability.
She remained normotensive throughout this admission so
hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued on discharge.
.
#GERD: Continued home dose of omeprazole.
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE:
- Patient will require overlap of warfar
