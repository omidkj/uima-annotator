Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o M with hx of NSCLC who is currently undergoing treatment
for recurrence; presents with one day of new hemoptysis.
.
# Hemoptysis: Pt. presented with hemoptysis and was stable
throughout the hospital course with only minimal (2-3cc) of
bloody sputum per episode which occured less than twice per day.
 His Hct remained stable throughout his hospital course.
He was seen by interventional pulmonology who did a flexible
bronchoscopy followed by a rigid bronchoscopy for Y-Stent
placement on the following day ([**2176-9-3**]).  The patient returned
from the PACU and had some maroon sputum overnight with
increased mucous and some desaturations initially to 88%.  His
oxygen level improved with nebulizers, mucomyst, and chest PT.
He was weaned down to his baseline oxygen requirement of 2
liters prior to discharge.  He was discharged on Mucomyst,
mucinex, and tessalon pearls.

# NSCLC: Pt. is currently undergoing chemotherapy with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 83212**], his outpatient oncologist.  There were no changes made
and he has f/u on Friday [**2176-9-6**].

# Vasovagal Presyncope: Pt. had recent episodes of vasovagal
presyncope and hypotension.  His BP meds were initially held,
but once BP was >140/90, Metoprolol was restarted.

# COPD: Pt was continued on Spiriva and his home O2 settings.
Oygen saturation isuues post-op most likely due to Y-Stent
placement and irritation of the airways.  This improved
throughout the course of the day.

# Hyperlipidemia: Pt. was continued on his statin

# Hypothyroidism: Pt. was continued on his normal Synthroid
dose.

# Hx of pituitary removal due to benign mass.  Pt. was continued
on his hydrocortisone dose and did well.

# FEN: Pt. was NPO prior to procedures, but otherwise ate a
normal diet and had a good appetite.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
1.  Hemoptysis
2.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
.
Secondary Diagnosis:
1. Adrenal Insufficiency


Discharge Condition:
Stable, O2 sats are 94% on 2LNC


Discharge Instructions:
You were brought to [**Hospital3 **] after having several episodes of
hemoptysis (coughing up blood).  You were observed in the
medical ICU here and were seen by the interventional lung
doctors who did a bronchoscopy to look at your airways.  They
found that your lung cancer was progressing into the airway and
causing some bleeding.  You returned to the operating room the
next day for another bronchoscopy and a stent was placed to keep
your airways open.
.
We started you on several new medications after your procedure
that will be extremely important for you to continue at home to
prevent mucous from building up in your stent.  These include:
1)We started mucinex
