Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 32 y/o female with a h/o SLE Nephritis w/ ESRD
on HD, HTN, MSSA endocarditis, H/O Line Sepsis, s/p R BKA,
seizure d/o, and restrictive lung disease presenting with pain
from sacral decubs and fever. Per transfer notes, the patient
had fevers 2 days prior at [**Known lastname 2286**] and was given Vancomyocin.
Over the past few months she has had pain at the site of her
decubitus which has escalated. She has pain throughout her body,
and decreased PO intake. She has not had a bowel movement in
several days. She reported no chest pain, pleuritic pain,
palpitations, or shortness of breath. She feels "fluid
overloaded".
.
She has a recent admission at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital from [**Date range (1) 17594**] with
SOB after [**Date range (1) 2286**]. She had a debridement of her hospital and
was emperically covered with Vanco and Ceftaz with subsequent
coverage with just Ceftaz for RLL PNA. She also had left
shoulder pain which was diagnosed as supraspinatus tendonitis
which was treated with prednisone and dilaudid.
.
Of note: Her CXR was unchanged from prior studies, and a CT ABD,
Pelvis demonstrated air tracking from her decub site. She had an
episode of hypotension (SBP 80's, baseline 90s) which was
treated with IVF fluids.

Relevent Imaging:

MR PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As seen on CT from six days
prior, gas is seen
in the gluteal muscles, especially along an apparent sinus tract
adjacent to
the gluteal crease on the right (6:31). There is generalized
marrow signal
abnormality throughout the pelvis and heterogenous marrow
re-conversion
sparing the epiphyses and apophyses, related to the patient's
debilitated
state. Even allowing for this background abnormal marrow signal,
there is
focally increased marrow signal on fluid-sensitive sequences at
the
sacrococcygeal junction, especially at S4-5 and the proximal
coccyx (9:30).
There is also fluid surrounding the sacrococcygeal junction,
with pre-sacral
fluid in contiguity with background ascites also seen on recent
CT. Diffuse
anasarca, and soft tissue edema are also again seen.

Bowel loops are not well evaluated due to patient motion, but
the rectum
appears unremarkable. The pelvic muscles elsewhere also appear
unremarkable.
The vertebral discs demonstrate slight degenerative signal and
endplate
irregularity at the lumbosacral junction.


IMPRESSION:

1. Sacral decubitus ulcer with gas in the gluteal muscles and
possible right
paramedian sinus tract.
2. Sacrococcygeal junction marrow abnormality and overlying
edema without
osseous erosion, but highly concerning for osteomyelitis.

Findings conveyed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10919**] the morning of [**2180-6-30**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CT LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.

INDICATION: 32-year-old female with left elbow joint effusion
and left
lateral elbow pain.

COMPARISON: Left elbow radiograph dated [**2180-6-29**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the left elbow were obtained
without
administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted
images were obtained.

FINDINGS:

The osseous structures are severely demineralized. There is no
definite
fracture and no dislocation, bone erosion, or focal osteolysis.
There is an
equivocal subtle lucency through the anterior aspect of the
radial head,
extending to the articular surface, likely representing a
nondisplaced
fracture, best seen on the sagittal series 702A images 106-111.
No other
fractures are seen, generalized osteopenia limits evaluation.

Effusion previously appreciated on the radiograph is not seen on
today's
study. There is generalized soft tissue edema, consistent with
anasarca.
There are vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION:
1. Subtle nondisplaced radial head fracture.
2. Anasarca.
Findings of fracture were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17595**] on [**2180-7-3**] at 12 p.m.

MMD

Addendum [**2180-7-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - There is possible linear
lucency, but no
definite fracture and no displaced fracture. Demonstration of a
possible
nondisplaced fracture is markedly limited by the surrounding
osteopenia.
Possibilities for further assessment include follow-up
radiographs 7-10 days
following the initial x-ray, MRI, or bone scan.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
