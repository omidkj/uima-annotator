CHEST SINGLE VIEW ON [**2115-11-2**]
FINDINGS: There has been interval decrease in the amount of
intra-abdominal free air. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in
location. There is a small amount of volume loss versus an early
infiltrate in the left lower lung.  Otherwise, the lungs are
clear.


[**2115-10-25**]
EXAMINATION: Non-contrast head CT.
COMPARISONS: Comparison to non-contrast head CT from [**2115-10-24**],
dating back to CTA of the head from [**2115-10-23**].
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable pattern of hemorrhage consistent with diffuse axonal
injury.
Dominant area of hemorrhage within the left subinsular region
with stable
associated mass effect and effacement of the left lateral
ventricle. Areas of
intraventricular hemorrhage stable. No evidence for new
hemorrhage.

2. Multiple fractures of the mandible and right
zygomaticomaxillary complex
fracture which are better evaluated on dedicated CT of the
facial bones from
[**2115-10-23**]. Please refer to CT facial bone report for further
characterization
and recommendations.

[**2115-10-23**]
Cerebral Angiogram
IMPRESSION: The patient underwent cerebral arteriography which
revealed no
evidence of arteriovenous malformations, AVMs or aneurysm, which
could be
responsible for his left putaminal hemorrhage






Brief Hospital Course:
[**2115-10-23**] Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] from scene. GCS4.  Imaging shows
Diffuse Axonal Injury w/ multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages
(largest L temporal); Right orbital and mandibular fractures
(body + R ramus). Neurosurgery consulted; bolt placed for ICP
monitoring. Mannitol and Dilantin started. His cervical spine
imaging was negative for any fractures or malalignment; disc
protrusion was noted at C4/5 and Neurosurgery spine recommended
to keep the cervical collar on until follow up in 4 weeks.

[**10-24**] Repeat head CT showed no interval change of intracranial
hematoma. Angio neg for AVM, good flow. ICP pressures <15. TF
started.

[**10-25**] Bolt removed. Post bolt CT: no new hemorrhage. ICPs [**2-6**];
Mannitol dose decreased. Slightly improved mental status, moving
all extremities. Sedation being weaned. U/S performed on right
inguinal area hematoma; showed hematoma with no pseudoaneurysm
or AV fistula.

[**10-26**] Febrile--urine, blood and sputum cultures sent. Imaging
shows LLL pneumonia. Vanc, Cipro, Zosyn started. Mannitol d/ced.
Neurosurgery signs off. Speech consulted for Passy Muir valve
for which he tolerated. Physical and Occupational therapy
consulted. Social work closely following.

[**10-27**] Percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy at bedside performed.

[**10-28**] Taken to the operating room by OMFS for closed reduction
with placement of intermaxillary fixation. His jaws were wired
shut. SQH started.

[**10-29**] Ventilator weaning initiated.

[**10-30**] On trach mask. Sputum culture grew pan sensitive staph,
Hflu. Vanco and Zosyn stopped. Continued Cipro for an additional
7 day course. Physical and Occupational therapy consulted.

[**10-31**] Transferred to the regular nursing unit floor. Remains
hemodynamically stable.

[**11-1**] Case management continuing screening for acute rehab
placement.

[**11-3**] Febrile up to 101.8; he was pan cultured, chest xray still
showing a LLL infiltrate and so Vancomycin and Zosyn were
started. His WBC was 19.6 at that time. He does have a
productive cough with copious secretions. Final culture results
are pending but he is currently being treated empirically.
Discussions whether to perform an LP took place between the
trauma team and Neurosurgery.

[**11-4**] WBC down to 14 and temp 100.8. Discussed with neurosurgery
whether they still wanted to do the LP; given that he was
clinically improving the decision was made to hold off as the
infection source was likely from his lungs. His sodium was
intermittently elevated, as high as 155 with ranges from
147-155. He was given free water boluses and his IV fluids were
increased; Na level on [**11-4**] was 152. he was discharged to rehab
facility.
