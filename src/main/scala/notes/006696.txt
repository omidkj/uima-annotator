Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 32950**] is an 87 year-old Russian-speaking male with h/o
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a. fib with tachy-brady syndrome
s/p recent dual [**Last Name (un) **] who presents with progressive dysnpea for 2
days.  Notes decreasing exercise capacity with DOE over past few
days, limiting ability to walk steps or long distances.  Denies
pre-syncope, syncopal episodes.  Also reports 15 minute episodes
of chest pressure at rest, sub-sternal, without associated
symptoms that resolve spontaneosly.  These episodes started
yesterday.  Also endorses orthopnea and episode of PND last
night.  No palpitations.  Oxygen relieves his sense of dyspnea.
He is compliant with medications.  No weight changes.  Denies
fevers/chills/cough.  No abdominal pain, distended abdomen is at
baseline.  Last BM this morning, denies melena/BRBPR.  Today, he
notes persistent dyspnea along with feeling sweaty and malaise.
VNA was concerned about his respiratory status, and patient was
sent to ED for evaluation.
.
History obtained through Russian interpreter through patient,
patient's wife, and patient's sister.
.
In the ER, vitals were. EKG showed v-paced rhythm. CXR showed
cardiomegaly, trace right pleural effusion. He was given ASA 325
mg, furosemide 40 mg IV, and transferred to floor.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECG [**4-6**]:
Demand ventricular pacing. Visible endogenous beats show right
bundle-branch block with left axis deviation consistent with
left anterior hemiblock. Native complexes are newly seen
compared to tracing #1. Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2178-3-24**] ventricular pacing is new.

EKG: [**2178-3-24**]: Irregular rhythm of uncertain mechansim but may be
atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch
block. Left anterior fascicular block.  Consider biventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities are primary. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2178-3-23**]
no significant change.

CXR Portable [**4-6**]. The patient has a pacemaker with leads
terminating in the right ventricle and right atrium. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from previous study
and is somewhat enlarged. The lungs are clear with no masses or
lobar consolidation. The right costophrenic angle is mildly
blunted, suggesting a small right pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumonia.
2. Stable cardiomegaly.
3. Trace right pleural effusion.

CXR [**4-8**]: In comparison to the previous chest radiograph, [**4-6**], [**2177**], there has been a subtle increase in density in the
diffuse opacity in the right mid and lower lungs which could be
due to pneumonia in the correct clinical situation. Otherwise,
mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists and blunting of the
right costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion,
unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly is stable and atrial and
ventricular pacing leads are unchanged and in standard position.
IMPRESSION: Increased consolidation in the right lung base could
be due to evolving infection. Clinical correlation is advised.

TEE [**4-8**]: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.

EKG [**2178-4-9**]: AV paced, HR 75, LAD, LVH, QTc 479

CXR [**2178-4-11**]: Chronic failure. Pulmonary edema, bilateral
effusions and atelectasis persist.

PRIOR STUDIES:
ECHO [**2178-3-19**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is asymmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
