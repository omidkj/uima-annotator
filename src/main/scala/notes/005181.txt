COMMENTS:
1.Coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant circulation
with
severe three-vessel disease.  LMCA had no angiographically
apparent CAD.
LAD had a proximal mildly calcified 80-90% stenosis close to the
take
off of D1 and D2, which was in close proximity to D1.  LCX was
80%
stenotic proximal to trifurcation of LCX, OM1 and OM2.  RCA was
totally and thrombotically occluded after the takeoff of acute
marginal.  Distal RCA was filled via collaterals from LCX.
2.Resting hemodynamics post angiography revealed normal aortic
pressure. Both right and left sided filling pressures were
mildly elevated.  There was a gradient of 13 mmHg across the
pulmonic valve.  Fick calculated cardiac output and cardiac
index was 5.6 L/min and 3.3 L/min/m2, respectively.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the RCA with overlapping 3.5x13mm

Hepacoat (prox), 3.0x28mm Hepacoat (more distal), 2.75x18mm
Hepacoat
(more distal), 2.5x18mm (more distal), 2.75x18mm (Hepacoat) and
2.25x23mm Hepacoat (more distal). Final angiography revealed no
residual dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. There was 13 mmHg gradient across the pulmonic valve.
3. Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
4. PCI of the RCA.

Brief Hospital Course:
CAD: upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt had diffuse ST depressions and ST
elevations in V1, V2.  taken to cath, was found to have
thrombosed RCA with PCI and 3 vessel disease. RCA was
successfully stented with a cypher stent.  Reopro was continued
for 12 hours, then, the patient was placed an asa, plavix, and
atorvastatin. Of note
patient is intolerant to ACEI's with a document rise in Cr, so
valsartan 80 was started on discharge

Pump: EF was 30% on arrival, post-cath = 20%, [**12-21**]+MR, with
apical hypokinesis and severely depressed LV function.  patient
was on afterload reducers (hydralazine, isordil) on admission,
however was hypotensive, so those meds were held.
-PCWP 11 on cath, wet on exam, so diuresis was started, with
poor response to lasix.  The patient subsequently diuresed
spontaneously when BP increased to normal levels.
-the patient was still in mild CHF upon the discharge, so
discharged home on a dose of PO Lasix 40mg po qd

Rhythm: patient has a AV pacer installed for a hx of
bradycardia.  remained in NSR [**Hospital 6028**] hospital stay, except
for few episodes of asx a-fib that were medically treated.
patient went in and out of v-paced rhythm with HR of 75.  pacer
was interrogated by EP they determined that the battery needed
to be replaced but could not do it this admission to to mrs. [**Known lastname 110766**] pneumonia.  follow up at device clinic will be scheduled
 (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**]

Pulm: The patient was extubated successfully of the day of
cardiac cath, with persistent o2 requirement, at time of
discharge she was on 2L NC saturating between 92-95%_.
-pt developed cough with a blood-tinged sputum when CXR on [**9-2**]
revealing mild CHF and post RLL infiltrate consistent with
bronchopneumonia, patient was started on renally dosed levaquin.

ARF: baseline renal insufficiency.  pt's cr actually improved
and was stable at 1.4 at the time of discharged.

FEN: patient was placed on 2g NA heart healthy diet, but did not
take very good [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was supplemented with boost shakes and
breakfast pudding.

Heme: pt had a drop in Hct from 34-27 and was trasfused 2 units
of PRBCs with good Hct response.  Hct on discharge was stable at
34.4.
-due to apical akinesis, dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's primary
cardiologist recommdation started anti-coag with coumadin with
heparin bridge on discharge.  PTT was 76 at the time of
discharge.  heparin and coumadin therapy to be tailored at
