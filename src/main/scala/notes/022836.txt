has significant abdominal tenderness in setting of renal

The patient has received kayexylate, Ca, and bicarb for her
hyperkalemia. No peaked T waves on EKG.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82238**] was admitted to the [**Known lastname **] ICU on [**2164-3-21**].  Her
potassium at the time of admission was 5.6, and she was treated
with calcium gluconate, kayexalate, and sodium bicarbonate for
the hyperkalemia.  Her EKG was negative for T-wave changes.  Her
creatinine at time of admission was found to be 5.7, and her
urine was positive for E.coli.  She was started on empiric
ciprofloxacin and flagyl and kept strict NPO and hydrated with
IV fluids. A CT scan at time of admission showed the following:

Hypodense cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas with
associated
calcification. This finding may represent a benign cyst or
cystic neoplasm.
Associated pancreatic ductal dilatation, common bile duct
dilatation and
gallbladder distention is also noted.

On [**3-22**] she was transferred from the ICU to the floor and had a
right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound which showed the
following:

1. Distended gallbladder, however no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
cholecystitis.
2. Prominent CBD measuring up to 9 mm.
3. Both the gallbladder distention and CBD dilation may be
related to the
pancreatic head lesion seen on CT, and a multiphasic CT or MRI
of the abdomen
is recommended when feasible.

On [**3-23**] - [**3-25**], her stool was found to be positive for c.diff
and she was continued on IV cipro/flagyl, hydration and NPO
status.  Her potassium was normalized at 3.7 and creatinine was
2.9.  A CA [**73**]-9 was 19, and CEA was 3.

On [**3-26**] she underwent endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy of the
pancreatic cyst.  Cyst fluid was negative for malignant cells
with cyst fluid amylase 165 and CEA 655.

On [**3-27**] she was advanced to a clear diet.  Ciprofloxacin was
discontinued, and she was transitioned to PO medications.

On [**3-28**] she was advanced to a regular diet without difficulty.
She complained of left foot pain and was started on a 5-day
course of prednisone for likely gout flare in her left great
toe; pain improved later that day.

On [**3-29**] she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and
voiding without assitance, pain was well controlled.  She was
continued on Flagyl for cdiff with resolutions of loose stools.
