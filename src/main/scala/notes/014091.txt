Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] with hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
50 year old male with no medical care in over 20 years. Patient
presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 84493**] office yesterday ([**2183-8-11**]) to
establish primary care and was noted to have an elevated BP
180/120 and tachycardia 120. Patient was sent to [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**]
ER and troponins were trended - 0.014, 0.02, 0.017. ECHO
demonstrated EF 15-20% and consequently patient was transfered
to [**Location (un) 86**] [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Prior to transfer patient received ASA
325 mg and Heparin. Cath demonstrated clean coronaries, however
did show elevated filling pressures, pulmonary hypertension and
low CO. Patient was hypertensive in cath lab and started on
Nitroglycerin and Nitropresside. Patient was admitted to CCU for
further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.
.
Patient reports shortness of breath of one year duration,
however worsened in the past month. Patient becomes SOB walking
several yards, prior he was able to walk a 18-hole golf course.
1 month ago patient describes malaise, weakness, fatigue,
increased urination and diarrhea for 1 week duration. Patient
states it improved when he decreased his fluid intake (cola).
During this peroid he had an epidose of dizziness (no LOC,
syncope) which improved with rest.  Patient denies PND or lower
extremity edema. Denies chest pain, but does complain of
intermittent epigastric discomfort and palpitations. Patient
unaware of an history of HTN or high cholesterol. He has a
history of very heavy alcohol use in the past but has since cut
down to ~14 drinks per week.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2183-8-13**]:
1. Selective angiography in this right dominant system revealed
no angiographically significant disease. The LMCA was normal.
The LAD, Cx and RCA had mild diffuse disease.
2. The renal arteries were widely patent bilaterally.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 24mm Hg and LVEDP of 46mm Hg.
There was severe systemic systolic and diastolic hypertension
with SBP of 169/125mm Hg.
4. There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback from LV
to the aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Diuresis, blood pressure control and risk factor
modification.
.
CXR [**2183-8-14**]:
1. No signs of fluid overload.
2. Leftward tracheal deviation concerning for superior
mediastinal mass; further workup recommended if clinically
warranted.
.
CT NECK [**2183-8-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tracheal deviation seen radiographically is secondary to
heterogeneous enlargement of the right thyroid, most likely
goiter. However, thyroid ultrasound may be considered for
further evaluation to exclude neoplasm arising in a goiter if
not previously evaluated.
2. Right paratracheal rounded hypoattenuating structure is more
likely to represent a congenital cystic structure (i.e. small
bronchial cyst) than a lymph node.
3. Small pericardial effusion.
4. Bilateral very small pleural effusions, accompanied by mild
hydrostatic edema.

.
50yo overweight M no [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with hypertensive
emergency with systolic HF on ECHO now s/p cath with clean
arteries.
.
# PUMP: The patient presented subacutely with systolic heart
failure with an EF of 15-20% and mild global hypokinesis. Mildly
dilated LV cavity with moderate LVH. Mild to mod MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**]
pulmonary HTN. Likely dilated cardiomyopathy with unclear
etiology - most likely [**12-30**] hypertension vs. alcohol.
Hemochromatosis, thyroid, HIV workup negative. Ischemia unlikely
as cath showed mild diffuse disease with elevated left and right
sided diastolic filling pressures but no focal lesions. Diuresed
well during admission. The pt was started on Lisinopril 40,
Carvedilol 12.5 po bid, HCTZ 25 po qd. A low salt diet was
explained as well as monitoring of weight changes. Alcohol
cessation was discussed.
.
# CORONARIES: Cath showed mild diffuse disease with no focal
lesions of note. Cholesterol studies show LDL 66, HDL 29, TG
113, Chol 118. Aspirin 81mg po daily was started. HDL is low -
pt was couseled regarding increasing daily exercise and
following up with PCP.
.
# HYPERTENSION: The patient was admitted with hypertensive
emergency given his systolic HF. Cr was mildly elevated but
stable. Optho exam was unremarkable. No renal artery stenosis
seen on cath. Potassium within normal limits therefore unlikely
