CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-17**] 7:13 PM
IMPRESSION: Small right pneumothorax

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-19**] 11:37 AM
1) Interval placement of a right subclavian venous catheter in
good position.
2) Stable size of the right apical pneumothorax.
3) Stable atelectasis at the left base.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-21**] 10:20 AM
Comparison is made to prior study 2 days ago. Right apical
pneumothorax looks slightly smaller. Basilar density is
essentially unchanged. This may represent consolidation,
atelectasis and/or effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14731**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service at
[**Hospital1 18**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14732**] care on [**2182-9-17**].  On that day he
underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsies, fiberoptic
bronchoscopy and right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph
node dissection.  For details of the operation, see procedure
note.  Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural line placed
and a foley catheter and 2 chest tubes placed intraoperatively.
His primary issue in the immediate post-op period was pressure
support for which he was placed on a neosynephrine drip-stopped
prior to going to the floor.  Due to his BP issues, his epidural
was removed on POD#1 and a PCA was installed for pain control.

On POD#2, the patient went into atrial fibrillation and was
treated with 2g of IV magnesium sulfate, fluid boluses, 150cc
amiodarone bolus x2, calcium chloride, diltiazem and was then
moved to the critical care unit for BP monitoring.  At that time
he was started on a diltiazem drip.

On POD#3, patient's hematocrit was noted to be 26.8; however, a
repeat hematocrit was 29.3 and it was decided not to transfuse
the patient with blood products. Also, the patient was moved to
the floor after being deemed stable enough on the diltiazem drip
that same day.

On POD#4, the chest tubes and foley catheter were removed.
Also, the patient was started on a Heparin drip and coumadin 5mg
QHS for anticoagulation secondary to the atrial fibrillation.
EPS was consulted at that time and recommended maintaining
amiodarone at 800mg/day for 1 week, 400 mg/day 2 weeks
thereafter and finally 200mg/day to finish.  Also, the diltiazem
drip was subsequently discontinued that day.  They also
requested the patient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in
Cardiology/[**Hospital **] Clinic in 6 weeks and to continue on coumadin
until then.

On POD#7, patient became therapeutic on his coumadin with an INR
of 2.3.  He was seen by physical therapy who had recommended he
be placed in a rehabilitation facility for further conditioning
the previous day.  He was finally discharged on POD#8, [**2182-9-25**],
in good condition, tolerating a house diet and ambulating with
assistance.  He is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in [**12-7**]
weeks and to call for an appointment.  He must also continue
having his PTT/INR checked on a daily basis for conitnued
coumadin dosing.
