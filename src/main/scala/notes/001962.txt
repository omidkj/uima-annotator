This is an addendum to the discharge summary that was
completed on [**11-27**] and will detail the hospital course
from [**2107-11-28**] to date of discharge [**2107-12-2**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  Patient was able to be weaned off the
ventilator without complication.  She was started on
supplemental oxygen with nasal cannula with saturation in the
high 90 percentile.  She was weaned off her nasal cannula.
She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs around the block
secondary to wheezes.  She was continued on her Solu-Medrol
with taper secondary to her asthma flare.  Given her improved
pulmonary status, original plans to consider a possible trach
were discontinued.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Patient was on a Lasix infusion
secondary to congestive heart failure.  Patient then began to
show signs of having intravascular volume depletion with CVP
as low as four.  Her Lasix was weaned to off and patient's
I:Os were essentially equal which she was able to tolerate
without difficulty.  The patient was monitored on Telemetry
and continued to have normal sinus rhythm.

She was continued on her Amiodarone secondary to her episode
of atrial fibrillation and this was weaned to 400 mg p.o. q.
day at the time of discharge.  She is to continue on a taper
and should be on Amiodarone for a total of one month after
her incident of atrial fibrillation. The patient was taken
off her Enalaprilat IV and transitioned to Enalapril at 5 mg
p.o. q. day.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient is on day #9 out of 14 for
Flagyl secondary to Clostridium difficile.  Day #9 out of 14
for Vancomycin secondary to methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  Day #7 of 14 of Bactrim
for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in sputum.  Her Vancomycin
and Bactrim were transitioned to renal dosing secondary to
the patient's compromised creatinine clearance.  She has
remained afebrile over the past several days.

4.  RENAL:  Patient's creatinine was slowly increasing and
hit a high of 2.2.  It was felt this was secondary to
intravascular volume depletion and decreased renal profusion.
The patient was no longer aggressively diuresed and her
creatinine continued to improve with the latest value at 1.7
on the day of discharge.  Until her creatinine clearance
improves further, she will continue to have her medications
renally dosed.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient is receiving NPH insulin and regular
insulin sliding scale correction for hyperglycemia while on
Solu-Medrol.  Her insulin will need to be adjusted as her
Solu-Medrol is tapered.

6.  HEMATOLOGIC:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable at 28
and required no further transfusion.

7.  PSYCHIATRY:  Patient had issues of anxiety contributing
to many of her symptoms.  She was given Klonopin which was
titrated to 0.25 mg t.i.d. with any further advancement
deferred secondary to increased sedation.  The patient was
also started on a trial of Haldol, but this was discontinued
secondary to the family's request.  The patient was
subsequently started on Zyprexa at 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was
also started on Paxil for signs of depression.  Patient has
an order for Ativan p.r.n., although administration was
limited secondary to patient's sedation.

8.  FEN:  Patient was taken off of her tubes feeds once she
was extubated.  She was maintained on IV fluid hydration at a
maintenance rate of 75 cc of half normal saline.  Her
potassium and magnesium were repleted while she was on
aggressive diuresis, but these were maintained within normal
range once her Lasix drip was discontinued.  She is taking
p.o. without difficulty swallowing and will have this
advanced as tolerated.  Patient currently has a left IJ in
place, Foley.

9.  SKIN:  Patient had her abdominal staples removed from her
surgical site.  A few inferior staples were left secondary to
skin edges not yet being appropriated.  Patient has
Steri-strips in place.

10.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on subcutaneous
heparin and Protonix.

11.  Code is still full.  Patient's primary contact is her
son, [**Name (NI) **], but frequent communication is also maintained
with her other sons, [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **].

DISPOSITION:  It was felt that the patient was stable for
discharge.  PT evaluated the patient and recommended
inpatient rehabilitation for several weeks.

intubation.
2.  Pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
