Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18036**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room, resuscitated
with IV fluids, had her stomach decompressed with a nasogastric
tube and had an urgent Abd CT done which showed a mesenteric
volvulus with small bowel ischemia.  She was taken to the
Operating Room urgently for an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions and reduction of the volvulus ( see formal Operative
note for more details )  her hemodynamics improved during and
after the procedure and she was taken to the Surgical ICU,
intubated but in stable condition.
She was extubated without any difficulty on post op day #1 and
the pain service was consulted for help with her pain control as
she has chronic pain, mainly back oain, and was on Methadone and
Oxycodone pre operatively. She was treated with a Dilaudid PCA
and eventually a Ketamine drip was added.  Her methadone was
also resumed as she had a functioning ostomy.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor her pain manageement
was the major issue and she was seen daily by the Chronic pain
service to help with adjustments.  On post op day # 4 her
ketamine was discontinued and she was transitioned to oral pain
medication including her pre op methadone and dilaudid 4-8 mg PO
q3 hrs prn pain.
She was tolerating a stage 5 diet and her ostomy was active.
Her abdominal wound was clean without drainage or evidence of
erythema.
After an uneventful post op course she was discharged to home on
[**2103-4-4**] with VNA services for wound and ostomy care.
