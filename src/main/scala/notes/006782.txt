Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laparoscopic cholecystectomy

History of Present Illness:
47M with long standing history of alcholism presented to [**Hospital 8641**]
hospital with 3-4 days history of continuous RUQ pain. Patient
states this pain has been a long [**Last Name **] problem for several
years and comes after eating or drinking too much. The pain
typically is dull and resolves after several hours, sometimes
days. He presented to the hospital last evening because the pain
was constant, sharper and was associated with cramping. Patient
also reports some mild nausea but denies vomiting, change in
stool, melena, hematocchezia, fevers, chills, weight loss or
fatigue.

Social History:
On disability. 1 case of beer weekly, 1.5 PPD smoking, Occ MJ
distant cocaine. Tattoos obtained from family member.

GENERAL: Extremely tan male in NAD
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear.
NECK: Supple
HEART: Irregularly irregular, normal S1 S2
LUNGS: CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored.

ABDOMEN: Soft, no masses noted. TTP in RUQ, [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign is
present
EXTREMITIES: WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
LYMPH: No cervical LAD.
NEURO: Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING: ECG: ([**7-24**]) Sinus tachycardia.
ECG ([**7-25**]): Atrial fibrillation.
ECG ([**7-26**]): Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific
diffuse low amplitude T waves with T wave inversions in leads
V1-V2. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2158-7-25**] atrial fibrillation has been replaced
by sinus rhythm.

RUQ ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLERS: 1. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder
distention. If there is persistent clinical concern for acute
cholecystitis, HIDA scan could be performed. 2. Increased
echogenicity of the liver compatible with diffuse fatty
infiltration. Please note that more advanced forms of liver
disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded. 3.
Reversal of flow in the portal vein, splenomegaly and multiple
splenic varices. 4. Right-sided pleural effusion.

HIDA SCAN 1. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. 2. Delayed
tracer clearance secondary to hepatic dysfunction.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 1. Portal vein patency cannot be assessed without a
technically adequate portal venous phase image. The patient can
be rescanned using bolus tracking technique if clinical concern
for portal vein thrombus persists. 2. Portal adenopathy, splenic
vein tortuosity, and anasarca consistent with liver cirrhosis.
3. Distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid, most likely
secondary to third spacing and liver dysfunction rather than
cholecystitis. 4. Age indeterminant compression fracture of T11.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed due to
severe hypokinesis of the distal two-thirds of the left
ventricle (LVEF= 30-35 %). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal LV cavity size with severe hypokinesis of the
distal [**1-26**] of the ventricle. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle. Mild, posteriorly directed, mitral regurgitation,
likely due to leaflet tethering.

[**2158-8-2**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz
catheter, are unchanged. Moderate
cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and signs of
moderate to severe pulmonary edema. The changes are stable since
the previous examination. No evidence of pneumothorax. Stable
appearance of the mediastinal and hilar contours.

[**2158-8-3**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque t. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital to the Medical Service
with abdominal pain and a distended and large gallbladder.  He
underwent a number of imaging studies that demonstrated a
distended gallbladder with stones.  He also underwent a HIDA
scan that did not demonstrate any evidence of cystic duct
obstruction.  Additionally he underwent additional medical
workup which revealed Hep C, cirrhosis with ascites, as well as
poor cardiac function with an EF 30-35%. He was watched for
several days, but over the course of the weekend of [**2158-7-30**],
he developed an increase in abdominal pain despite antibiotics.
At that point we elected to take him to the operating room for
laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Postoperatively the patient was
unable to extubate and was admitted to the ICU. He was oliguric
postoperatively and extubated uneventfully. He was
conservatively resuscitated with IVF on POD 1 but continued to
be oliguric. Echo was performed which showed worsening
biventricular heart failure with EF estimated between 15-35% and
associted TR. A swan ganz catheter was floated for better
hemodynamic monitoring. Over the course of the next days he had
had increasing right heart failure, poor oxygenation requiring
reintubation, atrial fibrillation requiring chemical and
electrical cardioversion as well as volume overload requiring
CVVH.  He remained hypotensive throughout his sicu course and he
had increasing pressor support. There was suspicion for
pulmonary embolus but the patient was never stable enough to go
to the CT scanner. On [**2158-8-3**] he was on maximal pressor support.
A family meeting was held and the decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only. He expired shortly thereafter at
18:10 on [**2158-8-3**].
