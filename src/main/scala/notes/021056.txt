Admission Date:  [**2143-9-24**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain/pressure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
inferior myocardial infarction in [**2135**], percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty to the right coronary
artery, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who presented
with sharp substernal chest pain that woke her up from her
sleep on the day of admission, that lasted half an hour at
5:30, and then resolved.  However, the patient had another
substernal chest pain and pressure that brought her to her
primary care physician where the pain abated.  The patient
describes the pain as [**4-30**] to [**5-30**] with pressure.
.....................  The pain was nonradiating.  Denied any
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting.  No syncope.  The patient described that this pain
did not feel like that when she had her myocardial infarction
in the past.  No heartburn.  No pleuritic chest component.
Did not hurt anymore when she coughs.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, left main artery 60%, 70% left
anterior descending artery, 90% of right coronary artery.
The right coronary artery with percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stented, and status post inferior
myocardial infarction in [**2135**].
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus
3.  Osteoporosis.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Status post appendectomy.
8.  Status post oophorectomy.
9.  Status post hip surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Hydrochlorothiazide, Procardia,
Lopressor, Prinivil, Zocor, Micronase, and Prilosec.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location **].  She quit
smoking 10 years ago.  Occasional alcohol; two glasses of
wine at home per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Physical examination on
admission included a pulse of 62, blood pressure of 154/80.
Generally, was a well-appearing elderly female in no acute
distress.  HEENT revealed extraocular muscles were intact.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Neck revealed jugular venous distention was
8 cm.  Cardiovascular had a regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
A 3/6 systolic blowing murmur heard best at the apex.
Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended, with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Vascular revealed dorsalis pedis nonpalpable bilaterally.
Rectal was guaiac-negative.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratories on admission
included a white blood cell count of 5.9, hematocrit of 32.
Chem-7 was within normal limits.  BUN and creatinine of 21
and 0.8.  Creatine kinase #1 was 112 with a MB of 9.
Troponin of 10.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 60 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals,
ST elevations in V2 through V5, inverted T waves in III.

Echocardiogram on [**9-16**] revealed an left ventricular
ejection fraction of greater than 55%, ....................
mildly dilated, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, mild pulmonary
hypertension, normal left ventricular function.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**]
Firm for rule out myocardial infarction.  The patient ruled
in for a myocardial infarction with first troponin I of 10.8.
Troponin #2 was its peak at 20.9 with a creatine kinase
of 132, index of 8, MB of 11.  Creatine kinase #3 was 112,
with a MB of 8, troponin was 9.4.  The patient was started on
heparin, aspirin, and Lopressor, and the patient was to be
taken for catheterization the following day.

Upon arrival to the cardiac catheterization laboratory the
patient was found to be severely hypoxic despite 100% oxygen
saturation by face mask.  Hypoxia was confirmed by oxygen
saturation measurements and an arterial blood gas.  Oxygen
saturation subsequently improved during the right heart
catheterization. .................... right and left-sided
filling pressures with a mean RA of 10, pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 19, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
of 22, pulmonary hypertension was noted with a systolic
pressure of 51.  Left ventriculography revealed akinesis of
the anterior and apical wall with hypokinesis of the inferior
wall.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was measured to
be 38%.  Echocardiogram revealed the left main artery was
normal, the proximal left anterior descending artery had a
diffuse 80% stenosis with ...................., the left
circumflex had a 30% stenosis such that it involved the
origin of the first obtuse marginal branch.  The right
coronary artery was dominant and totally occluded in its
proximal segment.  The distal right coronary artery territory
was filled by a left-to-right collateral ....................
left anterior descending artery.  The patient had stenting
times two of the proximal left anterior descending artery,
and there was no residual stenosis, normal flow, and no
apparent dissection.

The patient was then admitted to the Coronary Care Unit
status post catheterization due to her decreased oxygenation.
While in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was given
aggressive diuresis.  Oxygen saturations improved, and the
patient was monitored.  The patient had an episode of
agitation the night of [**9-26**] in the Coronary Care Unit
and was then quieted down; due to Intensive Care Unit
psychosis, and no abnormalities were found.

On [**2143-9-27**], the patient was transferred out to the
floor to the [**Hospital1 139**] firm again.  The patient was stable after
her catheterization, status post Coronary Care Unit.  The
patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed an left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities of middle anterior akinetic, middle
anteroseptal akinetic, basal inferior septal hypokinetic,
mild inferolateral hypokinesis, apex akinetic, distal lateral
akinesis which were new compared to the echocardiogram on
[**9-16**].

The patient was stable on the floor with creatine kinases
peaking status post catheterization at 631 and then went down
to 351, and then we stopped monitoring them.  The patient was
stable on the floor.  Blood pressures were monitored and
followed closely.  The patient had an episode of hypertension
on [**2143-9-28**], and captopril was titrated from the
b.i.d. regimen to t.i.d.

On [**2143-9-29**], the patient was stable and blood
pressures were more stable.  We titrated her captopril back
up to t.i.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  On the day of discharge, [**2143-9-30**] the patient was stable.  Vital signs were stable.
Physical examination was as mentioned on admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was to be discharged to an
acute rehabilitation center for further cardiac
rehabilitation following her myocardial infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: (The patient was sent home on the
following medications)
1.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Carvedilol .................... mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the future, and will go to cardiac
rehabilitation for further strengthening and conditioning.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  The patient was discharged with a
diagnosis of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
