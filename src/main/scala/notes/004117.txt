History of Present Illness:
76 yo male with below med hx presents with bilateral parotitis
suspectedly due to dehydration who are consulting for help with
management of fluid balance and question of when to restart
[**First Name3 (LF) 17339**]. Pt reports increasing parotid pain and swelling for 4
days associated with worsening dry mouth. He denies fever,
chills, cough or sick contacts but does produced very thick oral
secretions that he has to spit out and are white in color. Pain
on left face radiates up to his ear but no changes in hearing.
He reports not being able to tolerate PO's since his radiation
but has be taking 2 cans of G-tube feeds tid along with 2x 16oz
boluses of water [**Hospital1 **] consistently. He denies current diziness
but does report diziness with standing in the past around his
time of chemotherapy which is why he was taken off his lasix and
lopressor. His blood pressure had been in the low 100's systolic
and so they have not been reinitiated. He is very sedentary and
does report intermittent LE swelling worse on the left leg where
his SVG CABG graft was harvested from. He denies any CP, CT,
SOB, PND or orthopnea. He stopped his [**Hospital1 17339**] 2 months ago since
he had to start Diflucan to treat XRT associated thrush and has
not initiated it since. He lost >20 lb's over the past 3 months
and felt that his cholesterol can't be bad at this point.

[**11-26**] CXR: Patchy opacities throughout the left lung are
concerning for pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**11-27**] CXR: Compared with [**2147-11-27**], the moderately extensive left
lung
infiltrate shows marked interval consolidation, consistent with
progressive pneumonia and/or intra-alveolar blood or infarction.

Right lung remains grossly clear. No CHF.
.

[**11-27**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular  wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral  valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.  Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2147-12-3**] 3:51 PM
1. Interval marked worsening of alveolar consolidations
including the entire lungs The findings appear consistent with
infection ehich might overlay aspiration, especially in the
setting of gradual worsening.
2. No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
3. Small associated bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Mild-to-moderate emphysema, unchanged.
5. Heterogeneous spleen enhancement with rounded hypodense
lesions might represent splenic infection.
.
[**12-2**]
Bronchial lavage:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Scant cellularity with bronchial epithelial cells,
  pulmonary macrophages and blood.
.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2147-12-4**] 10:17 AM
Limited study, without definite fluid collection. Fluid in
nasopharynx and upper trachea, with fluid density posterior to
left nasopharynx, probably a continuation of nasopharyngeal
cavity. No definite abscess. Mild diffuse increase of the
subcutaneous fat, especially at the level of the tongue base,
which can be due to edema, however, inflammation in this area
cannot be totally excluded given the clinical setting. Please
correlate with physical examination.
.
[**2147-12-18**]
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
Limited study due to bony artifact from patient's arms in the
scanner. Bilateral pleural effusions, intra-abdominal fluid, and
anasarca are suggestive of fluid overload. No evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed or fluid collections within the abdomen.
.
Tracheal Wall Bx:
Fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and focal ossification.
No malignancy identified.
.
Skin Bx [**2147-12-12**]
Skin, left cheek, biopsy (A):

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with adjacent granulomas, some
containing fragmented elastic fibers (see note).

No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the bilateral lower
extremities.
