History of Present Illness:
PCP:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 103326**],  [**Hospital3 103327**], Suite #202,

Briefly, 81 yo male with Hx of ischemic cardiomnypothy s/p CABG,
CHF (EF 30%), DM, and peripheral vascular disease s/p bipass
with graft on left femoral artery in [**Month (only) **]. Since discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 359**], he did not take any of his CHF meds, and
now returns increased swelling in his abdomen, legs. Orthopnea,
+DOE (can only walk to the bathroom, can not climb a flight of
stairs [**1-31**] to dyspnea) as well as 50lbs weight gain specially
over the last week. He finally came back to ED on [**12-15**] b/c
groin abscess and was initially admitted to vascular service.
The abcess was drained and he was started on nafcillin on [**12-15**].
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for diuresis on [**12-18**].

On the floor, he was started on a lasix gtt (5 -> 10 mg/hr) with
50-100cc output in 24hrs. He was given one dose of chlorthiazide
and loaded with digoxin. Creatinine was increased to 3.9 from
baseline of 1.5. Renal consulted for further eval of oliguria.
Urology also following because he was having urinary retention.
Foley placed (and then replaced) by urology but still not
draining adequately. He was given one dose of hyoscyamine
ungoing bladder spasm and per urology giving  but can exacerbate
tachycardia (only recived one dose)

Given the poor response to lasix gtt, the CHF service has
requested transfer to CCU for pressors (milrinone) to see if he
will autodiurese with improved cardiac output.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2127-12-15**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
