Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, worsening fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p biventricular pacing/defibrillator system.


History of Present Illness:
61 year old man with a PMH notable for ischemic cardiomyopathy.
He has had two prior myocardial infarctions, the first in [**2092**]
and the second in [**2096**]. He also has undergone multiple PCI??????s,
the most recent being an angioplasty at [**Hospital1 756**]
and Women??????s Hospital in [**2106**]. He does complain of chest
discomfort. He does get significant shortness of breath with
mild to moderate exertion. This can occur with activities like
emptying the garbage. Given his degree of cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 26%, he has been referred for LV lead
placement with biventricular upgrade.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal IVC diameter
(<2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA
pressure indeterminate).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Focal apical
hypokinesis of RV free wall.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
([**11-30**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The basal
inferolateral wall contracts best. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with focal severe hypokinesis of the apical half of the free
wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to
moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Right ventricular apical free wall
hypokinesis.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibotor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2106**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
