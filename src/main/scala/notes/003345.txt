Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Morphine / Penicillin G Sodium / Cortisone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4421**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers and rigors of unknown cause.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 yo woman with recent diagnosis of stage III, suboptimally
debulked ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**Month (only) 956**], presented with
respiratory distress and fever. She tolerated her first cycle of
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] carboplatin beautifully 12 hours prior, and then
developed fever and chills at 3 AM today. In the ED, her T was
102 degrees F PO. CXR was consistent with CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 100467**]
range).  Patient denies cough/headahce/photophobia/chest
pain/diarrhea/sick contact.  She recieved vancomycin and
levofloxacin in the ED for a possible infection, although no
site of infection was identified.

Upon admission, she was febrile to 103 degrees F PO with rigors,
and she was found to be in respiratory distress.  Code status
was discussed at that time, and she did not want
intubation/resuscitation. In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her respiratory distress was
attributed to a combination of fever and CHF, the latter
possible precipitated by atrial fibrillation.  Patient was
formerly DNR/DNI but reversed her code status to DNR/intubate.
She received nebulizer treatments prn. CT chest showed stable
thyromegaly. She had left shift, lactate 3.3 on presentation.
She did not have other obvious site of infection. Patient was
treated with vanco/levo/flagyl (patient has PCN allergy) but
continued to spike fevers. Urine culture/blood cultures showed
no growth for many days, and the final results are pending (the
patient refused further testing with subsequent fevers).  For
atrial fibrillation, she was rate controlled with metoprolol as
needed.  Upon admission she was noted to have a mild
tramaminitis.

Patient is now transferred back to the regular floor and
currently states that she "feels great," without chest pain,
sob, discomfort, nausea/vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea,
constipation.

father died at older age without cancer. She has four brothers

Physical Exam:
exam: Temp: 101.3 Tcurrent: 97.9 HR: 89 BP: 104/50 RR: 16 99% on
RA

GEN: NAD, AEO x3
HEENT: CNII-XII intact, EOMI, PERRLA

LUSB
RESP: Right lower lobe cracles, CTA in all other lung fields
ABD: soft, nt, nd, nabs
EXT: no c,c,e


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR [**5-19**]: CHF picture with stable thyroid mass
cxr [**5-20**]: 1. Increased right lower lobe opacity which could
represent pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
2. Stable CHF.
cxr [**5-21**]: IMPRESSION:  Improving aeration consistent with
improving fluid status, although persistent features of CHF
remain.  No new consolidations
CT neck [**5-21**]: IMPRESSION: Enlarged thyroid gland is again seen,
and is stable in appearance.

Ct chest [**5-22**]: 1.  Findings consistent with congestive heart
failure.  The evaluation for underlying interstitial lung
disease is not possible due to superimposed CHF.
2.  Focal patchy opacities seen in the right lower lobe may
represent a focus of atypical atelectasis, or early pneumonic
consolidation.  Resolution of this lesion should be documented
on follow-up scans after treatment given the
patient's history of ovarian cancer.
3.  Pulmonary hypertension.
4.  Enlarged right lobe of the thyroid, which is stable in
appearance dating back to [**2112-6-13**].

Ultrasound [**5-22**]: 1)  Normal hepatic echotexture with no focal
liver lesions or biliary ductal dilatation identified.
2) Likely parapelvic cysts within left kidney.

Blood cultures and urine cultures have shown no growth to date

Echo ([**5-23**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall  left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The  ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
(2+) aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is  no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory distress due to CHF:
The patient had a BNP of 10,000, and she was diuresed with good
response. It was thought that her CHF was precipitated by fever
and atrial fibrillation.  She was placed on aspirin, and there
was decision not to anticoagulate based on an isolated incident
of atrial fibrillation and the morbidity of coumadin. Patient
was formerly DNR/DNI but has reversed her code status to
DNR/intubate. She was maintained on lasix for her CHF.

Fever:
The etiology of her fevers remained unclear, but there was no
convincing source of an infection. Patients blood and urine
cultures were unrevealing. She had no evidence for pneumonia by
clinical sx or by imaging. In the unit she was originally
treated with vanco/levo/flagyl (patient has a pcn allergy) but
she continued to spike fevers. It was then felt that an
infectious etiology was unlikely, and all abx were therefore
stopped.  We spoke to heme onc attending as to whether fevers
could be related to carboplatin. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt this would
be very unusual for this drug, but still considered it a
possibility, especially in view of LFT abnormalities (below)
suggestive of possible drug-induced cholestasis (again unusual
for carboplatin). Patients fever curve trended down off of
antibiotics, and she was afebrile at the time of discharge.

Transaminitis and cholestasis:
Patient showed evidence of a transaminitis upon admission which
stab
