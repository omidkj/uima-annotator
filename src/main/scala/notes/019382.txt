[**9-19**] ERCP: Pus, sludge and one stone were released from the bile
duct following cannulation - consistent with cholangitis
(cannulation)
Previous sphincterotomy at the major papilla
Multiple filling defects in the CBD consistent with stones and
sludge were seen
A 5cm 10F double pigtail stent was successfully placed in the
common hepatic duct for drainage (stent placement)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
*repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and stone extraction.
.
[**9-20**] CXR: 1. Bilateral interstitial opacities, which could lead
to interstitial edema, but differential diagnoses includes
atypical pneumonia and other interstitial abnormalities.
Followup PA and lateral radiographs would be helpful for initial
further evaluation.
2. Asbestos-related pleural plaques

Brief Hospital Course:
#Cholangitis: Patient underwent ERCP which showed multiple
filling defects c/w sludge/stones. Pus and sludge were noted to
be draining from the bile duct during ERCP. A pig tail biliary
stent was placed in the common hepatic duct. Patient was
intubated for procedure, and was extubated the same day without
difficulty. Zosyn was continued on transfer (started [**9-18**]) and
converted to Ciprofloxacin 500mg po Q12H on [**9-22**]. Initial
transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia improved during hospital
course (on discharge AST/ALT 44/62, TBili 3.5. Of note,
patient's alkaline phosphatase continued to rise during
hospitalization (in three days prior to admission 225, 438, and
480 on discharge). Elevation was thought to be [**3-15**] evolving
hepatic injury vs. cholestasis/ductal obstruction. After
discussion with the GI service, it was felt that the patient was
safe to return home with close PCP f/u and re-check of alk phos
within 5 days (appointment has been scheduled). Presence of
declining bili, and alk phos trend was reassuring. The plan per
discussion with ERCP/GI service is for total 2wk course of
Ciprofloxacin.
.
#Hypotension: Initially noted to be hypotensive (BP 80/50). Home
ACEI, Beta Blocker were held on admission. Required
Vaso/Norepinephrine initially. Also required Dopamine post-ERCP.
Dopamine was weaned on HD2 and Vaso/Norepinephrine weaned HD3.
Patient subsequently remained normotensive, hemodynamically
stable.
.
#AoCRF: Noted to be ARF on admission (Cr 2.7) which returned to
baseline (baseline Cr 1.7-2) with aggressive IVF hydration, BP
support. CKD likely [**3-15**] HTN vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
.
#Heme: Normocytic anemia likely [**3-15**] AOCD vs. CKD. There was no
evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Anemia studies (Fe 51, TIBC 221,
Ferritin 265) were c/w AOCD. Patient was also noted to be
thrombocytopenic on admission (Platelets 75). Available data
suggests thrombocytopenia is chronic (baseline 100-130s). There
was no evidence of DIC, though admission thrombocytopenia below
baseline was presumed [**3-15**] septic physiology. A blood smear was
evaluated and was unrevealing. Of note, there are prior reports
of prosthetic valve related thrombocytopenia (?auto-immune
mechanism). No clear mechanism of marrow hypo-proliferation or
destruction. Given known chronicity, and stability of
thrombocytopenia during hospitalization, there was low concern
for HIT.
.
#AF: Initial rate-control [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (Metoprolol) was held [**3-15**]
hypotension on admission. Home dose metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] was
re-started on HD4. There were no episodes of AF/RVR. Patient's
ASA 325mg was continued and further anti-coagulation was
deferred per home regimen given hx of significant GIB.
.
#CAD/Cardiomyopathy/CHF: No episodes CP during admission.
Troponins were checked at the OSH and were negative. Home dose
ACEI, statin were held initially. Patient's ACEI (Lisinopril 5mg
po qd) was re-started on HD4. Patient's statin was held during
hospitalization given transaminitis. Patient was discharged home
