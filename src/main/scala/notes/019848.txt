Pertinent Results:
[**2130-9-13**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a distal 30%
calcific
lesion. The LAD was calcified proximally with serial 70% and 60%
lesions
in the mid-vessel. The diagonals were diffusely diseased. The
LCx had a
distal 70% lesion with smaller OM branches. The RCA was totally
occluded
proximally with left to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic
arterial
blood pressure (SBP 132 mm Hg).

[**2130-9-14**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. The
basal inferior, inferolateral and anterior septal segments have
relatively better function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2123-1-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction
is similar, however the wall motion abnormalities now appear to
be more global. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension has increased.

[**2130-9-14**] Carotid Ultrasound
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.  Left ICA stenosis <40%

CXR [**2130-9-23**] Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with
subsequent areas of atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged alignment of
the sternal wires.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17129**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2130-9-13**] for further
management of his chest pain and positive stress test. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which showed severe three vessel
coronary artery. Cardiac surgery was therefore consulted and
preoperative evaluation was performed - see result section.
Given recent Plavix dose, surgery was delayed for several days.
Preoperative course was notable for 22 beat run of asymptomatic,
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Given his low ejection
fraction, he was observed on telemetry and maintained on heart
failure regimen. No further runs of NSVT were noted.

On [**9-19**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. Please see operative note for details.
Following the operation he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. On postoperative day one, he developed signs of
cardiac tamponade and returned to the operating room for
re-exploration. Hemostasis was obtained and he returned to the
CVICU. Later that day the IABP was weaned and removed without
complication. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated
without incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two.

On POD4 his pacing wires were removed.  He remained volume
overloaded.  His diuretics were increased and he was slowly
diuresed. His electrolytes were repleted. Pain was well
controlled NSAIDS and hydromorphone.  His blood sugars were
monitored and his metformin was restarted.  He tolerated a
diabetic diet.  Was seen by physical therapy.

He was discharged to his sister's house and VNA on POD5.  He
will follow-up as an outpatient.
