Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-1-6**] following
hospitalization for falls and SOB. Falls were thought to be due
to a mechanical nature. SOB was attributed to Acute CHF
exacerbation. Also noted to have intermittent delirium in
addition to baseline dementia (A&Ox2, occassionally x 3).
Medications actively avoided were Trazodone (worsened
sedation/confusion), hydralazine (potential for delirium) and
Lisinopril (5mg caused hypotension). Discharged to rehab center
for further recovery. He was then transferred by ambulance ot
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2147-1-21**] with concern for cyanotic toes and
fingers. EMS evaluation with 85% on unknown O2. At that time he
denied F/Ch, SOB, N, CP per OSH ED records. Initial ABG
7.33/66/314 on NRB. He was given Lasix 40mg IV, Nitropaste 1"
and Moxifloxicin 400 mg IV. Treated for CHF with Lasix.
Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and thought it unlikely (per OSH
records) that the patient had an acute CVA. OSH labs Na 143, K
4.6, Cl 103, CO2 35, BUN 31, Cr 1.23, Ca 9.7, Mg 2.1, TSH 2.71,
B1 541, Folate > 24, INR 3.19, Hct 32.1, WBC 8.6, Plt 136, BNP
202. OSH telemetry/EKG with V-pacing vs Afib. CTA with near
complete occulsion of the left internal carotid artery which may
be on the basis of a dissection (noted on prior study). NC CT
head with atrophy without acute finding. CXR [**1-21**] likely
consistent with congestive heart failure. Patient was then
placed on BiPAP for further respiratory support, though what
prompted need for increased ventilatory support is unclear. VS
on transfer 97.9, 79, 16, 177/77, weight 220 lbs. Patient with
DNR/DNI order upon arrival.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is with BiPAP but able to follow
simple commands. He is not in notable distress. Oriented to
hospital. Cannot provide further details as to history.

FLOOR ADMISSION NOTE
HPI:
See MICU admission note for full details.
Briefly, 89yoM who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from rehab
[**2147-1-21**] with hypoxia and AMS. Per EMS eval, was hypoxic to 85%
on unknown O2.
At OSH, ABG on NRB showed 7.33/66/314. Got Lasix, Nitro, and
Moxiflox at OSH, treated for CHF. Neuro evaluated and felt acute
CVA unlikely, and CT-A head and neck negative for CVA, but
stable occlusion of L-ICA. EKG showing AFib vs V-pacing. CXR
[**1-21**] showed volume overload without obvious infiltrate. Put on
BiPAP there.
.
Family wanted transfer here, so pt came on Monday, vitals on
transfer 97.9 79 16 177/77 weight 220 lbs. Labs/imaging through
MICU stay significant for: normal WBC count, Hct 32.2 but within
baseline from previous dc, plts 130 lower than previous dc, INR
3.0 on Coumadin, Cr 1.2 below baseline, Trop 0.06 x2 (but with
CRI) and CK/MB negative. UA negative for infxn but with blood.
UCx pending. CXR showing mild pulm edema and mediastinal
engorgement c/w cardiac decompensation and small R pleural
effusion.
.
In the MICU, was easily weaned off BiPAP. Diuresed with 80mg IV
lasix once yesterday, once this AM with approx 675 cc's negative
through MICU stay. EP was consulted for interrogation of pt's
pacer but not performed yet. Echo was ordered but has not been
performed yet. Pt received 1 dose of Levaquin/Cefepime/Vanc
prophylactically as pt not noted to be febrile or have WBC count
here or at OSH, no localizing symptoms noted on OSH ROS (unable
to obtain in MICU). ABx was were stopped [**2147-1-24**] and Cx's from
OSH negative to date. Ortho spine was consulted due to pt's
chronic C2 fracture, and pt noted to be in soft collar with
recent dc summary notes indicating necessity of hard collar.
Mental status noted to be slightly confused.
.
Of note, during recent admission [**2147-1-6**] for falls and SOB
(falls felt to be mechanical and SOB attributed to CHF
exacerbation), pt noted to have intermittent delirium on top of
baseline dementia. Medications avoided were Trazadone
(sedation/confusion), Hydralazine (delirium), and Lisinopril
(hypotension).
.
On evaluation in the MICU, pt is somnolent, rousable to voice,
but sleeps if not stimulated. No specific complaints.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, otherwise able to obtain further. Per MICU note,
OSH ROS was without localizing symptoms.
