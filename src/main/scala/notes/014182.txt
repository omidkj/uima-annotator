Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 12130**] is a 71 year old woman with history of silent MI
([**2103**]) that was complicated with left ventricular aneurysm (s/p
repair) and mural thrombus, STEMI ([**9-16**]), CAD s/p CABG x 4
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, OM2 and RCA) [**10-17**], recent NSTEMI
([**12-18**]), insulin dependent diabetes, peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease,
and hyperthyroidism.

She is presenting with  bloating and abdominal pain that started
1-2 weeks ago. Her abdominal pain is diffuse, crampy in nature,
not increased with exertion, and relieved by Gas-X or flatus.
She denies vomiting but has some mild nausea today. She had
loose stools secondary to Miralax for constipation but denies
melena or hematochezia.

Patient has noticed feeling increasingly more weak with
exertion. She has increased dyspnea when on exercise bike during
cardiac rehab or when climbing flight of [**9-23**] stairs recently
at her grandson's wedding. She has orthopnea at baseline that
has not worsened recently. Patient also has a mild cough with
whitish-pink sputum.

Denies fevers/chills, sweats, flushing, syncope, dizziness,
lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, shoulder pain (except
baseline pain in R shoulder secondary to OA) or defibrillator
firing.

Patient presented initially to her PCP with these symptoms. Her
PCP thought they could be related to fluid overload and
increased her Lasix dose to 80mg and, because she presented with
similar symptoms during her NSTEMI in [**12-18**], her PCP checked
troponin. Today the troponin I level came back at 0.14 (previous
troponin T <0.01 in [**3-18**]). Her PCP called her and told her to
come to the ED.

In ED initial VS were: 98.3 96 117/64 99. She complained of mild
abdominal pain which improved after placement of a foley. On
exam no evidence of fluid overload with only 1+ edema, no JVD,
and no crackles. EKG showed no changes but patient has ICD.
Heparin was not started because she has h/o spontaneous bleed
when she was placed on heparin previously. Initially the plan
was for her to be admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] floor but then in the ED
she had a transient drop in her BP (nadir = 76/45). She was
bolused 250mL NS X2 and BP came up to 109/35. She remained
asymptomatic throughout this episode.

TTE on admission ([**2117-8-10**])
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
aneurysm which is dyskinetic. A left ventricular mass/thrombus
cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-5-14**],
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more
prominent and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is now higher.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old woman with insulin dependent diabetes, 3 vessel CAD
s/p CABG, presenting with abdominal pain and increase in
troponins, admitted to CCU for exacerbation of systolic heart
failure
.
# Acute on Chronic SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Dyspnea and abdominal
discomfort could be secondary to CHF exacerbation.  Etiology
ACS/NSTEMI versus dietary indiscretion. Patient was continued on
ASA, Plavix, Lipitor, metoprolol, ACE-I. Serial troponins/CK-MB
were followed and were never elevated.  Etiology thought to be
due to dietary indiscretion.  ECG showed NSR with many PVCs.
TTE showed similar finding to prior (see above) consistent with
mild systolic failure.  Patient was dosed with short-acting
metoprolol in setting of mild hypotension, which was reason for
admission to CCU.  Persantine Thallium test was scheduled for 2
weeks after discharge to evaluate for ischemia.  Patient
responded well to additional doses of lasix, with increased
urine output and net (-) fluid balance of [**12-11**] liters/day.
Patient was transferred from unit to floor and continued to do
well.  The addition of spironolactone to her regimen was
deferred in the setting of systolic blood pressure in the 100s.
The patient was discharged on [**2117-8-12**] in improved and stable
condition.
.
# RHYTHM: PVC's present but ICD in place.  Rate was
well-controlled during admission on metoprolol.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Manual cuff BP of 115/50. Automated BP
measurements were thought to be artifically low secondary to
multiple premature ventricular contractions.  The patient was
converted to short-acting metoprolol and ACE inhibitor for
improved control, and was discharged on her home regimen of
toprol XL and lisinopril at decreased dose of 10 mg.
.
# DIABETES: Patient was continued  on home insulin regimen with
Lantus and Novolog with good glycemic control.
.
# HYPERTHYROIDISM:  Methimazole was continued.
.
# CODE: full (confirmed)
