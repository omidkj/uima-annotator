Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old female with history of DM, COPD,
ventilator dependent, hypertension, rectus sheath hematoma
[**6-/2139**] who was brought to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with altered mental
status and abdominal pain.  Abdominal CT was done at outside
hospital which showed partial SBO.  CT head at OSH was negative
for intracranial process.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work up given her recent admission here.
.
In our ED, vital signs were BP 115/50, HR 90, RR 16, O2 sat 100%
on trach collar.  Labs notable for positive UA, WBC count 12.9
(73% neutrophils), creatinine 6.2 up from last d/c 4.2, troponin
1.51 (CKMB normal), hct 30.2 (up from b/l of 24-25 last
admission).  Blood and urine cultures sent from ED.  She was
given 1L NS, Cipro 400mg x1, Aspirin 600mg PR, Tylenol 1g.  She
was also given ?????? amp D50 for low BG.  She was seen by surgery
for evaluation of partial SBO.  Decision was for no surgical
intervention but NGT was placed.

The patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-25**] with
urosepsis treated with Linezolid, MRSA RLL PNA treated with
Ceftazadime and Cipro.  Also noted to have RUE edema last
admission, UE US was negative for DVT.

TTE [**7-22**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. Mild
mitral annular calcification.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Right pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-6-29**],
moderate pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now identified.
Biventriclar systolic function is similar.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered mental status: On admission patient somnolent but
responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly
more somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for
evidence of bleed. AMS likely due to infection and Acute renal
failure.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8
prior to last admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2
(felt to be her new baseline secondary to ATN. On admission the
