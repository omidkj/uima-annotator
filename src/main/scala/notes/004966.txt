CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-9-9**] 8:30 PM

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: S/P [**2175**]0 FT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old man s/p 30-foot fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
dedicated recons of T, L spine
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Status post fall from 30 feet.

COMPARISON: No previous studies. Torso CT performed on the same
day is available for correlation.

TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast multidetector CT images of the
thoracic spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal reformatted
images were performed.

FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of T4 vertebra, which
involves the body, right pedicle, and bilateral posterior
elements - lamina and facets. Since all three columns of the
spine are involved, this fracture is highly unstable. It is
associated with a moderate to severe anterior dislocation of T4
with respect to T5. There are multiple fragments in the spinal
canal, which is narrowed by roughly 50%-75%. These findings are
suggestive of severe spinal cord injury. There is a superior
anterior corner fracture of the T5 vertebra. There is a fracture
through the T5 spinous process. There are fractures of the left
fourth rib and right fifth ribs at the costovertebral junctions.
There is associated anterior paraspinal hematoma at T4 through
T6.

Degenerative spurring is present in the endplates at T8-9. There
are bilateral pulmonary contusions and bilateral hemothoraces.
Please refer to the torso CT of the same day for further detail.
Radiopaque contrast from the preceding torso CT is present in
the renal collecting systems.

IMPRESSION:
1. Highly unstable, a comminuted fracture of T4 vertebra
involving all three columns of the spine. Greater than 50%
narrowing of the spinal canal by fracture fragments with
findings consisitent with cord injury and compression.
Dislocation of the T4-5 interspace.
2. Bilateral pulmonary contusions and hemothoraces. Please refer
to the torso CT of the same day for further detail.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Status post traumatic fall from 30 feet.

COMPARISON: No previous studies.

TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast multidetector CT images of the
cervical spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal reformatted
images were performed.

FINDINGS: There is a fracture through the base of C7 spinous
process, which involves the confluence of the right and left
lamina. There may also be a fracture of the C6 spinous process,
only visible on the sagittal images. There is no subluxation.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Mild loss of disc
space height and moderate degenerative endplate spurring is
noted at C5/6 and C6/7.

IMPRESSION: Fracture of C7 posterior elements, and perhaps C6
spinous process.

MR THORACIC SPINE  [**2175-9-10**] 2:31 AM

MR CERVICAL SPINE; MR THORACIC SPINE

Reason: C7 SPINOUS PROCESS FX. PRE-OP FOR T1-T10 POSTERIOR
FUSION.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old man with 30ft fall and C7 spinous process fx; preop
for T1-T10 posterior fusion
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

THORACIC SPINE:
As noted on the CT scan, there is a fracture dislocation of T4
and T5. There is severe spinal canal compromise at the T4 level
with compression of the spinal cord. Edema is identified within
the spinal cord. Detail is limited due to motion artifact. Above
and below the level of cord compression, the spinal cord has a
normal course and caliber and normal signal intensity.

There is edema in the paravertebral soft tissues of the upper
thoracic spine, associated with a fracture dislocation at T4 and
T5. Findings were telephoned to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 8:10 a.m. on
[**2175-9-10**].
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE AND THORACIC SPINE

INDICATION: Fall from 30 feet with fractured spine.

TECHNIQUE: Cervical spine imaging was performed with sagittal
T1, T2, gradient echo, and inversion recovery scans as well as
axial T2-weighted images. Comparison is made to the cervical
spine CT performed on [**2175-9-9**].

Thoracic spine imaging was performed with sagittal T
