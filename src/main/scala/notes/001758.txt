Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-3-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2133-3-27**] Six Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal
mammary to ramus, vein grafts to left anterior descending, first
obtuse marginal, second obtuse marginal, acute marginal and
right coronary artery)


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male without medical follow up since childhood
presented to new PCP with new complaint of palpitations on
[**2133-3-12**] - no CP, no SOB. At that time exam was notable for HTN
(SBP to 151), tachycardia (104) and hepatomegaly of uncertain
etiology - lungs clear, no JVD, no peripheral edema. EKG on [**3-14**]
showed sinus at 90 with T-wave inversions in the inferior leads,
possible Q-s in the anteroseptal leads, and LVH with ST
elevations in V1-V5. No delta waves or abnormal intervals. PCP
started ASA and Metoprolol which eliminated the patient's
symptoms. Saw patient again on [**3-14**] and the patient was
hypertensive so the Metoprolol was increased to 100 [**Hospital1 **] and
Simvastatin was added for elevated cholesterol. Patient went for
a stress test on [**3-25**] and was found to have a large fixed defect
in the LAD territory. In ED patient was given ASA and metoprolol
Patient admitted for ROMI and evaluation.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Hepatomegaly

Social History:
Social history is significant for remote tobacco use. There is
no history of alcohol abuse, though the patient reports a couple
of beers per week.

Family History:
There is no clear family history of premature coronary artery
disease or sudden death. The patient reports that his father
died of the effects of alcohol abuse on the heart at age 65.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 149/88 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 84
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min
saturating at 98% on RA.
Generally the patient was thin and and well groomed. The patient
was oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.

There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 8 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.

Palpation of the heart revealed a laterally displaced PMI. There
were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds
revealed a 2-3/6 diastolic murmur at the apex that was audible
in the axilla. There were no rubs, clicks or gallops.

The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.


Pulses were 2+ distally.

1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
sever
three vessel coronary artery disease with left main involvment.
The LMCA
had a mid to distal 80% eccentric stenosis. The LAD was heavily
calcified with severe dffuse disease of the first and second
diagonal
branches. The mid LAD is occluded and fills via left to left and
right
to left collaterals. The LCX is also heavily calcified with 70%
proximal
disease, diffuse disease of major OM2 branch and 50% stenosis of
the mid
AV groove CX supplying the OM3 and large LPL branch. The LCx
also
provides collaterals to the large distal RCA system. The RCA has
sever
diffuse disease with a proximal to mid total occlusion.
Competitive flow
in the distal RCA with no antegrade filling of the R-PDA and
RPL, with
collateral filling of the LAD. 2. Resting hemodyanmics revealed
severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with
RVEDP of 15mmHg and LVEDP of 39 mmHg. There was severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension with PASP of 58mmHg. The cardiac
index was moderately reduced at 1.82 l/min/m2. There was
moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP of
157mmHg. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred due to severely
elevated LVEDP. 4. Successful placement of a 7.5F 40cc IABP
under fluroscopy with good systolic unloading and diastolic
augmentation.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Severely depressed LVEF. TDI E/e' >15,
suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of
distal arch coarctation.

with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of all but the basal segments of
the left ventricle. There is extensive apical akinesis with
spontaneous echocardiographic contrast indicating stasis of flow
at the apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. There is focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall of the right ventricle, but overall right
ventricular contractile function appears well-preserved. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve l
