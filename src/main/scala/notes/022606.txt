Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU.  She was found to have the
following injuries:
1. Large subdural hematoma w/ 9mm of shift, early uncal and
transtentorial herniation.
2. B/L upper lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration.
3. pulmonary edema
Neurosurgical evaluation was obtained. Due to patient's age,
comorbidity and extensive ICH, the risk and mortality rate of
neurosurgical intervention is very
high, and final outcome does not change with or without surgery.
In addition, the patient had DNI/DNR on file with the nursing
home, but the appropriate documentation could not be found prior
to intubation by EMS. Therefore, no neurosurgical intervention
was warrented. [**Name (NI) **] Niece [**Name (NI) 71734**] was explained the
situation by the neurosurgical [**Last Name (un) 12003**].  The patient's health
proxy, her sister [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 14502**]), flew from [**Name (NI) 6482**].  Upon her
arrival, the decision was made to make the patient CMO given her
devestating brain injury.  She was extubated, started on a
morphine drip, and was pronounced dead at 0834 on [**2189-4-1**].  The
family was at her bedside.  The attending and medical examiner
