Allergies:
Ampicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain / aortic thrombus


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**2105-10-1**]
extubation [**2105-10-2**]

History of Present Illness:
Admission HPI:
63 yo M with no significant medical issues presented today to
[**Hospital3 **] with back pain, for which he underwent CTA that
found aortic thrombus, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for vascular
evaluation, now transferred to MICU given intubated state in the
setting of metabolic alkalosis and tachypnea and medical
management.

Per report, patient received morphine, ASA 300 mg PR, zofran,
IVF.  He was started on heparin bolus then gtt.

Per ED report, patient arrived with VS of 96.9F, HR 80, BP
167/60, RR 30, 99% 2L.  He was pale, responsive, but lethargic.
Patient was intubated with etomidate/succinylcholine for
tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis, versed/prop/fentanyl for
sedation.  Apparently ETT was slightly high on CXR, so it was
advanced.  Initial lactate was 6.8.  Vascular surgery evaluated
patient and found no threatened limbs and dopplarable pulses
bilaterally to the femoral artery.  Bedside [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] vascular
surgery, is consistent with peripheral vascular disease.
However, it was thought this could be managed medically given
hemodynamic stability.  General surgery also evaluated patient
for concern of bowel ischemia given high initial lactate.  CTA
was reviewed by surgery and it was thought there was no
mesenteric ischemia.  Per report, patient received vancomycin
and zosyn for ? early sepsis (elevated lactate and WBC) as well
as 500 cc IVF bolus.  He continued heparin gtt.  CTA chest was
normal at [**Last Name (LF) 620**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ED report.  Upon transfer, VS HR 85, BP
146/60, RR 14, O2Sat 100 on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, TV 500.  He has 3
PIV.

On the floor, he is intubated.

CTA from [**Hospital1 **]:
IMPRESSION: 1.   EXTENSIVE SOFT PLAQUE, POSSIBLY RUPTURED
PLAQUE, VERSUS THROMBUS IN THE INFRARENAL ABDOMINAL AORTA,
SPANNING APPROXIMATELY 3 CM, WITH ASSOCIATED MAXIMAL LUMINAL
NARROWING OF 75%. 2.   FOCAL SOFT PLAQUE OR THROMBUS IN THE
RIGHT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY WITH AT LEAST 50% ASSOCIATED LUMINAL
NARROWING. 3.   NO AORTIC ANEURYSM OR DISSECTION.  NO EVIDENCE
OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM. 4.   ASYMMETRIC EMPHYSEMA, PREDOMINANTLY
IN THE RIGHT LUNG. 5.   SMALL HIATAL HERNIA.

CXR: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect or recent infarction. Slight prominence of the
ventricles and sulci reflects a mild degree of generalized
atrophy, age related. No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Aerosolized secretions are seen within the sphenoid sinuses,
left greater than right. The mastoid air cells are grossly
clear. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale
is present (positive bubble study at rest). Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
63M who presented with aortic thrombus complicated by
respiratory failure and bacteremia.

Aortic thrombus: The aortic thrombus was found on CTA from
[**Hospital1 **]. The etiology of the thrombus is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was
started on a heparin drip and transitioned to warfarin with a
goal INR of [**1-8**]. We did not work him up for hypercoaguablity,
although this may be reasonable to do as an outpatient. The
duration of the therapy is unclear and he will need to be
followed closely by a primary care physician and likely [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
hematologist as well. He was started on a statin despite
adequate lipid profile as it may stablize a ruptured plaque (if
present). He will need age appropriate cancer screening tests.
He was discharged with follow up with primary care physician and
hematologist.

Enterococcus septicemia: The patient had enterococcus and
another gram positive rod (likely propionibacterium or
lactobacillum) in his blood. He had a total of 14 days of IV
antibiotics directed by infectious disease specialists. He was
on vancomycin which was switched to ampicillin which was
switched back to vancomycin for concern of drug rash. Blood
cultures were negative since starting antibiotics. Infectious
disease does not think clot is infected. No evidence of
endocarditis. The source of the infection is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] should
undergo colonoscopy as outpatient.

Skin lesions: The patient has multiple concerning lesions. He
has two on his chest which are concerning for squamous cell
carcinoma. He also has one on his face which is concerning for
basal cell carcinoma. These will need to be evaluated by a
dermatologist as an outpatient. His primary care physician will
need to schedule a dermatology appointment once he has
insurance.

Sclerotic lesion in spine: Per radiology most consistent with
degenerative joint disease.

Respiratory failure: This was transient and likely related to
bacteremia. He was
