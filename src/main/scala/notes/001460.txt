Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of central line, left sided IJ

History of Present Illness:
87 y.o. female wtih h/o MVR ([**2108**]), CAD, CHF, pAF, and recent
admissions in [**9-9**] and [**10-10**] for colitis and Cdiff
respectively, presents from rehab with asymptomatic hypotension
to 70s.  The patient complains of abdominal discomfort and
nausea which has been going on since her last admission in
[**10-10**], along with some fatigue/weakness.

During her last hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 96313**]), the patient
completed a course of cipro for infectious colitis, and was
discharged on oral vancomycn for presumed Cdiff.  She also had a
PICC line placed and was receiving TPN at rehab until 5 days
prior to admission, when the line became infected with Staph Epi
which was resistent to oxacillin.  Stool came back positive for
Cdiff on [**11-19**] and she was restarted on oral Vanco (had been
d/c'd when diarrhea resolved). The line was pulled and she was
started on Linezolid.

ROS: negative for CP, SOB, fever, chills.  + for abd discomfort
and nausea.  Also + for poor appetite since last admission.

In the ED, T 95.1, BP 92/41 (dropped to SBP 80), HR 124, RR 16,
94% 2L. U/A was floridly positive wiht > 1000 WBCs.  Left IJ was
placed.  She was given 4L NS, Ceftaz, Vanc, and Flagyl and sent
to MICU for sepsis.


Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
1. Recent Cdiff colitis following ABX for presumed infectious
colitis
2. Coronary & Valvular  Disease
-S/p post-op NSTEMI in the [**2066**] after CCY, though no CAD seen
on cardiac cath  in [**2108**]
- Flail mitral valve, s/p mitral valve repair, [**9-4**].
-Stress [**2-7**]: Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a mild
fixed defect in the inferior wall. Gated images reveal global
hypokinesis, worse in the septum in this patient post MVR. The
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 44%. Echo at
this time showed EF 55%, Mild TR, no MR, and well-seated mitral
annulus.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p pharmacologic conversion
(not currently on anticoagulation). Holter [**10-7**] showed
underlying sinus rhythm with normal intervals, occasional PACs
and frequent PVCs. Rare short bursts of atrial tachycardia and
occasional short runs of NSVT.
4. Systolic CHF: nuclear stress on [**2114-2-6**] showed global
hypokinesis; LVEF 45-50%, although recent echo [**10-10**] showed EF
60%
5. Pulmonary Artery Hypertension, mild based on echo [**2-7**]
6. Hypertension
7. Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, transverse colon,
descending colon and sigmoid colon based on colonoscopy [**2-4**]


Social History:
Never smoked, doesn't drink ETOH, no illicits.  Had been living
with her with her son until recent hospitalization.  Widowed. .


Family History:
Two sisters died with breast cancer. All children are healthy.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:
Micro at rehab:
Cdiff toxin [**11-19**] - positive
[**11-14**] Blood cultures - 4/4 bottles pos for Staph Epidermidis,
[**Last Name (un) 36**] to linezolid, resistent to oxacillin
[**11-15**] PICC line tip - pos for Staph Epidermidis

CXR: [**2114-11-20**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
CT abd [**2114-11-20**]:
1.  Pancolitis, slightly less severe than colitis seen on
previous
exam. C. diff colitis is a consideration.  No pneumatosis or
free air.
2.  Ventral hernia containing non-obstructed small bowel loops
.
COLONOSCOPY [**2114-10-22**]
Diverticulitis of the transverse colon, descending colon and
sigmoid colon
Stool in the transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid
colon
Erythema and congestion in the sigmoid colon compatible with
diverticulitis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid transverse colon

EGD [**2114-10-22**]
Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus
Normal mucosa in the whole stomach
Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part
of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Surface Echo [**2114-10-19**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-2-5**],
the findings are similar

ECG: Afib with RVR at 138.  Repeat pending (pt now in sinus)

Brief Hospital Course:
87 y.o. female with MVR, remote CAD, and recent admissions for
colitis/Cdiff, presents with hypotension and presumed urosepsis
with shock.

# Septic shock: Upon admission, the patient had elevated WBC,
was tachycardic, and hypotensive requiring pressor.  Potential
sources were urosepsis (floridly positive UA, but also known to
have Cdiff (stool was positive at rehab).  Also considered was
line sepsis (recent PICC line).  She received fluid
resuscitation and was started on neosynephrine which was later
changed to norephinephrine.  The pressor was weaned off and the
pt was able to maintain her BP.  She was initially covered
broadly with vancomycin, ceftazidine, and flagyl, all started on
[**2114-11-20**].  Vancomycin was stopped on [**2114-11-22**] when cultures had
been negative for 48 hours.  Ceftazadine was changed to
ceftriaxone.  She should complete a 7 day course of
ceftaz/ceftriaxone and then complete 14 days of flagyl after the
other abx are completed for Cdiff.
.
# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia: Likely [**1-5**] diarrhea.  Repleted and
remained stable.  She will need her potassium checked in 3 days
and at least once a week afterward.
.
# Afib with RVR: The patient has a h/o paroxysmal Atrial
fibrillation.  Likely triggered by septic shock.  Has converted
to sinus after IVF resuscitation.  Her metoprolol was held
because of hypotension, but should be restarted as an outpt.
She should discuss coumadin for pAF with her outpt provider.
.
# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**1-5**] volume
resuscitation with NS or diarrhea.  Remained stable throughout
hospitalization.
.
# GI: The patient has been having nausea and abdominal
discomfort since last admission, along with very poor PO intake
(she only will eat tootsie rolls and ginger ale).  CT abd
without new finding, but revealed pan-colitis which was reported
to have improved since last scan.  Neg ECG and colonoscopy last
admission.  Was seen in GI clinc for these symptoms which were
thought [**1-5**] meds (flagyl/vanco) vs colitis.  She was given
antiemetics and treatement for Cdiff.  GI evaluated her for
possible PEG tube, but because of her ventral hernia, she can
not have it placed endoscopically and would instead need it done
by radiology of surgery.  The patient and he
