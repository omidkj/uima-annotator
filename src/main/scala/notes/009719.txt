History of Present Illness:
38 year old female with history of HTN, CHF, Etoh abuse, CKD [**12-25**]
htn presents with 3 days of worsening shortness of breath.  At
baseline, patient has shortness of breath and 4 pillow
orthopnea.  3 days ago she noticed gradual onset of worsening

also reports palpitations and occasional episodes of sweating.
Furthermore, she has also experienced non-radiating chest pain
lasting from seconds to minutes, feels like "pinching" over her
L chest and L epigastrum; this pain is unchanged and chronic
lasting from [**2115**] until now.

She was started on a nitroprusside drip, given lasix 40 mg,
lisinopril 20mg, amlodipine 4 mg, and trasferred to the CCU for
further management.

MRI abdomen (to eval for masses, renal artery stenosis)
IMPRESSION:
1. The study is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast and
patient's inability to hold her breath during the scan. Mild
narrowing of the mid right renal artery without evidence of
significant stenosis.
2. Normal adrenal glands.
.
Echocardiogram
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left  ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. No masses or thrombi  are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) with global hypokinesis
(slightly more  prominent in the inferior wall). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased  left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and  tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber  size is normal. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly  thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve  leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.  There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
 pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH. Biventricular systolic dysfunction
(consider
infiltrative vs hypertensive cardiomyopathy).

Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old female with essential HTN, CKD w/ baseline
creatinine 2.3, systolic dysfunction with EF 30% presents with
hypertensive emergency and congestive heart failure in setting
of medical non-adherance.
.
#HTN
Patient presented without visual changes, confusion, mental
status changes, hematuria, however did present with symptomatic
moderate to severe congestive heart failure.  The diagnosis of
hypertensive emergency / urgency was made and the patient was
started on a nitroprusside IV drip to lower BP from 200's /
100's (up to 150) by approximately 25% to goal SBP 140-150's.
She was then started on labetalol, lisinopril, and lasix for
diuresis. After her BP stablized, she was maintained on
amlodipine (10 mg daily), and carvedilol (50 mg [**Hospital1 **]), and lasix
20 mg PO daily. Her ace inhibitor was briefly held due to a bump
in her creatinine, and subsequently restarted with lisonopril 40
mg daily.  Patient refused trial of labetalol PO instead of
carvedilol.  On discharge, a clonidine patch 2 was added to
optimize her bp control.  She was provided 0.2mg [**Hospital1 **] clinidine
PO x 4 days to bridge her until her follow up appointment with
her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) **] health center on [**2123-7-2**] at 11:30AM.
.
Likely has essential htn.  Secondary causes were evaluated.  MRI
did not show renal artery stenosis.  Urine metanephrines were
evaluated for pheochromocytoma but were pending on discharge.
No intra-abdominal or adrenal masses were discovered on MRI of
the abdomen.
.
#Heart Failure, systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction
Patient has an EF of approximately 30%.  Presentation was
consistent with CHF exacerbation in setting of uncontrolled and
elevated blood pressure.  Diuresis and control of BP was
successful in normalization of hemodynamics to baseline.  She
requires 20 mg lasix PO daily.  She is currently able to walk
the hospital floors without desaturation or shortness of breath.
 Patient was instructed that without weight loss, a stable and
effective exercise program, a low sodium / low fat diet, smoking
cessation, and tight blood pressure control that she faces
likely worsening of her heart function, kidney function and
probable failure, and likely cardiac / cardiovascular /
neurologic event (stroke) in the next 5 to 10 years.  She was
instructed to weigh herself daily and report > 3 lb weight gain
to her doctor.  V
