Admission Date:  [**2141-4-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-5-2**]

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with
history of atrial fibrillation and some mitral regurgitation
who was referred in to Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for cardiac
catheterization.  He had a three to four year history of
mitral regurgitation and was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation in [**Month (only) 958**] on a routine exam.  He had a positive
exercise thallium test on [**3-28**] and an echocardiogram on
[**3-28**] also that showed moderate mitral regurgitation and
moderate left ventricular hypokinesis with a dilated atrium.
He was referred in for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Ankle fracture.
6.  Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Lipitor, lisinopril,
aspirin, Questran, vitamin E, multivitamin.  He also took
subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis when visiting the
dentist and was also on Coumadin.  His last dose was on [**4-21**] prior to admission.

He came in for a cardiac catheterization on [**4-25**] on the
Cardiology Service and was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**] of
Cardiac Surgery who saw him on the 22nd.  Cardiac
catheterization showed a 90% ulcerated lesion on the left
anterior descending on the left main, some irregularities of
the left anterior descending and a 60% circumflex marginal
lesion, also showed 2+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection
fraction of 25%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, he had no masses, no carotid
bruits.  His chest was clear.  He had a Grade 1/6 systolic
murmur at the apex. His abdomen had no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities had no edema or
varicosities.  Neurologically, he was oriented and had good
gross motor sensory and cranial nerve function.

LABORATORIES:  Preoperatively, his white count was 8.6,
hematocrit of 43.7, platelet count of 187,000.  PT 13.6 with
an INR of 1.2.  BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, sodium 141, potassium
4.1, chloride 104, CO2 25, anion gap was 16 and a CK enzyme
of 50.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**4-26**], he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three and a flexible cystoscopy.
Coronary bypass grafting was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**].
Flexible cystoscopy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
Urology for problems with [**Name2 (NI) 8389**] placement.  In the Operating
Room, cystoscopy was completed before the patient began his
cardiac surgery procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] grafted left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, vein
graft to the diagonal 1 and vein graft to the ramus.  Patient
was transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition with an underlying chronic atrial
fibrillation and bradycardia on a milrinone drip at 0.3
mg/kg/minute and Neo-Synephrine drip of 1.0 mg/kg/minute and
a propofol drip at 10 mg/kg/minute.

On postoperative day one, his BUN was 20, creatinine 1.3 with
a potassium of 5.0 and a hematocrit of 32.  He was in the 80s
in sinus rhythm with a good blood pressure, saturating well.
He was alert and oriented and following all commands.  His
lungs were clear bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm with good tones.  He had a soft, nontender abdomen in
positive bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well-
perfused with good distal pulses and only 1+ edema.  His
chest tubes were removed.  His Foley remained in place for
monitoring of hematuria around his Foley placement and
cystoscopy.  In the Operating Room, he continued
perioperative antibiotics which included vancomycin and
gentamicin for coverage of instrumentation of the bladder.

On postoperative day two, he was in the 90s in atrial
fibrillation.  His atrial fibrillation was treated with
amiodarone.  He had a temperature maximum of 100.4.  A white
count of 17, a hematocrit of 27.2, platelet count 122,
potassium 4.4, BUN 30, creatinine 2.2 with good blood sugar.
He had some decreased breath sounds at the bases.  He had
some serosanguinous drainage from his chest tubes.  His heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  His sternum was stable.  His
incision with staples was clean, dry and intact.  His abdomen
and extremities were unremarkable.  He remained on Percocet
for pain control after his extubation the day prior.  He
continued on amiodarone and his Neo-Synephrine began to be
weaned down.  He started his Lopressor and his central line
was pulled.  His PA Swan-Ganz catheter was pulled.  His Lasix
was held to monitor his urine output which had decreased a
little bit.  His diet was advanced and he remained in the
unit during the day up 2 kg up in weight just for monitoring.
He was then transferred out to the floor later in the day and
seen by Rehabilitation Services, Physical Therapy, and Case
Management.

On postoperative day three, he was looking better and feeling
better.  He was afebrile with stable vital signs.  His lungs
were clear.  His heart sounds were normal.  His extremities
were warm with a trace amount of edema.  He began his
Coumadin 5 mg and remained on amiodarone and continued his
progress with physical therapy.

On postoperative day four, he had no new events and continued
to improve, hemodynamically stable, saturating 99% on three
liters.  He continued on his Coumadin therapy and beta
blocker.  His heart was slightly irregular.  He had clean,
dry and intact sternal dressing.  His extremities were warm
with decreasing edema.  His INR came back at 1.1.  He was
re-dosed with Coumadin.  He remained on amiodarone for his
atrial fibrillation.  His pacing wires were pulled and he
continued to ambulate and improve on the floor.

I do not see a note from the 28th, postoperative day six.  On
[**5-2**], he had no complaints.  His vital signs were stable.
He was afebrile.  His lungs were clear.  His heart was
regular rate and rhythm.  His incisions were clean, dry and
intact.  He had mild leg swelling and edema but his
extremities were warm and well-perfused.  He was discharged
to home on the following medications:
