Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
epidural abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T12-S1 Laminectomy
Intraoperative Foley Catheterization
PICC placement
Percutaneous placement of pulmonary pigtail catheter drains x2


History of Present Illness:
61 yo male with PMH significant for HTN, HL, DM, umbilical
hernia repair 2 months ago who presented to an OSH on [**2163-11-25**]
with severe LBP of 5 day duration, fever to 101.3, and left foot
drop and was found to have an L3 epidural abscess.
.
He is now POD #4 s/p T12-S1 laminectomy ([**2163-11-25**]). He was of
normal mental status on arrival but has had confusion and
delirium since he was extubated which is the reason for transfer
to medicine. Of note, pt was initiated on an anesthesia study
protocol post-op due to concern of opiate/alcohol use which
included ketamine infusion and ativan scheduled. He has also
been receiving dilaudid po/iv prn and methocarbamol for pain
control. Unclear reason why pt with abscess. He Denies IVDU. He
has very poor dentition but recent dental work (most recently 5
years ago), his only recent surgery was hernia repair 2 months
ago with mesh placement and does have urethral implant.
.
Hospital course is notable for WBC 17.6 with 18 bands on
admission with recent WBC of 12.9 and no diff done. There was
question of some nucal rigidity yesterday which has now
resolved, no LP done given surgical site. The pt is being
actively followed by ID. He received 4 doses gentamicin after
his foley manipulation ([**11-24**] to [**11-27**]) and vancomycin
post-operatively. While in the sicu patient was noted to have
mild hand tremulousness but patient and family (per PA) deny any
alcohol abuse. Hemovac wsa discontinued today. Of note pt had 6
french foley which required intraoperative placement after
dilation and rigid cystoscopy by urology due to his urethral
implants and artifical sphincter.

Discharge Labs:

RADIOLOGY STUDIES:

CXR [**11-28**]
In comparison with the study of [**11-25**], there is increasing
opacification at the left base. Although much of this could
merely reflect
atelectasis and effusion, the possibility of supervening
pneumonia must be
seriously considered.
Mild atelectatic changes are again seen at the right base. The
PICC line
appears to have been removed.

Echo [**11-27**]
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.

CT Head [**11-26**]
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Right maxillary sinus disease. Clinical correlation is
advised.

Lumbar Film [**11-24**]
A single lateral view. Just submitted for report [**2163-11-26**].
Multiple surgical instruments are projected posterior to the
lumbar spine. There is narrowingof the lowest lumbar-type
intervertebral disc space. Degenerative arthriticchanges are
present. A sharp metallic surgical instrument with a curved tip
is projected posterior to the lowest lumbar-type vertebral body.


MRI 12/17 L-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive fluid collection between the thecal sac and
posterior
musculature, with an enhancing rim. While this may represent a
post-operative seroma, infection cannot be excluded.
2. More focal areas of rim-enhancing fluid within the left psoas
and left
posterior paraspinal musculature at the L2 level and a tiny
focus of probable
epidural abscess abutting the left thecal sac at the S1 level.

CTA Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: [**12-1**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Within limitations described above, no evidence of pulmonary
embolus in
the main pulmonary artery, lobar or segmental branches.
Subsegmental branches are well seen except in the inferior lower
lobes, particularly on the right, and embolism can not be
excluded here.

2. Partially loculated left pleural effusion with enhancing
parietal pleura raises the question of infection, though an
exudative effusion could also have this apperance. Volume loss
in the left lower lobe with possible small area of infection
inferiorly. Atelectasis in the right lower lung.

3. Allowing for differences in technique, no significant
difference in known psoas abscess and appearance of the
paraspinal muscles with fluid collection between the thecal sac
and posterior muscles, for which infection can not be excluded.

4. Tubular intermediate density fluid in the left mediastinum
adjacent to the left pleural effusion without enhancing rim.
This is of uncertain etiology and attention should be paid on
follow up.

5. 18 mm enhancing intramural and exophytic gastric antral mass
has an
appearance most consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST).
Endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy are recommended when the
patient's condition allows.

6. Multiple well circumscribed sclerotic lesions in the right
hemipelvis
likely represent bone islands. However, in the setting
