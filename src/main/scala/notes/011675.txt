Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 118/69 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was 82
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. Tmax
was 98.4 Generally the patient was well developed, well
nourished
and well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.

There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor
or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple without
JVD.
The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no thyromegaly. The
were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.  The
respirations were not labored and there were no use of accessory
muscles. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with
normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.

Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.

The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

[**2137-1-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
reveals
severe three veseel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA tapers
distally
into ostial 50% LAD lesiona and ostial 70% LCx lesion.  The mLAD
has a
70% stenosis, D1 has a 80% stenosis at its origin and D2 has a
70%
stenosis.  The OM1 has a 70% ostial lesion and the mLCx has a
70% lesion
after the take-off the OM1.  The mRCA has a 80% lesion and the
mPDA has
an 80% lesion.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamic measurement reveals normal
central
aortic pressure with mildly elevated LV filling pressure (LVEDP
15mmHg).
3.  Left ventriculography demonstrates moderately depressed LV
function
with a calculated ejection fraction of 38%.  The anterior
lateral wall
was akinetic and the apex were hypokinetic.  The rest of LV wall
motion
was normal.

[**2137-1-9**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
of the distal half of the anterior wall and distal inferior and
lateral walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic. There
is normal systolic function of the remaining segments. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2137-1-9**] Carotid Ultrasound
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
