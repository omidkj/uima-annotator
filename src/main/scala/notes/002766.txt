Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Furosemide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Right ankle pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with history of sCHF, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
15-20%), severe pulmonary HTN and right sided heart failure,
recent worsening of lower extremity edema, presenting now with
1-1.5 week history of purplish toes and acute onset right medial
ankle pain.  Patient has had recent worsening of bilateral lower
extremity edema, with associated weeping.  Is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in Cardiology, and plan was for him to see an advanced
heart failure specialist.  Outpatient diuretic regimen of
ethacrynic acid recently increased to 150 mg daily.  Last night
around 6pm, developed [**9-20**] pain in the medial aspect of his
right ankle.  Pain came on suddenly and was sharp/cramping in
nature, extending mid-way up his calf.  He denies any preceding
injury or history of gout.  Given severe pain, called EMS and
was brought to ED for evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were 98.7 67 100/61 18 100% RA.  On exam,
his bilateral hands were cool, bluish w/blue discoloration of
the nails.  Had [**2-12**]+ lower ext edema with blue discoloration of
distal aspects of toes; [**3-16**] sec cap refill with dopplerable
PT/DPs bilaterally (L>R).  Noted to have of erythema over the
right medial malleolus tracking upwards to the mid calf, no
crepitus noted.  Labs notable for WBC 7.3 (N:71.7), INR 3.1, Cr
1.9.  K 5.5, lactate 2.7.  While in ED, BP dropped to
70s/40s-50s (baseline SBP in 80s).  Received 250cc NS, R IJ
placed, and he was started on norepinephrine. CVP was 12. No
alteration in mental status.  Also received broad antibiotic
coverage with vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/clindamycin and pain control with
morphine.  X-ray of right tib/fib negative for subcutaneous air
per prelim report.  Was concern for septic joint vs. cellulitis
vs. nec fasciitis.  ED deferred Vascular consult or CTA of aorta
with runoff due to [**Last Name (un) **] and bilateral distribution with
dopplerable pulses.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports pain has improved to
[**2184-2-12**].  VS on arrival 98.3 117/ 71/56 11 97% RA.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI.  Reports recent chills, "sweating" in his legs.

Micro:
[**8-25**] Blood cultures no growth

Imaging:
[**8-26**] Right tib/fib x-ray:
No evidence of soft tissue gas.  No suspicious bony lesions. No
fracture.
Calcification of the anterior tibial artery and the superficial
femoral artery are seen.

[**8-26**] Right ankle x-ray:
Three views of the right ankle demonstrate medial soft tissue
swelling; however, the alignment is normal and there is no
fracture or
dislocation.

[**8-26**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.  Left pleural
effusion has
improved compared to [**2186-4-11**].  The right IJ central line ends
at the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

[**8-28**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis. Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate
hypokinesis. Calcified aortic valve with probable moderate
aortic stenosis - the gradient is relatively low due to poor
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation directed towards
the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-1-23**],
left ventricular systolic function has worsened. The other
findings are similar.

([**8-30**]) R. Heart Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild elevation in right sided and severe elevation in left
sided
filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension with a moderately elevated PVR.

3. Severely reduced cardiac output/index.
4. PA catheter secured in place for continued hemodynamic
monitoring in
the CCU.  The PA catheter balloon should not be inflated without
