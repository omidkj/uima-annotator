Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH with right putamen intracranial hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 282**] tube placement [**2159-8-8**]


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 51 year-old woman with PMHx of HTN, ESRD, uterine
malignancy, history of L periventricular white matter infarct
and DM2 who presented from [**Hospital3 4107**] for an ICH that is
likely hypertensive in etiology. Per [**Hospital3 4107**] records,
the patient was at her baseline earlier on [**7-30**], then went to
dialysis in the afternoon.  When she returned home, she had a
rightward gaze and "wasn't acting right", so her family called
EMS (arond 8pm).  She was brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] where a
NCHCT was completed that showed a 4.1cm R lentiform ICH w/ 4mm
of midline shift.  Her BP at [**Hospital1 **] was initially in the 230's,
and she was given IV labetalol 20mg x2 with good effect.  She
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  In the
ED, she was seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no
intervention to be done (per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and recommended
admission to the neurology service.

Unable to complete ROS as pt is intubated and sedated.  However,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] records the patient had been c/o a headache when she
returned home from dialysis.



Past Medical History:
- ESRD due to Hypertension, diabetes, HD since [**2152**] MWF, left AV
fistula
- infarct of unknown timing in left periventricular white matter
- Hemochromatosis with grade 1 varices and cirrhosis.
- Diabetes type 2, on insulin.

Imaging:

NCHCT [**2159-7-31**]
FINDINGS:  There is a parenchymal hematoma centered in the right
external
capsule, displacting the right lentiform nucleus medially, and
extending into the corona radiata, which measures 3.9 x 1.7 cm
(2:18), not significantly changed in size.  The extent of
surrounding edema is also unchanged.  There is no new
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is mild effacement of the
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the right ventricle, and a minimal
leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, also unchanged. There
is no herniation.  The basal cisterns are not compressed.  Sulci
are more prominent than would be expected for the patient's age,
indicating cerebral atrophy.
Bilateral mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear.  There is evidence of right cataract surgery. The bones
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right external capsule
and corona
radiata, displacing the lentiform nucleus medially, with mild
associated mass effect, unchanged compared to approximately 4
hours earlier.  While this could represent a hypertensive
hemorrhage, a vascular malformation or a mass could also be
considered.  The latter possibilities could be investigated by
MRI/MRA, if clinically warranted.

Chest x-ray [**2159-8-1**]
There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum is widened.
There is mild pulmonary edema.  If any, there are small
bilateral pleural effusions.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 51 year-old woman with PMHx of HTN, ESRD,
uterine malignancy, history of L periventricular white matter
infarct and DM2 who presented from [**Hospital3 4107**] with left
sided weakness, aphasia and was found to have an ICH that is
likely hypertensive in etiology.

# NEURO: Patient was eating dinner when suddently her left and
and face "felt funny."  Per her friend who was present, she was
unable to speak and could not stand up from her chair.  Friend
called 911.  SBP at OSH was in the 230s on arrival.  Head CT was
obtained and showed a right putaminal hemorrhage.  The bleed was
most likely in the setting of hypertension (Of note, a recent
discharge summary from [**2159-5-31**] stated that her home labetalol
dose was 300mg PO BID; however on admission her home dose was
reportedly 100mg PO BID). Other possibilities would be a
hemorrhagic conversion of a stroke (although this is a less
likely location for that) or bleeding into a malignancy, but
again this is less likely than hypertensive hemorrhage given the
location and elevated BP on arrival to the OSH.  Her
neurological exam on admission was notable for minimal movement
of her L-side to noxious stimuli, which would fit with her R ICH
location.  She was admitted to the neuro ICU for further
evaluation and workup.  Aspirin/Simvastatin were held in the
setting of a bleed.  Shortly after arrival in the ICU, she was
successfully extubated.  Her blood pressure was initially quite
well controlled on labetalol 100mg PO BID. On HD #5 she became
persistently hypertensive to SBP 170s so amlodipine 5mg PO daily
was added to her antihypertensive regimen. In addition, due to
increased lethargy and possible ?eye opening apraxia during
hospitalization, she was started on modafinil to increase her
alertness -- this seemed to be helpful. On discharge, her neuro
exam was notable for dense
