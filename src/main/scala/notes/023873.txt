Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
multi-organ failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 45 y.o. man with pmh significant for
hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, who presented to an
outside hospital with abdominal pain, shortness of breath,
nausea and vomiting, chest pain, and hematuria. His wife reports
his symptoms began friday when he noticed hematuria. he
presented to the OSH ED, where CT abdomen was unrevealing and he
was told he passed a kidney stone. He went home, where he
developed abdominal pain. His pain was crampy in nature, and
localized over the left lower quadrant. He then developed lower
back pain and shortness of breath, with profound dyspnea on
exertion. Sunday night his abdominal pain was increasing in
severity. He then presented to the [**Hospital6 8283**] ED
Monday Morning. At presentation he had an INR of 4.0, other labs
consistent with DIC, hypotension with systolic blood pressure in
the 60's and oxygen saturation in the 70's. He was reporting
epigastric tenderness. Liver enzymes were also elevated, with T
bili 8.8, Direct Bili 5.5, AST 13,000, ALT 7820, LDH 11,000.
BUN/Cr 20/3.5. He was intubated, given ceftriaxone, levaquin,
and flagyl, and 1L NS, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival here
he was still hypotensive. A right IJ line was placed. A femoral
arterial line was placed as well. levophed was added and his
blood pressure was 66/34. he was given 5 Liters of NS.
vancomycin and zosyn were added. Initial labs in ED showed pH
6.90/76/86/16, lactate of 14.0.
.
On presentation to the ICU he underwent TEE which revealed
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, but no aortic
dissection. The patient became asystolic during this procedure
and was coded, receiving CPR, epinephrine, CaCl2, HCO3. .
.
He was placed on levophed, vasopressin, neosynephrine. He
received 3 more liters of 150meq sodium HCO3, and is receiving
continuous 150meq NaHCO3.

Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia. In
this location, aspiration is a potential etiology.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Air and decompressed urinary bladder consistent with
instrumentation,
correlate clinically.

CXR:
support lines remain in place; OGT not completely visualized.
allowing for
portable supine technique and low lung volumes, heart size may
not be
enlarged. left lower lobe consolidation and ill-defined right
perihilar
opacity are as seen on earlier same day CXR and CT abd/pelv.
areas of
consolidation in RUL and LUL somewhat more confluent. no supine
evidence of large ptx or large effusion seen. rt lateral sulcus
excluded.

TEE:
LVEF 75%, no evidence of aortic dissection


Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old man with pmh significant for obstructive sleep
apnea, hypertension, presenting with profound lactic acidosis
and hypotension despite three vasopressors.
.
#Hypotension: Differential included septic shock, vs. mesenteric
ischemia. Aortic dissection was not found on TEE. CT abdomen was
significant only for mild retroperitoneal fat stranding.
Babesiosis is a possibility given residence on [**Location (un) 7453**]. Other infectious sources include cholangitis or
cholecystitis given elevated liver enzymes.  Patient was
administered broad spectrum antibiotics-vanc, zosyn, flagyl,
doxycycline. He was maintained on vasopressin, phenylephrine,
dopamine, and levophed for pressor support. He was given NaHCO3,
LR for fluids. Patient expired before RUQ ultrasound could be
done.

.
# Lactic Acidosis: Differential included sepsis and mesenteric
ischemia given history of abdominal cramping pain.  He was
maintained on broad spectrum antibiotic. He was not a surgical
candidate in light of his other comorbidities.

.
# Transaminitis: Likely shock liver in setting of reported
hypotension at OSH. Must also consider other liver etiologies,
including acetaminophen, alcoholic hepatitis (given EtOH
history). Serum and urine tox were sent.  He did have an
elevated acetaminophen level, which could have contributed to
fulminant hepatic failure especially in light of heavy ETOH use.

.
# DIC:  Patient was supported with FFP, cryoprecipitate, and
vitamin K.

# Myocardial infarction: Patient had ST elevations in V1 through
V4, likely secondary to demand ischemia in light of severe
hypotension.

Patient expired at 20:35 on [**2195-10-19**]. His wife requested autopsy
to determine cause of death.
