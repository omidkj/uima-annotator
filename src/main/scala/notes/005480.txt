History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62 year old woman with locally advanced
esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing chemo-radiation therapy
(cycle 2 Cisplatinum/5-FU) who developed acute onset orthostasis
and presyncope while in [**Hospital **] clinic, with tachycardia to 130s
and hypoxia (88%RA).  She was given 1 L NS, O2 sats improved to
91% on 6L NC. 5-FU pump stopped, about 2 hours prior to planned
stop time. PIV was placed, and IV NS started with improvement in
pulse to 90s and BP to 130s/60s; pt sent to ED for evaluation.
.
ROS: Significant for nausea, sore throat, pain on swallowing,
skin changes in the area of radiation field, cough secondary to
radiation. Negative for weight change, change in vision,
hearing, sinus congestion, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea,
melena, BRBPR, chest pain (pleuritic or otherwise),
palpitations, dizziness or lightheadedness currently, hematuria,
dysuria, fevers, chills, night sweats, LE swelling, numbness,
tingling, weakness, recent long trips with immobilization.


Past Medical History:
Onc History:
Ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy on [**7-14**], cytology
positive for malignant cells consistent with signet-ring cell
carcinoma.  By EUS, the tumor was noted to be a fungating
ulcerative infiltrative circumferential non bleeding 6 cm mass
at 34 cm in the esophagus.  The mass caused a partial
obstruction.  The stomach and duodenum were considered normal
and she was staged as a T3, N1 son[**Name (NI) 5326**].  Therapy was
initiated with cisplatin and continuous infusion 5FU, followed
by XRT.  She was finishing a second cycle of chemo (it was cut
two hours short by admission) and XRT (she has four days left
which are scheduled for this week) when admitted.
.
Past Medical History:
-Esophageal cancer (signet-ring cell carcinoma T3, N1), dx

-h/o H Pylori '[**89**] & '[**92**]
-GERD
-Hiatal hernia
-HTN
-Hyperlipidemia

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT chest:
1. Large bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the main left and
right pulmonary arteries.
2. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes noted.
3. Diffuse thickening of the distal esophagus, consistent with
patient's history of esophageal cancer.
.
CT head:
Usual rounded relatively hypodense lesion within the suprasellar
region, possibly representing pituitary tumor, primary or
secondary to versus aneurysm. Dedicated CTA of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] is recommended.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Large esophageal mass and single 1 cm lymph node just
inferior to the esophageal hiatus.
2. J-tube in situ with moderate stranding of the subcutaneous
tissues; no evidence of fluid collection, abscess, or
obstruction.
3. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, VS: 130/90, 96.7, 80, 28, 99% 2L NC. She had CTA
showing bilateral massive PE; ECG w/o evidence of strain. CT
head showed a suprasellar lesion concerning for 1 cm aneurysm.
Neurosurgery and oncology were consulted; she was started on
anticoagulation out of concern for hemodynamic compromise from
PE.  She was admitted to the MICU.
.
MICU Course: She was continued on heparin gtt.  MRI head was
done and showed a suprasellar mass.  MRA of the head was normal,
ruling out an aneurysms.  The neurosurgeons requested the
patient follow up as an outpatient.  She remained
hemodynamically stable in the MICU, and was called out to the
floor after 1 day.
.
While on the floor, the patient was transitioned from a heparin
drip to lovenox injections to treat her large bilateral
pulmonary emboli.  She initially required 4L nasal cannula to
provide adequate oxygenation, however, her oxygen requirement
decreased over the course of stay.  At discharge, the patient
was requiring 2L nasal cannula to maintain her oxygenation.  Her
home regimen of estrogen replacement therapy was also held.  The
patient was followed by physical therapists while in the
hospital and was able to ambulate well with portable oxygen at
the end of her stay.
.
Once stable on the floor, the patient completed her course of
radiation therapy, to complete 25 treatments.  She will follow
up as an outpatient for discussion of further chemotherapy for
her esophageal cancer.
.
Tube feeds were initiated while the patient was in the hospital.
 Her tube became clogged several times and was then replaced by
Thoracics for a larger diameter tube.  The patient had several
G-tube checks in interventional radiology to confirm the
placement and patency of the tube.  At discharge, tube feeds
were running smoothly.  The patient had difficulty swallowing
secondary to XRT to the esophagus.  Her pain was controlled with
both a Fentanyl patch in addition to liquid oxycodone and magic
mouthwash.
.
The patient spiked one fever during her hospitalization.  Blood,
urine and stool cultures were all negative for infection.  Chest
xray did not show evidence of pneumonia.  The patient did have
erythema around her feeding tube.  CT scan did not demonstrate
any abscess, however, the patient was treated empirically for a
cellulitis with antibiotics.  She was discharged to complete a
two week course of Augmentin.
