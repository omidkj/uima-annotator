Radiology
=========
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**] - IMPRESSION:
Limited study due to patient motion. No evidence for discitis,
osteomyelitis, or paraspinal abscess.

CXR [**12-20**]
Significantly limited radiograph without evidence of large
effusion or pneumothorax. Recommend repeat PA and lateral when
feasible.
Probable left lower lobe opacity suggesting aspiraton.

CXR [**12-24**]
In comparison with the study of [**12-22**], there is continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with poor definition of
engorged
pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.
Probable bibasilar atelectatic change, though a lateral view
would be helpful for further evaluating this region. Nasogastric
tube extends well into the stomach. The

TTE [**12-23**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. with normal free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
is a focal thickening (non-mobile) at the tip of the
non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve with the appearance of
fibrocalcific change. No definite vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude
valvular vegetations.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 83 year old female with a history of
schizophrenia who lives at home with her sister who is
additionally noted to have cognitive delay and significant
psychiatric disease. On [**12-20**], the patient called EMS with a
chief complaint of severe back pain and fever with T = 106.0 on
EMS arrival. In the ED the patient was noted to confused,
agitated and febrile to 102 with vitals of 210/64, P116, 98% on
4L. The patient was reporting at that time severe back pain and
difficulty walking or sitting. The patient was intubated,
sedated and received ceftriaxone, Flagyl and propofol. The
patient was transferred to the ICU for further care. In the ICU
the patient was noted to have 1/2 bottles growing Group B Strep.
The patient had a CT Head that was without acute change,
Abdominal CT/Pelvis that
