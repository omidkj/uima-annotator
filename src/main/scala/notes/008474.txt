Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty of the
perforated right proximal inferior epigastric artery

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo woman with H/O HTN, asthma, GERD, left
breast CA, subdural hematoma s/p evacuation with residual
difficulty with short term memory, transferred from [**Hospital 27034**] Hospital after being admitted on [**2198-8-31**] for chest pain.
Much of the HPI is given by the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) **]. The
patient initially had epigastic pain radiating to her back the
night prior to presentation to OSH, which resolved with her home
omeprazole; the following morning, she presented to the OSH
complaining of similar pain along with non-exertional chest pain
with radiation to left shoulder and back and associated with SOB
and nausea; TNG gtt was started and her pain improved to [**12-3**].
Initially, the chest pain was not thought to be cardiac in
nature as it was reproducible with palpation. However, the
morning day prior to transfer, the patient had sudden onset of
[**5-3**] chest pain, which did not respond to Nexium, Pepcid and
nitro paste; at that time, her biomarkers bumped up once again
(troponin peak 5.3, trended down to 1.34 then bumped again to
1.45 AM of transfer, CK peaked at 225 and continued to trend
down) and she received Plavix 300 mg and was started on a
heparin and Integrilin gtt due to continued chest pain. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization having
continued [**2197-11-25**] chest pain, which resolved upon arrival without
intervention.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE in [**2192**] after initiation of
Tamoxifen therapy for her breast cancer. On review of systems,
she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2198-9-14**]):
   STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET
ONLY.
         SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST.

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2198-9-12**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2198-9-7**]):    No MRSA isolated.

ECG [**2198-9-3**]  9:04:34 PM
Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular complex. Poor R wave
progression is probably a normal variant. Low QRS voltage in the
limb leads. No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR [**2198-9-3**]:
No previous images. The right chest port extends to the lower
portion of the SVC, though the precise tip is difficult to
visualize. No evidence of acute pneumonia or congestion. There
is some increased opacification obscuring the right heart border
suggesting volume loss in the middle lobe. Of incidental note
are surgical clips in the left axillary region.

Cardiac catheterization [**2198-9-4**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
normal in appearence. The LAD was normal with a dual LAD system.
The D2 had a long serpentine 99% lesion in the distal vessel.
The LCx and RCA were both normal.
2. Resting hemodynamics
