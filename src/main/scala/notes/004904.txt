CTA Head:  NO OBVIOUS AVM IS SEEN. BILATERAL FRONTAL HEMMORHAGE
WITH ASSOCIATED SUBFALCINE AND UNCAL HERNIATION .IVH is seen as
extension of of parenchymal hemmorhage.
CT Head without contrast: Massive R (7.8x4.5cm)>L (2.8x1.8cm)
with R parietal/frontal SDH and small L frontal SDH, small R
falx
SAH, +10mm midline shift with subfalcine and subuncal herniation
on the right.  +Effacement of suprasellar cistern.

NCHCT [**2136-4-7**]
Biventricular catheters have been removed with small air present
within the ventricles and pneumocephalus along the catheter
tracts. The large bifrontal intracranial hemorrhages (right
greater than left) are stable in appearance. Mass effect
including a leftward subfalcine herniation and small uncal
herniation is unchanged. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear. The osseous structures are unremarkable aside from
bifrontal burr holes and overlying skin staples.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain with large bifrontal
intracranial hemorrhages, subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Bilateral ventricular catheters removed.

CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/Pelvis [**2136-4-8**]
1. Marked inflammatory changes in the pelvis, with a linear
tract leading from the presacral coccygeal space to the skin
surface, may represent a perianal sinus tract. No drainable
fluid collection. Linear tract in the right lower abdominal wall
may also represent a fistula, however the assessment is
difficult due to lack of the contrast in the underlying bowel
loops.
2. Abnormal appearance of the sacrum and L5 vertebral body,
consistent with given history of osteomyelitis. MR could be
obtained to evaluate for evidence of active process.
3. Moderately dilated loops of small bowel, consistent with
ileus.

CXR [**2136-4-6**] Low lung volumes.  No evidence of failure or
worsening infection.

BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)  [**2136-4-9**]
27 year old man with frontal hemorrhage and [**Last Name (un) 73258**] disease fell
out of bed c/o left hip pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:R/o fracture
HISTORY: Left hip pain.
Five radiographs of the pelvis and bilateral hips demonstrate no
fracture. Femoral head contours are smooth. Bilateral sacroiliac
joint spaces are normal. Pubic symphysis is normal. Regional
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:No fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 27 y old man with large R>L frontal atraumatic ICH
with intraventricular extension and hydrocephalus in the setting
of known cocaine use.

ICH:
Bilateral external ventricular drains were placed on [**2136-3-30**]. He
was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. He was treated
with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. Serial CT scans showed
stable appearances of hemorrhage. EVD was clamped and removed on
[**2136-4-5**]. He was transferred to the floor on [**2136-4-5**].

His mental status improved. He consistently thought he was at
the [**Hospital6 1708**]. Oriented to time and person.
There was no focal motor deficit, normal coordination. He has
L>R action tremor. He was observed for 24 hours was found to be
neurologically intact with the exception of short term memory
difficulties, slightly disinhibited/emotional.

The patient is being treated with dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis.  Please continue to monitor levels. Goal dilantin
15-20. Additional 300mg given on [**2136-4-9**].

The patient was seen by PT and OT and will be discharged to
rehabilitation facility for further recovery.

Please arrange follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with CT head.

Pneumonia:
CXR showed LLL opacity concerning for penumonia and on [**2136-4-2**] he
was commenced on levofloxacin. This was ceased on [**2136-4-6**] as he
was covered for meningitis (see below). Repeat CXR on [**2136-4-6**]
showed stable to improved.

Sacral osteomyelitis/Crohn's disease:
Crohn's disease with sacral osteomyelitis and sacral drain.
General surgical team discussed with [**Hospital1 112**] surgeon regarding drain
and directed to leave drain in situ, he is should be treated
prophylactically with Amoxicillin. Amoxicillin ceased on [**2136-4-6**]
while covered with ceftriaxone and linezolid.  Amoxycillin
should be restarted after other antibiotic course completed.
Drain pulled out on [**2136-4-8**].  CT abdomen revealed no abcess or
fluid collection. Discussed with general surgery team. Not for
replacement of drain at this stage. Monitor clinically for pain,
signs of inflammation and monitor inflammatory markers.  Repeat
imaging studies if indicated. The patient needs follow up with
the Gastroenterology and General Surgical teams at [**Hospital1 112**].

There is a small draining sinus/fistula on the anterior abdomen
(draining small serous fluid) and a small sinus on the left
buttock (site of sacral drain).
A further GI operation has been recommended by the surgical team
for treatment of Crohn's disease. The patient had failed to
attend follow up.  Please arrange follow up appointment and
facilitate attendance. He currently has a rectal tube in situ.

[**4-6**] Pt's WBC increased to 23, on further evaluation of his CSF
from [**4-5**] he had 205 WBC 4950 RBC and 118 glucose gram stain
negative. He was not systemically unwell, had only background
headache and no neck stiffness. A chest xray showed: stable
right pneumonia and urine an
