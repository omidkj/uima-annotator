Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-8-6**]
4:06 AM

COMAPRISON: Outside study performed 3 hours ago.

NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There are tiny foci of intracranial
hemorrhage adjacent
to the right thalamus. No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Left
temporomandibular glenoid fossa fracture, left zygomatic process
fracture,
left inferior and medial orbital wall blowout fractures, left
inferior orbital
rim fracture, left maxillary sinus medial and lateral wall
fractures, left
nasal fracture, left lateral orbital wall fracture, right medial
lamina
papyracea of fracture, multiple ethmoid fractures. These appear
stable when
compared with outside exam. There are multiple foci of
hemorrhage within the
ethmoid sinuses as well as air- fluid levels in the left
maxillary sinus and
right maxillary sinus. The mastoid air cells are grossly intact.


IMPRESSION: Stable exam when compared with outside study
demonstrating
multiple facial fractures and scattered foci of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.


NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The outside studies were not
available when I
reviewed the [**Hospital1 18**] examination. Therefore, I cannot comment on
change since
the earlier study. I recommend adding the outside study to the
[**Hospital1 18**] PACS
record.



Radiology Report CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST
Study Date of [**2156-8-7**] 4:56 AM

COMPARISON: Outside study performed [**2150-8-6**].

MAXILLOFACIAL CT SERIES NON-CONTRAST: Left temporomandibular
clinoid fossa
fracture, left zygomatic process fracture, left inferior and
medial orbital
wall blowout fractures, left inferior orbital rim fracture, left
maxillary
sinus, medial, and lateral wall fractures, left nasal fracture,
right
maxillary fractures are unchanged. There are multiple foci of
hemorrhage
within the sinuses which are slightly increased since prior
exam.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple unchanged facial fractures with scattered foci of
bleeding into
the paranasal sinuses.
2. Extensive dissection of air into the soft tissues of the neck
is likely
secondary to air leak from chest tube in right pneumothorax.


ATTENDING NOTE: Bilateral midface [**Last Name (un) 52400**] Type II fractures are
noted. There
is also involvement od pterygoid plates on the right.


Radiology Report CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2156-8-10**]
11:38 AM


COMPARISON: CT head without contrast, [**2156-8-7**].

FINDINGS:

HEAD CT: Punctate areas of attenuation in the right thalamic
area previously
described are unchanged. [**Month (only) 116**] represent hemorrhage as previously
noted.
Calcifications would be less likely in a patient of this age.
Bifrontal
prominence of the sulci is unchanged from prior. The ventricles
are normal in
caliber and configuration. The paranasal sinuses demonstrate
unchanged
opacification of the left maxillary sinus and decreased
opacification of the
right maxillary sinus with better aeration. There is bilateral
ethmoid
mucosal thickening. The fluid level in the left ethmoid sinus is
unchanged
from the prior study. There is partial opacification of the
mastoid air cells
bilaterally, possibly related to intubation. There is interval
resolution of
left-sided periorbital soft tissue swelling on at the level of
the zygoma.

There is stable subcutaneous empysema in the anterior neck
spaces. There is
residual bilateral pneumothoraces. Bilateral subcutaneous
emphysema of the
chest wall is again noted. Chest tubes are in place bilaterally.
The aortic
arch is normal.

HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their
major
branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis. There is no
evidence of
filling defect or contrast extravasation. There is no evidence
of dissection
or aneurysmal formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Grossly stable head CT.
2. Bilateral stable pneumothroaces.
3. Normal internal cerebral and neck vasculature.


Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-8-16**]
1:02 PM


CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:

Again seen are minimally displaced fractures involving the
bilateral superior
and inferior pubic rami. Fracture of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] is
again noted. The
fracture line extends to the articular surface of the sacroiliac
joint along
its anterior margin. No proximal femur fracture is evident. The
acetabula
are intact. The femoral head contours are smooth. The sacrum is
normal. No
abnormal widening or narrowing of the sacroiliac joint spaces is
identified.
There is a Foley catheter with its tip in the urinary bladder. A
small amount
of air is present within the collapsed urinary bladder.

There is marked subcutaneous emphysema overlying the anterior
right lower
quadrant superficial to the abdominal musculature. A small
amount of
subcutaneous air is seen within the right groin as well.

There is expansion of the left iliacus muscle adjacent to the
iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**]
fracture site, representing hematoma, slightly worse when
compared with
[**2156-8-9**]. Fluid attenuation within the left gluteus musculature
is seen at
the inferior and lateral aspect of the imaged field of view and
represents
hematoma, also seen on the previous CT examination. The finding
is
incompletely assessed but likely slightly larger when compared
to the previous
exam.

The visualized bowel is unremarkable.

No free fluid is identified within the pelvis.

IMPRESSION:

Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures and left
iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**]
fracture, unchanged.

Probable interval increase in left iliacus and left gluteal
hematomas as
described above.

Subcutaneous emphysema along the anterior aspect of the right
abdominal wall,
similar to that seen on previous studies.













Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Orthopedics, Neurosurgery
and Plastics were consulted given his multiple injuries. His
subarachnoid hemorrhage was small and did not require any
intervention; it was recommended that if there was deterioration
in his mental statu
