Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 year old male w ESRD on M/W/F HD, CHF, COPD on home O2 and
OSA on nocturnal biPAP and right sided pleural effusion
presenting [**Location (un) 54358**]with shortness of breath and
hypoxia. The patient is a poor historian but reports recently
being in the hospital and being transferred [**Location (un) 54359**]to live approximately 2-3 days ago. Although he has requires
daytime oxygen at baseline, he reports not being given O2 while
[**Location (un) 54360**]. He felt short of breath earlier on the day
of admission so he called EMS. Per report, when EMS arrived, his
sat was in the 60s so he was placed on supplemental O2 and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.1 74 152/92 20 98% 4L NC --> 80s
on 6L NC. Exam was notable for an uncomfortable male, expiratory
wheezing with bilateral decrease in basilar breath sounds. Labs
revealed Hct 29.5, K 4.9, creatinine 11.3, lactate 1.2, ABG
7.32/57/74 on 8L NC CoOx 6%. Blood cultures were drawn. Patient
was given vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin, methylpred 125mg IV and
nebs *3. CXR showed right pleural effusion. VS prior to transfer
were: 71 144/69 14 95% on 8L.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient is very agitated and
combative. He is not interested in providing further history. He
reports wanting to die.

PCXR:
1. Opacification of the right lower lung presumably combination
of moderate
right pleural effusion and RLL atelectasis; however, cannot
exclude pneumonia.
2. Improved aeration of the left lung base with residual
atelectasis.
3. Persistent prominent hila, as seen on CT could be reactive
lymphadenopathy.
4. Mild edema..
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional left ventricular
systolic function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a chronic or
acute on chronic primary pulmonary process (e.g., primary
pulmonary hypertension, pulmlonary embolism, bronchospasm, sleep
apnea, etc.).

Brief Hospital Course:
45M with what appears to be paranoid schizophrenia, ESRD on HD,
COPD on 3L NC O2 at home, OSA on CPAP, and substance abuse who
was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress from
volume overload and due to lack of access to his home oxygen per
the patient.
.
In the MICU, empiric antibiotics and steroids were started.
However, his hypoxia was much improved after a single session of
HD. His behavioral issues were an impediment to optimal medical
care, and due to threatening behavior and suicidal expressions
he was placed on a 1:1 security sitter and made Section 12.
.
# Hypoxia: Given rapidity of response to HD, it seem likely that
he was volume overloaded. Given this, antibiotics and steroids
were stopped. Continued HD Q MWF for volume control. Received
standing Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q6H and Ipratropium
Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H.  His oxygen requirement decreased back
to baseline over the course of his hospitalization to his
baseline requirement of 3L NC O2.  The patient has a pleural
effusion that is of unclear etiology.  Pulmonary recommended
repeat thoracentesis and/or consideration of a thoracotomy was
suggested for further work up but the patient adamently refused.

One barrier for the patient is that he reports that he was not
allowed to use his portable oxygen outside of his room at his
group home.  We explained to the patient that there was a danger
to have oxygen around when he was smoking and he understands the
risks of combustion.  However, he does need to wear his oxygen
at all other times.  He reported having a functional CPAP
machine at home to use for his OSA.
-outpatient pulmonary or interventional pulmonary follow up for
further evaluation of his pleural effusion is suggested if the
patient is agreeable in the future patient is agreeable
.
# Psychotic disorder: After being aggitated in the MICU, the
patient remained non-aggressive on the floor (though he had
paranoia, did raise his voice and did try to leave the floor to
smoke on multiple occasions).  We believe his increased
aggression was likelely due to hypoxia and hypercarbia. Has
paranoid features, which were felt consistent with schizophrenic
v schizoaffective v bipolar disorder. Psych and SW consulted on
the patient this admission. After talking to outpatient
providers, and doing an evaluation, psychiatry felt the patient
was at his baseline and section 12 was removed.  He was
continued Divalproex (DELayed Release) 375 mg PO BID for mood
stablization.
.
# COPD: Active smoker. Baseline oxygen requirement is 3L NC O2.
Received standing nebs as above and supplemental oxygen.
Encouraged smoking cessation.
-Started Albuterol Inhaler
- [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from a long acting anticholinergic such as
tiotropium and an inhaled steroid such as fluticasone given his
smoking history and hypoxia.  Outpat
