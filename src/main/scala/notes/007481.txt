STUDIES:
[**2126-12-9**] CXR:
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen,
terminating at the lateral aspect of where the mid SVC would be
expected to be located. No pneumothorax is seen. Right upper
lung consolidation is worrisome for pneumonia. There may also be
subtle patchy left base opacity. No pleural effusion is seen.
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
