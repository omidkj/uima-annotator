HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for exertional
angina dating back approximately five years ago.  At that
time, he was placed on beta blockers which ultimately
resolved his symptoms.  However, this past [**Month (only) 956**], he was
diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with surgery and
radiation, and had quit smoking at that time.  Since then, he
gained approximately 40 pounds.  Recently he has noted chest
pressure and dyspnea on exertion with a limited amount of
activity, i.e., mowing the lawn or going for walks, and
symptoms always resolve with rest.  On [**2189-11-2**], he had a
stress echocardiogram where he exercised for 5 minute 58
seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, reaching 67% of maximal
predicted heart rate, and had positive chest pain with modest
ST segment depression with biphasic T wave changes noted
during the recovery period.  Echocardiogram revealed probable
exercise-induced ischemia at the inferior base, possibly a
small area of ischemia at the apex.  At that time, he denied
any claudication, no edema, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
no lightheadedness.  He sleeps with two pillows, but
attributes this to recent weight gain and need to be somewhat
elevated while sleeping.  His height was 5'6", weight was 197
pounds.  Coronary artery disease risk factors included
hypercholesterolemia, previous smoker but quit in [**Month (only) 956**] of
this year, positive family history with father having three
myocardial infarctions in his 70s, brother with coronary
artery bypass graft and died of a myocardial infarction in
his 50s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   [**2189-1-8**], diagnosed with lung
cancer, treated with XRT and surgery; he has a remote history
of ulcers; hyperlipidemia; tobacco.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Significant for rotator cuff injury
in [**2174**].  He had gastrointestinal surgery not otherwise
specified, and in [**2189-1-8**], right upper lobectomy.
No history of transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular
accident or gastrointestinal bleed.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once
daily, Pravachol 40 mg by mouth once daily, Norvasc 5 mg by
mouth once daily, atenolol 100 mg by mouth once daily,
nortriptyline 25 mg by mouth once daily, Imdur 30 mg by mouth
once daily, and a multivitamin by mouth once daily.

LABORATORY DATA:   On [**2189-11-2**], hematocrit 40, INR 1.01, BUN
and creatinine of 14 and 1.0.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He is married and lives in [**Location 1439**] with his
wife.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Given the above symptoms, he was
ultimately admitted to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]' service and he
underwent a cardiac catheterization showing no mitral
regurgitation on left ventriculography.  Coronary angiogram
was a right dominant system with a left main coronary disease
showing diffuse 70% disease, left anterior descending had
minor irregularities, with a D1 having proximal 70% stenosis,
left circumflex with mid-60% stenosis, and the right
circumflex had mid-80% stenosis.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction was 55%.  Therefore, given the significant left main
and three vessel coronary artery disease, he was admitted and
a Cardiothoracic Surgery consult was obtained.

His evaluation ultimately yielded a consultation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**2189-11-10**] when he was admitted to the hospital,
and had undergone his catheterization which showed
significant enough disease to warrant operative intervention.

On [**2189-11-11**], the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3, including left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending, right saphenous vein graft to right
coronary artery, posterior descending artery, and also a
right saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal I.  His
pericardium was left open. He had a right radial A-line.  He
had a Swan-Ganz catheter in place, with a right internal
jugular cordis.  He had two ventricular wires, one atrial and
one ground wire present.  He had one mediastinal and one left
pleural tube.  His mean arterial pressure upon leaving the
operating room was 78, his CVP was 16, he had a pulmonary
artery diastolic pressure of 24 and a main pulmonary artery
of 30.  He was on Levophed at .2 mcg/kg/minute, and also
propofol at 20 mcg/kg/minute.

He was brought to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and was
maintained overnight on Levophed at .5, nitroglycerin drip at
.25, as well as insulin drip and was given propofol for
sedation. He remained intubated.  He had a lactate of 5.5,
coming down to 4.5.  He was in sinus tachycardia at 104, with
blood pressures of 120/60.  He was intubated on SIMV of 800 x
14, with a PEEP of 5, with pressure support of 5.  Gas was
7.36/41/82/24/-1.  Neurologically, his propofol was
discontinued.  His respiratory was weaned from the
ventilator.  His chest x-ray was checked, and he was
transfused two units for a hematocrit of 24.  Renal had no
issues.  Infectious Disease:  He was given perioperative
vancomycin and he stayed in the Intensive Care Unit at this
time.

On postoperative day number two, because of failure to
extubate the patient because of high PA pressures and
agitation, he remained intubated.  He was on Levophed at .35,
nitroglycerin at .25.  His hemodynamics were unable to be
weaned from the previously indicated pressor drip.  He was in
sinus tachycardia persistently at 105.  His hematocrit was 26
after transfusion.  BUN and creatinine were 14. and .8.  He
was sedated neurologically.  His Levophed was weaned
accordingly.  His nitroglycerin drop was discontinued.  He
received bronchoscopy and chest x-ray to check why his thick
secretions prevented him from having extubation.  Renal-wise,
his lasix was started and he was also started on Reglan.
Minimal secretions were fine bilaterally in the airways from
the [**2189-11-13**] bronchoscopy.

By postoperative day number three, the patient remained on
SIMV at 800 x 14.  He had a PEEP of 10 and pressure support
of 5.  His gas was 7.5/34/103/27.  He was on Levophed at .3
at this point.  His blood pressure was being maintained
around 90 to 100 systolic.  He was in sinus tachycardia at
110.  His Haldol was being utilized as needed.  He did spike
a temperature to 101.5 at this point, and blood cultures were
sent.  Gram-negative rods ultimately grew out from his
bronchoscopy lavage.  He was subsequently diuresed.  PEEP was
weaned.

By postoperative day number four, he was weaned off the
ventilator.  Levophed was weaned as tolerated.  He was
transfused a unit of blood for a hematocrit of 23.  BUN and
creatinine remained 19 and .9.  Sputum grew out gram-positive
rods and gram-positive cocci.  Blood cultures from [**2189-11-13**]
were noted to have gram-positive cocci as well.  Sputum from
cultures had aforementioned gram-negative rods x 2 from
[**2189-11-13**].  He was empirically started on vancomycin, Cipro and
Zosyn.  He continued to spike high-grade temperatures to 102
and 103 subsequently.  He had full culture panels.  He did
grow out E. coli from his sputum that was pansensitive.

He ultimately did have a prolonged intubation, as he was not
weaned from the ventilator until postoperative day number
six.  Infectious Disease consultation was obtained.  Their
recommendations were to stop vancomycin secondary to the fact
that his fevers had started while on vancomycin and doubted
that this was contributing much.  They recommended
discontinuing Zosyn and discontinuing ciprofloxacin, as he
continued to spike on antibiotics.  They recommended starting
Kefzol 1 gram intravenously every eight hours due to its good
Klebsiella pneumonia coverage and good gram-positive
coverage, and then to follow a peripheral blood culture.
Additionally, they recommended re-siting all lines, which was
done on postoperative day number five.  Nutrition
consultation recommended total parenteral nutrition for
nutritional
