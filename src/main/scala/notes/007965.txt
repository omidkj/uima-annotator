Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 76 year old man with history of hypertension,
asthma (diagnosed 1 year ago) and glaucoma, presenting with 3
days of cold like symptoms and cough. Patient reports he was in
his ussual state of health until this past Friday, when he began
to feel congested and started having a cough productive of
"greyish white" sputum.

Patient reports he attemted to take his inhaler but this made
him feel very light headed (as though he would faint) and
stopped taking it. Denies any chest pain, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea. Has not had any syncopal episodes. Patient
has no history of cardiac problems or other chronic medical
conditions.

In the emergency department, patient received a dose of
solumedrol, nebulizers and levofloxacin after chest x-ray
revealed a question of a right lower lobe infiltrate. During his
stay in the ED, patient was noted to go into rapid atrial
fibrillation into the 150's without symptoms. Patient was given
4 liters of IV fluids and although rate improved systolic blood
pressure decreased to 90's. Patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
futher management.

Part of the history obtained from primary care office. Lives in
elder housing, diagnosed with COPD in the last year.

Imaging/results:
CXR [**3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Ill-defined opacity in the right lung base,
which may represent pneumonia. Emphysema.
.
CXR [**3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Increasing right cardiophrenic angle
consolidation and increasing mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

.
CXR: [**3-3**]:  In comparison with the study of [**3-2**], there is
obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm consisting with
increasing pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some pulmonary
vascular congestion persists
.
Echo [**3-4**]: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
LAE. . Left ventricular function is probably normal (EF >55%), a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle appears mildly dilated and hypokinetic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly 76year old male with h/o HTN, asthma, glaucoma,
COPD/asthma presented to ER [**3-2**] with 4days of LH/[**Month (only) **] PO, 2days
of new productive cough/fevers/DOE. Found to have RLL PNA and
COPD exacerbation. In ER, got solumedrol, nebs, levoflox,
required 4L 02. While in ER, reportedly developed "Afib RVR" to
150s a/w LH and transient hypotension 90 SBP, was given 4L IVFs
and admitted to ICU. Did well overnight in ICU, noted at 3am to
be in NSR. Given CHADS 2, started on [**Month (only) **] 325mg. Continued on
levoflox for PNA. Solumedrol converted to prednisone 60, on 4L
O2. Had [**Last Name (un) **], improved wtih IVFs as above. Transfered to Gen Med
on [**3-3**].
Did well on Gen Med floor. His O2 requirements were weaned to
2Lnc at rest.  Was kept on prednisone 60 and levaquin. Afebrile.
Breathing had improved over next two days.  Still had cough,
thus started guaifenesin/dextromet. On discharge, will complete
3more days of prednisone 60mg and Levaquin (7days total for
both). Has significant smoking history (100+pack year), thus
likely all COPD. Was started on advair and spiriva and xopenex
(see below).  Spent extensive time reviewing his medications and
explaining proper use of advair, spiriva scheduled and xopenex
prn. Was still requiring oxygen, thus decision made to send home
on O2 with outpt follow up. Needs 2L O2 at rest and 4L with
ambulation (to maintain 92% sats). Home O2 set up and teaching
provided.
On thing to note was that, pt has exaggerated sympathetic
response to albuterol with HR up 130s after treatment
(asymptomatic) and tremors. On EKG,  this is sinus tach with
frequent PACs. On review of EKGs from ER, not clear that was
Afib at that time either. More likely had similar sinus tach
with frequent PACs after getting nebs in ER. Other possibility
is MAT given irreg narrow complex tachy, but cant assess
sequential p-wave morphorlogy. Note, Echo with normal EF and
mild RV free wall HK. Decision made to change albuterol mdi to
xopenex mdi with hope that pt will develop tolerance to
sympathetic effects. For the tachycardia (with normal EF),
started on Cardizem 180mg (replacing hctz). Has follow up
arranaged with pulmonary [**4-15**].  Have explained to him that many
of his medications have changed and that he needs to ONLY take
the medications that are prescribed on discharge. Was set up
with VNA services.
Started on PPI ([**Month/Year (2) **], prednisone) on discharge.

See plan below according to problem list:
.
76 year old man with h/o asthma/COPD, HTN, dyslipidemia,
glaucoma here with 4days of LH/[**Month (only) **] PO, followed by
cough/fever/dyspnea, admitted to MICU [**3-2**] with COPD exacerbation
[**1-26**] PNA. Had a transient episode of possible Afib RVR (vs sinus
tach c PACs), transfered to Gen Med [**3-3**] for further management.
doing well. d/c home today
.

CAP complicated by COPD exacerbation: CXR with RLL PNA. pt
reports dx of "asthma" 1year ago, however significant tobacco
history more suggestive of COPD. Unclear why only on pulmicort
at home, needs a new respiratory regimen. Currently afebrile,
REsp status improved but still requiring O2.
-continue Levaquin, day [**3-31**].
-cont prednisone 60mg, plan 7day burst, day 4
-given tachy response to albuterol (significant), placed on
xopenex mdi
-educated on use of advair [**Hospital1 **] (hopefully with not have too much
tachy response to salmeterol), spiriva qd, xopenex prn.
-HOme O2 2L at rest, 4L with exertion (to maintain sats around
92%), needs reeval as outpt
-Pulm appt as new pt set up on [**4-15**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 26281**] VNA set up
.
Tachycardia: was reported to have Afib RVR episode in ER after
recieving duonebs. Denies prior history but asymptomatic. On
further evaluation of the EKGs as well as pattern on Tele, it
appears that pt has sinus tach with frequent PACs rather than
afib. This is bought on by albuterol nebs each time (up to
130-140s).  Other poss that is hard to exclude given poor
quality EKG is MAT. Note, pt is for most part asymptomatic. no
fever/pain/volume depletion as other cause of ST. Note, Echo
with likely normal EF >55%.
-given exaggerated sympathetic response to albuterol, switched
to xopenex, hopefully with develop tolerance to these effects in
time
-started dilt, titrated to 180
-since review of EKGs less suggestive of Afib, will decrease [**Name (STitle) **]
back to 81mg (since also on steroids)
.
[**Last Name (un) **]: reported [**Month (only) **] PO. Creat 1.7-->0.9 with 4L IVFs, hold further
IVFs as CXR wtih suggestion of mild pulm edema and pt taking
good POs. Again, unlikely sinus tach [**1-26**] volume depletion
.
Glaucoma: confirmed with pharmacy, on xalatan b/l qhs. resumed.
