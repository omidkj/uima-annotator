Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 88yo female with h/o hypertension, CAD
s/p MI, CHF, DM2, hypothyroidism, CHB s/p pacer presenting from
rehab with confusion and aphasia

1. Mental status changes: ddx was broad included toxic
metabolic, UTI, stroke, seizure amongst others.  Although
initial UA was unremarkable, UTI was thought to be most likely
cause as UCX showed coag neg staph greater than 100,000.  Once
UCX posted, vancomycin was started on [**11-28**] on renal dosing
pattern.  Pt's elevated TSH prompted endocrine consultation, who
recommended increasing levothyroxine dose to 100 mcg/day; of
note, endocrine consultation did not believe that hypothyroidism
was responsible for acute decline in MS.  [**Name14 (STitle) 1094**] electrolytes were
significant for hypernatremia, which resolved s/p 1 L of D5W.
Neurology workup at last admission concluded that baseline
dementia is secondary to chronic multiple ischemic events.  CT
head was negative for IC mass or hemorrhage.  Pt's mentals
status waxed and waned, from conversational to paranoid to
pleasant but cofused.  At discharge, her mental status was
improved, although she did show evidence of a resolving deirium.

2. UTI - UCX revealed coag-neg staph sensitive to vancomycin.
She completed a 5-day course of vancomycin.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure- baseline cr 2.5, 3.0 on
admission. It was likely prerenal in origin. She received 2 L
IVF over her first day. She then was taking in good POs, and
creatinine went to 2.4-2.5 her baseline. We continued pt's
epoetin per outpatient doses. Her Hct will need to monitored to
make sure it does not go too high with the epoetin.

5. DM 2- Glipizide was held as pt initially was taking poor POs.
She was started on a regular insulin sliding scale with BS
120-200 range in the ICU. Once on the floor, she was maitained
on her home dose of glipizide.

6. Left shoulder pain- chronic in nature from accident 20 years
ago. She got injected at rehab.

7. CV-
a. CAD- continued ASA, metoprolol, and Statin.
b. Pump- h/o diastolic CHF. euvolemic-dry on exam. We held her
Lasix and monitored fluid status qday. She was euvolemic on
discharge.
c. Rhythm- sinus on EKG

8. HTN- continued regimen of metoprolol, amlodipine, and Imdur.


9. Hypothyroid- TSH elevated at 15. Levoxyl increased to 100 mcg
from 75 mcg qday. Ms. [**Known lastname 92993**] will need her TSH to be checked 6
weeks from discharge.

10. Anemia-continued epoetin per outpt regimen as above as well
as iron supplementation.
