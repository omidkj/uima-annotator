[**11-16**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Exam is somewhat limited
due to patient body habitus. The liver is unremarkable with no
focal lesions. The gallbladder has multiple gallstones, with a
large gallstone measuring up to 1.4 cm. There is no wall
thickening or pericholecystic fluid to suggest cholecystitis. No
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was present. The common bile duct is
markedly dilated measuring 1.5 cm, and there is central
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, raising the possibility
of a distal CBD obstruction. The distal CBD and pancreas are not
able to be visualized due to overlying bowel gas. The portal
vein is patent with anterograde flow. There is no ascites

[**11-17**]: ERCP: Ten fluoroscopic spot images obtained during ERCP
procedure without radiologist present. Cholangiogram
demonstrates dilated intra- and extra- hepatic bile ducts. There
is suggestion of irregularity of the intrahepatic ducts which
may be projectional. No filling defect is identified within the
opacified biliary tree. The cystic duct is normally opacified.

IMPRESSION: Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. No
filling defect is identified within the biliary tree.

[**11-18**]: Ampullary mucosal biopsy:

Ampullary mucosa with focal acute inflammation and
fibrinopurulent exudates consistent with ulceration.

[**11-26**]: U/S FINDINGS: The study is limited due to patient's body
habitus. The liver texture is within normal limits allowing for
technique. The gallbladder demonstrates multiple gallstones.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation,
and the common duct measures 7 mm. Main portal vein is patent
with antegrade flow.

[**12-2**]:CT- 1. Extensive severe pancreatitis with diffuse
enlargement of the pancreas and fat stranding and ongoing
formation of peripancreatic fluid collection/pseudocyst with
attenuated SMV. Diffuse peritoneal fat stranding suggestive of
panperitonitis with bowel dilatation.

2. Cholelithiasis.

3. Small ascites, slightly decreased in the lower pelvis.

4. Diffuse anasarca.

5. Diverticulosis.

6. Post G-tube placement.

7. New pneumomediastinum within the pericardial fat along the
pericardium, of unknown etiology. Clinical correlation with
recent procedure and interventions is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], Ms. [**Known lastname 75891**] was admitted to the trauma
service and transferred to the SICU for further evaluation.  She
was made NPO, with IVF and a FOley was placed; the patient
refused an NGT at the time.  The patient's pain was to be
controlled, and the patient was consented for an ERCP.  THe
patient received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis, her
hematocrit was watched on a dialy basis, ad the patient was put
on an insulin sliding scale.  The patient was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 3 at
admission.  A RUQ ultrasound was performed revealing
cholelithiasis without cholecystitis, and CBD dilation as well.
On [**11-17**], the patient underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy; the
report read "Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. No
filling defect is identified within the biliary."

Her post procedure course was complicated by increased
secretions, and hypoxia to 78%; the patient was made aware of
the risk of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress, but
she refused both an NGT and intubation at the time.  The patient
was made comfortable with anti-anxiety and pain medications, and
her vital signs were closely monitored.  The patient required
fluid bolusing for volume depletion.

A geriatric consult was called for further treatment and
evaluation while the patient was in the ICU as the patient
became delirious and had been quite agitated despite lorazepam
and Haldol.  Geriatrics recommended low dose dilaudid for pain
control PRN, altering the dose of Haldol, removing all
unneccessary tubes, lines and drains, and getting the patinet on
a better sleep cycle.   On [**11-18**], the patient became tachypneic
to a respiratory rate in the 30s, oxygen saturation of 82% on
RA, and was put on a face tent as she was not tolerating other
oxygen supplementation.  The patient's vital signs were
unstable, and the patient was combative and aggressive.  Her
mental status began deteriorating, and the patient required
intubation for airway protection, and adequate sedation for
safety during hospital treatment.  The patient was started on
Unasyn for pneumonia (aspiration).  On [**11-19**], the patient was
intermittently tachycardic with decreased urine output; she was
bolused for presumed volume depletion; her urine output improved
and her renal function remained within normal limits.  The
patient also had an OGT and subsequently a DObhoff tube placed
for tube feeds.  The patient's respiratory status was frequently
monitored and changed according to evaluations.  Her sedation
and ventilation were attempted to be weaned.  Her hospital
course was complicated by post-procedure fevers; blood cultures
were sent when the patient spiked, and chest x-rays, urine
analysis/cultures were also taken.  The patiemt was noted to
have a R base consolidation, and went for bronchoalveolar lavage
on [**11-23**].  The patient was put on vancomycin and later levo as
well as zosyn for empiric VAP treatment; these antibiotics were
stopped when appropriate, i.e, when cultures returned with
sensitivities, and/or fevers and leukocytosis decreased.

The patient was diuresed when appropriate as she was fluid
