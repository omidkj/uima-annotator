History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6129**] is a 77yo female with PMH significant for COPD on 4L
NC, HTN, anemia, and recent pubic ramus fracture who is being
transferred to the MICU for hypotension, hypoxemia, and
hypoglycemia. Per her family, she fractured her pubic ramus 3
weeks ago. She was evaluated at the [**Hospital1 756**] and was found to be
a non-surgical candidate. She was then transferred to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital and admitted. During her stay she was found to have a
UTI and was treated with Cipro. Her daughter states that after 5
days of treatment she found out that the bug in her urine was
resistent to the Cipro. She was then apparently treated with
Cefpodoxime and the last day was [**6-19**]. She had a foley in place
during these times which was removed yesterday. Two days after
being at the NH, she represented to [**Hospital1 882**] ED with symptoms
suggestive of a bowel obstruction. Of note, she has been on
narcotics during this time. She was then discharged back to
Bostonian where she has been since [**6-18**]. Per daughter, she has
had poor intake over the past few days.
At 8:15am this morning her BS was low according to the
glucometer. She was immediately given Glucagon IM and glucose
gel. Her BS increased to 40 at 8:50am after a second glucagon
shot. Blood sugar remained at 42 per nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. EMS was called
and she was immediately brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the ED initial vitals were T 98.2 BP 119/70 AR 78 RR 28 O2
sat 80% RA. She was immediately placed on NRB and her O2
saturation increased to 92%. Repeat blood sugar was 135. She
received ASA 325mg, Levaquin 750mg IV, Flagyl 500mg IV, Zofran
4mg IV, and 3L normal saline. She was then transferred to the
MICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
1)Pubic ramus fracture
2)Syncope
3)COPD on 4L at home
4)IDDM
5)Hypertension
6)Anemia (followed by hematologist)

Social History:
Patient lives with husband. [**Name (NI) **] current tobacco, alcohol, or
IVDA.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
vitals T 95.6 BP 161/84 AR 89 RR 20 O2 sat 86% on 6L NC
Gen: Awake, responsive to commands, increased respiratory effort
HEENT: Mucous membranes slightly dry
Heart: RRR, no audible m,r,g
Lungs: CTAB, +crackles at posterior bases
Abdomen: Soft, distended, NT/ND, +BS
Extremities: 1+ bilateral edema

Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen and pelvis:
1. Patchy and nodular depdendent airspace opacities most
consistent with
aspiration pneumonia/neumonitis and tiny bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Evidence of constipation, with large amount of stool in
rectum.
3. No other evidence of acute abdominal process.
.
.
CT angiogram of the chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism identified.
2. Left lower lobe infiltrate, perhaps representing aspiration
pneumonia.
3. Smaller right lower lobe infiltrate. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
.
Echocardiogram
Severe pulmonary hypertension with dilated right ventricle and
global right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Grossly preserved
left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
.
Urine cultures: E. coli resistant to cipro only
.
.
Blood and sputum cultures negative

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6129**] is a 77yo female with PMH as listed above who presents
with hypotension, hypoxemia, and hypoglycemia, originally
admitted to the MICU.
.
1)Urosepsis: Patient has had multiple UTIs over the past few
weeks. Per daughter, the bacterial strain was resistant to
flouroquinolones (cipro). She was subsquently treated with
Cefpodoxime for unknown time course which she completed on [**6-19**].
On arrival to the ED she was hypotensive and U/A was floridly
positive. She was given Levaquin in the ED. Her blood pressure
improved with IVFs. On transfer to the MICU she was started on
Vancomycin and Cefepime for broad spectrum coverage.  Once she
stabilized, she was converted back to cefpodoxime to complete a
seven day course.
.
2)Hypoxemia: Patient is on 4L NC at home for COPD. She presented
with an increasing oxygen requirement from baseline. An
echocardiogram obtained in the MICU showed preserved LVEF but
also revealed a dilated RV without hypertrophy, consistent with
pressure overload and severe pulmonary hypertension. A CTA of
the chest was obtained to rule out PE given her multiple risk
factors. Her CT showed no PE but confirmed bilateral airspace
disease, and she was covered with vancomycin and cefepime for
possible hospital acquired PNA.  This was changed to cefpodoxime
to cover both her UTI and likely aspiration PNA. Her oxygen
requirements returned to baseline but her right-sided heart
failure warrants further evaluation.
.
3)Hypoglycemia: Patient was found to be hypoglycemic on the
morning of admission. BS was ~40s despite receiving Glucagon x2.
She was on a very aggressive regimen at home including
metformin, NPH, and lispro; and was only requiring 6-8 units
daily of sliding scale.  We held her home regimen and will
continue to titrate up as needed.
.
4)COPD: Baseline is 4L NC at home, she was maintained on this,
and her nebulizers were continued.
.
5) Bladder retention: The patient failed a foley removal trial,
and will need bladder retraining.
.
6) Abdominal pain: The patient is having vague cramping
abdominal pain, with no fevers or diarrhea.  Her KUB was
negative, however, there is moderate clinical suspicion for C.
diff in the setting of multiple abx.  She will need to be tested
for this while at rehab.
