0.8, glucose 94, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were all
within normal limits.  INR was 1.3.  He had a head CT, which
showed no evidence of new hemorrhage or new strokes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 79-year-old man with a
past history of left temporal hemorrhage and a question of
associated seizure disorder, who presents with the sudden
onset of right face, arm, and leg weakness, aphasia, and a
right gaze, as well as focal muscle twitching on the right
side.

In the emergency department he was given 2 mg Ativan, which
improved the strength in his right arm and leg.  He was now
able to move them against gravity and against mild
resistance.  He had a MRI scan because he was still very
confused and aphasic, but he was unable to sit still for the
examination.

He was admitted initially to the Neurointensive Care Unit
just for close observation.  At that time it was felt that
the most likely etiology for his resolving hemiparesis, as
well the right gaze deviation in the setting of a right
paresis with seizure activity, especially if he has a history
of a prior seizure disorder associated with his left temporal
hemorrhage and he has not been taking any antiepileptic
medications recently.  He had no evidence of acute stroke on
head CT.

EEG was ordered, which was not performed for several days and
by the time the EEG was performed, there were no
abnormalities.  However, prior EEGs in [**2169-2-27**]
revealed the following:  Evidence of left temporal slowing,
especially in the left temporal region on EEG and on another
EEG in [**2171-10-28**].  He also had a slightly abnormal EEG
due to some focal slowing.

In the ICU, he was loaded with Dilantin and maintain on this.
However, later in the hospital course he was transferred to
the floor and his wife said that he did not tolerate Dilantin
in the past very well because of excessive drowsiness.  So,
he was loaded with phenobarbital and planned to transition
him off the Dilantin in order to increase medical compliance.

Throughout the remainder of the hospital stay he continued to
improve on a day-by-day basis.  The strength in the right
side greatly improved.  The Department of Physical Therapy
evaluated the patient.  They thought that he had some
unsteady ambulation, but, otherwise, he was doing fairly
well.  The aphasia was the slowest to resolve.  However, that
also continued to improve throughout the hospital stay.  He
was started on Zyprexa, as well as Trazodone to help him
sleep at night.  He did eventually receive a MRI of the head,
which showed no new evidence of any acute process.  At the IV
site on the right upper quadrant, he had some evidence of
cellulitis and he was begun on Ampicillin.  The patient is to
be discharged to rehabilitation today.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  History of left temporal hemorrhage.
2.  History of seizure disorder.
3.  History of hypertension.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  History of medication noncompliance.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Phenobarbitol 30 mg PO t.i.d.
2.  Trazodone 25 mg PO q.8 PM.
3.  Olanzapine 2.5 mg PO q.h.s.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.

The patient is also going to be tapered off Dilantin over the
next week.  He can received 100 mg PO twice a day for three
days and then 100 mg PO once a day for three days and then
the Dilantin can be discontinued.
