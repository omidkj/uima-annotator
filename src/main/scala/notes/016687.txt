Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
bilateral thoracentesis with pigtail catheter placement
talc pleurodesis

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o F with hx of pneumonia and atypical cells on
thoracentesis, treated several approximately 1.5 weeks ago at
[**Hospital 1281**] hospital, with levoflox for 10 days, presents with acute
respiratory failure. Last few days has been increasingly
shortness of breath at home. Has had dry, non-productive cough.
Was thought she was still just recovering from recent pneumonia.
Today, it was particularly bad so her son brought her to the [**Name (NI) **].
She was not having fevers or chills.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were T97.4, P 125, R 28, 90% on NRB.
She had triggered in triage for hypoxia to 50s. She appeared to
be in respiratory distress, so was intubated. She had a CXR
showing effusion and potentially recurrent pneumonia. Initial
lactate was 4. She received levo, ceftriaxone. Initial BPs in
130s, but then had hyoptension after intubation and did not
rebound back to normal. BP lows were 70s systolic, so was
started on levophed. Also received 3 L of NS. They had
difficulty sedating her and she required large amounts of versed
and fentanyl in order for her to be come in-sync with the
ventilator. She was autopeeping and overbreathing the vent prior
to arrival to the floor.
.
On the floor, she is intubated and sedated. Her family is at the
bedside. She is calm.

   URINE CULTURE (Pending):

CXR [**2192-3-21**]
Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with
underlying atelectasis and central vascular congestion.

PATHOLOGY [**2192-3-22**]
Pleural fluid, cell block:
Tumor cells are positive for B72.3, [**Last Name (un) **]-31, WT-1, and PAX-2, but
negative for calretinin, TTF-1, mammoglobin, and GCDFP.
The findings support an ovarian serous carcinoma.

CTA [**2192-3-23**]
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Small peribronchial nodular opacities in the lingula likely
representing an acute infectious process.
3. Large right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobe
collapse and leftward mediastinal shift.
4. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with left pleural
drain in place.

CXR [**2192-3-31**]
The left-sided pigtail catheter has been removed.
Right-sided pig tail catheter remains in place. A small
loculated left-sided pleural effusion appears unchanged. There
is increased opacity obscuring the right hemidiaphragm likely
representing a combination of increasing effusion and
atelectasis. The retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms
persists. No pneumothorax is appreciated. The stomach air filled
and distended.

CXR [**2192-4-1**]
The right basilar pigtail catheter has been removed. There is a
persistent
right-sided pleural effusion which appears relatively stable
since the
previous study. There are low lung volumes. Increased density at
the right
base and perihilar areas are again seen. No pneumothoraces are
present. The heart size is upper limits of normal but stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] is a 74y/o lady who presented with acute respiratory
failure due to malignant effusion and was found to have serous
ovarian adenocarcinoma.  Her respiratory status was stabilized
via thoracentesis, pigtail catheter placement, and pleurodesis.

Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] had multiple medical issues stemming from newly
diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. Those issues included
malignant pleural effusions which led to respiratory distress
and respiratory failure leading to intubation. Similarly, she
had a distended abdomen from carcinomatosis. Finally she
developed renal failure after one dose of chemotherapy, from
which her kidney's did not rebound. After careful consideration
and thoughtful discussion, it was decided along with her
children, that it was in the best intrest of Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] to make
her comfort measures only. She was extubated on [**2192-4-17**] in the
morning, and passed away at [**2111**] peacefully with her children at
her bedside.

Her hospital course up until her readmission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit is outlined below.

ACTIVE ISSUES IN THE ICU:
.
# Respiratory failure on presentation: due to malignant
effusion.
Patient was intubated in the ED and arrived to the ICU on
mechanical ventilation. Echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic
right ventricle suggestive of PE, so a CT angiogram of her chest
was performed which showed no evidence of PE. Initial CXR
demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of
pneumonia, and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for
healthcare associated pneumonia.  Outside records obtained from
[**Hospital 1281**] hospital indicate that a pleural fluid analysis revealed
malignant cells, most likely papillary serous adenocarcinoma,
most consistent with origin from Muellerian duct.  Her pleural
effusions were tapped and pleural fluid analysis were consistent
with exudate and cytology was preliminarily positive for
malignancy.  After thoracentesis, her respiratory rapidly
improved.  She bit through the ET tu
