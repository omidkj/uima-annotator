Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
A 67 year old gentleman recently discharged [**10-5**] from [**Hospital1 1516**]
service for sepsis [**1-27**] R. BKA site complicated by Refractory VT
s/p ablation with a history of DM, CAD s/p PCI distal RCA '[**03**],
ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20% who was admitted with lethargy
and fatigue from [**Hospital3 **]. He reports an
increase in fluid collection in his upper extremities, shortness
of breath and constipation and general fatigue over past 4 days.


At [**Hospital1 **], it was presumed that this was an exacerbation of
his CHF so Lasix increased from 20mg PO to 80mg IV BID x2 days.
His UOP was negative 1.5 Liters yesterday but he failed to
respond and was persistantly short of breath. However, on
further review he has not recieved any Lasix over past 18 hours.
(pharmacy error per report). He was subsequently transferred for
further managment.

PT was directly transferred to the floor from [**Hospital1 **] where
his VS: 97.3 77 105/66 17 100% 4L. An initial evaluation was
begun on the floor. EKG showed V paced @69 and no ischemic
changes. CXR revealed evidence of pulmonary edema and possible
pneumonia. CT Chest showed large right pleural effusion and no
evidence of pneumonia, BNP 55, 000. CK 36, Trop 0.35. Cr 2.0 (up
from baseline 1.7)

Pt was subsequently transferred to CCU for further management.

On ROS, He denies chest pain, palpitations, N/V, abdominal pain.
Denies PND or orthopnea. Denies cough, fever or chills. He does
report some constipation x2 days but had some BM today. Reports
mild dysuria 2 days ago now resolved. Denies flank pain. He
endorses poor appetite and PO intake over past 3 days. He
reports a pressure ulcer on coccyx.

Admission Chest X-ray:
1) New focal opacity overlying the left mid lung field, which
could represent an area of developing pneumonia. Dedicated PA
and lateral views of the chest is recommended.
2) Persistent large right pleural effusion and mild congestive
heart failure.
3) Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2131-10-19**]:
1. Severe right pleural effusion and small left pleural
effusion. The left
pleural effusion is loculated and corresponds to the described
density on the recent chest radiographs.
2. No pericardial effusion is noted.
3. Diffuse ground glass opacities of the lungs is most likely
related to
pulmonary edema. More focal patchy opacities at left apex may
represent
asymmetric pulmonary edema although superimposed infectious or
inflammatory process cannot be excluded.
4. Bibasilar pulmonary calcifications or aspirated barium,
unchanged since
[**2129**].

ECHO [**2131-10-20**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
preservation of the anterolateral wall (LVEF = 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-10-1**],
the findings are similar.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2131-10-27**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old gentleman with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20%,
Refractory VT s/p ablation, CAD s/p MI'[**03**], who presented from
rehab with increasing SOB c/w acute on chronic systolic heart
failure.

# Systolic CHF exacerbation and dyspnea: On admission, clinical
exam revealed bilateral basilar crackles, JVD 12-13cm and
peripheral edema all consistent with volume overload. BNP 55,260
(previous BNP 22,000). CXR showed effusions (right >left) and
left likely loculated fluid per CT. Pt was also hypotensive,
requiring dobutamine drip which was quickly weaned off. Pt
initially was SOB, attributed to largle right pleural effusion.
Symptoms improved with diuresis to good sats on 2L NC. After
anticoagulation was adequately reversed (Vit K, Lovenox held,
heparin bridge until several hours before procedure), pt was
tapped 2.1L of serous fluid, with LDH and TP consistent with
transudate with additional symptomatic improvement.
Pt was aggresively diuresed with Lasix drip and responded well
symptomatically. PO intake was restricted to low salt and 1L
fluid.   He was transitioned to PO lasix at 80 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On
discharge, his oxygen saturation was 98 % on room air.

# Rhythm: Pt has history of VF on recent admission in setting of
sepsis (s/p ablation) and afib (also ablated). Pt was monitored
on telemetry and V Paced with no arrhythmias. He was continued
on Mexilitine and Amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was held for thoracentesis (with a heparin drip
for bridging) and restarted after procedure.
- It was noted that he has a pacemaker rather than an ICD.
Although, there are multiple reasons why he might not be a good
candidate for ICD placement, this issue could be readdressed in
the future.

#CAD: h/o MI. Pt was continued on a statin. BB held while
diuresing since initially was hypotensive, and restarted prior
to DC.  Although pt had previous history of bleed while on
Lovenox and [**Hospital1 **], after discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
restarted as the risk of CAD would exceed the risks of bleeding
on [**Name10 (NameIs) **].
