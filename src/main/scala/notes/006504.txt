CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
with CAD, PVD, COPD, on home 02 and history of lung cancer,
status post resection who presented from [**Hospital3 **]
with shortness of breath.  On [**2111-6-16**], a chest x-ray at
[**Hospital3 7**] showed consolidation of the right lung.  On
the day prior to admission, the patient had oxygen
saturations down to the 70s with increased shortness of
breath on BIPAP.  She was given vancomycin and Levaquin and
IV Lasix.  Her temperature was 101.6.  An EKG was notable for
atrial fibrillation at [**Street Address(2) 26163**] depressions which was new.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department where she was found to be febrile
to 101.2 with an oxygen saturation of 77 percent on
nonrebreather.  She was given ceftazidime and was intubated.
Following intubation, she was transiently hypotensive
requiring dopamine at 5 mgs per minute and was then
transferred to the MICU for further management.

ALLERGIES:  Tylenol, gets hyperemesis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a single female who had 100 pack year
smoking history and was still smoking.  No alcohol.  No
drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease on her
mother's side.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  This is an elderly female
lying in bed intubated and sedated.  Vital signs:
Temperature 101.2, blood pressure 105/42, heart rate 130,
respiratory rate 38, oxygen saturation 77 percent on
nonrebreather and then 100 percent on AC 400 by 16, 100
percent, 5 PEEP.  HEENT:  An ET tube was in place.
Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Right IJ in place.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, regular, II/VI systolic murmur
at the apex radiating to the axilla.  Lungs:  Positive
rhonchi at the right base, crackles at the left base.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, surgical scar.  Extremities:  The extremities were
without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  They were warm.  Skin:
With no rashes or lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12.8, hematocrit 36, platelets
300,000 including 81 percent neutrophils, 8 percent bands, 2
percent lymphs.  Chem-7:  Sodium 131, potassium 3.8, chloride
89, bicarbonate 31, BUN 25, creatinine 0.6, anion gap 11.
The U/A was positive for many bacteria, 0-2 white blood
cells.

Chest x-ray showed a dense consolidation in the right lower
lung and bilateral pleural effusion and emphysematous
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient presented
with right-sided pneumonia and some pulmonary edema.  She
developed ARDS and became extremely difficult to oxygenate on
the ventilator.  She was initially treated with ceftazidime,
gentamicin, and vancomycin.  Gentamicin was held.  On
[**2111-6-20**], her sputum culture came back as Acinetobacter which
was sensitive only to Zosyn.  The patient was switched over
to Zosyn.  However, throughout the day she became extremely
difficult to oxygenate, saturating only in the 80s on 100
percent FI02 on the ventilator.  The ventilator settings had
a high respiratory rate and a low tidal volume to match the
ARDSNet protocol.  In the end, her oxygenation
tailed off during the day up until her death.

SEPSIS:  The patient received approximately 10 liters of IV
fluid resuscitation.  She developed anasarca.  She maintained
her pressures off of pressors for two days but on the morning
of [**2111-6-20**], she began to drop her pressures and Levophed was
started.  Levophed maintained her pressures with a MAP of 60
for some time.  She became increasingly acidotic and the
pressors lost their effect in this.  She did receive several
amps of bicarbonate which transiently improved her blood
pressure and the effectiveness of the pressors.  However, in
the end, she could not maintain her blood pressure and
dwindled during the day.  She was also started on dopamine
and even with the two pressors we could not support her blood
pressure.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient was in and out of atrial
fibrillation during her illness.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had known severe three
vessel disease.  CABG had not been pursued on prior admission
given her other medical comorbidities.  She likely incurred
ischemic damage as well on the day of her death.  Troponin
was noted to be 0.33.

CODE STATUS:  After the patient was intubated, her family was
present for discussion of her code status.  The patient at
that time was able to be alert and participate in discussion.
She expressed a desire for a trial of aggressive therapy but
that she did not want to undergo prolonged intubation and she
did not wish to have a cardiac resuscitation undertaken.  The
family acknowledged her wishes.  On the day of death, the
family was frequently consulted and they felt that the level
of aggressive therapy and the patient's dire condition was
not consistent with her wishes for her care.  The family came
in from a distance to be present.  The patient passed while
our aggressive therapies were still in place.

The patient's substantial comorbidities played a significant
role in her inability to overcome her ARDS and sepsis.  The
time of death was 10:01 on [**2111-6-20**].
