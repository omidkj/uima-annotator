Fever

Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with a history of refractory biphenotypic
leukemia, disseminated fusarium [**First Name3 (LF) 2**], on chemo and with
neutropenia, recent enterococcal empyema finishing treatment
with long course of vancomycin through PICC line, now presents
with worsening [**First Name3 (LF) **] and fevers to 102. Over the past 2 months
he has been at home, able to walk many blocks without dyspnea;
he has been eating and drinking well, without nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**], headache or malaise.
Mild sore throat, but no [**First Name3 (LF) **] or other URI symptoms. No
myalgias or joint pain. On the evening of this admission, he
developed chills and his wife took his temperature and found it
to be 101, rising later to 102.5. He called his oncologist who
recommended he go to the ED. He denied any other symptoms at
this time.
.
He has a history of biphenotypic leukemia currently on dacogen
(last administration on [**3-17**]) who continues to be transfusion
dependent with blasts in periphery, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia. He has also had multiple complications
secondary to his leukemia including congestive heart failure,
recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions, and infectious
complications including disseminated fusarium which is currently
controlled. His IV vancomycin course for enterococcal empyema
was due to complete on [**3-16**].
.
In the ED he received 2 L of fluid; his atrial fibrillation was
at a rate of 100-120. He was initially on a non-rebreather but
was quickly weaned off. Chest x-ray was obtained which revealed
bibasilar opacities. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

Past Medical History:
Hematologic History:
1) followed since [**2154**] for an autoimmune pancytopenia
treated with steroids and IVIG.
2) In [**3-/2157**] his cytopenias worsened and he was noted to
have about 90% blasts and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic

leukemia
3) therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD. His day 14 marrow
showed persistent disease
4) Regimen was changed to 7+3. Day 14 and 2 subsequent
marrows all continued to show persistent involvement with
leukemia.
5) Further chemotherapy was held as MR. [**Known lastname 1005**] was
found to have disseminated fusarium [**Known lastname 2**] in the setting of

prolonged neutropenia and was treated with a prolonged course of

AmBisome with voricoanzole before transitioning to voriconazole

alone.
6) He has subsequently been treated with Dacogen with
refractory disease;
7) He has had several admissions for pericardial effusions
with tamponade physiology, treated medically;
8) He has had periodic pleural effusions requiring
thoracentesis with transudative to exudative chemistries; cell
blocks and flow cytometry have not been suggestive of leukemic
infiltration, and work up for infectious causes including viral,

fungal and AFB have remained unrevealing.
9) admission for VRE bacteremia presumed to be of line
origin though line tip cultures were unrevealing and completed a

prolonged course of linezolid.
9) admission in late [**Month (only) 956**] 2012for acute shortness of
[**Month (only) 1440**], fevers and found to have an enterococcal empyema.
10) Prior HBV [**Month (only) 2**], on lamivudine prophylaxis.
Other Medical History:
1. Biphenotypic leukemia CLL/AML (s/p hyper [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]/Ara, MEC,

two cycles of Decitabine)
2. Autoimmune pancytopenia
3. Disseminated fusarium [**First Name3 (LF) 2**], treated with Ambisome and
Voriconazole for four and half months. Ambisome was stopped on
[**10-20**]. Last voriconazole level was 1.0 on [**10-8**]
4. HBV, on Lamivudine
5. VRE bacteremia/cellulitis
6. Pericardial effusion of unknown etiology
7. s/p appendectomy
8. s/p umbilical hernia repair
9. a-fib, MVR

CXR [**2158-4-20**]
Stable chest findings, there is no evidence of new pulmonary
parenchymal infiltrates as can be excluded on this single AP
portable chest view examination.

[**2158-3-28**] CT CHEST
1.  Multiloculated, bilateral, pleural effusion, with the
largest individual collection in the right lower lung with
enhancing visceral pleura which is concerning for empyema.  This
largest collection has decreased in size since [**2158-3-20**]
and may be related to prior thoracocentesis (PER OMR).  Second
largest loculated collection on right side along the
paramediastinal aspect has increased, while on the left side is
overall unchanged, except in the left lung apex where it shows
minimal interval decrease.
2.  Right lower lung pneumonia.
3.  Borderline sized and other smaller mediastinal lymph nodes,
unchanged
since [**2158-3-20**].
4. Splenomegaly

[**2158-3-21**] ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tric
