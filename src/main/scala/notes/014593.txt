HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old
[**Location 7979**] woman who presents with progressive mitral
regurgitation.  She had more recently developed paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation for which she was on Coumadin and
Amiodarone.  She has been doing fairly well from a
symptomatic perspective, however, on recent examination, she
has had moderately severe mitral regurgitation and marked
left atrial enlargement.  More recently, she has developed
pulmonary arterial hypertension by echocardiogram.  The
feeling is that mitral valve replacement is prudent at this
time.

respiratory rate 20.  Neurologically she was intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2193-4-3**], and
underwent mitral valve replacement with Carbomedics valve.
Immediately postoperatively, the patient was transferred to
the unit where she well and her Swan-Ganz catheter was
removed on postoperative day number one.  The patient was
extubated on postoperative day number one and continued to do
well.  On postoperative day number one, the patient had an
event where her heart rate was in the 30s to 40s, however,
she was asymptomatic at the time.  This subsequently
increased to the 60s to 70s over the next couple of days.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy on
postoperative day number one.  Physical therapy anticipated
that she would be safe for discharge upon two to three more
visits.

On postoperative day number two, the patient continued to do
well and her chest tube was left in place due to high output.
On postoperative day number three, the patient's chest tube
was placed to water seal.  The patient was started back on
her Coumadin on [**2193-4-6**].  On postoperative day number four,
the patient's chest tube was removed.  The patient continued
to ambulate with physical therapy.

On postoperative day number five, the patient's wires were
removed and the patient was started back on her Coumadin
after it had been held for wire removal.  On postoperative
day number six, the patient ambulated with physical therapy
and was deemed safe for discharge the following day,
postoperative day number seven.  The patient was discharged
to home in good condition.
