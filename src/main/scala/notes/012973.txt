Date of Birth:   [**2092-7-27**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old male with
a history of hyperlipidemia and tobacco abuse who presented
to an outside hospital earlier this morning with a complaint
of severe substernal chest pain described as a [**8-4**].
Initially patient attributed his pain to gastroesophageal
reflux disease, but he became concerned when the pain started
to radiate down his left arm with a burning sensation.  The
pain failed to radiate to the jaw or back and there was no
associated nausea or vomiting.  An electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed hyperacute peaked T waves in leads V2
through V5.  A STAT echocardiogram showed a mid internal wall
with mildly hypokinetic and the apex with moderate akinesis.
The patient received thrombolytics along with aspirin,
nitroglycerin, heparin, Metoprolol and morphine.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further observation due to a lack of Intensive
Care Unit beds at the outside hospital.

In the Emergency Room, the patient's nausea and vomiting was
initially thought to be secondary to infarct (ischemia),
however, likely secondary to the 300 mcg of Fentanyl plus 6
mg of morphine received at the outside hospital.

The patient's chest pain decreased to a [**2-5**], but was not
completely resolved.  Coronary artery disease risk factors
include smoking - one pack per day for 25 years and
hyperlipidemia with an LDL of 209.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  Zantac and ibuprofen.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Divorced with one child.  One pack per day
smoker for 25 years plus.  Rare alcohol use and no
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had a myocardial infarction at
the age of 80.  His father had a CVA at the age of 92 and his
brother has diabetes.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  A white blood cell count of 15.2,
hematocrit of 44.2, platelets 239,000 with a differential of
68 polys, 26 lymphocytes, and INR of 1.2.  Sodium 141,
potassium 3.9, chloride 108, bicarbonate 24, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.9, glucose of 116, calcium of 8.2, potassium
4.5, magnesium 1.9.  A CK of 669 on admission that increased
to 1202.  A troponin was measured to be 49.9.
Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed normal [**Month/Year (2) **]
rhythm at 60 beats per minute with a normal axis, normal
intervals, T wave inversion in [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevations in V2
through V4 with peaked T waves in V2 through V5, which is new
compared to an electrocardiogram from [**2139-11-27**].
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no hypertrophy, a Q
wave in [**Last Name (Titles) 1105**], T wave inversions in V2 through V5 improved from
the outside hospital electrocardiogram.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate of 64.  Blood pressure
96/44.  Oxygen saturation 97%.  General:  Well-developed,
well-nourished male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
NO jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, holosystolic murmur radiating
to the apex.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 47-year-old male with a history of
hyperlipidemia and tobacco abuse who presented to an out
hospital with chest pain/burning that radiated to his left
shoulder.  Electrocardiogram showed anterior T wave changes
and an electrocardiogram showed hypokinetic anterior wall
with an akinetic apex.  He received thrombolytics and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further observation.
The electrocardiogram normalized and he continued to have
improvement of his chest pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:  He was continued on aspirin, heparin,
intravenous nitroglycerin and Metoprolol.  His cardiac
enzymes continued to be cycled and he was followed on
telemetry.  He was started on pravastatin because of a
history of muscle aches with Lipitor.  He initially was going
to go to the catheterization laboratory in two days, on a
Monday, however, he continually complained of pain and some
ST segments were still elevated, therefore, he was sent to
the catheterization laboratory on [**3-20**], a day early.
The catheterization revealed a right dominant system with
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery was nonobstructive.  The left anterior
descending artery had diffuse proximal 30-40% lesions and a
distal 80% lesion at the second diagonal branch.  The left
circumflex artery had mild luminal irregularities.  The right
coronary artery was notable for a small to moderate size
proximal aneurysm and mild plaguing in its mid portion.
There was a 70% lesion in the right posterior descending
artery.  Minimal resting hemodynamic measurements revealed
mild systemic hypotension to low normal normotension and
[**Month (only) **] rhythm.  Left ventriculography revealed an estimated
ejection fraction of 50% and no significant mitral
regurgitation.  Successful direct stenting of the mid left
anterior descending was performed.

Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and a
0% residual stenosis.  He was continued on aspirin and
Metoprolol which was changed to Toprol XL upon discharge.  An
ACE inhibitor was started, as well as a statin as described
earlier.  Smoking cessation was also encouraged on this
admission as well.

The plan was for him was to obtain a repeat echocardiogram as
an outpatient in the next three months in order to assess his
myocardium at that point.  Nutrition was consulted and he
received cardiac diet teaching.  He also underwent a Physical
Therapy consult prior to discharge.  Plavix was also
initiated which he should continue for a total of 9 months.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was instructed to take one to two
weeks off from work with absolutely no heavy lifting and no
smoking.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute anterior ST elevation myocardial
infarction, status post a stent to the mid left anterior
descending.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient was discharged to home.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] on Friday,
[**4-1**] at 9:40 a.m.  He will need to have a repeat
echocardiogram performed in about three months.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg po q.d.
2.  Pravastatin 40 mg po q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. for a total of nine months.
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q.d.
6.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg prn chest pain.
