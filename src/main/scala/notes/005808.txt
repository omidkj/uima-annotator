Admission Date:  [**2146-11-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2146-11-25**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
male with a past medical history of motor vehicle crash,
cerebrovascular accident, status post tracheostomy and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy who presents from a
rehabilitation facility with fever and increased respiratory
rate.  The patient was in his usual state of health until the
day of admission when he had some question of confusion,
temperature noted to be 104.8 and a pulse of 104.  The
patient also was experiencing some tachypnea which developed
over the previous hours and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**].  The patient had a recent
admission to [**Hospital6 256**] after an
motor vehicle crash, was admitted to the Trauma Service from
[**2146-9-22**] to [**2146-10-12**] after he was missing
for three days and found under his car.  The hospitalization
was notable for likely left lower lobe pneumonia, discovery
of an old cerebrovascular accident, right distal clavicular
fracture managed nonoperatively.  The patient was unable to
be delivered from the vent at that time and he received
tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy on
[**2146-10-11**].  The patient was also placed on an Aspen
collar to be finished on [**2146-12-12**] as he was unable to
clear his neck despite multiple imaging modalities being
negative, the patient was unable to report clinical
examination of the neck.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Prostate cancer; 2.  Motor vehicle
crash, [**2146-9-22**]; 3.  Cerebrovascular accident,
small left frontal; 4.  Right distal clavicular fracture; 5.
History of Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus
aureus; 6.  Right renal stone; 7.  Failure to wean from
ventilator, status post tracheostomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy; 8.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Bacitracin b.i.d. prn; Lactulose
prn; Artificial tears; Albuterol; Atrovent nebulizers prn;
Bisacodyl; Ranitidine 150 q.h.s.; Heparin subcutaneously 5000
b.i.d.; milk of magnesia; Seroquel 25 q. day; Ativan prn;
Multivitamin; Colace 100 b.i.d.; Lopressor 25 and a regular
insulin sliding scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient currently is living at [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation Facility.  Denies tobacco, alcohol or drug use
in history.  Contacts were the patient's wife, phone
[**0-0-**], [**Name2 (NI) **]aughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 50134**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Temperature
101.4, pulse 85, blood pressure 110/50, respirations 20,
sating 100% on 100% oxygen, pressure support ventilation.
General:  Elderly male appearing somewhat uncomfortable with
mild injection of the sclera bilaterally, cervical spine
collar in place.  Pupils were 2 mm equal and reactive
bilaterally.  The patient was tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2,
somewhat distant heartsounds.  The patient's lung examination
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no edema.  Neurological examination, the patient was
disoriented, unable to follow commands, did react to painful
stimuli, had 3+ reflexes bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at 130, normal axis and intervals, slight ST
depressions in lateral leads.  White count 15.2, hematocrit
33.3.  Laboratory data was significant for a sodium of 151.
Arterial blood gases on admission 7.43/46/437.  Computerized
tomography scan of the head revealed no hemorrhage, mass or
shift.  Bilateral thalamic hyperdensities in old frontal
infarct and age-related atrophy.  Urinalysis was 3 to 5 red
blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, few bacteria, negative
for nitrates, trace leukocytes.  The patient also had a
spinal tap which revealed no evidence of infection in the
cerebrospinal fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Fever - The patient with evidence of
pneumonia on chest x-ray.  The patient's sputum revealed
coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was resistant to
Oxacillin as well as two morphologies of gram negative rods.
The patient was kept on his empiric antibiotics, Levofloxacin
and Ceftazidime for the gram negative rods, double coverage
and Vancomycin for the Oxacillin-resistant coagulase positive
Staphylococcus.  Plan for antibiotic course of 14 days to end
on [**12-6**].  A PICC line was placed on [**11-25**] for
antibiotic management as an outpatient.  The patient's fever
subsided during his hospital course and the patient was
afebrile at the time of discharge.  Further blood cultures
remained negative at the time of discharge.  Cerebrospinal
fluid culture was negative.

2.  Change in mental status - The patient's mental status
changes were likely due to the pneumonia.  A head
computerized tomography scan was negative for bleed.
Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for signs of infection in
the cerebrospinal fluid.  The patient's electrolyte
abnormalities were corrected during his hospital course.
There was no further evidence for an etiology of changes in
mental status.  However, the patient remained in a state of
occasionally following commands although not consistently.
He was not verbally responsive at any time.

3.  Pulmonary - The patient with excellent oxygenation on
ventilator as well as on tracheostomy mask.  The patient was
weaned from the ventilator and was able to tolerate
approximately 12 hours a day on tracheostomy mask or with
minimal assist CPAP with 5 of pressure support, however, the
patient did occasionally fatigue and required assist
controlled ventilation for resting.  The patient remained
with his tracheostomy tube at the time of discharge.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - On admission the
patient appeared volume depleted and was hypernatremic.  The
patient's free water deficit was calculated and corrected
over time.  The patient was continued on tube feeds during
his hospital course and tolerated these well.  The patient's
hypernatremia resolved to sodiums in the normal range.  He
was maintained on free water boluses 250 t.i.d. for adequate
hydration.

5.  Cardiovascular - Repeat electrocardiogram on admission
showed resolution of the ST depressions in the lateral leads.
This was likely due to weight-related changes.  The patient
was continued on his aspirin, however, his beta blocker was
held due to the fact that the patient's blood pressure did
not require beta blocker.  Early in his hospital course the
patient's blood pressure would occasionally drop, however,
this responded readily to fluids and was likely due to
dehydrations.

6.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was continued on his H2
blocker as well as his tube feeds.  He had a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube which was well functioning during
his hospital course.

DISPOSITION:  Return to [**Hospital **] rehabilitation for further
care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable on antibiotics, still
requiring occasional resting on ventilator support.
