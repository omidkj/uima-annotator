HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for lower
gastrointestinal bleeding at [**Hospital1 5042**].  The patient was noted
to pass large blood clots from her rectum and was
subsequently hypotensive at [**Hospital1 5042**].  The patient was
transferred here for stabilization.  She underwent a
colonoscopy which demonstrated a proctosigmoiditis.  The
patient was treated with Rowasa and hydrocortisone enemas as
recommended by the gastroenterology service.  During her
stay, the patient also was followed by the nephrology service
for dialysis treatments.  The patient was maintained on her
medications as she had been on at [**Hospital1 5042**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient, when transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the medical service, was in no
acute distress.  She had stable vital signs and she was
afebrile.  On neurological examination, the patient was
responsive to voice and seemed to communicate with facial
expressions.  She obeyed commands in all of her extremity
except for her right arm, which was related to her previous
stroke.  On cardiovascular examination, the patient had
normal heart sounds and no murmurs appreciated.  The
respiratory examination demonstrated coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  On abdominal examination, the patient had a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and a slightly
distended abdomen, bowel sounds were present, she was soft
and nontender.  On musculoskeletal examination, the patient
did not have any edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course proceeded as
stated in the history of present illness.  She also underwent
a procedure on [**2126-8-30**] in the Operating Room for a
T-tube change and rigid bronchoscopy.  She was transferred to
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to the floor
in stable condition.  In initial attempt at capping the
T-tube was made and the patient was not able to tolerate it
immediately postoperatively.

The gastroenterology division recommended that the patient
was likely to have some ongoing bleeding from her
proctosigmoiditis and, thus, will need continued monitoring
of her hematocrit.  She was also recommended to continue with
both her Rowasa and hydrocortisone enemas.  The
hydrocortisone enemas were to be discontinued on [**2126-9-5**].  Her Rowasa enemas were to continue once a day for a
month and then change to an as needed basis.  It was also
recommended that the patient should follow up with an
affiliated gastroenterology with [**Hospital1 5042**].

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 5042**] in
satisfactory condition on [**2126-8-31**].
