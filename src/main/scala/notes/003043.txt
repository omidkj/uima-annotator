Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o. man with HCV cirrhosis, complicated by recurrent
ascites, SBP, encephalopathy, and portal hypertensive
gastropathy was admitted with recurrent acute on chronic renal
failure that was managed with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide
after paracentesis.  Cr slightly improved to 2.6. Lactulose and
rifaxamin were continued. Cipro was continued for sbp
prophylaxis.

On [**2187-4-19**], a liver donor became available and he underwent
piggyback liver transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Induction
immunosuppression was given (solumedrola and cellcept). Five
liters of ascites were removed. There was a size mismatch
between the donor (smaller)and recipient bile duct. This was
adjusted for by cutting a slit on top of the donor liver, using
interrupted 5-0 PDS to accomplish a biliary anastomosis. Two
drains were placed in the usual locations (posterior to liver
and hilar area). Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for
management. VRE rectal screen was positive. He experienced a lot
of pain on top of his chronic back pain and required large
amounts of narcotics. On postop day 1, he was extubated and
resumed his home doses of oxycontin.  Re-intubation for
pulmonary edema was required on postop day 4. He was also found
to have myocardial stunning from the stress of surgery. BNP was
39,512. Cardiology was consulted. Cardiac enzymes were negative.
 Diuresis and metoprolol were given. No cardiac event occurred
and he was eventually extubated. Chest CT was negative for PE
and notation was made of bilateral pleural effusions. Hepatic
vasculature was patent. On [**4-23**], TTE demonstrated EF of 30%.
There was moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral and apical akinesis, trace MR
and borderline pulmonary artery systolic HTN. He was extubated
on [**4-25**].

Of note, JP drains had large bilious outputs requiring albumin
and fluid replacement. LFTs increased initially with t.
bilirubin peaking at 12 then decreasing. Liver duplex
demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature, but suboptimal
visualization of the inferior vena cava, no intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilation and a small amount of ascites. On [**4-26**], ERCP was
performed noting extravasation of contrast from the biliary
anastomosis was seen, with contrast tracking along the JP drain.
A 10cm 8 French stent was placed. LFTs then continued to improve
with JP drain outputs dropping and appearing non-bilious.

He was transferred out of the SICU on [**4-28**] to the Med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit
where he continued to do well. Diet was advanced and tolerated.
Glucoses were elevated requiring NPH daily with intermittent
sliding scale regular insulin. Lateral JP was removed on [**5-2**].
Lateral JP creatinine was 2.3 with serum bili of 2.7. The medial
JP remained in place.

PT worked with him noting impulsivity and need for a rolling
walker. He was cleared for home with home PT thru VNA.

Medication teaching was done and he did fairly well with
reinforcement. Insulin administration and glucoses checks were
reviewed. He required assist from his wife for management of
this. This plan was for VNA services to provide
monitoring/instruction.

Immunosuppression consisted of cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] that was well
tolerated. Steroids were tapered to 20mg daily per protocol and
Prograf which was started on postop day 0 was adjusted per
trough levels. On the day of discharge, Prograf trough was 10.9.
Prograf was decreased to 4mg [**Hospital1 **].

Creatinine increased postop to 3.6 after CT, but gradually
decreased to 1.8. On the day of discharge, creatinine was 2.0
and potassium was 5.4. He was instructed to follow a
carbohydrate consistent, 2gram potassium diet.

He was discharged to home with VNA of Southeastern MA
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 80441**]). He had resumed his home dose of oxycontin 80mg
tid with prn oxycodone 10mg approximately 3-4 times a day for
breakthru pain.
