cc of fluid was drained from the pericardium.  One
pericardial and two chest tubes were placed in the operating
room.  The patient was transported to the PACU in stable
condition.  Overnight in the PACU the patient initially did
well, however, the patient started developing agitation.  The
patient was taking swings at the nurse.  He had to be
physical restrained and chemically restrained with Midazolam
to which he responded well.  Also, on postoperative day #1,
the patient was taken for bronchoscopy.  We found moderate
amount of thick, white secretions in both lungs and this was
suctioned to clear airway.  The patient was in respiratory
distress and required Neo for his blood pressure.  The
patient was transported to the SICU for further management
and observation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient remained agitated,
requiring chemical and physical restraints.  The patient was

increased to 3.4 and the heparin drip was discontinued.  The
patient continued ambulation, exercise, and physical therapy.
