Intra-op TEE, [**2198-6-14**]
Conclusions
PREBYAPSS: Preserved LV systolic function with LVEF>55%, no
swma. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS: normally functioning AV bioprosthesis. No AI No AS.
MV unchanged. LVEF > 55%


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-6-14**] where
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement with a # 21 St.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12640**] tissue valve.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and directly
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU intubated in
stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. She had
post operative anemia and was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC.
She awoke neuologically intact and was weaned and extubated.
POD1 found the patient hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Her insulin was titrated to
maintain BS < 150. Beta blocker was initiated and titrated. A
cxr showed bilateral pleural effusions and Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was slow
to wean from supplemental oxygen she was aggresively diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  [**2198-6-16**] a Left 50 cm double
lumen PICC line was placed for IV access. The patient was
transferred to the step down unit for ongoing post-operative
care.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. She was evaluated by physical therpay for strength
and conditioning and rehab stay was recommended.

 By the time of discharge on POD 5, the patient was ambulating
slowly but not at baseline, she requires ongoing diuresis, the
sternal wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to The [**Location (un) **] at
[**Location (un) 701**] with appropriate follow up instructions.
