Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/STEMI

History of Present Illness:
77 year old female who presented to OSH [**Hospital **] Hospital with
chest pain. Patient's VS on presentation were BP 139/69, HR 75,
RR 33, T 97.8, O2 97% 2 L. EKG demonstrated ST elevation V1-V5.
Patient was given ASA, Plavix load, Metoprolol 5 mg X 2 and
Heparin bolus. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
cath.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient's VS BP 130/80, HR 72, RR 18, 91 RA. Heparin
drip was continued, integrillin bolus and 1 L NS given. For pain
control patient was started on Nitro drip and Morphine. Patient
was given Levofloxacin for questionable infiltrate on CXR.
.
Patient is poor historian and currently denies chest pain.
However, since admission patient has described intermittent left
chest "achiness". She describes nausea of 1 day duration. To
other members of medical team describes shortness of breath and
chest pain over past week. Unable to obtain further history due
to orientation to name only. Per nursing home medicine sheet
patient was given 3 SL Nitro at 6 am today.

TTE [**11-16**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls and apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40-45%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
distribution). Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Possible aortic valve
stenosis.
.
.
TTE [**11-20**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV
systolic function appears depressed. There is no ventricular
septal defect. with depressed free wall contractility.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
.
CXR [**11-16**]
Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema. Recommended repeat chest

radiograph after appropriate diuresis, to rule out underlying
infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant for
dementia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, PPM placement
transferred from an OSH with medically managed STEMI.  Patient's
code status was DNR/DNI, which was reversed temporarily to
manage the STEMI, and is now changed back to DNR/DNI, confirmed
with legal guardian (see below).

1. GOALS OF CARE: PATIENT IS DNR/DNI/DNH WITH HOSPICE REFERAL.
After discussion with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (legal guardian), decision
was made for no further escalation of care and request for
hospice referral. Legal guardian can be reached at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 84522**], fax number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84523**] (c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).

# PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales
on exam. Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient
medication. Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart
failure. TTE showed EF 40-45% with prominent symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Possible
aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip re-started, patient diuresed
>4L over the hospital stay, nearing dry weight.  Lasix drip was
d/c'ed prior to discharge; patient discharged on Lasix PO 40mg
twice a day.  She was continued on Metoprolol on discharge
.
# RHYTHM: Patient was in sinus on admission and intermittently
V-pacing.  On [**11-19**], patient went into atrial
fibrillation/flutter with HR 80??????s-110??????s with BP 70's-80's.  She
did not respond to Metoprolol IV boluses, and due to low BPs,
Metoprolol was decreased in dose and Digoxin was initiated.
However, pt continued to have low BP and was DC cardioverted and
loaded on Amiodarone.  Digoxin was d/c'ed as pts BPs increased
in sinus, and Heparin drip was initiated.  However, patient went
from sinus rhythm back to a fib/flutter, and it was decided to
medically manage the patient with rate control.  Heparin was
d/c'ed after patient went back into a fib.
.
# CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior
leads. Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to
septal branch resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU
showed decreasing ST elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5,
this morning with worsening ST elevations. Patient was initially
tachycardic in 90??????s-100??????s with chest pain and significant
nausea, which responded to Nitro drip and Morphine.  Metoprolol
up-titrated for HR control, and patient was initially on Heparin
drip for her STEMI.  Due to medical co-morbidities, improving
