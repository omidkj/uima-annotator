History of Present Illness:
58 y/o M with multiple myeloma s/p chemo and auto SCT [**4-27**]
presenting with acute onset of CP.  Pt was discharged from the
oncology service yesterday, when he noticed onset of severe
pleuritic chest pain.  Stated this started in the setting of a
new medication for nausea started by his oncologist earlier
today (Zyprexa).  Also c/o difficulty catching his breath.  Says
pain doesn't radiate anywhere.  Has chronic trouble with
nausea/vomiting.  No cough, dysuria, oliguria.  He states he has
never had easy bleeding or bruising and denies history of GI
bleeding other than small amounts due to hemhorroids.  To his
knowledge, never had brain involvement of his MM.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.3P 109BP 123/75 R O2 sat. Had
CTA showing PE predominantly in L main PA w/ a small
non-occlusive strand in the R main PA, and extension into LLL,
LUL, and lingular branches.  2. smaller PE in the RML and RUL
branches. 3. flattening of ventricular septum but no bowing into
the LV to suggest R heart strain. Patient was given a dose of
cefepime, morphine for pain, and started on a heparin gtt.
.

Past Medical History:
OSA, hemorrhoids, anemia, asthma, allergies, distant h/o gout,
eczema, s/p chole [**2180**], Multiple myeloma s/p chemo and ASCT

resolved, h/o gout with elevated uric acid on previous adm.

He was first seen in the oncology clinic in late [**2186-10-18**]
and was shortly after diagnosed with multiple myeloma, IgG
lambda, with plasma cells = 80% of marrow cellularity on
[**2186-11-13**]. A skeletal survey was negative, and cytogenetics were
notable for a deletion at 13q14.3.

20mg
d1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12 of 21 days cycle. Complicated by vomiting and
d11 bortezomib was held. Zometa 3.3mg q4wks started.
[**2187-1-12**]: C2D1, no complications.
[**2187-2-2**]: C3D1, Zometa increased to 4mg.
[**2187-2-23**]: C4D1. Monoclonal IgG decreased by >90% (still detectable
in blood and urine), and bone marrow biopsy with <5% plasma
cells, indicating VGPR. Plan was made to proceed withautologous
stem cell transplant followed by PD-1 treatment, as part of
clinical trial 09-061.
[**2187-4-5**]: Admit for high dose cytoxan stem cell mobilization.
[**2187-4-15**]: Admit for fever [**12-20**] Neupogen tx
[**2187-5-1**]: melphalan auto SCT, post-transplant course complicated
by typhlitis

Micro:
Blood cultures ([**5-24**], 8, 10):  no growth to date
Urine culture ([**5-27**]):  no growth to date
.
Imaging:
[**5-24**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2187-4-27**]
non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities are now present.
.
[**5-24**] CTA: The visualized portion of the thyroid appears
unremarkable. There
is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The aorta
is of normal caliber along its course with no intramural
hematoma or dissection. The heart shows no pericardial effusion.
There is no pleural effusion. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
demonstrated.
  A large filling defect is seen in the left main pulmonary
artery with a
smaller contiguous component crossing over into the proximal
right main
pulmonary artery (3; 55). The left main pulmonary arterial
embolus extends
into the lower lobe, lingula, and upper lobe branches.
Additionally,
pulmonary emboli are seen in the right middle lobe, right upper
lobe and right lower lobe branches. The heart shows no bowing of
the intraventricular septum in the left ventricle to suggest
heart strain. Additionally, the main pulmonary artery is of a
normal caliber. The visualized portion of the upper abdomen
shows no gross abnormality. No aggressive appearing lytic or
sclerotic lesions are seen.
.
[**5-25**] CXR: Small left pleural effusion.
.
[**5-25**] Echo: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No valvular
pathology or pathologic flow identified. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2187-3-26**], the echocardiographic
findings are similar (heart rate is now tachycardic).

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
.
58 y/o M with multiple myeloma s/p chemo and auto SCT [**4-27**]
presenting with acute onset of CP found to have a PE on CTA.
#PE - likely related to underlying hypercoaguable state due to
malignancy, though olanzipine was held given that it was only
recently started.  Per CTA pt with large clot burden.
Hemodynamically stable throughout course, only with tachycardia
upon arrival to the floor to 130s.  Echo shows no right heart
strain.  Started on hep gtt and coumadin bridge begun, still on
hep gtt at time of transfer.  Mainly, pt experiences intense L
chest pain that is pleuritic in nature, which causes him to
become very tachycardic and tachypneic (fast and shallow breaths
to avoid the pain).  He doesn't experience much SOB from the PE
other than when the pain becomes too much.  He was started on a
dilaudid PCA after multiple tries with IV morphine, which
eventually controlled his pain.  On transfer, he is on PO
oxycodone with good pain management, less tachycardic to the
110s and satting 96% on RA. Incentive spirometry was encouraged
.
