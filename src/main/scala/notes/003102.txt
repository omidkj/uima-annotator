Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amlodipine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral CVC. Failed RIJ CVC placement.

History of Present Illness:
85-year-old female with history of diastolic congestive heart
failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG x 3 in
[**8-31**], and s/p multiple orthopedic procedures most recently a L
total shoulder replacement [**9-19**] who has been in rehab and
recently discharged to home.  She was last hospitalized in
[**2155-9-23**] for a segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
embolism involving the right lower lobe and right upper lobe
with subpleural consolidation in the right lower lobe suggestive
of pulmonary infarct.

She presented to the ED today via ambulance (field records
unavailable) with fevers (not quantified), chills, ?rigors,
nausea, vomiting, and new oxygen requirement. The patient was in
her otherwise normal state of health except for joint-associated
pains at baseline. Over the past 24 hours, she felt she
decompensated with the aforementioned symptoms. She denies sick
contacts and aspiration although some difficulty swallowing
pills at time. She endorses decreased PO intake over the past
few days. Her last dose of anti-hypertensives was before she
presented.

In the ED, she was triggerred for BP 95/44. She also spiked a
fever of 103.3 in the ED. CXR suggested ?bilateral pneumonia,
and she was started on vancomycin/zosyn. Labs were suggestive of
acute renal failure. Around 8 AM on the day of admission, her
blood pressures dropped to 59/24 with resultant peripheral
levophed started. She was given a total of 7 L NS for
resuscitation. Access was attempted with CVC in the RIJ but
failed. She subsequently had a right femoral line placed.
Pressures were subsequently 105/41, and she came to the flow on
Levophed 0.08. She also required oxygen. In the ED, she was
91-92 % on 6 L NC.

Initial VS on the floor were HR 95 BP 122/46 RR 21 O2 95 % on 4
L T 99.6. Patient denied any overt complaints and felt much
better. She was oriented to person, time but not place. She
could not say the days of the week backwards.

For her functional status, she has been in rehab recurrently for
orthopedic issues. She does some ADLs, limited [**Year (4 digits) 12210**]. She can
ambulate well.

II. Imaging

A. CXR
INDICATION: Fevers

TECHNIQUE: Single frontal radiograph of the chest was compared
to prior
examinations, most recent radiograph dated [**2154-9-22**].

FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: New opacification extending from the
left hilum to both the upper and lower lobes is concerning for
developing pneumonia. A  small left pleural effusion may be
present. A question of luceny over the  left mid thorax is seen
and PA and lateral views may be useful to exclude  cavitation.
No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A left
humeral prosthesis is partially imaged.

B. CT Abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
This is increased since the [**2154-9-23**] study.
2. There is no free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis to
suggest an RP bleed.
A right-sided femoral line is appropriately positioned with no
iatrogenic
complication seen.

III. Cardiology
A. EKG
Sinus tachycardia with poor baseline. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-9-22**] no diagnostic
interval change.

Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T  105 144 102 350/428
153 110 38

B. ECHO
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with preserved free wall motion. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Normal regional and global left
ventricular systolic function. Possible small secundum atrial
septal defect.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-9**],
the right ventricular cavity size is larger, the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation is increased, and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. Is there a history
to suggest a primary pulmonary process - e.g., pulmonary
embolism, pneumonia, etc.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2150**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
