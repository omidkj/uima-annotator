ECG: OSH: Inferior ST segment elevations: III> II, Upsloing ST
segment ddperssions and flat T waves in V5, V6.

ECG: Pre-admission: Demonstrates ST segment elevation in II,
III, AvF, with ? ST segment depression in V4, V5, V6.

Post-admission: Resolution of II, III, AvF, with JP elevation in
V3 with TWI in the inferior leads.

ASA 325 daily, Plavix > 6 months, Cardiac Echo.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis to akinesis. The apex is not well
seen. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2158-3-15**], the LVEF may have improved. If
indicated, a cardiac MRI may better assess LVEF.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 8.6 cm. The left
kidney measures
9.1 cm. A simple cortical cyst measures 1.6-cm in the left
interpolar region.
There is no hydronephrosis, hydroureter, renal calculus or
suspicious mass.
No perinephric fluid collection is noted to suggest abscess.

IMPRESSION:
1. A 1.6-cm left simple renal cyst, previously documented in the
[**2154**] CT
study.
2. No evidence of perinephric abscess. No hydroureteronephrosis
or stone.

Of note, renal ultrasound is not sensitive to detect
pyelonephritis which
requires contrast to demonstrate abnormal parenchymal
enhancement pattern.
.
MRI:
FINDINGS:
THORACIC SPINE: The thoracic vertebral body alignment, heights
and marrow
signal are maintained. There are scattered foci of endplate
irregularities
likely representing Schmorl's nodes and degenerative changes.
The
intervertebral discs are mildly desiccated without significant
loss of disc
space height. No evidence of disc herniation, spinal canal or
neural
foraminal narrowing is identified. No large epidural or
intradural abnormal
fluid collection or mass is identified (contrast could not be
given as the
patient refused). The thoracic cord is normal in signal and
configuration.

LUMBAR SPINE: The lumbar vertebral body alignment, heights and
marrow signal
are maintained. Intervertebral discs demonstrate moderate
desiccation with
significant loss of height. No large epidural or intradural
abnormal fluid
collection or mass is identified. The spinal cord and cauda
equina are normal
in signal and configuration.

T12-L1: No disc herniation, spinal canal or neural foraminal
narrowing.

L1-L2: Mild diffuse disc bulge is present which indents the
ventral thecal
sac without significant spinal canal narrowing. The neural
foramina are not
significantly narrowed.

L2-L3: A diffuse disc bulge is present with minimal flattening
of the ventral
thecal sac. Facet arthrosis is present without significant
neural foraminal
narrowing.

L3-L4: A diffuse disc bulge is present with slight asymmetry to
the right.
Facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum infolding along with the
disc bulge
results in mild spinal canal narrowing and mild right neural
foraminal
narrowing. The left neural foramen is not significantly
narrowed.

L4-L5: A diffuse disc bulge is present which along with facet
arthrosis and
ligamentum flavum infolding result in moderate to severe spinal
canal
narrowing and moderate crowding of the nerve roots. These
degenerative
changes result in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal
narrowing.

L5-S1: A broad-based central disc protrusion is present without
significant
spinal canal narrowing. Facet a
