CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old
white female with a 50 pack year smoking history, who
underwent mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsy on [**2138-9-29**] for Pancoast right upper lobe cancer at [**Hospital6 11896**].

The patient was doing well after her procedure but developed
acute onset of left leg pain at 11:30 p.m. on [**2138-9-29**].  The pain was described as 200 out of ten.  She also
noticed numbness of her left foot.  The patient has a history
of bilateral claudication at one and one-half blocks of
ambulation.  The patient has undergone an angioplasty
previously.  The patient denies any constitutional symptoms
such as shortness of breath, wheezing or cough.

The patient was evaluated in the Emergency Room and then
admitted to the vascular surgery service for further
treatment and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Rheumatoid arthritis.  2.  History
of coronary artery disease, angina stable.  3.  Peripheral
vascular disease.  4.  Osteoarthritis.  5.  Recently
diagnosed lung carcinoma, nonsmall cell; right upper lobe
surgical staging T3N0M0.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Balloon angioplasty to the right
lower extremity times two in [**2129**].  2.  Bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy on [**2138-9-29**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with her
husband.  She has been in relatively good health until
recently.  She has a 50 pack year smoking history and denies
alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, although
she is allergic to contrast media (reaction not described in
notes).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Tenormin 25 mg p.o.b.i.d., Maxzide
27.5 mg p.o.q.d., Reglan 5 mg p.o.q.i.d., aspirin 81 mg
p.o.q.d., [**Doctor First Name **] 1 mg p.o.b.i.d.p.r.n., Nitrostat p.r.n.,
Mavik 1 mg p.o.q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 97.3, pulse 67, respiratory rate 16,
blood pressure 93/54 and oxygen saturation 96% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm without extra heart sounds.  Abdomen:
Unremarkable.  Extremities:  Left lower extremity cool to
touch mid-leg to toes with mottling of foot and toes, sensory
and motor intact, though sensory is diminished compared with
right foot, no ulcerations.  Pulses:  Triphasic signal
femoral on left, palpable on right, popliteal monophasic
signal on left, triphasic on right, dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis absent by palpation and by Doppler signal
on left, palpable dorsalis pedis and triphasic signal
posterior tibialis on right.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 5.2, hematocrit 44,
platelet count 341,000, coagulation profile normal, BUN 22
and creatinine 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given intravenous hydration
and intravenous heparin was begun at 700 units without bolus.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient for perioperative
risk assessment.  They thought she was an acceptable risk for
surgery and was stable from coronary artery disease.  The
patient was begun on Kefzol.

On [**2138-10-2**], the patient underwent a right
iliobifemoral bypass graft with 6 mm Dacron.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition postoperatively.
The patient was hemodynamically stable.  A chest x-ray was
unremarkable.  Postoperative hematocrit was 34.7.  Her
partial thromboplastin time was serially monitored.

On postoperative day one, there were no overnight events.
She had Dopplerable foot pulses.  She remained in the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day number
three, the patient ran a low grade temperature of 99.8.  She
remained hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of
109/51, central venous pressure 15, pulmonary artery pressure
35/15, index 2.69, systemic vascular resistance 1,117, 70%
face mask, 93% oxygen saturation.  Arterial blood gases:
7.21, 50, 88, 21 and minus 8.  Hematocrit was 35, BUN 13,
creatinine 1.3, potassium 4.1.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Abdominal examination was unremarkable.
Extremities showed the left foot cooler than right with
monophasic dorsalis pedis, absent dorsalis pedis on the left
and monophasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis on the
right.

On postoperative day number two, the patient had episodes of
respiratory wheezing with tracheal compression on
examination.  Intravenous Solu-Cortef was given and urgent
pulmonary consult was requested.  Bronchoscopy was done which
showed mild secretions, moderate malacia of the trachea and
both main stem bronchi with more pronounced changes on the
right than left; upper airway was without obstruction.

Prednisone was continued and aggressive pulmonary toiletry
was begun.  The patient required supplementation of potassium
for a potassium of 2.8.  Ativan for anxiety was begun on
postoperative day number three.  Ambulation was begun and the
patient's diet was advanced.  Diuresis was continued for
volume overload.  Stool was sent for Clostridium difficile on
[**2138-8-6**], which was positive and the patient was begun
on Flagyl.

The patient was transferred to the regular nursing floor on
[**2138-10-7**].  Her diet was advanced as tolerated.
Rehabilitation screening began.  Physical therapy evaluated
the patient.  The patient continued to progress.  Her
pulmonary status improved without further compromise.  Some
swelling of the lateral aspect of the cervical incision was
noted.  Hematocrit was stable.  The patient was continued on
Flagyl for a total of seven days.  Case management was
consulted regarding discharge planning.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Albuterol nebulizer q.6h.p.r.n.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.t.i.d., started on [**2138-10-6**] and is
to be continued through [**2138-10-12**].
Fentanyl 25 mcg/hr topical patch q.72h., begun on [**2138-10-4**].
Lorazepam 0.5 mg p.o.q.6h.p.r.n.
Heparin 5,000 mg s.c.q.12h.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
Reglan 10 mg p.o. with meals.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.b.i.d., hold for systolic blood pressure
less than 100 or heart rate less than 60.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute ischemic left leg with underlying peripheral
vascular disease, status post right iliobifemoral bypass
graft with 6 mm Dacron
2.  Respiratory compromise secondary to allergic response of
intravenous dye and volume overload status post bronchoscopy,
improved.
3.  Nonsmall cell lung cancer, staging T3N0M0.
