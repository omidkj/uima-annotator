History of Present Illness:
61 year old man, PMH of DM type II, with recent hospital
admission ([**5-22**]) for enterococcal bacteremia and aortitis,
presented to OSH on [**2138-7-22**] complaining of 6 weeks of back pain
and bowel incontinence. Patient said onset of severe back pain
began approximately 6 weeks ago in lower right side, worse with
sitting or standing. If attempted to stand, he experience pain
shooting up his back. He last walked approximately 6 weeks ago.
The pain has been stable, not worsening. He reports mild
improvement. He is now able to roll in bed. Yesterday patient
was unable to turn his head to the side. That has since
resolved.
.
Two weeks ago, patient developed bowel incontinence. He can not
sense when he is going. He has loss of stool approximately
3-4x/day. Also reports decreased urine output with no leakage or
dribbling. Patient feels he is dehydrated.
He decided to go to the hospital when after attempting to get
out of bed he felt very dizzy and "things went black." Also
became concerned about his decreased urine output.
.
At OSH: MRI was notable for an L2-L3 epidural abscess.  Notable
findings at the OSH include ampicillin sensitive enterococcal
bacteremia, CT scan findings of possible aortitis and a right
pleural effusion.  He was started on ampicillin and gentamycin,
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation. Pt was started
on flagyl for diarrhea.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 6xyo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with
EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred
from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and
enterococcal bacteremia.

refusing vascular surgery intervention.

Pertinent Results:
Initial MRI L Spine: Findings indicative of discitis and
osteomyelitis at L2-3 and L4-5 level. Inflammatory changes
posterior to the thecal sac at L2-3 level could be due to
phlegmon or a small epidural abscess. Inflammatory changes are
also seen involving the right psoas muscle and posterior
musculature at L4-5 level. Epidural enhancing soft tissues due
to phlegmon are also seen. Examination is limited and for better
evaluation if clinically indicated, a repeat study with proper
sedation is recommended.
.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2138-7-27**]: Discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-C6
level.  No overt change in the extent of discitis and
osteomyelitis at L4-L5 level, incompletely assessed at L2-L3
level. Probable pelvic fluid, incompletely assessed.
.
TTE [**7-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall,
moderate hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall,
and extensive apical akinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous strands on
the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant), although small vegetations cannot be excluded with
certainty. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66yo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with
EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred
from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and
enterococcal bacteremia.

His hospital course is summarized as follows:
He was initially followed on the medical floor for medical
management of his MI and bacteremia but then transferred to the
MICU on [**7-29**] when he became hypoxemic with an associated
respiratory acidosis.   In the MICU, patient was diuresed.
Initially Abx extended to vanco/zosyn/amp/gent for presumed PNA.
However CXR more consistent with worsening CHF and pleural
effusion.  PICC was placed for longterm antibiotic therapy.
.
Pt was called out to floor on [**2138-7-31**]. On the floor, he
initially was stable then on [**8-2**] became more SOB. CXR revealed
moderate R pleural effusion as well as worsening CHF. Diuresis
with Lasix plus albumin with minimal response.
.
On [**8-3**], he was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for
SOB.

MICU PROBLEM BASED COURSE SINCE [**8-3**]:
.
1. Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially intubated for
respiratory distress with subsequent multiple failed planned and
self-extubations throughout MICU course.  His respiratory
failure was likely secondary to large pleural effusions [**1-17**] CHF
(EF 10-15%).  Hypoalbuminemia due to nephrotic syndrom also
playing large role as pt reaccumulated fluid s/p thoracentesis
and additionally, he has underlying COPD. On [**8-9**] extubated, R
Thoracentesis removed 2L fluid. CXR improved following but
clinical scenario without change. Pt refused re-intubation
overnight. Worsening gas on bipap.  Pleural fluid labs:
transudate. On [**8-10**] Reintubated (pt w/ barely adequate O2 resp
function on BiPap).  On [**8-13**] Pt self-extubated and [**8-14**]
re-intubated secondary to increasing hypoxia, hypercarbia.  On
[**8-20**] extubated x1hr to speak with wife but was briefly
hypotensive with reintubation, requiring levophed.
On [**8-23**] pt extubated himself, agreed to reintubation.  [**8-26**] R
Thoracentesis removed 1.8 L, stopped due to hypotension
requiring levophed temporarily. On [**8-27**] Trach placed by IP and
respiratory status remained stable through remaining hospital
course. He is able to breath off the vent for 8-10 hours on some
days, but then tires and requires to be replaced on the vent.
