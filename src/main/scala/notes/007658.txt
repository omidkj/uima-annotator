History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 68-year-old woman diagnosed with primary high
grade B cell CNS lymphoma here for 5th cycle of methotrexate.
Patient has newly diagnosed CNS lymphoma per brain biopsy,
however bone marrow biopsy results reveal no lymphomatous
involvement and CT torso showed no signs of mets.  On her last
admission, she developed exacerbation of her delirium and was
monitored with a 1:1 sitter, as well as restraints as needed to
prevent the removal of lines.  She received two cycles of
methotrexate which were well tolerated.  After the fourth cycle,
her mental status improved significantly and she no longer
required restraints.  Furthermore, follow-up MRI showed good
response of her tumor to methotrexate therapy.

In addition, on her last admission, the patient was noted to
have one likely seizure while in-house on a therapeutic dose of
dilantin ([**10-25**]). She has not had any repeat seizures.

Pertinent Results:
[**2201-7-21**] MRI head: Decreased perilesional edema in the left
temporal region. No change in the area of enhancement in the
left temporal region. Gyriform enhancement in the right medial
occipital lobe and left inferior
cerebellar hemisphere

[**7-29**] Hip Xray: No acute left hip fracture detected.  No
displaced fracture is seen about the pelvic girdle.
Degenerative changes of lower lumbar spine and hips noted.  On
the AP view, there is a metallic density overlying the left
iliac in the region of the anterior superior iliac spine seen
only on that view.

MRI hip:  No evidence of avascular necrosis. Increased signal
present within the distal left iliopsoas tendon near its
insertion at the lesser trochanter with surrounding fluid signal
and inflammatory change, consistent with tendonitis and
iliopsoas bursitis. Edema within the gluteus muscles on the
left, as well as the left vastus lateralis muscle

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 69-year-old woman with CNS lymphoma who presents
for her 5th cycle of MTX.  She has a one month history of
psychiatric changes and ataxia secondary to the CNS lymphoma.

(1) Primary CNS Lymphoma:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] presents with a history of
posterior circulation strokes and aortic atheroma, a one month
history of psychiatric changes, ataxia, and word finding
difficulties.  She is s/p 4 cycles of HD MTX which she tolerated
well and cleared after 96hrs.

She was admitted for her 5th cycle of high-dose MTX and
underwent the standard urine alkalinization and hydration with
D51/2NS with 3amps of bicarb at 150cc/hr and given 650mg bicarb
TID.  However, the patient did not alkalinize sufficiently after
the first evening of hospitalization and required an additional
day of alkalinization with bicarbonate supplementation.  Strict
Is/Os were kept and Lasix was administered to attempt to
maintain fluid balance.  However, she became several liters
positive and gained 6 lbs, stopped diuresing to the given doses
of Lasix and on [**2201-8-14**] she was found to have a MTX level of
488, oliguria, altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension,
and bradycardia to 38.  At that point she was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for MTX toxicity and ARF for urgent hemodialysis
management.  A left HD cath was placed and hemodialysis was
initiated.  She tolerate the hemodialysis well, and her MTX
levels decreased incrementally (488, 137, 43, 23, 9, 2.5, 1.21,
0.96, 0.73, 0.4, 0.18, and 0.1). During that time she was given
leucovorin, as well as 1/2 NS with bicarbonate to alkalinize her
urine.  Urine pH was kept at 8 to 9 during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.  She
consistently produced >200 ml/hr of urine.  They also removed
between 1 to 4 kg of ultrafiltrate each day.  She pulled out her
hemodialysis catheter on [**2201-8-21**] and another one was replaced
without incident on the right femoral vein.  Her last
hemodialysis was on [**2201-8-26**] and her creatinine continued to
trend downward to a level of 0.1 on the date of discharge.

(2) Left Hip Pain: Per NH report, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] had fallen out of
her wheelchair while attempting to stand up.  She fell on her
left side and has resultant bruises noted on admission.  A hip
xray was obtained which revealed no fractures, however she
complained of pain on her left during the hospitalization.
Ecchymoses were noted along her left abdomen and thigh. An MRI
of the left hip was also done which showed bursitis/tendonitis.
She was treated wit
