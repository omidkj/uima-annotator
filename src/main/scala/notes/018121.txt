Gen: Pleasant, answers questions appropriately
HEENT: PERRLA
Neck: supple, tender to palpation along sternocleidomastoid,
worse when coughing
Chest: Decreased lung sounds at left base. Serous drainage from

Pertinent Results:
[**1-5**] ChestCT: 1. Mild calcifications of the aortic annulus and
anterior ascending aorta extending to the level of the right
pulmonary artery. 2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension. 3.
Mediastinal lymph nodes likely reactive.
[**1-6**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened and display slightly reduced systolic
excusion. However, frank aortic stenosis is NOT present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2162-4-29**], no major change is evident.
[**2163-1-6**] Carotid U/S: 1. 40-59% stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery. 2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal
carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4886**] was transferred from OSH
for cardiac surgery. She was appropriately worked-up and brought
to the operating room on [**1-6**] where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated.

She was gently diuresed with IV lasix towards her pre-operative
weight. On POD 4 she had a slight increase in her BUN/CR and her
lasix was changed to [**Hospital1 **]. Physical therapy was consulted to work
on strength and balance and felt that she would be best served
by a short stay at a rehab facility.  There was serous drainage
from the distal pole of her sternal incision and she was started
on a 5 day course of Keflex.

On POD 4 she was screened and received a bed and was discharged
to rehab.
