Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus tach at 120, PRWP, IVCD, LAE, no ST/TW changes c/w
[**2143-1-1**]
CXR: hyperinflation, mild CM, atx at bilat bases, no CHF,
effusion or focal infiltrate.  stent in lower trachea/left
mainstem (unchanged position)

Echo [**1-1**]
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: 1) Probable normal myocardial perfusion study in the

face of soft
tissue attenuation by breast tissue. 2) Normal left ventricular
cavity size and
function.
