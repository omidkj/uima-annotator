antibiotic spacer and I&D of L heel ulcer. Leading up to OR,
patient had a L TKR in [**2198-1-29**] in NY which was complicated
by post-operative MRSA infection. To manage this, she had a
resection arthroplasty in [**Month (only) 216**] during which antibiotic spacer
had been placed. She also received several weeks (details
unavailable) of Vancomycin/Flagyl at home, with some period of
Levaquin therapy. In the OR today, she had 800cc blood loss
intraoperatively through L knee with 2 U PRBCs transfused.
Intra-operatively patient did well from oxygenation standpoint.
One hour later in recovery in the PACU, patient became
acutely/subacutely hypoxic (according to ortho resident) ad was
noted to have PO2 30 on ABG, at which point CXR was performed,
which revealed tube abutting carina, and 3cm pullback of tube
was advised. Patient was also on Neosynephrine drip
post-operatively, and anesthesia was unable to wean. They gave
patient 10 IV lasix prior to transfer because of concern for
fluid overload.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient remained intubated and appeared
comfortable. Wound Vac over left knee was in place. Patient was
maintaining good urine output and oxygenating well.

as a precautionary measure overnight and was extubated in the
MICU on POD1 without complication.  Here PE CT scan was negative
and her EKG and cardiac markers were negative.  On POD2 she
received an additoinal 2 units of packed red cells and was
