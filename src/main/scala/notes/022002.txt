Service: SURGERY

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2534**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p MVC with injuries

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-11-30**]:  ORIF left acetabulum, right knee aspiration and closed
treatment of right patella fracture with manipulation under
anesthesia


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 yo male with hx of sick sinus syndrome s/p
pacer, HTN, and  high cholesterol who was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with
an acetabular fx. Per report, the patient was in a MVA where he
was in the passenger seat and they rear-ended another vehicle at
approx 30mph. EMS arrived on scene and the patient was
complaining of hip pain radiating to his low back.

The patient was taken to [**Hospital 5279**] [**Hospital 1108**] transferred to WX VA
who then transferred him to [**Hospital1 **] for management of left acetabular
fracture and right patellar fracture. He denied any chest pains,
shortness of breath, PND, orthopnea, palpitations, dizziness.
.
In the ER pt was seen by trauma and ortho services. C-spine was
cleared. Pt was transferred to the ortho service and medically
cleared for surgery. Had ORIF of L acetabular fracture on [**11-30**].


During he had narrow complex tachycardia (afib vs AVNRT) with
HRs up to the 180s. He had a CTA to evaluate for PE which was
negative. However, CT showed 2 focal areas of irregularity in
the aorta thought to be ulceration vs. dissection.

 He was transferred to the SICU on [**12-2**] due to rapid HR and
possible dissection. Vascular and cardiac surgery were consulted
and recommended repeat CTA. He had repeat CTA in the AM of [**12-2**]
which showed no dissection. HRs went up to the 190s and pt had
narrow complex tachycardia. He was given esmolol and SBPS
dropped, so he was transiently started on peripheral levophed
for 2 hours. He was seen by EP who thought he had an AVNRT as
well as atrial fibrillation. He was started on a dilt gtt in the
MICU, with continued rapid HRs to the 140s and SBPs 80s-90s. He
ultimately was hemodynamically stable and titrated off the
diltiazem drip and responded to PO diltiazem 75 mg QID
(increased from 50 on [**12-4**]) and lopressor 25 mg PO TID. His HR
remained in the low 100s to high 90s with SBP in the 120-130s.
He was then transferred to the cardiology service for HR
control.
.
Currently patient is without complaints. Denies dizziness, chest
pain, SOB, abd pain, N/V.

RENAL U.S.  [**2147-12-6**] 1:34 PM
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Cystic lesion seen on pelvic CT
corresponds to a 4.3 cm exophytic simple renal cyst from the
left lower pole. No hydronephrosis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2147-12-3**] 1:13 AM

FINDINGS: There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly. Leads
from a dual-lead pacemaker is seen projecting over the heart in
similar location to prior. The left lateral chest is off the
film. There is a new area of opacity in the right lower lobe
that could represent an early infiltrate or some volume loss.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2147-12-2**] 1:52 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Two focal aortic contour irregularities as described above.
Please see corresponding dedicated CTA of the aorta from [**2147-12-2**]
(Clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 71165**]). 3. Bilateral severe centrilobular emphysema.
4. Multinodular thyroid, with adjacent clips suggesting prior
surgery. Correlation with patient's history is recommended.
5. Small hiatal hernia.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2147-12-2**] 5:15 AM
Contour irregularities in the thoracic aorta and right common
iliac artery likely represent chronic changes associated with
atherosclerosis. No evidence of acute dissection or contrast
extravasation.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-11-28**] 10:34 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture. Multilevel
degenerative changes as detailed above.

CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2147-11-28**] 10:35 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. Comminuted left acetabular fracture involving the posterior
column and acetabular roof.

2. Two lytic lesions, involving the right iliac bone and the
left pubic symphysis. The larger lesion in the right iliac bone
demonstrates cortical destruction and a small associated soft
tissue mass. Given the multiplicity of lesions, metastatic
disease is the most likely differential consideration.

3. Low density structure in the left abdomen that is
incompletely evaluated, possibly representing an exophytic cyst
arising from the lower pole of the left kidney. This could be
further evaluated with renal ultrasound or CT.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2147-12-7**] 11:18 AM
1. Small right common iliac artery aneurysm with thrombus
component.
2. Descending thoracic aorta penetrating ulcer with small
associated hematoma unchanged.
3. At the aortic arch at the apex medially, there is a small
focal outpouching from which originates a small paraspinal
artery. These findings are unchanged as well. No aortic
dissection or aortic aneurysm identified.
4. Small bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
5. Indeterminate left upper pole renal lesion for which a
dedicated non- contrast CT of the abdomen could be performed,
alternatively, a dedicated MR could be performed.
6. Abnormal enlarged right hilar lymph node.
7. Multinodular goiter for which a throid ultrasound could be
performed for further assessment.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer from [**Hospital 5279**] hospital
after being a restrained passenger in a MVC.  He was evaluated
by trauma and orthopaedic surgery.  He was found to have a Left
acetabular fracture and a right patella fracture.  He was
admitted to orthopaedics and consulted on by medicine to clear
for surgery.  Due to his elivated INR he was given Vitamin K.
On [**2147-11-30**] he was prepped and consented for surgery.  He
tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and taken to the
recovery room.  In the recovery room he remained hemodynamically
stable with his pain controlled.  He was then transferred to the
floor for further recovery.  On the floor he remained stable
with his pain controlled.  He was seen by physical and
occupational therapy to improve his strenght and mobility.  On
[**2147-12-1**] he began to experience several episodes of SVT
associated with hypotension.  The patient was r/o for PE with
CTA and transfered to the unit where he continued to have runs
of SVT.  EP saw the patient and made recommendations for beta
blocker increase as well as hydration - plus possible cardiac
ablation.  On [**2147-12-2**] the patient was transferred to the
medicine service.

.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a known history of atrial
fibrillation.
- His RVR was thought to be precipitated by dehydration and
catecholamines in setting of fracture and pain. Ruled out for PE
by CTA.
-Digoxin loading initiated in the MICU but subsequently
discontinued.
-EP evaluated the pati
