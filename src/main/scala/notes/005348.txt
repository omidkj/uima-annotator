Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 yo M with DM, ETOH cirrhosis complicated by
encephalopathy and varaceal bleed, s/p TIPS (listed on
transplant list, currently deactivated) who was admitted to the
cardiology service on [**6-14**] for workup of a new cardiomyopathy (
He underwent an echo at OSH, which showed an EF=10%, prior from
[**3-7**] showed mild focal LV hypokinesis with EF=60%.) Of note, he
also had a cardiac cath [**4-6**], which showed non obstructive CAD.
While on the cardiology service he has had A fib/flutter with
rates up to the 150-250 bpm.  The EP service was consulted and
felt that this could be a tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy,
recommended to rate control with low dose metoprolol QID.  He
was also started on digoxin, lasix gtt and heparin gtt.

Over the past day, the patient's BP has progressively declined
from the 110s systolic to the 80s this morning.  He is newly
encephalopathic this morning, somnolent with very apparent
asterixis. He was started on vanco/cefepime and sent for a head
CT to r/o bleed given anticoagulation.  Of note, lasix gtt
stopped last night and heparin gtt stopped this morning at 9am.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports being sleepy but
denies any pain.  Does c/o some abdominal discomfort but
otherwise slow to respond.

Echo [**2171-6-14**]
Conculsions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Systolic function of
apical segments is relatively preserved. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis suggestive of a non-ischemic process. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-3-22**],
there has been a marked deterioration in biventricular systolic
function and increase in mitral regurgitation.

CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Associated
opacities are probably attributable to atelectasis although not
entirely
specific.
3.  TIPS in place and trace amount of abdominal ascites.
4.  Cholelithasis.
CXR-FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Hazy opacification of
the lung bases suggests pleural effusions of substantial size,
more conspicuous and probably larger on the left than right
side.  Fullness of each hilum with indistinct contours is
suggestive of perihilar congestion, although mild and unchanged.

There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of substantial pleural
effusions and mild
congestion.
CXR-[**2171-6-16**]-Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in
comparison to [**2171-6-14**].
There is interval progression of pulmonary edema, moderate to
severe.
Increase in bilateral pleural effusion is noted.  No definitive
focal
consolidation to explain interval development of pneumonia is
seen, although it might be obscured by pulmonary edema.  No
pneumothorax is seen.
CT Head-FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
or territorial infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are
moderately prominent, consistent with global atrophy.  The basal
cisterns are patent and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  There is no fracture.  The visualized paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
