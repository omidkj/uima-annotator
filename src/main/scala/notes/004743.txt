Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 60M with a PMH significant for malignant HTN,
venous thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin
abuse on methadone maintenance who was found down by paramedics.
Per the patient, he was using clonidine patches for his
hypertension and had to continually place new ones on his body
as they were "falling off in the shower". He denies any abuse of
other medications. Found to have clonezepam pill bottle which
was tucked in his buttocks on exam with several pills in it.
.
In the emergency department the patient was afebrile, SBP in the
170s, HR 35-40 and sinus, and satting 100% on RA. AP films of
the pelvis, chest, and CT head were preliminarily negative. The
patient refused narcan, and his mental status improved gradually
over the course of his ED stay.
.
On the floor he was found to be confused, disoriented,
complaining of severe headache with photophobia. Blood pressure
SBP 197-212. Gave 10 mg iv of hydralazine BP 169/94. He remained
bradycardiac 34-40 and due to concern for [**Location (un) **] reflex and
hypertensive emergency he was transferred to the MICU. Of note
he was found to be in renal failure, Cr 2.1, baseline 1.0.

Social History:
Past heroin abuse, now on methadone. No recent illicits. Denies
current smoking or  [**Last Name (un) **], but has h/o tobacco use 10 years ago.

IMAGING
.
LUMBO-SACRAL SPINE (AP and LAT)
T-SPINE: Again seen is multilevel degenerative endplate change
and marginal
osteophyte formation. No spondylolisthesis or fracture of the
thoracic spine
is evident. The cardiomediastinal contours and visualized lung
are grossly
unremarkable.
L-SPINE: Again noted is anterior wedging and loss of height of
the L1
vertebral body, unchanged from [**2107-10-5**]. Superior endplate
depression of the
L3 vertebral body remains similar in appearance as well. An IVC
filter is
unchanged in position. Bridging enthesophyte involving T12-L2
remains similar
in appearance. Visualized hip and sacroiliac joints are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  L1 vertebral body compression fracture, depression
of the superior endplate of L3, unchanged. IVC filter,
unchanged. Thoracic spondylosis without spondylolisthesis.
.
CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are
unremarkable. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. Small
amount of periventricular hypodensity (2, 18) is noted and
likely represents chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There
is no evidence of acute fracture. The visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
.
CT CERVICAL SPINE
FINDINGS: There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The
vertebral body heights and alignment are preserved. Minimal
degenerative changes in the cervical spine are noted, which
include disc space narrowing. Bilateral facet degenerative
changes are noted throughout the cervical spine and most severe
in the upper thoracic spine. There is no evidence of acute
fracture or dislocation. The visualized lung apices are clear.
Extensive amount of
mucous and debris are seen within the trachea and this patient
may be at risk for aspiration.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Degenerative changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M with malignant HTN p/w HTNive emergency with ARF and
AMS. Found down likely due to altered mental status from excess
narcotics/benzodiazepines.  Patient admitted to MICU given
evidence of hypertensive emergency with end organ damage
(creatinine 2.1) and severe sinus bradycardia.
==
# HYPERTENSION:  Patient started on nitroprusside drip,
clonidine, amlodipine and hydralazine. He was weaned off
hydralazine and nitroprusside within 8 hours of admission. His
amlodipine was increased. Cardiology was consulted regarding his
bradycardia and his clonidine patch dose was decreased on their
advice. The patient's blood pressure improved to systolics 120s
with medical intervention and his creatinine fell to 1.4.  His
hypertension at admission was likely [**2-25**] clonidine withdrawal.
.
After transfer to the floor, patient was normotensive.  On HD 4,
his c-spine was cleared and as he stood up from his bed for the
first time he became lightheaded and dizzy.  Orthostatics were
positive.  He was bolused with NS and advised to start eating,
as the cause of his dehydration was most likely d/t decreased PO
intake since admission. His BP regimen consisted of a 0.1 mg
clonidine patch and amlodipine 5 mg.  HCTZ 12.5 mg was added on
day prior to discharge as patient's SBP remained elevated in the
170-180 range.  His HR was stable in the 60s.  He has follow-up
scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-9**] (day following discharge);  BP
should be remeasured and regimen adjusted as needed.  Note that
patient has h/o multiple admissions for hypertensive
urgency/emergency, likely due at least in part to clonidine
withdrawal from his erratic use of the patch.  Clonidine should
therefore not be increased at this time; may even consider
discontinuing altogether to avoid rebound hypertension.
..
# BRADYCARDIA:  DDx on presentation included central bradycardia
due to increased intracranial pressure vs. narcotic overdose,
likely the latter as the patient was using both methadone and
klonopin PTA and serum tox at admission was positive for opiates
and benzodiazapines.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended
decreasing his clonidine.  Even after the decrease, he continued
to be bradycardic to the 40s.  He remained asymptomatic.  At
time of discharge, his HR was back up to the 70s.
