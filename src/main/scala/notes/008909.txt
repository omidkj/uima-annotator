Admission Date: [**2168-4-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2168-5-12**]

Date of Birth:  [**2111-10-16**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NME


REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Seizures.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old former
anesthesiologist, who has a history of anaplastic
oligodendroglioma which was picked up in [**2166-3-24**] by
screening MRI of the head for an infertility workup.  The
initial abnormalities were in the right temporal and right
insular cortices with later involvement of the corpus
callosum.  He had generalized tonic-clonic seizures shortly
thereafter and was started on anticonvulsants.  He was
treated initially with Antineoplaston in [**Country 149**] and finally
had stereotactic brain biopsy in [**2167-8-24**].  He came
to [**Location (un) 86**] to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in [**2167-9-23**], and
temozolomide chemotherapy was started in [**2167-10-24**].
Because of lack of response to this, whole brain radiation
was begun in [**2168-1-24**] and ended on [**2168-2-29**].  He
appears to have been on chronic steroids since [**2167-2-21**] when starting the temozolomide.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-3-13**] for an intracranial
hemorrhage seen on radioimaging that was probably radiation
changes ultimately.  He also was noted to have a leg abscess
and hypotension and was seen by neurology and neurosurgery in
consultation.  To address the hypotension, steroid doses were
increased and he was watched in the MICU overnight.  At that
time, he was on Lamictal but because a rash on the chest was
noted, Lamictal was stopped and Depakote was increased
because the level was subtherapeutic.  He had a seizure and
Dilantin was added, and therefore he was discharged on
Keppra, Dilantin, and Depakote.

He was seen on [**2168-4-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in neuro-oncology and his
cell counts were low.  For this, he was switched from
Dilantin to Topamax.  The plan at that visit was to
eventually treat him again with adjuvant temozolomide.  He
was readmitted from [**2168-4-6**] to [**2168-4-14**] with
encephalopathy from a urinary tract infection, pneumonia,
narcotics, and also a few seizures, although I do not know
which type these were.  He was observed on long-term
monitoring, during which he did have some subclinical brief
electrographic seizures.  This was questionable for muscle
artifact at the same time, which was fairly atypical
appearing.  He was finally tapered off Dilantin and sent home
on increased Keppra, Topamax, and Dilantin.

He was then readmitted on [**2168-4-24**] for increased seizure
activity.  He was residing at [**Hospital 24591**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 745**] and he
was falling down and sent to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital.  A
head CT showed no new changes and a chest x-ray showed a
persistent right middle and right lower lobe infiltrate,
thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia.  A valproic acid
level was low upon admission and it appears that it has not
been therapeutic for a couple of months.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient formerly worked as an
anesthesiologist in [**Location (un) 11177**].  His brother, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Known lastname **], is on staff at [**Hospital1 18**] in the division of cardiology.
He also has a wife by the name [**Name (NI) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  His parents are alive and well.  His mother
has a history of depression.  His two brothers are healthy.

EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  GENERAL:  He is an ill-appearing
man in no apparent distress.  His temperature was 99.4, blood
pressure was 120/74, heart rate 92, O2 sat 95 percent on room
air.
HEAD & NECK:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  He has alopecia.
His neck is supple.  His mucous membranes are moist.  No
carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.
CHEST:  Lungs revealed some decreased breath sounds at the
right lower lobe.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema or rashes.
MENTAL STATUS:  He was inattentive and extremely abulic.  He
did not easily follow commands.  His language appeared to be
intact in that he spoke in full sentences coherently, but his
speech output was greatly reduced.  He answered questions
appropriately about biographical information and orientation
to place.  He was able to name a couple of objects and
repeat.
CRANIAL NERVES:  He appeared to be neglecting the left hemi-
field.  The fundi appeared normal.  The pupils reacted
normally to light.  Extraocular movements were full without
nystagmus initially.  Facial movement is symmetric.  The
tongue and the palate were midline.  The patient spent most
of his time with his gaze towards the right.
MOTOR:  Again, this was difficult due to the patient's
inability to follow all commands.  The bulk was normal.  The
tone was increased in the whole left hemi-body.;  There
initially was a left pronator drift and upon sustained
extension of the arms, the left drops more rapidly than the
right.  There also appeared to be a component of neglect,
during which leaving the limb in front of the patient's field
of vision did not seem to help him sustain against gravity
better than without making his arm more apparent to him.  He
spontaneously moves the right side much more than the left.
Coordination was thought to be somewhat more ataxic on the
left.  It was not clear whether this was due to motor
weakness alone, however.  Reflexes were trace throughout and
difficult to elicit.  The plantar reflexes were flexor
bilaterally.  Sensation was intact to noxious stimulus in all
four extremities.  Gait and stance were deferred.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. SEIZURES:  The patient was admitted to the neurology [**Hospital1 **]
   service with suspected increased seizure activity.  His
   valproic acid level was 37 upon admission and, as
   mentioned before, had not really been therapeutic in the
   last several months.  The previous recent medical
   illnesses including the C-diff colitis as well as the
   pneumonia were thought to be the exacerbating factors for
   those episodes of increased seizure activity, but it was
   not clear that these were acute issues upon this
   admission.  Although he was on Neurontin and Keppra, as
   well as Depakote, he was having at least two to three
   clinical seizures a day on the neurology [**Hospital1 **], which
   mainly consisted of right gaze deviation with some
   twitching of the right side of the face.  There would also
   be tonic contracture of the right arm.  During the brief
   episodes which lasted a couple minutes, the patient was
   not responsive to any commands.  After these episodes, he
   would routinely seem more lethargic than prior.  He
   remained fairly encephalopathic for the majority of the
   hospital course, which was thought to be multifactorial,
   in part due to poor seizure control, and potentially
   sedating effects of Keppra.  He did not have any
   significant metabolic or toxic abnormalities.  He also did
   not have any significant systemic infections to account
   for this.  Around the fifth hospital day, it was decided
   to load the patient with phenobarbital orally as efforts
   to increase his Depakote were still not making his
   frequency of clinical partial seizures reduced.  He
   appeared to be again more sleepy initially wi
