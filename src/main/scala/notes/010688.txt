Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
pre-syncope, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath [**2133-11-24**]


History of Present Illness:
76 year old man with history of coronary artery disease s/p DES
to LAD in [**2130**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting to
[**Hospital3 **] today with new episodes of dizziness and light
headedness for the past week.

Mr [**Known lastname 53607**] reports he was in his otherwise good state of health
until the last week or so, when he began feeling tired
performing his usual activities. He reports until recently he
was able to run for 40 minutes on his treadmill but now has not
been able to do so for more than 20 minutes without feeling
short of breath. He denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or episodes of fainting or passing out.

Of note, patient recently traveled to his home country
([**Last Name (LF) 53608**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] air travel) where he attended a wedding. He does
acknowledge dietary indiscretions including salty meals and
increased alcohol consumption.

On the day of admission, patient reports these episodes of
feeling as though he would faint became more frequent. He also
reports he almost fell on his way into the emergency room
because of feeling so light headed.

On [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], Patient's vitals were:
T: 97.6 HR 38 (palpated) RR 16 BP: 150/74 O2 Sat: 99% RA
He was also found to have ventricular Bigeminy with frequent
pauses and later developed episode of non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia (7 beat?) and cardiology fellow was consulted, who
recommened starting amiodarone with load (150mg IV x 1) and
600mg infusion after. D-dimer was obtained and found to be
elveated. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further
management.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

He does report some exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.9, HR 116, BP 125/72, RR 22
O2 Sat 99%. He was continued on IV Amiodarone and taken to CT
scan for CTA chest. Patient was then transferred to CCU for
futher management.

CTA Chest [**2133-11-21**]: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Extensive
coronary arterial calcific atherosclerotic disease. 3. Tiny
right pleural effusion. No consolidation. 4. Non-specific mild
bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
ECHO [**2133-11-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There are probable
torn/coiled chordae tendinae on the mitral valve tips, although
a healed vegetation cannot be excluded. An eccentric, jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

CATH [**2133-11-24**] (prelim report): 1. Selective coronary angiography
in this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was free of angiographically apprent disease.
The LAD had a proximal stent that was widely patent. The LCX had
a small OM2 with long disease up to 80% (noted to be unchanged
from [**2130**]). The Ramus was a small vessel with 70% lesions in two
sub-branches. The PDA was a small vessel with diffues minimal
disease unchanged from catheterization in [**2130**]. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly eleavted right and left sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mmHg and PCWP of 15 mmHg.
There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP of 43 mmHg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension with SBP of 168 mmHg.
Cardiac index was low at 2.08 l/min/m2.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 53607**] is a 76 year old man with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and CAD, s/p DES to LAD [**2130**], presenting with
worsening dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema and atrial
bigeminy with NSVT.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Patient demonstrated several episodes
of monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting up to
several minutes on telemetry, during which he was asymptomatic
and hemodynamically stable. His recurrent episodes of exertional
pre-syncope prior to admission were attributed to his VT.
Patient's VT was controlled on Amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Etiology
initially thought to be secondary to ischemia given known
history of CAD. He was also volume overloaded with signs of
heart failure, which may have precipitated his tachyarrhythmia.
He underwent cardiac catheterization  which demonstrated CAD
unchanged from [**2130**] (proximal LAD stent was patent, other
diseased vessels looked similar in appearance). He also had
mildly elevated biventricular filling pressures on right heart
cath and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Amiodarone was
discontinued and beta [**Year (4 digits) 7005**] increased. A Cardiac MR was
ordered to evaluate for myocardial scar/fibrosis
