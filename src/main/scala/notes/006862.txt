Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 y/o male with MMP including Parkinson's Disease, prev
ARF, CHF, CAD s/p CABG [**2088**], carotid stenosis s/p CEA '[**92**],
restless leg syndrome, MGUS, anemia, PUD with recent discharge
for anemia/CHF/PNA now admitted with worsening DOE x 2 wks, LE
edema R>L, worsening orthopnea and PND. Shortness of breath
thought to be due to PNA so pt was continued on his outpatient
levofloxacin and azithromycin. Pt went into acute respiratory
failure on [**9-28**] requiring intubation. Chest xray revealed
diffuse bilat patchy opacities so antibiotic coverage was
broadened to Azithromycin/Vancomycin and Zosyn. on [**9-30**] pt went
into acure on chronic renal failure though due to being prerenal
and ATN, and required hemodialysis. Pt continued to require
ventilatory support without much improvement and brochoscopy was
performed but unhelpful. Chest CT revealed fibrotic changes
consistent with a chronic fibrotic process, unlikely to resolve
in the near future. After 9 days of hemodialysis treatment the
Renal team felt that his chances for renal recovery was
unlikely. On [**2101-10-3**] a family meeting was held with the pt's
wife, his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], MICU attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99878**],
and the renal team to discuss prognosis. The family decided to
make the pt DNR/DNI but to see how he progressed over the next
few days. The pt showed no improvement in his respiratory
failure or renal recovery so a second family meeting was held on
[**2101-10-7**] with the same parties present except for the Renal team
and it was decided to make the pt comfort measures only with
morphine for respiratory distress. The pt was pronounced on
[**2101-10-8**] at 3am. Family requested that no post-mortem be
performed.
