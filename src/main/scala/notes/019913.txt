Chief Complaint:
S/p fall

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of Type 1
diabetes, systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease s/p
MIs and CABG who presented to the Emergency Department after
falling down the 4 steps of her house while trying to get to her
car. According to interviewers in the ED, the patient had no
loss of consciousness and the narrative was one of mechanical
fall. Following the fall, the patient had hip pain and
deformity.

In the ED, the patient was waiting in triage when she became
hypoxic to 80s despite supplemental oxygen and her lungs had
crackles throughout. The patient has a history of systolic CHF
requiring diuresis. The patient's chest X-ray was consistent
with pulmonary edema (likely flashed) with RA saturation in the
70s and low 90s on non-rebreather. The physicians in the ED
decided to intubate the patient, which was completed without
complication. The patient was originally on nitroglycerin gtt,
Versed/Fentanyl, but the compbination of the sedatives and the
nitroglycerin made her hypotensive so the nitroglycerin was
stopped. The patient still gets hyypotensive with boluses for
[**Last Name (LF) 31158**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on dopamine. Also in the ED, the
patient was pan-CT scanned, and her only injury is a left femur
fracture. Orthopedics would like to surgically correct but want
medical clearance first. Her vitals upon leaving the ED were Hr
76, BP 110/48, 100% saturation on ventilation.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was sedated and intubated
but responsive. She was motuhing words but could not be
understood secondary to the endotracheal tube.

.
CXR [**3-1**]:Single supine portable view of the chest was obtained.
The
endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level
of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level
of the diaphragm, with the side port at the GE junction and
distal tip likely terminating within the stomach, suggest
advancement so that the side port is well within the stomach.
Extensive bilateral perihilar opacities likely relate to edema,
although underlying consolidation may also be present. No large
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The patient is status
post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided AICD is stable in
position.
.
CT spine [**3-1**]:
1. No fracture or subluxation.
2. Bilateral lung apices opacifications better evaluated on the
concurrent CT of the chest.
.
CT head [**3-1**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic right parietal infarct.
3. Moderate-to-severe small vessel disease and atherosclerotic
calcifications
of the carotid arteries
.
CT A/P [**3-1**]:
1. Acute left intertrochanteric femoral fracture with adjacent
hematoma
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs consistent with
pulmonary
edema and bilateral posterior lung opacifications likely
representing
atelectatic changes, less likely aspiration or contusion.
3. No acute vascular or visceral injury. No evidence of aortic
injury and no pulmonary embolism.
4. Left lateral 7th rib fracture seen on radiograph from this
same date
([**2133-3-1**]) is not visualized on CT, however this might be
related to technical reasons
.
Hip XR [**3-1**]: IMPRESSION: Left intertrochanteric fracture.
.
Echo [**3-2**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the sepum, inferior, and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of
multivessel CAD (LAD and PDA distribution). Mild mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Incresaed PCWP.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2125-4-23**], left ventricular systolic function is
now improved and the estimated PA systolic pressure is now
lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD, CHF admitted for left hip
fracture and acute congestive heart failure requiring
intubation.
.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acute on chronic systolic and
diastolic heart failure.
-Patient was diuresed, and her symptoms improved. She briefly
required intubation.  The patient spent time on several services
while in-house, and at one point there was concern for an acute
ST elevation on EKGs, so she was taken to the cardiac cath lab.
At that time, chronic total occlusion of her LAD was diagnosed,
and no intervention was performed.  The patient will need her
heart failure regimen titrated while at rehab, including ACE-I,
beta-blocker and diuretics.  She needs additional diuresis
acutely, which should be performed at rehab.  Additionally,
given her chronic angina and CAD, she may benefit from rene
