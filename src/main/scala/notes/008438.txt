Admission Date:  [**2115-4-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-4-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2060-2-13**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
female with a past medical history of end-stage renal
disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
high cholesterol, peripheral vascular disease (status post
gastrointestinal bleed with chronic guaiac-positive stools
who presented with increased abdominal pain since [**2115-4-11**].  The patient states that she had an abdominal
paracentesis on [**4-11**] where 2 liters of fluid was removed.
She states the tap was done because the patient had an
increased abdominal girth.

patient states she had increased abdominal pain which had
been increasing until she presented to the hospital.  The
pain is diffuse throughout her abdomen and increased when she
sits up.  She had a positive bowel movement yesterday which
was within normal limits.  No diarrhea.  She has had nausea
and vomiting yesterday.

Of note, the patient has had multiple medical admissions in
the recent past.  In [**2114-12-15**] she was admitted with
the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia versus gastritis.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy was complicated by bleeding, and
ascites was noted but not tapped.  Hepatitis serologies were
negative.  She was readmitted several days after discharge
with a headache and lightheadedness.  Her hematocrit was
14.7.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy led to gastritis.  A
colonoscopy revealed polyps and diverticula.  A small-bowel
follow-through was negative.

 1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction.
 2.  Diabetes.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  End-stage renal disease.
 5.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis.
 6.  Bilateral below-knee amputation.
 7.  High cholesterol.
 8.  Asthma.

10.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed with chronic
guaiac-positive stools.
11.  Peripheral vascular disease versus calciphylaxis.
12.  Bilateral frequent gangrene.
13.  Status post appendectomy.
14.  Left arteriovenous fistula.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d., clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin patch as
needed, carafate 1 g p.o. q.d., Phos-Lo 3 tablets p.o.
t.i.d., nifedipine-CR 120 mg p.o. q.d., Zestril 60 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Dilaudid 4 mg to 5 mg
p.o. q.2-4h. as needed, Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Senna two
tablets p.o. q.p.m. as needed for constipation.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies include VANCOMYCIN, PENICILLIN, SULFA
DRUGS, KEFLEX, and CIPROFLOXACIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile, heart rate
was 80, blood pressure was 161/91, respiratory rate was 20.
In general, she was a frail African-American female, lying in
bed, appeared uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat was unremarkable.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and
second heart sound.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was tense, distended, diffusely
tender; especially in the lower quadrant in the right lower
quadrant around the paracentesis site.  Extremities revealed
bilateral below-knee amputations, and fingers were wrapped in
ACE.  The patient requested not to unwrap.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission were significant for a creatinine of 4.3, a white
blood cell count of 8.2, and a hematocrit of 18.7 (down
from 26).  An ascites tap revealed 1175 white blood cells
with 73% polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
floor for management of her hematocrit drop.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  A CT scan was performed which revealed
blood present in the peritoneal cavity.  There was an active
source of extravasation seen.  Because of these results, the
patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

There, she was given fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K,
desmopressin acetate, and packed red blood cells.  Surgery
was consulted but did not think the patient emergently needed
surgery.   They recommended that she go to Interventional
Radiology.

On approximately the third hospital day, the patient was
taken to Interventional Radiology where she underwent an
embolization procedure.  Substantially following that, the
patient's hematocrit stabilized.

She was followed in the Intensive Care Unit.  She
subsequently was able to maintain her hematocrit; although,
she required a few blood transfusions.  No further treatment
was needed for her bleeding.  The patient also
had large volume paracenteses several times in house, and she
seemed to tolerate this reasonably well.  She was called out
to the floor on [**4-19**].

2.  RENAL:  The patient underwent hemodialysis while she was
in house.  She continued to do well with this.

3.  DIABETES:  The patient had several low blood sugars and
was treated with D-50; but, otherwise, she seemed to do
reasonably well.  There were some issues with patient
compliance.  She was refusing some of her medications, but
these were ultimately resolved.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  Twice per day hematocrit checks were done
following discharge from the unit, but she remained
hemodynamically stable.  She ultimately required a total of
four units during her hospital stay.

5.  PAIN:  The patient had significant abdominal pain.  This
was her main issue on the floor.  We were attempting to get
this under control so that she would be safe for discharge.

A Pain Management consultation was obtained.  She was started
on a Fentanyl patch and given p.o. Dilaudid.  She had no
evidence of over sedation, and this regimen seemed to work
reasonably well for her.

The patient ultimately had her pain controlled with a
Fentanyl patch and Dilaudid.   She was deemed safe to go
home.   She was to follow up with her primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was to follow up with the [**Hospital **]
Clinic as necessary.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Anemia secondary to
bleeding into peritoneum.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She was to follow up with her primary
care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 2.  Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 4.  Nitroglycerin patch as needed.
 5.  Carafate 1 g p.o. q.d.
 6.  Phos-Lo 3 tablets p.o. t.i.d.
 7.  Nifedipine-CR 120 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Zestril 60 mg p.o. q.d.
 9.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
10.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
11.  Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12.  Dilaudid 4 mg to 5 mg p.o. q.2-4h. as needed.
13.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
14.  Senna two tablets p.o. q.p.m. as needed for
constipation.
