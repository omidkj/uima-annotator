Service:  Bone Marrow Transplant

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
gentleman who was transferred from an outside hospital to
[**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit with
streptococcal pneumonia and bacteremia.  The patient was then
found to have plasma cell leukemia.

The patient initially presented with shortness of breath for
three days, malaise, and an upper respiratory tract infection
for six weeks.  On initial presentation, his temperature was
104 degrees Fahrenheit and his heart rate was 130.  He had
fecal incontinence, bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and
thrombolytic lesions at L3 seen on a computed tomography
scan.  On admission, the patient was diaphoretic, short of
breath, and using accessory muscles to breathe.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Denies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin every other day.

ALLERGIES:  PEANUTS.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 104.2 degrees
Fahrenheit rectally, his heart rate was 114, and his blood
pressure was 103/68, his respiratory rate was 21 to 25, and
his oxygen saturation was 96% on 70% face mask.  Physical
examination was significant for diffuse rhonchi and coarse
rales bilaterally, tachycardia, protuberant abdomen which was
soft without tenderness, and diaphoretic skin.  All other
systems including head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination, pulmonary, cardiovascular, abdominal,
extremities, skin, and neurologic examinations were found to
be within normal limits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
white blood cell count was 3.6, his hematocrit was 26.7, and
his platelets were 132.  His albumin was 2.4.  His INR was
2.6.  His lactate was 2.2.  His ferritin was 731.  His
reticulocyte count was 2.9.  Differential on the white blood
cell count revealed 39% atypical, 18% neutrophils, and 24%
lymphocytes.  Urinalysis revealed 10.9.  His lactate
dehydrogenase was 1066.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with hypoxia.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and his
oxygenation improved on a nonrebreather.

On [**1-8**], the patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit on 4 liters of nasal cannula.  Over the
next few days, his oxygenation improved, and he was
saturating greater than 90% on room air.  The patient was
discharged to home without oxygen.  The patient did not need
to be intubated during this hospitalization.  A repeat chest
x-ray revealed interval improvement in infiltrates.

2.  PLASMA CELL LEUKEMIA ISSUES (immunoglobulin G):  The
patient presented with hyperviscosity syndrome on admission.
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy on [**1-6**] which
revealed plasma cell leukemia.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was treated with
Decadron for four days, allopurinol, and G-CSF.  On transfer
to the Oncology floor, the patient was given pamidronate.  A
skeletal survey was negative for fractures, except for
compression fractures of T12, L1, and L3.

The patient was treated with a CVAD protocol
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and Decadron).
The patient was discharged from the hospital on G-CSF.  The
patient was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Clinic for
further treatment.

The patient initially presented with a lactate dehydrogenase
above 1000, and prior to discharge this level had trended
downward to less than 200.

3.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's renal failure
resolved prior to transfer from the Intensive Care Unit with
intravenous fluids.

4.  HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  While on the Oncology floor, the
patient had hyponatremia with a low of 125 without symptoms.
The patient was treated with fluid restriction and Lasix.

5.  PNEUMOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient was started
on ceftriaxone in the Intensive Care Unit on [**1-6**].
This was continued through the day of discharge; totalling
twelve days of treatment.  The patient was also treated with
antibiotics for one day at the outside hospital.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to home
with Hickman catheter home care.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable;
tolerating a by mouth diet; with blood cultures no growth to
date.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Streptococcal pneumonia.
2.  Streptococcal bacteremia.
3.  Plasma cell leukemia; status post chemotherapy.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Hyponatremia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged on
G-CSF.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Wednesday, [**1-23**].
