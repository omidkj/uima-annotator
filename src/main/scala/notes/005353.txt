Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient with a history of severe COPD secondary to longterm
smoking use although he quite smoking successfully 6 years ago.
Is on baseline oxygen at 2.5 liters per minute which he only
requires during the daytime and does not typically use at night.

He does not use his nebulizer treatments routinely, but used 2
yesterday and 3 today without significant relief.  He was
maintaining his baseline until 2 days ago when he started
devloping a productive cough and progressive shortness of breath
- he directed his wife not to call 9-1-1 at that time; today his
breathing became acutely worse while trying to have dinner and
he told his wife he needed to go to the emergency department at
that time.

There has been no fever, no n/v/d.  No chest pain.  No extremity
pain or leg pain, no extremity swelling.  Wife confirms DNR/DNI.
 He has recently begun treatment with a wound care nurse for a
fungal infection of his skin complicated by excoriations.

In the ED, initial VS were: 100.1 ??????F (37.8 ??????C) (Temporal
Artery), Pulse: 124, RR: 38, BP: 147/101, O2Flow: 98.  He was
placed on BiPAP, started on antibiotics in the setting of a
low-grade fever and a productive cough.  He was loaded with
solumedrol, given ativan to improve bipap tolerance.  He was
then admitted to the MICU for BiPAP requirement, oxygen demand,
and work of breathing.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared uncomfortable in
his BiPAP, but otherwise was saturating well, but tachypneic.
His wife was at his bedside with him.  He complains about the
discomfort of the mask, but denies any pain at this time.

Pertinent Imaging:
CXR [**5-22**]:
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2107-5-22**] at 5:43 p.m.
.
Heart size is normal.  Aneurysmal descending thoracic aorta is
redemonstrated. Bilateral enlargement of pulmonary arteries,
most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension is
redemonstrated.  Severe emphysema involving upper and mid lung
zones and to some extent lower lobes is redemonstrated.  No
pneumothorax is seen.  The patient might potentially have small
hiatal hernia.
No pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is
present.  Overall, no abnormality has developed in the interim
to explain patient's symptoms since the prior radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o male with history of COPD presenting with 2 days of
worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough, needing
BiPAP, admitted for increased work of breathing.
.
#COPD Exacerbation: likely due to wife having respiratory
illness in the last 2 weeks, less likely is PE which was
considered in the face of this patient population having
increased risk of PE, but with a good source and response to
COPD therapies COPD exacerbation is the most likely diagnosis.
-continue NC & high flow, tolerated better than BiPAP
-continuous vs stacked nebs
-continue prednisone at 40mg today, start [**Year (4 digits) 15123**] tomorrow
-hold home spiriva at this time
-morphine for air hunger
-DNI/DNR
-CM for LTAC
**ICU Course**
The patient was quickly transitioned off BiPAP his first night
in the unit and did well with nebulizers and nasal cannula, but
intermittently required high-flow oxygen with corresponding
tachypnea to maintain O2 saturations in the mid 90's; he quickly
recovered once that therapy was initiated, howevever.  He has
been stable on 5L via nasal cannula for the last day.  He
received 4 doses of IV methylpred, and was started on a steroid
[**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] far has received 40mg [**Hospital1 **] of prednisone, will be
slowly tapered over the next 2 weeks then he should continue his
5mg regimen [**Hospital1 **].  He has been receiving scheduled nebs, this
should continue.
.
#PNA/Bronchitis: low grade fever, unlikely pneumonia on CXR,
will narrow coverage to levo in the face of this; if spikes or
deteriorates low threshold for advancing to MRSA coverage with
vanc for cefepime.
-levo 750mg q48, next dose 6/12 AM
-airway management as above
-follow cultures
**ICU Course**
The patient had low-grade temps, but is being treated for
pneumonia given his increased risk having COPD and a productive
cough.  Due to his creatinine clearance he was dosed 750mg q48,
he has received 1 dose and will need to receive a dose at 10pm
tonight and then his last dose at 10pm on [**5-26**].
.
#Vision Changes: patient with several months of worsening
vision, unable to get to eye doctor due to financial
constraints, wife is asking that this be looked into.
**ICU Course**
No emergent need to address this in the ICU, should be
evaluated/facilitated in the outpatient setting.
