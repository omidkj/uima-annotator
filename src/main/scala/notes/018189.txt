report. He was given a bolus of Amiodarone 150 and recieved two
shocks (50 jouls). He then went back into sinus rhythm followed
by slow A-FIB. He was then transffered to [**Hospital1 18**]. ROS +

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2161-8-2**] 4:48 PM
IMPRESSION: Mild vascular engorgement. No frank edema.
Small pleural effusion most likely bilateral.
Questionable nodular opacity in the right lower hemithorax may
be a pulmonary nodule or nipple, repeated examination with
nipple marking is recommended.
Extensive mediastinal widening with right tracheal deviation due
to known
goiter containing areas of calcification.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2161-8-3**] at 10:34:45 AM      FINAL

IMPRESSION: Left ventrivcular cavity enlargement with regional
and global systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man who presented to OSH for with chest
pain, SOB and fatigue who was found to be in V-tach with
hypotension and was shocked twice, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# Rhythm: It was felt that the patient's initial wide complex
rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient was sable with a LBBB. He was maintained on his home
medications with the exception of digoxin.  While the etiology
his initial tachycardia was unclear, scar related [**Name (NI) 102121**] was
considered the most probable given his history of MI.  During
his hospital course, the patient was mostly in sinus rhythm but
did have one episode of asymptomatic V-tach 24 hours after
admission.  This lasted for approximately 16 beats and was self
resolving.
The patient was seen by the electrophysiology service who
recommended permanently discontinuing digoxin in order to avoid
it's proarrhythmic properties.  The patient's dig level at the
time of discharge was 0.6.  He should follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], the in next 2 weeks.
.
#A-FIB: The patient had a history of slow A-FIB with a history
of paroxysmal A-FIB. The patient was intermittently in A-FIB
during his hospital course. He was not on Coumadin given his
history on GIB.  He was continued on Plavix.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: The patient had a history of MI in [**2129**] which
was medically managed.  Troponins were elevated on admission
(peak 0.71) and this was felt to be due to his cardioversion at
the OSH. The patient was started on aspirin while hospitalized
but this was discontinued upon discharge given the patient's
previously documented GI bleed/?Adverse reaction to aspirin.
.
# Pump/valves: The patient had a history of heart failure.
Echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated at least
moderate mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of ~30%.
Chest x-ray was without evidence of volume overload. The patient
was scheduled for a follow up appointment with his primary
cardiologist.
.
# HTN/Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension but
his blood pressures were low throughout most of his
hospitalizations  (SBP's in the 80's-100).  The patient denied
feeling symptomatic despite some orthostatic component to his
hypotension.  The patient was continued on his home BP
medications and follow up was recommended.
.
# Neuralgia: The patient was on Neurontin for pain control.  The
patient denied pain during his hospital course.
.
# Home Safety: The patient was seen by Physical therapy who
recommended home PT as well as a home safety evaluation.
