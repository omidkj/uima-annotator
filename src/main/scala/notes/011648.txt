Chief Complaint:
Shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Fiberoptic intubation [**2200-8-23**], [**2200-8-28**]; left subclavian central
venous line placement [**2200-8-23**], left radial arterial line
placement [**2200-8-23**]; surgical tracheostomy tube placement and PEG
tube placement [**2200-9-4**]; staple insertion in head laceration

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106548**] is a 52 year old male with history of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia status post allogeneic bone marrow
transplant in [**2188**],
cutaneous GVHD recent admission for pneumonia who presents with
3 days of shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].
He was feeling "okay" until 3 days prior to admission when he
noted shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] upon awakening. It was worse with
exertion/walking but improved throughout the day. This occurred
again over the next two days. The shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] was not
associated with chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness,
diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  He notes orthopnea x several
months. No PND/leg swelling. He does note some
nausea/lightheadedness after taking famvir. He denies fevers,
chills, sweats, worse/productive cough. He denies diarrhea. He
does note some decreased appetite and PO intake.
He called Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] office today and was told to increase his
prednisone from 20 mg to 40 mg. Of note, he receives inhaled
pentamadine for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] but has missed a few doses. He is unsure
the date of his last dose.
In the ED, the CTA was negative for PE, but notable for
resolving pna and stable tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance. He was given 1
dose of ceftriaxone/vanco.  His ECG was sinus 94, old q in avF,
LAD, LVH and new TWI in V4-V6. He was given asa and 1 set of CE
was negative.

Imaging:
[**2200-8-20**] Chest CTA:
1. Resolution of left lower lobe consolidation with mild
scarring or atelectasis remaining.
2. Small 2 cm and 1 cm areas of patchy opacity of the anterior
base of the left lower lobe and peripheral right upper lobe are
nonspecific but unchanged.
3. No change in 7 mm soft tissue density in the rightchest
wallt, which may represent a sebaceous cyst.
.
[**8-23**] CT C Spine (prelim):
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment within the cervical
spine.
2. Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
.
[**8-23**] CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**8-23**] EKG: NSR 97, lat TWI, no ST changes
.
[**2200-8-25**] TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A
right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-7-30**], no
change. IMPRESSION: Patent formamen ovale with right to left
shunting at rest (probably mild).
.
[**8-27**]: Right hip XR
IMPRESSION: Limited exam. No obvious right proximal femur
fracture identified. Alignment of the right hip is within normal
limits on the AP view, but not well evaluated on the lateral.
.
[**2200-8-30**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Possible right atrial
abnormality. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave
abnormalities. The ST-T wave changes are diffuse. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-8-29**]
sinus tachycardia is now present.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52yo M w/ CLL s/p alloBMT in [**2188**] with chronic skin GVHD
admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology
with GI bleed, leukopenia.
.
1. Respiratory failure-This patient developed apneic hypoxic and
hypercarbic respiratory failure. DDx includes pulmonary GVHD,
pleural fibrosis, sleep apnea, or airway obstruction. DDx for
acute cause of respiratory failure include hypophosphatemia
(0.3), increase in sedation, mucus plug, CVA, or acute head
injury. Pt was intubated and doing well but had poor negative
inspiratory force with moderately reduced combined lung and
chest wall compliance secondary to chronic GVHD changes. Though
he had a favorable RSBI when he was extubated on [**8-28**] he
required reintubation after approx 2 hrs of extubation for
increased work of breathing, likely related to mechanical muscle
weakness.  He had a tracheostomy tube and PEG tube surgically
placed on [**9-4**] for for more slow weaning off the vent via
sprint-rest trach mask trials and was awaiting placement in a
respiratory rehabilitation center, however throughout the week
prior to his death, he was requiring higher vent settings and
continued to desaturate. Repeat bronchoscopy did not alleviate
his respiratory failure and it was felt that he was continuing
to mucous plug secondary to VAP and his inability to clear his
own secretions. His health care proxy (wife) along with the
team, made the decision to make Mr. [**Known lastname 106548**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] measures
only, and expired on the morning of [**2200-9-19**].
.
2. VAP-While awaiting tracheostomy tube placement he developed
increased FIO2 requirement, low-grade fever, and leukopenia with
bandemia in the setting of new LLL and RUL opacity, so [**9-3**] was
started on cefipime, vanco, levofloxacin for VAP. He also was
found to have gram + rods and cocci on sputum culture.
.
3. Leukopenia-he developed leukopenia [**9-2**], with WBC count
trending down during his hospital course, possibly
myelosupression from medication vs infection vs myleodysplastic
syndrome, differential showed bandem
