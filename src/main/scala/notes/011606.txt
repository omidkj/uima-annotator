Service:  GYN/ONCOLOGY

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Pelvic mass.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Stage IV poorly differentiated
papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old
gravida II, para II-0-0-II, who presented to the
Emergency Room with complaints of constipation, nausea,
vomiting, and anorexia for the last two weeks.  The
workup in the Emergency Room included a CT
which showed bilateral pleural effusions, a large
multiloculated mass filling the entire cul-de-sac measuring
15.8 cm in greatest dimension, extending out of the pelvis
above the umbilicus towards the liver.  There was omental
caking and minimal ascites.  The
ovaries were not well visualized.  There was some
questionable retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Because of the patient's GI complaints, she was admitted and
placed on bowel rest with the diagnosis of a partial small
bowel obstruction.  Her initial laboratory results revealed a
white blood cell count of 27.8 with 89%
neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes.  Her initial PT was 14.4 with an
INR of 1.4.  Her sodium was 133.  Her liver function tests
were within normal limits.  Her amylase and lipase were also
within normal limits.

The patient was admitted for further evaluation of her
pelvic mass, GI symptoms, and fever.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PARTIAL SBO:  The patient was admitted
to the hospital and placed on bowel rest.
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and were
repleted as needed.  The
patient's symptoms of nausea, bloating,
and constipation continued until her surgery.

Her postoperative course from a GI standpoint was significant
for a postoperative ileus which resolved on postoperative day
number seven with the passage of flatus.  The patient was
started on TPN on postoperative day number two given that she
had been on bowel rest preoperatively.
 We continued to check her electrolytes
on a daily basis and replete them through her TPN.

On postoperative day number eight, the patient's diet was
advanced to fluids.  The patient was able to
tolerate the fluids as she continued to ambulate and pass
flatus.  Her diet was advanced.

By postoperative day number 11, she was tolerating solid
foods.  In addition, the patient was also spontaneously
passing flatus and having bowel movements.

The patient will be discharged home on a regular diet with
Boost supplements.

2.  HEMATOLOGIC:  A lower extremity Doppler was performed on
the patient on hospital day number two after suspicion for
DVT was raised on the initial CT of the pelvis.  It
demonstrated a left superficial femoral deep venous
thrombosis.

A CTA
showed probably not clinically significant emboli.  The
patient was started on heparin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter was placed on
hospital day number four.  This was done by Interventional
Radiology with no complications.  The patient was continued
on heparin up until approximately seven hours prior to
surgery.   The
patient had her coagulation panel and CBC checked daily.

Just prior to surgery, the patient received 2 mg of vitamin K
and 1 unit of FFP per the Hematology Service recommendations.
In addition, preoperatively, the patient received 2 units of
packed red blood cells given that her preoperative hematocrit
was 25.

Intraoperatively, the patient received 2 additional units of
packed red blood cells and 1 additional unit of FFP.
Postoperatively, the patient's hematocrit was stable in the
low 30s.  Her heparin anticoagulation was restarted on
postoperative day number four for
one day.  At that point, the decision was made to change her
to Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. per recommendations
from the Hematology Service.  A low-molecular weight serum
level was drawn and was found to be subtherapeutic.
Therefore, the dose was increased to Lovenox 60 b.i.d.

The Lovenox was discontinued on postoperative day number ten
due to the development of an incisional hematoma.  The
patient will not be discharged on Lovenox  but
will probably restart the Lovenox on an outpatient basis with
her hematologist.  The patient's hematocrit on the day prior
to discharge was 27 and given that she will undergo
chemotherapy, the decision was made to give the patient 1
additional unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient was started on Epogen 40,000 units
subcutaneously q. week (starting on Wednesday) plus iron 325
mg q.d.  The patient will be discharged to home on the iron
and the Epogen.

3.  ONCOLOGIC:  A FNA of
the breast demonstrated a poorly differentiated
epithelial
tumor, unknown primary.  The Breast Surgery Service was
consulted and their opinion was
that the pelvic mass primary was most
likely not breast in origin.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated exploratory
laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, and
cytoreduction procedure on [**2179-3-20**].  The estimated blood
loss was 1,200 cc.  The patient received 5 liters of
crystalloid, 2 units of FFP, 4 units of packed red blood
cells (including her preoperative transfusion).

The intraoperative findings included multiple tumor nodules
on the mesentery, small bowel, diaphragm.  There was a large
pelvic mass arising from and replacing the entire left ovary.
The right ovary was normal and small in appearance.  The
omentum was replaced by tumor caking.  There was 1,200 cc of
straw-colored ascites.  There was no evidence of mechanical
bowel obstruction.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the ICU for
her immediate postoperative recovery.  While she was in the
ICU, her pain was adequately controlled.  Her CA-125 returned
at 475 and her CA19.9 was 14 (within normal limits).  The
patient's pain was controlled initially with a Dilaudid PCA.
An intraoperative NG tube was continued on low intermittent
suction.

The patient's urine output was adequate and her Foley was
discontinued on postoperative day number two.  The patient
remained afebrile during the immediate postoperative period.
The rest of her vital signs were stable.  Her breathing
remained the same (slightly with feelings of slight shortness
of breath but overall breathing without difficulty).

The final pathology from the surgery revealed a poorly
differentiated papillary serous carcinoma arising from the
ovary.  The Oncology Service was consulted and arrangements
were setup for in-house chemotherapy for cycle number one.

On postoperative day number 16, the patient underwent her
first cycle of single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] carboplatin chemotherapy with
Decadron premedication.  The patient tolerated the
chemotherapy well and will follow-up for her chemotherapy on
an outpatient basis.

From a pain control standpoint, the patient was continued on
Dilaudid PCA until postoperative day number seven.  At that
point, she was changed over to Toradol.  The patient was
continued on the Toradol until she was able to tolerate more
p.o. and at that point, she was changed to p.o. Motrin and
Percocet with Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  The patient
was continued on the Toradol for a total of four days and
Motrin for one day.

At that point, she developed an incisional hematoma which was
initially followed clinically as it was not expanding.
However, on postoperative day number 12, the incision began
to drain and the patient spiked a temperature up to 101.2.
The decision was then made to proceed with an I&D of this
incisional hematoma.  This was done at the bedside using 1%
lidocaine for local anesthesia.  A three inch area of the
incision was opened and approximately 200 cc of clot was
drained.

The wound was flushed with sterile saline and gently packed
with gauze.  The patient from that point onward will be
having b.i.d. to t.i.d. wet-to-dry wound dressing changes.
The patient will have VNA services when she goes home to
assist her with the dressing changes.

During the temperature spike, the patient had been pan
cultured.  Her blood cultures have been negative to date.
The triple lumen catheter that was placed intraoperatively
was pulled and the tip was sent for culture.  The u
