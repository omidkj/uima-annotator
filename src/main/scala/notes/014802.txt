Brief Hospital Course:
.
.
1) DYSPNEA: The patient intitially presented complaining of
acute onset shortness of breath at home.  This most likely
represented the patient's typical COPD flare, for which the
patient has been admitted with several times in the past.  There
was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR; however, he was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin initially.  These were stopped
after a short peroid of time since there was no evidence of
pneumonia.  A few days into his admission, the patient acutely
decompensated with desats into the 80's and low blood pressure
(80-90's systolic).  He was transferred to the MICU for a 24
hour period, at which time he received BiPAP and more frequent
nebs.  He stabilized and was transferred back to the floor.
While back on the floor, he continued to have episodes of acute
SOB requiring frequent nebs (often Q1H).  With nebs, his O2 sats
stabilized in the mid 90's, and he did not require further ICU
level of care.  He was started on doxycycline for coverage of
possible bronchitis.  Blood cultures still pending without
growth to date, and sputum culture obtained was not a good
sample.
.
2) DYSURIA: Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**] also complained of significant dysuria
on this admission, requiring catheterization.  UA was negative.
He was also noted to have significant urinary retention after
catheterization, suggesting significant BPH.  He was started on
Flomax and Proscar this admission.  His dysuria could also be
due to chronic prostatitis since UA was found to be negative.
He was not started on antibiotic therapy for this possibility
during this admission.  He should see urology as an outpatient
for these issues.
.
3) BACK PAIN: He continued to complain of significant back pain
during this admission, consistent with his musculoskeletal pain
related history of L1-2 laminectomy from an accident he had at
work many years ago.  This pain made him anxious and
occasionally precipitated shortness of breath.  It was well
controlled with oxycodone prn.
