Date of Birth:   [**2054-1-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old Cantonese
female who speaks some English with a history of hypertension
and hypercholesterolemia who presents with a four day history
of the acute onset of dyspnea on exertion which worsens with
exertion.  Also noted fevers, occasional chills,
nonproductive cough and decreased appetite.  She was seen by
a nurse practitioner [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6685**] Medical Center where she is
a patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Chest x-ray and examination were
consistent with pulmonary edema.  She was given doses of
Hydrochlorothiazide and Levaquin and sent home.  The patient
continued to have dyspnea and became more tachypneic.  She
was then brought to the Emergency Room.

The patient has a history of refractory hypertension managed
on Clonidine transdermal and Norvasc.  She has no prior
history of heart disease however, she has never had a
cardiovascular evaluation.

Cardiac risk factors include hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and age.  She does not have any history
of diabetes mellitus, smoking history of family history of
cardiac disease.

Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient was able to walk
several blocks with minimal difficulty.  She has no remote
history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  She
has awakened several times over the last four nights short of
breath.  She denies any history of chest pain.

At the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was
208/80, heart rate was 120, respiratory rate was 30 and her
oxygen saturation was 96% on four liters nasal cannula.  She
was given aspirin, sublingual Nitroglycerin two times, and
then was started on a Nitroglycerin drip.  Examination was
consistent with left and right sided heart failure.  She was
given Lasix 40 mg intravenous times one and she diuresed 500
ml.  Her EKG at that time showed multifocal atrial
tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 with 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevation in V1, V3, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V5 and V6.
Poor R wave progression with loss in the anterior portions in
V1 through V3.  There was no prior EKG for comparison.

LABORATORY:  Showed CK of 560, MB of 17, MB index is 3.0 and
troponin greater than 50.

Cardiology fellow was consulted who recommended a heparin
drip and low-dose beta blocker.  Per Emergency Room attending
no Telemetry beds except for unit.  Transferred to Cardiac
Care Unit for monitoring.

upper sternal border.  No heaves.  Lungs with diffuse
crackles two-thirds of the lung fields anterolateral.

Abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds with well healed right
upper quadrant transverse scar, nontender.  Liver 10 cm at
the right mid-clavicular line.  No splenomegaly.  Extremities

greater than left with some stasis changes.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit 33.5,
platelets 276, 85 neutrophils, two bands, 11 lymphocytes, one
monocyte, one eosinophil.  INR 1.1, PTT of 26.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 70 year old female with prior history
of refractory hypertension who presents with a four day
history of dyspnea and evidence of [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure on
examination with enzymes, consistent with myocardial injury
in the setting of likely multi-lobar pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Cardiovascular:  It was thought that she was in
congestive heart failure, likely biventricular heart failure
with evidence of pulmonary edema and peripheral edema.  She
likely had a myocardial event which led to this acute
exacerbation of her heart failure.  When she was initially
brought to the Cardiac Care Unit, she actually had blood
pressure control with continuation of her Clonidine.  She
also had a low dose of beta blocker started with 12.5 mg
p.o., twice a day.  She was also placed on Lasix for
aggressive diuresis.  She was started on intravenous Lasix on
as needed basis with 40 mg intravenously periodically given.
There was concern with her troponin greater than 50 that she
had a myocardial infarction.  However, her MB index was only
3.  She was also initially started on aspirin.

On the second day of admission, it was decided to send the
patient to catheterization.  Besides the aspirin, beta
blocker and Lasix, the patient was also started on heparin.
She was also on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She responded well to
the furosemide and was more comfortable from a respiratory
perspective.  On the second day of admission, she had a
cardiac catheterization done in the setting of congestive
heart failure, elevated troponin and EKG changes suggestive
of ischemia.

Prior to catheterization, she was found to be hypertensive
with a systolic blood pressure up to 200.  Her Nitroglycerin
drip was increased to 200 micrograms per minute.  Hydralazine
was also given.  She was given Metoprolol 10 mg intravenous
and 50 mg p.o.

Cardiac catheterization results were as follows:  Right
atrial pressure was 25 mean, right ventricular pressure was
58/20; pulmonary artery pressure was 58/31; capillary wedge
pressure was 40.  Her pressure was 173/76.  She had elevated
right sided and left sided pressures.  In terms of her
coronary arteries, she had a right dominant system with a
short and normal left main.  Her left anterior descending
artery showed minimal irregularities with 60% ostial stenosis
at the first diagonal.  The left circumflex showed 70% ostial
and proximal obtuse marginal 1 stenosis.  Her distal obtuse
marginal 2 had an 80% stenosis.  Right coronary artery showed
80% mid-ulcerated lesion and 70% stenosis at the posterior
descending artery.

She had evidence of three vessel disease, however, because
she had a fever up to 101.0 F., in the catheterization
laboratory, no intervention was done in the catheterization
laboratory, secondary to concerns for a possible stent
infection.  The plan was to have her return when her fevers
and infection subsided.  It was thought that she had a
bilobar pneumonia.  Consequently, intervention w
