HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old with
severe pulmonary hypertension with congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease on 4 liters of home oxygen here with
altered mental status.  Over the last few months she had been
doing steadily worse, more dyspneic with exertion, and
limited activity.  Was seen by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-24**] for
worsening and put on seven days of levofloxacin and a steroid
taper, as well as having her oxygen increased.

She reports feeling better, though not quite back to feeling
well.  She had never been on oral steroids before.  In the
past few days, her symptoms have been stable.  She was seen
by her doctor two days ago and she was brought to Pulmonary
Rehabilitation appointment and was okay.  On that
appointment, her oxygen was increased to 5 liters.  The next
day she was more sleepy.  The doctor did not call her because
she was supposed to go out to lunch in the afternoon.  When
she called in the evening, she was very sleepy.

The patient reports feeling confused without remembering much
of what was happening in the past few days, unsure if she was
taking the right number of pills, and not eating.  On
baseline, she self disimpacts her rectum and last did this a
few days ago noting some fecal incontinence.  She also
reports worsening shortness of breath.  She had a cough that
has been dry.  Her weight has been fluctuating a great deal
from 107 to 117, though on a higher side recently 6 pound
weight gain to 124 and worsened lower extremity edema.  The
left side is greater than the right which always decays when
she has more edema.

She denies chest pain, sinus symptoms, hemoptysis, no
weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, although she has
been uncomfortable from constipation.  In the Emergency
Department, she had a respiratory rate of 4 and oxygen
saturation of 85% on 5 liters.  Narcan 0.3 mg was given with
immediate awakening, and then confusion, dry mouth, and
dysarthria which resolved.  A total of 0.5 mg of Narcan was
given, and the initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly,
bilateral pleural effusions.  Blood pressure dropped until 5
pm it was 69 systolic.  She was given 500 cc of normal saline
and responded to 80-95 systolic.

She was started on a stress dose of steroids, right lower
lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray.  Was treated with Levaquin.

continued.
10. Urinary retention resolved after pessary placement,
baseline decrease in lower extremity sensation left greater
than right.  Perianal sensation, abnormal bowel movements
requiring disimpaction.
11. Left cataract.
12. Osteoporosis.

to drink a few glasses of alcohol, cut has cut back recently.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a history of lymphoma.  Her
father with a myocardial infarction at an unknown age.
Sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer at age 66.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 96.5, pulse is
75, blood pressure 106/68, respiratory rate of 24, sat 85
which decreased to the 70s and increased to 90's with deep
breathes on a Ventimask at 5 liters.  In general, she is
fatigued appearing, thin-elderly woman in no apparent
distress.  Her pupils were reactive bilaterally.  Irregular
and small on the left.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  The
neck was supple.  There was jugular venous distention sitting
at 60 degrees.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1,
S2 prominent, P2 [**12-26**] blowing systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  Decreased breath sounds throughout, no
wheezes.  Abdomen had positive bowel sounds with diffusely
mildly tender and distended.  Rectal was guaiac negative in
the Emergency Department.  Extremity examination showed 3+
left and 3+ right lower extremity pitting edema up to the
thighs.  Neurologic examination:  She was alert and oriented
times three.  She could give the days of the week forwards
and backwards.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout with downgoing
toes.  Strength was [**3-24**] in the upper extremities bilaterally.
Some decreased sensation in the left lower extremity to light
touch, positive asterixis.

LABORATORIES:  On admission, white count 9.4, hemoglobin of
12.7, hematocrit of 38.2, platelets of 272.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Glucose 125, BUN 46, creatinine 2.1, which is
significantly up from her baseline normal creatinine.  Sodium

the Emergency Room showed a pO2 of 76, pCO2 of 71, pH of
7.25, and a total CO2 of 33.

She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pulmonary:  Patient's initial hypercarbic respiratory
failure was likely due to Narcan overdose of narcotics.
There was a question of infiltrate on her initial chest x-ray
consistent with pneumonia, and in addition her history of
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease along with new
abdominal distention and oxygen retention from her increased
O2 likely cause of altered mental status and worsened
pulmonary status.

She was continued on oxygen, given a stress dose of steroids
at that time.

2. Cardiology:  She was ruled out for myocardial infarction.

3. Renal:  Acute renal failure improved rapidly during her
stay, etiology unknown.

4. Gastrointestinal:  Abdominal CT scan was obtained given
the history and increased LFTs.  CT scan of the abdomen
showed a significant ascites, multiple hepatic lesions
consistent with metastatic cancer, a right adrenal mass
thought to be an adenoma, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy,
and bilateral pleural effusions.  Patient is thought to have
metastatic disease from an unknown primary, however, her
uterine cancer was the most likely source.

She had a paracentesis while in-house, which 1 liter of fluid
was removed, however, it was difficult to continue removal of
fluid given that it was in multiple pockets in the abdomen.

5. FEN:  The patient had hyponatremia likely secondary to
ascites and heart failure.  She was continued on salt
restriction and diuresed.

Code status was discussed.  The patient is DNR/DNI, wants
comfort only.  Her pain was controlled with Morphine as
needed by a drip and then converted to IV boluses of Morphine
and a Duragesic patch.
