Date of Birth:   [**2062-9-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL ICU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old female
who was admitted as a transfer for respiratory failure.  She
was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**] Psychiatric
Unit on [**2125-2-8**] for depression with psychotic
features and suicidal ideation.  The patient had been
reportedly threatening to hand herself.  She was transferred
to the Medical Unit at the [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2125-2-22**]
for an episode of chest pain and dyspnea.

She was ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  She had a negative
stress thallium and negative transthoracic echocardiogram.
Chest x-ray at that time showed mild CHF and bibasilar
infiltrates.  She was sent back to the Psychiatric Unit
between [**2125-2-24**] and [**2125-2-27**] when she
became increasing dyspneic and had a decreasing oxygen
saturation.

Her chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.  She
was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and given
low-dose Lasix with good effect.

On the night of [**2125-2-27**], the patient had acutely
worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress requiring 100%
nonrebreather mask.  A V/Q scan showed low probability for
pulmonary embolism and chest x-ray showed increase in the
bilateral consolidations.

She was transferred to the ICU and was intubated at 3:00 p.m.
on [**2125-3-1**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Chest CT was performed and was read as diffuse consolidation
of the lungs consistent with pulmonary edema with multiple
bilateral air bronchograms.  There were bilateral pleural
effusions.

Shortly after intubation, the patient's blood pressure
dropped and her urine output fell off.  Dopamine was started
and she became anuric.  She went into rapid atrial
fibrillation on [**2125-3-1**] and was loaded with
digoxin.  She converted to normal sinus rhythm.

She was transferred on [**2125-3-2**] for a question of
ARDS and persistent hypoxemia with hypotension and anuria.

2.  Intravenous drug use.
3.  Ethanol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died in childbirth.  The patient's
father apparently died at greater than [**Age over 90 **] years old.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Spanish-speaking only.  Widowed.  Lives in
[**Hospital1 487**].  She has four children, two sons and two daughters.
Smoking:  One pack per day of tobacco.  Occasionally smokes
crack cocaine, last on [**2125-2-5**].  Intravenous drug
use by history but last used 27 years ago.  Uses marijuana
weekly.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.8, blood pressure 73/42 by the arterial line and 103/37 by
blood pressure cuff, heart rate regular at 111 beats per
minute.  Respiratory:  Mechanically ventilated on AC mode 700
cc, 22 breaths per minute, FI02 100%, PEEP 15, saturation
100%.  General:  She was obese, unresponsive and intubated,
heavily sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light.  No scleral icterus.  Mucous membranes moist.
Macroglossia.  Edentulous.  Chemosis.  Neck:  No appreciable
JVD, obese neck.  No bruits or thyromegaly.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, normal S1,
S2, distant, no murmurs or extra heart sounds heard.
Pulmonary:  Diffuse fine crackles and rhonchi with tubular
vented breath sounds, bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen:  Obese,
soft, decreased bowel sounds, no appreciable
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  There was 1+ palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses, 1+ lower extremity edema.  The
extremities were warm.  Skin:  No diaphoresis.  No rash.
Neurologic:  Unresponsive to pain.  No spontaneous movement.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ARRIVAL:  CBC:  White count 4.8,
differential 91% polys, 0 bands, 4% lymphocytes, 5%
monocytes.  Smear was normal.  ANC 4,760, hematocrit 26,
platelets 44,000.  INR 1.4, PT 14.3, PTT 29.3.  Sodium 135,
potassium 3.6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, BUN 41,
creatinine 3.1, glucose 88, calcium 6.9, magnesium 1.9,
phosphate 5.2.  Vancomycin level 15.  FDP 0-10, D-dimer
500-1,000.  Fibrinogen 353.  ALT 26, AST 64, LDH fasting at
36, albumin 2.4, alkaline phosphatase 77, total bilirubin
0.6, amylase 414, lipase 70.  Iron 10, TIBC 300.  ABG
revealed a pH of 7.34, PC02 46, P02 187.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 87 with early R wave
progression, axis 0 degrees, normal intervals, no ST changes,
no Q waves.  This EKG was performed at the outside hospital.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 62-year-old female with a history of
intravenous drug use, pancytopenia, psychiatric disorder,
hepatitis C virus, presenting from the outside hospital with
hypoxemic respiratory failure most consistent with ARDS and
sepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The etiology of the patient's ARDS and
sepsis were investigated and no definitive source was ever
identified.  Cultures were all negative.  Question of
vasculitis was raised but rheumatologic workup was negative.
In terms of her respiratory status, she improved very little
over the course of the first week of her admission.
Paralysis and proning was attempted with mild to moderate
improvement in her oxygenation.  Upon reversal of the
paralysis and repositioning supine, the patient gradually
worsened over the next several days.

She became increasingly difficult to oxygenate and the FI02,
although weaned as low as 0.6, had to be increased back to
1.0 for the last week of her hospital stay.  She remained on
broad spectrum antibiotics.  Her blood pressure control
worsened and more pressors had to be added to the point where
by [**2125-3-16**] she was on maximum dopamine, Levophed and
Vasopressin.  She as re-paralyzed and re-proned but this had
no significant benefit.

She became anuric and the Renal Service was consulted to
perform CVHD which was done beginning [**2125-3-15**].  Her glycemic
control was managed with an insulin drip.  She continued on
her antipsychotic medication.  Her pancytopenia was felt to
be secondary to hepatitis C.

Due to the patient's multiorgan system failure (liver, renal,
pulmonary).  A family meeting was held on [**2125-3-17**] and
given the extremely poor prognosis, the family made the
decision to withdrawal care. This was done and the patient
died peacefully on [**2125-3-17**].
