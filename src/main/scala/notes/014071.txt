HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 30864**] is a 29-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for significant asthma
requiring four intubations, bipolar disorder, and intravenous
drug abuse (on methadone) who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] on her usual state of health until the
date of admission when she was found by Emergency Medical Service
to be lethargic and nodding off on the street.  She was
unresponsive until she received one mg of Narcan and 100%
nonrebreather. The patient reports taking her albuterol meter-
dosed inhaler one day prior to admission as well as on the date
of admission without effect and her usual dose of methadone.

While in the Emergency Department, she received a further dose of
Narcan, as well as 120 mg of Solu-Medrol, magnesium sulfate, and
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Oxygen saturations were
maintained at 100% on 100% nonrebreather. She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for further evaluation of her
asthma exacerbation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma requiring intubations times four.
2.  Bipolar disorder.
3.  Intravenous drug abuse, on methadone.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were Neurontin,
albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, Atrovent meter-dosed inhaler,
Seroquel, and methadone.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies are RISPERDAL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A history of intravenous drug use; she
denies current use.  She lives with her mother.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  She was afebrile,
heart rate of 106, blood pressure of 123/76, respiratory rate
of 32, oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% nonrebreather.  In
general, she was tachypneic, uncomfortable-appearing, white
female in obvious respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat showed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils
were equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Pulmonary examination showed diffuse wheezing,
rhonchi audible without stethoscope.  Stridor was obvious.
Cardiovascular examination revealed she was tachycardic and
with muffled heart sounds (difficult to appreciate heart
sounds secondary to loud breathing).  Her abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, obese, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities showed 2+ pulses in the upper and lower
extremities.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Good capillary
refill.  Neurologic examination showed somnolent, but capable
of answering questions, alert and oriented times three;
otherwise intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 9.3, hematocrit of 35.5,
platelets of 264 (70% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 5%
monocytes, 6 eosinophils).  INR of 1, PTT of 27.8.  Sodium
of 138, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 32,
blood urea nitrogen of 6, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 105.
Human chorionic gonadotropin negative.  Toxicology screen was
negative for aspirin, alcohol, Tylenol, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, tricyclics.  Patchy opacities bilaterally,
atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:   A 29-year-old female who was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for asthma
exacerbation.  She was initially maintained on 100%
nonrebreather as well as albuterol and Atrovent and was given
intravenous Solu-Medrol.

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient received albuterol and Atrovent
meter-dosed inhalers and intravenous Solu-Medrol 80 q.8h.

On her first hospital day she was intubated overnight with
arterial blood gases showing increased CO2.  On the second
Medical Intensive Care Unit day, the patient was extubated at 11
a.m.   Post extubation arterial blood gas was 7.38/45/136.  The
patient's respiratory status remained tenuous for several days.
On the fourth hospital day, she was still requiring almost
contiunous nebulizers.

On the fifth hospital day the patient was transferred to the
floor given her stabilized respiratory status.  At this point,
she continued to be maintained on a Solu-Medrol taper as well as
albuterol, Flovent, Atrovent meter-dosed inhalers, and Singulair.
During this time, her sputum culture grew out Staphylococcus
aureus sensitive to levofloxacin.  The patient was started on a
course of levofloxacin.  On [**12-1**] (which was the fifth
hospital day), the patient had previously been treated with
zithromycin and vancomycin, but these were discontinued on that
day ([**12-1**]).

On the seventh hospital day ([**12-3**]), the patient's peak
flow was 300 which was at her baseline.  The patient was
discharged on albuterol and Atrovent meter-dosed inhaler, Solu-
Medrol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d. as well as Singulair
and Flovent 220 2 puffs b.i.d.  She was also given a nebulizer
machine which she had lost.

2.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient with a history of substance abuse
and bipolar disorder and was maintained on Serzone, Seroquel and
methadone while in the hospital.  She was followed by the
psychiatric team who recommended increasing her Serzone while she
was here.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was found to have a decreased
thyroid-stimulating hormone, T3, and free T4, as well as
irregular menses, and occasional blurry vision.  A prolactin
level was checked and was found to be mildly elevated at 27.  An
magnetic resonance imaging of the sella showed significant
narrowing in the left parietal cortex suspicious for ischemic
changes, two tiny depressions in sellar four suggestive of
adenoma, but no definite adenoma seen.  The patient's primary
care physician was made aware of this and will follow up with
her as an outpatient.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prednisone taper.
2.  Methadone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Flovent 220-mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.
4.  Singulair.
5.  Solu-Medrol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.
6.  Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Serzone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (day [**4-27**]).

She was discharged with a nebulizer machine as well as a peak
flow meter and told to follow her peak flow, to keep it between
300 and 350.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to home
with primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe asthma.
2.  Bipolar disorder.
3.  Opiate addiction.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Question of panhypopituitarism.
