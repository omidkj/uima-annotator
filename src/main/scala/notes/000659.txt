Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall and increased weight gain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-7-12**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2120-7-14**] Pulmonary arterial catheterization
[**2120-7-14**] Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion
[**2120-7-15**] Dialysis catheter placement
[**2120-7-15**] Arterial line placement
[**2120-7-17**] Intra-aortic balloon pump re-insertion

History of Present Illness:
68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post
cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs since then presenting on the [**7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status resulting in
a fall at home. In the ED he had a possible seizure with
dilantin loading. He became hypotensive after that and went to
MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for several days
working up neurologic issues and falls. Then the patient began
having chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis. Cath showed severe
native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA. RHC showed elevated
wedge at 30mmHg. RA pressures 25 and PAP 73. CI 1.5. Then
transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.
.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix given last night and this
morning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg IV lasix
and metolazone and lasix gtt. Team is concerned for poor forward
flow given LFTs have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, INR
>2, and only 600mL UOP with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday.
.
At this point, he was transferred to the HF service and admitted
to the CCU for inotropes, swan, and lasix drip. If
non-responsive to this will need IABP.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears somewhat lethargic and
uncomfortable but is conversant.  He endorses discomfort around
his foley site but denies cough, chest pain, sob, abdominal
symptoms, fevers/chills.

STUDIES:
[**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process
[**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or
malalignment
[**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again
noted.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with probable
basilar atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Heart size is
top
normal.  No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural
effusions with basilar atelectasis.
[**2120-7-6**] CT Abd/Pelvis-IMPRESSION: 1.  Nonspecific mesenteric
stranding and small amount of fluid in the abdomen could be
secondary to generalized third spacing. 2.  Chronic loculated
left sided pleural fluid collection/chronic empyema is stable.
3.  Gallstones and sludge within the gallbladder.
[**2120-7-8**] EEG- This is an abnormal waking EEG because of diffuse
polymorphic arrhythmic theta and delta activity. This background
activity improves to theta range activity on stimulation. These
findings are suggestive of moderate encephalopathy but of
nonspecific cause. There are no epileptiform discharges or focal
abnormalities seen.
[**2120-7-10**] MRI Head w and w/o contrast- 1.  No acute intracranial
abnormality. 2.  No pathologic focus of enhancement or anatomic
substrate for seizure. 3.  Relatively mild global atrophy.
4.  Chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses;
correlate clinically.
.
[**2120-7-11**] Portable TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex; the rest of the
left ventricle appears hypokinetic with regional variation. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-19**], left ventricular
systolic function is significantly further compromised.
.
[**2120-7-12**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel
disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent
with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA
stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was
unchanged from prior. The LAD had diffuse severe disease
proximally and occludes at the mid vessel after a tiny diagonal
branch. The Cx had diffuse disease throughout with serial focal
50% stenoses. The RCA had an ostial 80% stenosis which was
heavily calcified. There was also an 80% heavily calcified 80%
stenosis in the mid RCA. Diffuse mild to moderate disease was
seen throughout the rest of the RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 24 mmHg and an LVEDP of
26 mmHg. There was pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of
73/35 mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed at 1.55 L/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 120/73 mmHg. Upon careful
pullback of a pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta no
pressure gradient was seen.
3. Arterial conduit angio
