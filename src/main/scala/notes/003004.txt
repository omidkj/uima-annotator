Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-8-31**] Mitral valve replacement utilizing [**Street Address(2) 11599**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
porcine valve. Maze procedure utilizing radio frequency
ablation. Ligation of left atrial appendage.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old female with history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy and atrial flutter. She was recently admitted to
[**Hospital3 35813**] Center on [**2130-8-14**] with congestive heart failure
and hypotension. Workup revealed severe mitral regurgitation and
severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection
fraction of 30%. Her coronary arteries were angiographically
normal. Based on the above results, she was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for operative care.

Past Medical History:
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, Hypertension, Atrial flutter with
history of failed ablation, s/p PPM/AICD placement, Chronic
anemia, Osteoporosis with multiple lumbar compression fractures,
History of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, Spinal stenosis with chronic
low back pain, History of seizures, History of herpetic
neuralgia, s/p chole, s/p appendectomy

Social History:
No history of tobacco or ETOH. Lives with sister-in-law.

Family History:
Son diagnosed with coronary artery disease in his 40's.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent further preoperative
evaluation which included a repeat echocardiogram. This was
notable for 3+ mitral regurgitation with moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. The overall left ventricular systolic
function was mildly depressed but compared to previous studies,
her ejection fraction had improved to 50%. There was moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Her left atrium was
dilated. She had a normal aortic root and her aortic valves were
mildly thickened with only 1+ aortic insufficiency. Workup was
otherwise unremarkable and she was eventually cleared for
surgery. She remained stable on medical therapy. Antibiotics
were started for her preoperative urinary tract infection -
cutlture grew out E. coli sensitive to Bactrim and Ancef.

On [**8-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve
replacement([**Street Address(2) 11599**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve) and MAZE procedure.
Surgery was uneventful. The intraoperative TEE showed no mitral
regurgitation with an ejection fraction around 35-40%. After the
operation, she was brought to the CSRU in stable condition. She
initially required multiple blood products for an anemia and a
postoperative coagulopathy. She concomitantly experienced a
transient increasing pressor requirement which prompted a TEE
which found no evidence of cardiac tamponade. Over the next 48
hours, she successfully weaned from inotropic support and was
extubated without difficulty. Amiodarone was eventually started
given her history of atrial fibrillation/flutter as well as
Warfarin for her porcine mitral valve replacement. She
maintained stable hemodynamcis and adequate urine output. She
was intermittently transfused with additional packed red blood
cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%.

Postop, she continued to experience a persistent leukocystosis.
All lines were changed and pan cultures were obtained. Her white
count peaked to 25K on POD#3. All cultures remained negative. On
POD#4, she transferred to the SDU. There medical therapy was
optimized. She required additional diuresis. By discharge, chest
x-ray was notable for improving pleural effusions. Amiodarone
was titrated and Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 -
2.5. By discharge, her white count improved to 11K. She remained
afebrile. At discharge, she was tolerating 1L nasal cannula with
oxygen saturations of 95%.
