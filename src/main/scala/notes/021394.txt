Service: ORTHOPAEDICS

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1350**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain, lower extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C7-T PSIF with iliac crest bone graft


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 y.o.f. with a recent diagnosis of
metastatic breast cancer who presents with worsening back pain
and LE weakness.  She has had progressive worsening of her pain
over the last several weeks, as well as LE weakness, but this
seems to have worsened over the last 3 days in conjuction with
being incontinent x 2 in the last 2 days.  The incontinence
occurred when going from sitting to standing both times (one
time associated with being hugged by her grandchild) and she has
not had incontinence at rest.  She has also had increased LE
edema due to steroids and wonders if this has hampered her
mobility and feelings of worsening weakness.  Additionally, her
increasing pain is limiting her mobility and may be contributing
to the subjective sense of weakness in her LE's, although she
does feel that her worsened weakness is not solely due to pain.
Her pain is located in her lower back and radiates around to her
groin on both sides and down her anterior thigh, right > left.
Also with sharp shooting pain into bilateral hips.  She was
initially only taking vicodin QHS, but over the last couple of
days she increased the frequency to every 4 hours and was still
not getting good relief.  She feels more fatigued since her
radiation therapy ([**Date range (1) 83909**]) and does not believe that
radiation helped her pain or weakness.
.
In the ED her VSS except for mild tachycardia to 104.  She was
given morphine 2 mg IV x 4, dexamethasone 4 mg x 1, and a
vicodin.  Because the vicodin did not improve her pain and she
continued to require IV medications, she was admitted for pain
control.
.
ROS: no HA, occ blurry vision, + nasal congestion, no cough,
fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, constipation,
hematochezia, melena, loss of sensation, myalgias, arthralgias,
or dysuria.  incontinence in setting of increased abdominal
pressure x 2, + hesitancy.  + lower abd discomfort (pinpoint).

During this hospital admission the patient was taken to surgery
with the orthopedics spine team and underwent a C7-T4 PSIF with
iliac crest bone graft.


Past Medical History:
Onc history:
Metastatic breast cancer - Initial symptoms of lower back pain
and leg weakness.  PCP recommended PT, but chiropractor obtained
spine films that were abnormal and she was referred back to PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].  On [**2109-11-15**] she had lumbar MRI which was significant
for multiple abnormalities including infiltration of L4
resulting in a
compression fracture with retropulsion of fragments and
moderately severe spinal stenosis, and infiltration of T11 with
associated deformity of the right lateral aspect of the spinal
cord. On [**2109-11-20**] she had a core biopsy of L4 vertebra;
malignant cells consistent with metastatic breast cancer. On
[**2109-11-20**] she also had body CT significant for widespread
skeletal metastases, a 3cm left breast mass, and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Most notably, she had multilevel vertebral
involvement including T2, T11, T7 and L4 with the suggestion of
spinal cord involvement at T2 and T11.  She underwent left
breast core biopsy on [**2109-11-28**]; grade 3 IDC, ER/PR+, HER2
equivocal by IHC and non-amplified by FISH. Of note, she had a
normal bilateral screening [**Last Name (un) 3907**] in [**12-17**] (BIRADS 1).  She moved
from
[**State 3908**] in late [**Month (only) **] to live with her son.

compression or significant retropulsion.

soft tissue masses on the left at T6 and on the right at T11
appears similar to the outside examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a lovely 63-year old woman with newly diagnosed
metastatic breast cancer to bone and vertebral bodies causing
retropulsin and spinal canal narrowing who presents with
worsening lower back pain and LE weakness.
.
# Pain/weakness: The patient reported alternating left, then
right lower extremity weakness. MRI revealed multiple
compression fractures, as above. Upon arrival to the floor, she
initally had slightly decreased strength with right hip flexion.
By the day prior to discharge, the patient's lower extremity
strength was symmetric and [**5-14**] in all muscle groups. She was
evaluated by ortho spine, who fitted her for a TLSO brace and
[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar which she is to wear when out of bed. She also
complained of lower back pain, which she had been treating at
home with PRN vicodin and muscle relaxants. She was started on a
long-acting narcotic, with PRN morphine for breakthrough pain,
with excellent effect. At the time of discharge, orthopedic
surgery is considering surgical decompression after a few more
weeks pass, as her risk of wound healing complications will be
lower after some time passes from radiation treatment. She will
follow up with orthope
