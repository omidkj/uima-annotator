History of Present Illness:
(History obtained from charts, son, and telephone discussion
with transferring physician). Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old
woman with MMP including CAD ( s/p 4V CABG [**6-/2112**], s/p PCI [**2114**]),
CHF EF 25%, PVD who intiially presented to an OSH on [**2121-7-26**]
with chest tightness and shortness of breath that began earlier
that day. Patient ruled out with 3 sets cardiac enzymes, no EKG
changes, and stress test revealed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, no
reversible defects. 2 nights prior to transfer, patient felt
unwell and experienced a low-grade fever, chills with T 99.5.
Patient with recent history of urinary retention with recurrent
UTIs, had been on Macrobid as outpatient which was held on
admission, and this was re-started at treatment dose by the
covering MD. The following morning ~6AM, patient was found
unresponsive. Moonlighter noted patient's eyes to be "rolling
around" and patient appeared "rigid" on examination, and was
concerned about seizure, so administered 2mg Ativan and
Phenobarbital 500mg IV. Around this time, patient had
temperature spike to 103, other VSS (had pulse, BP, and was
breathing during unresponsive episode). Patient had an emergent
CT scan which did not reveal bleed, but showed evidence of prior
infarctions. She was admitted to the ICU, where she was found to
have labored breathing and was intubated. She received an LP
which showed 1 WBC, 0 RBC, Glu 75, TP 32. She was started
empirically on Vanc/Ceftriaxone. ID was consulted, and
doxycycline was added for possible [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9880**] Spotted Fever.
Patient continued to spike temperatures, but no localizing
source of infection could be found - no rashes, no diarrhea, no
cough, no sputum, LP negative. She received a neck, chest,
abdomen, and pelvis CT which were reportedly unremarkable. Given
persistence of fever this morning (101), patient is being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and management;
specifically, team at OSH felt that patient may benefit from
MRI, which they are unable to do with intubated patients.
Patient has not received any sedation while intubated after
initial Propofol.

.
MRI BRAIn: 1. Extensive acute innumerable infarcts involving
bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and a single focus
of acute infarct in the right side of the pons. This could most
likely represent embolic or septic in origin and needs clinical
correlation. The largest acute infarct noted is located in the
left MCA territory, involving most of the left MCA territory. 2.
Faint visualization of the left MCA-M1 segment and the
bifurcation. The M2, M3, and M4 segments are not definitely
visualized. This could most likely represent thromboembolic
occlusion. 3. Tiny foci of susceptibility, scattered in the
brain parenchyma could represent foci of hemorrhage versus
calcification.
.
EEG: Abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage asymmetry and
background slowing and disorganization described above. The
lower
voltage background over the left hemisphere suggests material
interposed
between the recording electrodes and cortical surface (e.g.
subdural
fluid), or a widespread cortical dysfunction. The background
suggests a
widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and
infection are among the most common causes. There were no
epileptiform
features.
.
ECHO: No vegetations or abscess seen. Dilated left ventricle
with severe regional systolic dysfunction. Mild right
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 1258**] [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old woman with CAD s/p 4V
CABG, CHF (EF 25%), PVD, who was intubated at OSH for
respiratory distress, transferred here for further work-up and
management of persistent mental status changes and fever. The
following issues were addressed during her MICU course:
.
# AMS
Patient with new acute decompensation in mental status, arrived
in comatose state without need for sedation. Toes were upgoing
bilaterally on Babinski, and patient withdrew only to deep
noxious stimuli. LP negative at OSH. Head CT negative for acute
changes at OSH. Given concern for central process, emergent head
MRI was obtained which showed large MCA stroke with several
small bilateral acute CVAs, likely embolic. SBP was maintained >
120 with intermittent use of pressors to maintain cerebral
perfusion. Neurology stroke service was consulted, prognosis was
poor given territory of involvement. Patient was not
anti-coagulated given risk for hemorrhagic conversion. To
evaluate etiology of embolic CVA, LENIs were done and returned
negative for DVT. TTE was done which showed no vegetations or
abscess. Given depressed LOC, EEG was done to rule out
non-convulsive status, which showed widespread encephalopathy.
In light of these findings, discussion was held between ICU and
family regarding goals of care, and it was decided to pursue
comfort care. Patient was extubated.
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
Patient with altered level of consciousness requiring mechanical
ventilation, unable to generate spontaneous breaths. CXR
unremarkable for infiltrate or effusion on admission. As above,
given prognosis, decision was made for comfort care, and patient
was extubated.
.
# FEVER
Patient received full fever work-up including CXR, UA, Blood Cx.
Patient with leukocytosis and left shift. Patient was continued
empirically on Vancomycin for gram + coverage given embolic
source of CVAs. 2/2 Blood cultures at
