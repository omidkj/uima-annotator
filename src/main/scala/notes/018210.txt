Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis/septic arthritis/ NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
78 yo female with h/o HTN, Type II DM, CAD s/p remote LAD stent,
COPD, and recent right total knee replacement complicated by
infected hardware s/p removal transferred from OSH for further
management of hemoptysis and NSTEMI.

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in late [**Month (only) **] with
right knee septic arthritis following a right total knee
replacement, cultures grew Group B Strep.  Hardware was removed
at [**Hospital 1562**] hospital on [**2184-12-17**], replaced by antibiotic spacer.
 Per report, the patient had bilateral DVTs on [**2184-12-15**], noted
again on LENIs from [**2185-1-1**].  At this time, it appears the
patient was on prophylactic dose of enoxaparin.  Patient was
then discharged to rehab following hardware removal.  Per
report, she developed respiratory distress on [**2185-1-1**], with
hypoxia and wheezing.  No aspiration event was witnessed.  There
was a question of excess sedation.  After being re-admitted to
[**Hospital 1562**] hospital, she was initially treated with BiPAP and
nebulizers, with good effect.  IV fluids were given for
hypotension and tachycardia.  She had a second episode of
respiratory distress, and was transferred to the ICU for further
management.  She then underwent diuresis, and was placed on
BiPAP.  She was intubated on [**2185-1-3**].  A Swan-Ganz catheter was
placed on [**2185-1-4**] for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of
possible cardiogenic shock. She was then started on levofloxacin
and clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia, and was transitioned
to vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.  She also received
pulse dose methylprednisolone for possible COPD exacerbation.
Over past few days, vent wean has been complicated by low minute
ventilation and airway secretions.

Today, patient had episode of hemoptysis, with 50-100 cc of
bright red blood suctioned through ET tube.  Bronch showed
lesions in left main stem bronch near second carina, one
suspicious for an eroding broncholith.  A bleeding lesion was
injected with epinephrine and iced saline, with hemostasis.
Patient was then transferred via [**Location (un) 7622**] directly to ICU for
further management.

Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated, alert, on
minimial sedation.  She complained of pain in her right knee,
and denied any other pain.

Imaging:
CXR [**1-7**]:
FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3.5 cm above the
carina. There is a right IJ central venous catheter with distal
lead tip in the proximal SVC. There is a nasogastric tube whose
tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is a left IJ and
subclavian central lumen catheters with the distal lead tip in
the mid SVC. There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
markings, compatible with fluid overload. There is left
retrocardiac opacity and a small left-sided pleural effusion.
