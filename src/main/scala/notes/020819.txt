for CAP vs COPD exacerbation ([**Date range (1) 8946**]) treated with 7d
levofloxacin and 10d prednisone, representing w increasing SOB.
Patient reports that since discharge she has not returned to her
baseline respiratory status, and two days prior to admission,
she developed worsening cough with yellow sputum.  Symptoms were
not asssociated with fevers/chills, chest pain, N/V/D.  Of note,

PNA.  EKG demonstrated afib w ventricular rate 139, without
ST/Twave changes.  Patient was given combivent with good effect
and was rapidly weaned to room air, satting 90-95%, although she

CXR [**2-8**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP portable frontal view of the chest was
obtained. Again
seen is asymmetry and volume loss and opacification of the right
hemithorax.
Postoperative changes of the right hemithorax are noted. Right
hemithorax
opacification again likely represents combination of radiation
changes and
volume loss. Given differences in patient position, there
appears to be
slight decrease in the opacification of the r
