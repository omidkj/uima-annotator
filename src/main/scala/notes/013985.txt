Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1232**]
Chief Complaint:
64F had Right Nx 4 yr ago at OSH (Clear cell RCC), now 3.1cm
Left upper pole renal mass concerning for RCC. Baseline Cr
1.5-1.7.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left partial nephrectomy


History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 64 y/o F with history of renal cell carcinoma s/p
right nephrectomy in [**2108**], subsequent CKD (b/l creatinine 1.6),
hypertension and hyperlipidemia, with routine follow-up
demonstrating a new mass in upper pole of left kidney, admitted
on [**6-4**] for partial left nephrectomy, with post-operative course
complicated by significant hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary
emboli. She has had persistently high supplemental oxygen
requirements on the floor, and is being transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring.
.
During her surgery on [**6-4**], she had an episode of
intra-operative SVT. She had a chest tube and nasogastric tube
placed, which have since been discontinued. She still has a JP
drain in place at her surgical site. Surgical EBL was 300 cc.
She was given 2700 cc of IVF during the surgery. Last evening,
she underwent CTA showing bilateral PE without evidence of right
heart strain, but with hypoperfused pulmonary parenchyma in her
left lower lobe, concerning for early parenchymal infarction vs
infectious infiltrate. She was started on a heparin gtt, which
has not yet reached a therapeutic level.
.
On the floor, she reports that she currently does not feel
particularly dyspneic at rest, but she feels significantly short
of breath with minimal movement, including reaching to her tray
to eat. She denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, leg pain, numbness/tingling, or pain at
her surgical site. She has a good appetite, and denies nausea or
vomiting.

WdWn woman in NAD, AVSS although maintained on nasal canula
oxygen support at 2-litres with saturations 90% ++.
Abdomen soft, supple, benign.
Incision line is c/d/i with well approximated wound edges and
surgical skin clips. No evidence of hematoma, dehisence or
infection. Chest tube site suture has been removed and drain
site dressing has been taken down.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU BHC: 64 y/o F with hx RCC s/p remote right nephrectomy, now
4 days post-op from left partial nephrectomy, with bilateral
pulmonary emboli and significant hypoxia.
# Hypoxia/Pulmonary embolism: CTA revealed clot burden in
majority of pulmonary vasculature. Hemodynamically stable but
has evidence of right heart strain on ECG; troponin negative.
Significant A-a gradient on ABG. Started on heparin drip. Per
primary surgery team, pt not a candidate for thrombolysis given
recent surgery. Lower extremity ultrasound to evaluate for DVT
was negative. Patient maintained O2 sats >90% on supplemental
oxygen. Plan to bridge to warfarin, preferred over enoxaparin
given possibly worsening renal function s/p surgery and IV
contrast.
# Renal cell carcinoma s/p resection: No major surgical
complications or blood loss. Creatinine stable post-operatively.
Pathology consistent with clear cell RCC. Maintained on pain
meds per urology service.
# Anemia: Low-normal MCV with significant hct drop 36 -> 31 in
setting of recently starting heparin gtt and surgery on highly
vascular organ. No ecchymoses at surgical site or significant
hematuria to suggest active bleeding, and blood pressure stable.
HCT was monitored every 6 hours and UAs were done to monitor for
hematuria. Throughout her ICU course, he had an active type and
screen and 2 units crossmatched.
# CKD: Post-operative creatinine remaining stable from
pre-operative level, although patient's renal functioning
currently operating on one-half of one kidney. Electrolytes
within normal limits and does not have significant acidosis on
ABG or chemistry panel. Making adequate urine. Did receive IV
contrast for chest imaging (CTA), at risk for CIN. Urine output
was monitored as well at BUN/creat/lytes. She received MIVFs in
setting of recent IV contrast load. THrough her ICU course,
ptient's sCr was stable.
# Hypertension: BP stable. No hemodynamic instability. Her
anti-HTN regmien was continued. AV nodal blocking agents were
avoided to avoid masking tachycardic response to worsening
hypoxia or bleed.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.
# COPD: Not on home oxygen or inhaled therapy. Current hypoxia
felt most directly related to PE. Has respiratory alkalosis on
ABG, without prior pCO2 available for comparison. Continued with
nebs.
# Gastritis/GERD: Continued omeprazole
# Depression/Anxiety: Mood stable. Not on medication.

UROLOGY BHC: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to urology, Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **]
service after undergoing Left partial Nephrectomy.  No adverse
intraoperative events were noted (except Anesthesia noted
paroxysmal SVT intra-op) but please refer to the detailed
operative note. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the PACU and then
transferred to the genral surgical floor where the first
two-three days were unremarkable. On POD1 her chest tube was
removed without difficulty and she was monitored for pain
control and her diet was restricted. Her post-operative course
was complicated by hypoxia due to bilateral pulmonary embolisms
for which she was initially started on a heparin drip and then
transitioned to coumadin. Her course was managed by the
intensive care unit and medicine service as described in OMR and
consult notes. Ultimately she was discharged in stable
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her PCP and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2805**].
