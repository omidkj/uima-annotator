Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
Tx from [**Hospital3 **] with SOB, increased sputum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Interventional pulmonology procedure for trach upsizing

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M with h/o COPD, OSA s/p trach, on home oxygen 10-15L via
NC/trach, CHF, pulm hypertension, afib on coumadin, who
presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital with 3 days of SOB, thick green
sputum production. He also complains of substernal chest pain,
worse with inspiration. He denies orthopnea, has intermittent
swelling of the lower extremities, denies fever, chills, sick
contacts. ON arrival to CCH ER he was satting 93% on 15L, BP
128/78, P 84, RR 22. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] presumably
because his pulmonary records are here. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ER,
his vitals were T 97, P 86, BP 100/57, 94% NRB. He was given
lasix, azitromycin, ceftriaxone, solumedrol and nebs. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given his high o2 requirement. On
arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he looked well but was satting mid to low 90s on
NRB. We placed a trach mask on him to provide some humidified
air. His ABG was 7.27/69/56. His trach was changed so we could
place him on the ventilator for his hypercarbia and concern for
impending hypercarbic resp failure.


Past Medical History:
1. Severe COPD. FEV1 1.45 (53% predicted). Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] in [**Hospital **] Clinic. On home oxygen via high flow NC during

the day (10-15L) and trach mask at night. Home O2 sat reportedly
in
87-90% range.
2. OSA, s/p tracheostomy
3. CHF, EF 40-50% [**2159-6-20**], repeat echo [**3-24**] with EF 50%
4. severe pulmonary hypertension PAP 50-55 mmHg ([**6-23**]), repeat
echo in [**3-24**] shows pulmonary artery pressure to be higher but
was likely underestimated in prior study
5. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creat ~1.2-1.3
6. Atrial fibrillation / flutter on coumadin
7. Morbid obesity
8. H/O supraventricular tachycardia; also h/o episodes of
bradycardia
9. Chronic RBBB
10. History of atrial myxoma s/p resection [**2148**]
11. Gastroesophageal reflux disease
12. PTSD
13. S/P appendectomy
14. S/P cholecystectomy


Social History:
Quit TOB >15 yrs ago (smoked 1.5 ppd x ~40 yrs). Some EtOH with
dinner few times per wk. Lives w/wife.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
T 97.8, HR 80-90, BP 100-124/60-80, RR 20's, 85-90% NRB
Gen: pleasant male, comfortable, not appearing in resp distress
HEENT: JVP difficult to assess, OP clear, trach in place
CV: irregular, heart sounds partially obscured by oxygen flow
Resp: Crackles at bases bilaterally, decreased air movement
diffusely
Abd: obese, soft, nt, nd, +bs
Ext: 2+ edema in lower legs
Neuro: A&Ox3


Pertinent Results:
[**2161-1-31**] CXR OSH: Moderately enlarged heart and slightly
increased when compared to previous exams.  Patchy densities
bibasilar c/w edema vs. infiltrate.  B/L small effusions.
.
[**2161-2-2**] Echocardiogram:  Moderate global left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35-40%). Dilated right ventricle with
severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Pulmonary hypertension. Markedly dilated aortic
root.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-6-3**],
tricuspid
regurgitation severity has increased. The other findings,
including left
ventricular systolic function and aortic root dimensions, are
similar.
.
[**2161-2-3**] Echocardiogram w/ bubble study:
Agitated saline was administered, but image quality was
suboptimal and no
opacification was identified in the venous [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].

If the clinical suspicion for a paradoxical embolism is high, a
TEE with
agitated saline is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o M with COPD, OSA with trach, CHF with EF 50%, pulmonary
hypertension who presents with worsening dyspnea, increased O2
requirement, and increased sputum production.
.
# SOB:  Given his increased sputum production in the setting of
increased oxygen requirement, precipitator of his increased SOB
and hypoxemia appeared to be likley COPD flare [**2-20**] to
tracheobronchitis.  There was no clear evidence of infiltrate on
CXR to suggest underlying pneumonia.  He was started on
azithromycin and completed a 5 day course.  Sputum cultures grew
pseudomonas and he was started on cefepime, on which he will
remain for a 14 day course.  He was originally started on IV
steroids on admission, and oral taper was then initiated.  His
last day of steroids is [**2161-2-12**].  CHF seemed a less likely
contributor as he had minimal bibasilar crackles on exam,
borderline BNP, although CXR did show evidence of small
bilateral pleural effusions and edema vs. chronic parenchymal
changes.  He was transiently placed on ventilator support as he
was persistently hypoxemic below his baseline (nml sats at home
are 87-90% on 10-15L O2 via NC) and pCO2 was also elevated
beyond his baseline of 50-55.  His trach, however, had persisent
leak thought [**2-20**] to tracheomalacia.  Interventional pulmonology
was consulted and replaced his trach so that there was no leak
around the balloon cuff.  He tolerated brief AC and then PS and
then was weaned to trach collar with 15L O2 via and 5L via NC
with ABGs revealing baseline pCO2 and pO2.  His O2 saturations
have been at his baseline as well, largely 87-90% but on
increased O2 support (90% via T piece) + 6 L NC.  Plan to change
out patient's trach for his original cuffless trach prior to
discharge from rehab.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: He was admitted with therapeutic INR and
was well rate controlled in A. fib and he is not currently on a
nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (no beta blocker given severity of COPD).  Coumadin
was held in the setting of the above IP procedure.  He did
receive vit. K at request of IP x1 and FFP periprocedure.  He
was restarted on home dose of coumadin (6mg) following IP
procedure and is now again therapeutic.  His coags will need to
be followed and he should continue at current dose.
.
# CHF: He may have mild CHF on top of COPD flare given mild
bibasilar rales.  He has been restarted on his home 120mg PO
lasix daily.  Please follow daily weight and increase lasix prn
for weight gain > 3 lbs.
.
# CAD: EKG on admisison was not ischemic. He has baseline
troponin of 0.03-0.05 likely secondary to his CRI and was 0.04
on this admission.  CKs were flat.
.
# Acute on chronic RF: Recent baseline over the past year
appears to be approx. 1.4-1.8.  Creat bumped directly following
admission and UA c/w ATN.  Creatinine peaked at 3.0 and has
since trended downwards and he is now back at his baseline
creatinine (1.1 on day of discharge).
.
# Metabolic alkalosis: Suspect contraction alkalosis from
diuresis.  Patient restarted on his standing diamox to treat.
Please follow chem 7 two times weekly to monitor.
.
# PTSD:  He is followed at the VA for his PTSD.  During this
hospital stay, he did have more nightmares and anxiety.  He was
started on seroquel qhs in addition to his prn ativan and he
responded very w
