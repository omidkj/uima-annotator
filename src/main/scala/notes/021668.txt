Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cath transfer from OSH following VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-4**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4, resection LV aneurysm and
LV thrombectomy

History of Present Illness:
41 yo Caucasian male with a PMH only significant for obesity and
a remote history of alcohol abuse was admitted on transfer for
VT s/p cardioversion. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal
prodrome beginning Wednesday evening and eventually came to the
OSH c/o chest discomfort, lightheadedness, dizziness and malaise
and at this time was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia,
confirmed on ECG, with SBP in the 90's. Attempted conversion was
unsuccessful with adenosine x 2, and was then sedated and
cardioconverted at 200J on first attempt. ECG at this time
revealed Q waves in inferior leads and was sent to emergent
cardiac cath which showed diffuse 3VD (100%mid RCA, 85% proximal
LAD, 80% ostial, 60% discrete mid diag1 and 50% mid LAD lesion).
An aortic balloon pump was placed at this time and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for probable surgical intervention.

Lungs - course bronchial breath sounds, moving air well, no
wheezes
Abd - obese, soft, NT, +BS
Extrem - warm, no edema/cyanosis. 2+ DP pulses bil
Neuro/Psych- anxious. AA&Ox3, CN II-XII in tact, DTR's 2+.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**6-4**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include akinetic inferior, inferoseptal in
the base and mid, and akinetic apex, hypokinetic anteroseptal
and anterior walls. Lateral wall function is preserved in the
base and mid regions. There is moderate global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. POST-BYPASS: Moderate to severe
RV systolic function. Severe focal LV systolic function. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.
Echo [**6-6**]: There is severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall LVEF is 20%.
CXR [**6-23**]: Still some volume loss in the left lower lobe,
marginally better than on prior chest x-ray.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
and was consulted immediately by cardiac surgery. He underwent
extensive work-up with labs, echo, and u/s prior to surgery. On
hospital day four ([**6-4**]) he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4, LV
Aneurysm repair and thrombectomy. Please see operative report
for surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable but
serious condition on multiple Inotropes/Pressors. On post-op day
one his balloon pump was removed. From post-op day two to three
he had multiple runs of VT that required defibrillation. EP
service was consulted. He continued to remain on multiple
pressors and was sedated/intubated over the next several days.
He continued to have an elevated WBC and fever with a CXR
ultimately showing a possible pneumonia. Antibiotics were
started and he was seen by Infectious disease who recommnended a
10 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for a tracheal aspirate
positive for MSSA and coag negative staph in one blood culture
bottle.
He was extubated and weaned from his vasoactive drips on POD #
9. He remained in the ICU awaiting VT ablation and ICD
placement. On POD #15 he had an ICD implanted, and he was
subsequently transferred to the floor. He was ready for
discharge to home on POD #19.
