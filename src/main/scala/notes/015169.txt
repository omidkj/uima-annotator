History of Present Illness:
53 year old female with pancreatitis diagnosed [**2182-4-16**],
schizoaffective disorder, morbid obesity.  On arrival the
patient is intubated and sedated, history is largely per medical
records.  The patient presented on [**2182-5-1**] with worsening
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She initially
presented to [**Hospital6 204**] where she was febrile to
101 degrees.  She received 1 mg IV dilaudid, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV, flagyl 500 mg IV and zofran 4 mg IV.  CT of the abdomen
showed necrotizing pancreatitis with possible pseudocyst.  She
was transferred to this hospital for further management.

She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have diffuse abdominal
pain with rebound tenderness.  She received 2mg IV dilaudid and
then desated to low 80s on RA and 93% on 15L. She also
complained of CP without EKG changes.  Pt was accessed to be a
difficult airway and was intubated while awake with fiberoptics.
CT abdomen was re-read as necrotizing pancreatitis with
pseudocyst. Surgery was consulted but declined surgical
intervention and suggested holding antibiotics. The patient had
a clear CXR but got dexamethasone and combivent for possible
COPD exacerbation. She received 1 gm vancomycin for a RLE
cellulitis.  She also received zofran, fentanyl, versed and
tylenol.

On arrival to the MICU the patient is intubated but arrousable.
Able to nod head. Grimaces to abdominal palpation.  All other
review of systems negative in detail.

Microbiology:

Urine culture [**2182-5-2**] no growth

Imaging:
[**5-1**] CT chest/abdomen:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis with 6.3 x 7.4 cm area of loculated
fluid adjacent to the pancreas. While this may represent
inflammatory changes from severe pancreatitis or
developingpseudocyst, infectious process/developing abscess can
not be excluded.
2. Diminutive splenic vein.
3. Splenomegaly.

[**5-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to low lung volumes and
patient rotation to the right. Superior mediastinum remains
prominent. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year old female with morbid obesity presenting with
necrotizing pancreatitis and respiratory failure.

Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unclear etiology. She has had a
cholecystectomy and does not consume etoh. Lipids normal.
Lipase was already low by the time of arrival here. CT with
necrotizing pancreatitis and a fluid collection. Her WBC's came
down  and she has not had fever so concern for secondary
infection was low. Her exam was reassuring as her abdomen is
soft, but with some tenderness. She continues to have some
residual pain so an N-J tube was placed to start jejunal tube
feedings. She will be discharged with a plan to remain NPO and
on only tube feeds until pain free, then diet should be slowly
advanced. Would be conservative with diet advancement as her
diet was advanced fairly quickly during her prior admission and
her conditioned worsened. Would consider having GI and nutrition
follow at LTAC. As she has no clear etiology of this episode,
she has f/u with a pancreatitis specialist in 4 weeks here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. When it is time to advanced her diet she passed s/s eval
with no restrictions. A picc was placed to facilitate IV meds
and lab draws(she has very difficult peripheral access).

Respiratory Failure:With diuresis the patient was weaned an
extubated. At the time of discharge we suspect that she is
euvolemic to slightly volume up, although difficult to assess by
exam. Would monitor i/o closely and given lasix 40 IV prn to
keep even.

OSA:Patient has OSA but refused CPAP.

Pain/anxiety: Can be given morphine IV or po.

RLE cellulitis: Resolved. Completed course of Cephalexin.

Anemia: Hematocrit stable.  Likely from critical illness.

Hypertension:  Blood pressures stable. continued to hold home
enalapril

Schizoaffective disease: The patient is well compensated. In
discussion with psychiatry it is unclear if she actually carries
the diagnosis of schizoaffective d/o. No hallucinations or
delusions noted.

Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

Type II Diabetes: Regular insulin sliding scale q6 was done with
TF. Januvia was stopped out of concern fo
