HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 81 year-old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, ulcerative
colitis status post colostomy, gastroesophageal reflux
disease and dementia here with blood loss anemia and severe
esophagitis and hiatal hernia.

1.  Blood loss anemia:  The patient's baseline hematocrit
around 36, 25 on admission and received a total of 3 units of
packed red blood cells with good response in hematocrit.  At
the time of discharge hematocrit was 30 after receiving the 3
units of blood otherwise the patient had negative hemolysis
workup, iron deficiency and anemia workup and was otherwise
stable.  The patient eventually went for an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for source of
bleeding. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy they found evidence
of erythema, ulceration and friability in the lower third of
the esophagus compatible with severe esophagitis consistent
with severe reflux disease.  He also had a large hiatal
hernia, question whether there was periesophageal versus a
sliding hernia.  He will go for an upper gastrointestinal
study to evaluate this for possible surgical intervention if
desired by the patient after study.  He also had a question
of an angiectasia in the duodenal bulb, but no other active
sites of bleeding.  Secondary to the severe esophagitis the
patient was started on a b.i.d. PPI.  Also plans to start on
b.i.d. Sucralfate two hours after each PPI dose.  Also was
put on  gastroesophageal reflux disease precautions with
plans to elevate the head of the bed greater then 20 degrees
at all times when sleeping and otherwise was tolerating a
regular diet without difficulty.

2.  Cough/shortness of breath:  Initially the patient came
slightly hypoxic with persistent cough.  Plans were for the
patient to continue a ten day course of Levaquin for a
presumed pneumonia.  The patient's sputum grew out gram
positive cocci in pairs and were waiting final sensitivities,
however, likely just a community acquired pneumonia and will
continue to treat with Levaquin for ten days.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was
stable and at baseline per his patient.  Was started back on
his home regimen of Combivent and Zafirlukast and with
nebulizers prn, but those were not required and the patient
was not requiring oxygen at the time of discharge and
otherwise breathing was stable.

4.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft:  He was ruled out by enzymes and overall doing
well.  Likely had some changes on electrocardiogram related
to demand ischemia that resolved after stabilization in the
hematocrit.  He did have initial complaints of some chest
pain, but was either severe heartburn reflux disease versus
demand ischemia.  The pain resolved after admission and plans
were to restart his aspirin ten days after discharge.  The
patient will continue on his Metoprolol.

5.  Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure remained
stable on his home dose of Metoprolol.

6.  Hyperlipidemia:  The patient's cholesterol was stable on
his statin.

7.  Depression:  The patient was stable on his Zoloft and
Xanax.

8.  Code:  The patient is DNR/DNI, which was reconfirmed and
his sister [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 4027**] is his health care proxy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Patient ambulating without
difficulty, tolerating a regular diet, stable hematocrit.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Blood loss anemia.
2.  Severe esophagitis.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Pneumonia.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Coronary artery disease.
