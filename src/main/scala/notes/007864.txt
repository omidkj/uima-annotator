Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated and sedated from [**6-28**] to [**7-6**]


History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with history of CHF, recent MVR 6 weeks ago, recently
had increased confusion and fatigue of 1 to 2 weeks. This
morning patient awoke with fatigue and dyspnea, and was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] by her son. Initially reported to [**Location (un) 620**] ED
and had an ECHO there which showed EF of 55%, new RV dilation
but otherwise intact new valve. Given her recent cardiac
surgery, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. The patient was also noted to have new acute renal
failure at that time with K of 7.5 and received 10 of insulin
and 60 kayexelate prior to transfer here.
.
In the ED patient was noted to have vitals upon arrival of: T
afebrile, HR 105, BP 90s/50s, O2Sat 100% on BiPAP. Cardiac
surgery assessed the patient and felt that there was not an
operable solution to her presentation. Patient coughed up
green-yellow sputum and in setting of WBC of 13, was started on
Vanc and Zosyn. She received 2L of normal saline. CXR without
obvious focal process. Patient noted to be in [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of
2.8. Potassium was initially 6.7 and confirmatory potassium was
7.4. The patient received a further 10 of insulin and 30 of
kayexalate. Patient was hypotensive to 80s/50s at one point in
the ED and BiPAP was thought to be to blame and was removed.
Patient's BP improved; however, an ABG was 7.18/75/99. ED staff
spoke with family who confirmed a DNR status, but felt okay to
intubate. Patient was intubated in the ED. Vitals prior to
transfer to the MICU were: T afebrile, HR 105, BP 115/65, 100%
on CMV FiO2 100% (Intubated with CMV mode PEEP 5, VT400, RR 14).

.
Per son who lives with pt, according to the CCU team who at
first was to admit the patient - pt had been doing well as rehab
and home for several wks. Over last [**4-23**] D pt with worsening
fatigue, MS. Pt walking with walker ok at home, poor po but
taking v small meals (several grapes then piece of cheese).
Yesterday, seen by VNA who was not concerned. Seen several days
ago in surgery f/u where they thought her fatigue was expected.
Today, pt was very confused and so son brought her in.
.
Also, according to the CCU resident who spoke with her son who
is the healthcare proxy, they are very clear about her wishes
re: goals of care. They felt that after he contact[**Name (NI) **] his brother
by phone, [**Name (NI) **] called me back to state that he and his
brother do not want the pt to undergo more aggressive measures
at this time incl a lines, CVL, pressors, CPR, or electric
shocks. They would like her to remain DNR. For tonight, they
would like to continue ABX, mechanical ventilation and medical
tx of her [**Last Name (un) **], hyperkalemia and other issues. They will be in in
the morning to see her.

[**6-27**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Diffuse ST-T wave changes. Left axis
deviation. Poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2136-5-18**] atrial fibrillation is new.
.
[**6-27**] CXR: FINDINGS: The study is compromised secondary to
respiratory motion resulting in blurring of the lung bases.
Within that limitation, lung volumes are low.  The vasculature
is difficult to assess but does not appear significantly
distended or indistinct. No definite focal consolidation is
noted. There is a markedly tortuous aorta with calcified plaque
at the arch. Evidence of prior median sternotomy is again noted.
The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable. No large
effusion is noted. No pneumothorax is seen in this upright
radiograph. Please note the patient is somewhat lordotically
positioned. Again seen is a dextroconcave scoliosis involving
the upper lumbar spine. Deformity of the included left humeral
head is again noted, though limited.
IMPRESSION:
Marked cardiomegaly. No overt edema identified.
.
[**7-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with global free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Normal
