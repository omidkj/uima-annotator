Patient is poor historian at baseline, unable to get story from
patient.
.
67M ho Dm2, HTN, autism and dementia (baseline: A+Ox1) who
presened to ED for abdominal pain and emesis and unsteady gait
(usualy wheelchair bound). He has a poor baseline mental status
secondary to dementia (A+O to self and place only). As of last
night, had abdominal pain and emesis so was brought to [**Hospital1 **]. Mental status did not change from baseline. No fevers.
Was given rectal compazine by EMS and then vomited twice more 6
hrs later.
.
[**Hospital3 **]: T 98.3, HR 96, RR 21, 99/73, 96%RA
He was supposedly hypotensive at [**Hospital1 **]. Lactate 1.7, Na 136, Cl
99, BUN 36, K 4.3, HCO3 27, Cr 1.2, Ca [**14**]. WBC 21, Hb 17, HCT
51.8. UA suggestive of cystitis (cathed urine that was bloody).
Trop I 1.66, EKG with inverted T waves.
CT Abd A+P showed bilateral perinephric stranding findings
(although this is not seen in the final report) and question R
lower pulmonary artery defect although artifact in final read.
? CXR RLL infiltrate.
He was given: Zosyn and vanco for infiltrate and urine, insulin
for glucose 420, zofran, 2L NS, aspirin 325mg, started in
heparin gtt at 1530 and tranfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were:  97.6 74 116/71 (lowest BP
90/58 when sleeping) 16 96% 4L
-giving 3rd L NS, heparin running at 1530.
EKG showed NSR @ 79, LAD, long QTC, deep T waves in V2-V5, poor
r-wave progression.
Guiac neg.
Access: two 20 g IVs
Transfer vitals: HR 74, RR 21, O2 sat 98% on 3L NC, BP 94/59
Pt transfered to MICU for ?ACS, complicated cystitis, RLL pna
.
On arrival to the MICU,  pt is lethargic, mildly diapharetic,
arrousable, answers yes/no questions. Denies any chest pain.
States he has some abdominal pain. When asked if he is drinking
at eating at home he says no.

EKG [**3-29**]
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Probable underlying inferior Q
wave
myocardial infarction. Extensive inferior and anterolateral T
wave inversions raise strong consideration of ischemia. Q-T
interval prolongation is also noted along with left axis
deviation. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
EKG [**3-31**]:
Sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 deep T wave inversions
persist but
are improving. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
EKG [**4-3**]:
Sinus bradycardia with a single ventricular premature beat or
aberrantly conducted atrial premature beat. Prior inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Minor right ventricular conduction delay.
Left axis deviation. Q-T interval prolongation (484). Inferior
and anterolateral T wave inversions may be due to ischemia, etc.
Early R wave transition. Compared to the previous tracing  of
[**2116-3-31**] no diagnostic change.
.
ECHO [**3-29**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal septum and distal
inferior wall and severe hypokinesis of the apex which is mildly
aneurysmal. There is moderate hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular cavity size is growwly normal.
Free wall motion is not well seen. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen The mitral
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with extensive regional and global systolic
dysfunction. Normal right ventricular cavity size. No definite
pathologic valvular flow identified.
.
CT HEAD [**3-29**]:
FINDINGS: There are no prior studies for comparison. There is
moderate
prominence of ventricles and sulci. The ventricular enlargement
is not out of proportion for sulci nor there is significant
dilatation of the temporal horns beyond the dilatation of the
lateral ventricles. These findings indicate atrophy. The CT
appearances are not typical for normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel di
