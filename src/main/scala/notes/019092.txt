Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-2-24**] right AK [**Doctor Last Name **]/pedal bypass with GSV
[**2134-3-1**] R heel ulcer debridement (Podiatry) w/ primary closure

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old man with a history of chronic renal
insufficiency (baseline Cr [**4-4**]), cardiomyopathy and type II
diabetes who presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED complaining of shortness
of breath.
.
Over the past year, he has been diagnosed with coronary artery
disease after being found to have had a silent AMI, which likely
happened in early [**2133**] during a trip in [**Country 3399**]. He has had
fractionated care between [**Country 3399**], [**Country 651**], [**Location (un) 6847**] and [**State **]. The AMI was found during a routine echocardiogram
in [**Month (only) 205**], along with an apicla thrombus. Most recently, he was
hospitalized in [**Location (un) 6847**] for a right heel ulcer. He was
discharged without antibiotics and has travelled back to the US
for an appointment at the [**Hospital **] Clinic. While he usually has a
strict diet, during the prolonged plan trip, he was unable to
adhere to his diet. Early in the trip he felt okay, but after
about 7 hours, he began feeling short of breath with exertion.
He got off the plan at 3pm yesterday and had difficulty
ambulating. He went home, and he believes that his dyspnea would
improves when he is lying flat. Overnight, he presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
and was found to be hypoxic.
In the ED he was bolused with lasix 40mg IV and nitro, and was
placed on CPAP. EKG showed lateral ST depressions. Cardiac
enzymes were mildly elevated. His potassium was elevated so
calcium and insulin we administered.

Cardiology Report STRESS Study Date of [**2134-2-16**]
INTERPRETATION: This 57 year old type 2 NIDDM man with a history
of
CHF was referred to the lab for evaluation. The patient was
infused
with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 minutes. No arm,
neck, back
or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the
study.
There were no significant ST segment changes. The rhythm was
sinus with
no ectopy. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the infusion. The

dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.


Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2134-2-23**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinetic apex.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The remaining left
ventricular segments are hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old man with a history of type II
diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, coronary artery disease, s/p
anterior mi with apical thrombus, preserved EF, presenting with
shortness of breath. BNP elevated to >25,000.
.
1) Cardiac:
a) Pump: Presented with florid CHF requiring 100% NRB. He had
h/o anterior MI with apical thrombus, apical akinesis, LVH.
Repeat eccho showed EF 35-40% no apical thrombus + apical
akinesis.  He was started on a nitro drip and diuresed
aggressively 1.5-2L/d with lasix (and put out well to 100mg
bolus).  This was bridged to imdur + lasix with the addition of
metoprolol to improve his filling time.
.
b) Ischemia: Mr [**Known lastname **] presented with lat STD and NSTEMI; his CK
peaked at 470. It was thought that he likely had demand
ischaemia from hypoxia/CHF.  His metoprolol was titrated up to
100mg po tid, he was kept on aspirin, and his anticoagulation
was continued (for LV thrombus).  He was kept on high-dose
statin.
.
c) Rhthym: NSR throughout stay.  Mr [**Known lastname **] was tachycardic in the
90-100 range, he was begun on metoprolol which was quickly
increased to 100mg metoprolol tid.
.
2) Diabetes, type II: Likely diagnosed late given his
nephropathy and retinopathy would be incosistent with the short
duration of his diagnosis and his relatively good [**Name (NI) **] (6.9).
His glyburide was d/c'd b/c of renal insufficiency and he was
started on an insulin regimen.
.
3) R foot ulcer: pt with post-tibial disease; s/p debridement
with non-healing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (vascular surgeon) was
consulted and performed an above-knee popliteal to dorsalis
pedis artery bypass with reverse saphenous vein and angioscopy
on [**2134-2-23**].  He also underwent a right heel debridement with
primary cl
