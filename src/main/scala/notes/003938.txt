Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 68839**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right great toe amputation

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well
as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a
gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and
hypotension.  The patient reports "a couple" of days of feeling
generally unwell with malaise and a fever.  He is not able to
endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain,
dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.  He also endosres
some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea.
No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting.  He was sent to the ED after his daughter
noted him rigoring at rehab and demanded he be sent to the
hospital.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132/80 R 26 O2 sat
99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.  As
the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related
to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted
regarding management.  The patient was given levofloxacin,
acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.  He became
hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS
without much effect before before being started on
norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.

Overnight the patient was weaned off norepinephrine.  He also
defervesced and has been afebrile today.  He received one unit
Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.  ID
consulted and are recommending daptomycin (patient was on course
as an outpatient) and pipercillin-tazobactam as well as
discontinuing PICC and scan to r/o abscess.  Plan was for
podiatry to amputate toe in AM but patient's daughter and HCP
requested vascular to perform this operation so timing is
currently unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] report blood cultures from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
are growing gram positive cultures in pairs and clusters as well
as gram negative rods.  Currently, he reports feeling fatigued
but denies specific complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of multiple
bacteremias due to gangrene of the right great toe (initially
precipitated by anatomical abnormality), myelodysplastic
syndrome, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease
presenting from rehab with fever and hypotension and found to be
bacteremic again.

1) Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient was clearly septic at presentation
with hypotension requiring norepinehprine on the night of
admission and positive blood cultures for MRSA.  On presentation
to the ICU the patient received his daptomycin as well as a dose
of pipercillin-tazobactam for broad coverage.  Outside hospital
blood cultures revealed MRSA, pan-sensitive klebsiella, and two
kinds of streptococcus.  After spending one night in the ICU the
patient defervesced and was able to be quickly weaned off
norepinephrine.  He was transferred to the floor on his second
hospital day and remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
The most likely etiology of his recurrent bacteremia was
considered to be his right great toe, which was status post
multiple debridements, so this was amputated on [**2146-4-12**].  In
order to rule out other sources of infection the patient had a
CT abdomen and pelvis on recommendation on the infectious
disease consult team, which showed no clear etiology of
bacteremia though this was a suboptimal study due to the lack of
IV contrast.  Given bacteremia with a PICC line in place the
patient's PICC was discontinued on the recommendation of the I
