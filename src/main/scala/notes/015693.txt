Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: dyspnea

Reason for MICU transfer: central pulmonary obstruction


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted bronchial stenting, bronchoscopy
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3825**] is a 70 yo F with significant smoking history who is
transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation and treatment of
presumed metastatic lung cancer with RML obstruction,
post-obstructive RML collapse, partial obstruction of lingular
lobe bronchus and BL pleural effusions.
.
She initially presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-7**] with several days of
cough and progressive shortness of breath, and 25 pound weight
loss over past several months. Chest x-ray and CT chest were
performed which revealed diffuse, extensive lung disease as
outlined above. She was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy,
but prior to appointment on [**6-11**] developed severe dyspnea and was
brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] emergency room. She was put on
Ventimask. Right thoracentesis was performed which yielded 15mL
serosanguinous fluid: WBC 7090, RBC 15,000 95% lymphs, glucose
189, LDH 257, tot prot 4.7. Bronchoscopy was also performed,
showing extrinsic compression of RML and possible submucosal
disease. No e/o endobronchial lesion or obstruction. Probably
external compression of lingular bronchus. Lavage, brushings,
and EBUS-guided biopsies were performed. Path report yielded
poorly-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, probably bronchogenic
in origin. After her procedure, patient was monitored closely in
the ICU. Her oxygen requirements increased over the next several
days. She was also very anxious, requiring Xanax 1mg q6 hrs PRN
as well as morphine for sleep. It was felt that her fairly
precipitous decline was [**2-5**] occlusion of R MSB with subsequent
collapse/atalectasis. Based on admission CXR which showed new
density (infiltrate vs. effusion) at right lung base, she was
started on Zosyn for pneumonia despite no clinical s/s of
pneumonia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, vitals are: 99.3 106 120/46 23 78% 3L +
10L face tent. O2 sat quickly improved to 91% on face tent.
Patient complaining of shortness of breath, productive cough,
and anxiety.


Past Medical History:
-Extensive lung masses per above, likely poorly differentiated
bronchogenic adenocarcinoma
-Osteopenia
-Anxiety
-Panic disorder
-Lyme meningioencephalitis c/b seizures
-C. diff ([**2152**])


Social History:
She is married with two daughters and five grandchildren. She is
retired. Denies EtOH. Smokes cigarettes.

CT-A chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolism.

2. Short interval progression of metastatic central
lymphadenopathy, producing
more bronchial obstruction and middle lobe and left upper lobe
atelectasis/obstructive pneumonia.

3. New left lower lobe pneumonia and increasing moderate right
pleural
effusion since [**2156-6-8**].

4. Numerous lung metastases.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 70 yo F with significant smoking history
transferred from OSH for workup and treatment of extensive lung
masses with compression of RML bronchus and lingular bronchus
and post-obstructive collapse.

Active Issues:
# LUNG MASSES, BRONCHIAL COMPRESSION: Patient with extensive
burden of cancer on chest CT scan. Interventional Pulmonology
attempted to stent open the RML collapsed on HD#2 but were
unsuccessful - thoracentesis was performed. Pathology at OSH had
shown poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma - likely of lung
origin. Medical oncology and Radiation oncology were consulted
and explained to the family that given her burden of disease and
performance status, palliative treatment would offer little
benefit. Palliative care was consulted and after multiple
meetings with the patient and family, care was transitioned to
comfort measures and discharged to hospice.
.
# ANXIETY, PANIC DISORDER: Pt with history of anxiety and had
significant anxiety during hospitalization, which was
contributing to her dyspnea. Ativan and celexa were continued as
well as morphine for air hunger.

Inactive Issues
# SEIZURE DISORDER: Continued home Lamictal and Keppra.
.
# SMOKING HISTORY: Continued nicotine patch

Transitional Issues:
Patient will be cared for a hospice.
