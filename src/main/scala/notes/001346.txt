Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M with PMH of DM and CKD p/w Septic shock for unknown
origin, likely sources were Pneumonia, Peritoneal Cath
infection, Acute Cholecystitis, UTI. ARF requiring dialysis, now
stable off pressures. He was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital directly to SICU. He was alert and oriented upon
admission. New onset Afib was treated initially with IV
Metoprolol for rate control. Ceftriaxone and Zithromax were
continued for RLL pneumonia and positive UA.

RUQ US was done to evaluate for cholecystitis. Sludge in the
gallbladder without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for acute cholecystitis
was noted.

Creatinine increased indicating acute on chronic renal failure
likely from hypotension. HD was performed via temporary HD line
for volume overload for a couple treatments.  Nephrology
recommended continuing Lasix and increasing dose to 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
Foley was initially placed. Urine culture was negative. Urine
output averaged [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92973**] liter per day. Daily serum potassium
was low in the 2.8-3.1 range.

Once stable, he was transferred out of the SICU. The PD catheter
was hand flushed noting bloody effluent. Catheter was then
flushed with 500 ml of dialysate with bloody effluent. No
leaking occurred. Repeat flushing was done with one liter dwell
and drainage. Fluid was clearer. Cell count and culture were
negative for peritonitis. Dry gauze dressing was applied to
catheter insertion site that appeared dry and without redness.
UA and Blood cultures were negative to date.


He was also noted to have  thrombocytopenia on admission with
level of 18.  Hematology was consulted and w/u ensued. HIT was
negative and it was felt that thrombocytopenia was most likely
due to sepsis and exposure to new drugs including vancomycin,
aztreonam, Levaquin, famotidine, heparin and new HD. Levaquin
was likely drug culpert. Platelet count increased to 27, however
this level decreased to 17 again. He was hemodynamically stable.
Notation was made of bloody effluent from PD rapid exchange to
assess PD catheter on [**4-6**] and [**4-7**]. HCT remained stable during
admission (26 on admit/29 on day of discharge). Temporary HD
line was removed without incident.

Hematology recommended f/u PLT count as an outpatient on [**4-12**].
Recommendations were to f/u with Hematology if PLT count
remained less than 20,000.

Amlodipine was added to Toprol for SBP that was elevated in the
161/79 range. BP responded with SBP decreasing to 140s.

PT was consulted as he was unsteady and required a walker. After
a couple PT sessions of 2 days, he was declared safe for home
with VNA/PT. [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA services were arranged.

The plan was to discharge to home with f/u at [**Last Name (un) **] Dialysis
Unit with [**Doctor First Name **] [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], RN. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **]
to review hospital course and discuss management/follow up of
PLT count and PD. Labs will be drawn on [**4-12**] at [**Last Name (un) **] with fax
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
