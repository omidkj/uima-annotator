Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]/diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
65 year old man with hx of CHF (EF 30%), CAD (with NSTEMI on
[**9-10**] s/p cath on [**2179-9-19**] showing 3VD s/p BMS to LMCA, LAD, POBA
of OM), PVD, COPD, h/o mesenteric ischemia s/p bowel resection
in [**7-/2179**], MRSA pneumonia, initially p/w [**Year (4 digits) **]/diarrhea on
[**2179-11-18**]. In the [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) **], pt afebrile, but SBP 50s. Pt's pressure
was responsive to aggressive fluids. Pt also had a leukocytosis
(wbc 36) and positive U/A, and was started on vanc/levo/flagyl.
Noted to have rising CEs.  In the ED, the patient developed VT
arrest in setting of sepsis and a Mg 0.8. Magnesium was
repleted, and he received one shock with recovery of Normal
Sinus rhythm. During the code the pt was intubated and sent to
the MICU.  He was subsequently extubated on [**2179-11-19**]. Of note,
CT scan done in ED showed pancolitis.

In the MICU the pt was noted to have loose stools. He was
diagnosed as sepsis/hypovolemia. He was given aggressive fluids
via CVL. Pt briefly on lidocaine drip from the ED, but never
required pressors. C diff from [**11-18**] was positive. Pt's abx
changed to po vanc/flagyl alone. Pt extubated on [**11-19**]. He
required a lasix drip [**Date range (1) 46801**] for fluid overload from
resuscitation.

He was then transfered to medicine for further management. On
the medicine floor he became dyspneic with O2 requirement. On
[**11-24**] Lasix was held for hypotension and dyspnea worsened.
Because of this worsening of dyspnea CE were drawn and showed
elevated Trop-T to 3.12 and CK of 15 c/w NSTEMI.  Heparin gtt
was started.  On [**11-25**] BP stablized and pt has responded with
increased urine output to Lasix IV bolus with Metolazone.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] today for management of NSTEMI and
better management of fluid status.

Discharge labs:

IMAGING:
[**11-18**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with pancolitis, significantly increased
in severity and extent compared to the prior study. This could
be due to an inflammatory or infectious process, including C.
Difficile colitis.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Diffuse anasarca.

[**11-18**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Appropriate placement of ET and NG tubes.
2. Increased interstitial opacities bilaterally consistent with
fluid overload.
3. More focal airspace opacities involving the right lung may
represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
4. Persistent opacification of the right cardiophrenic angle may
represent right middle lobe collapse.

[**11-18**] EKG:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Marked left axis deviation.
Right
bundle-branch block. Early R wave progression. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2179-10-1**] ST-T wave
abnormalities may be improved or there is pseudonormalization

[**11-19**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with regional variation: the inferior
and posterior walls are more hypokinetic than the rest of the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**11-24**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening in now large bilateral pleural effusions
(compared to CT [**2179-11-18**], but similar to CT [**2179-9-29**]), without
evidence of loculated component. Peripheral interstitial septal
thickening suggests congestive failure as part of the cause for
the effusions.
2. Debris dependently within the trachea. This finding was
called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2179-11-25**]

[**11-26**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-24**], there is again
moderate-to- severe pulmonary edema with substantial pleural
effusions bilaterally and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Right IJ catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.

ECHO [**12-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
inferior akinesis with moderate hypokinesis of the other LV
segments, c/w multivessel coronary artery disease or systemic
process. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
