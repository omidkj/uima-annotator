Admission Date:  [**2184-10-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-11-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2116-6-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA [**Last Name (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 -year-old male with
a history of stroke, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia,
who sustained a motor vehicle accident on [**2184-10-18**].  The
patient was an unrestrained driver of a vehicle that was
rear-ended by a garbage truck.  His car then struck another
vehicle and the patient was ejected from the vehicle.  The
patient recalled the events at the outside hospital and had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15 on arrival to the hospital.  The
patient was at [**Hospital6 5016**].

Initial studies undertaken there showed a CT scan head with a
small contusion in the left posterior parietal region and
there is a question of a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage in
the posterior aspect of the Sylvian fissure.  His CT scan
head the following day was completely negative.  CT scan of
the cervical spine was negative, CT scan of the chest was
negative, and the CT scan abdomen just revealed a 3.3 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  There was a left femoral neck
fracture for which the patient underwent open reduction,
internal fixation at [**Hospital6 5016**].  He also sustained
a left distal radius fracture, right humeral head fracture,
and lacerations of the head.

After going to the Operating Room at the outside hospital,
the patient was noted to have a hematocrit in the low 20s.
He received six units of packed red blood cells.  On the
evening of [**2184-10-20**], the patient became markedly hypoxic and
was not responsive to Lasix and nebulizer treatments.  The
patient was subsequently intubated and remained hypoxic
despite 100% FiO2.  A CT scan of the chest showed bilateral
pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema,
and a right lower lobe pulmonary contusion without rib
fracture.  The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for intensive care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cerebrovascular accident times two with no residual
deficits.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Procardia, Lipitor, and aspirin.

MEDICATIONS ON ARRIVAL:  Tequin, Kefzol, Procardia, Lipitor,
and Pepcid.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home and has a
supportive family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial visit examination, the
patient had a temperature of 100.2 F, heart rate 114, blood
pressure 121/58, respiratory rate 12, saturating 91% on 80%
FiO2.  He was awake, responsive to voice and moving all
extremities.  An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube were
in place.  Heart was tachycardic without murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  There were fine crackles on the chest bilaterally
anteriorly.  The abdomen was distended and nontender.  The
left distal extremity was in a splint.  The right arm was in
a sling.  Pulses were palpated throughout.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Initial white count was 12.5,
hematocrit was 26.0.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.5, chloride
106, CO2 25, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9, glucose 154.  Coag
studies revealed an INR or 3.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory:  The patient's respiratory status was his
main issue throughout his hospital course.  The patient was
initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  Two chest
tubes were placed and the patient remained intubated.  This
situation was continued for several days.  After several days
of intubation, the patient actually self-extubated and did
well without the breathing tube.  After the chest tubes
demonstrated no further air leak, they placed a water seal
and eventually discontinued.  The patient continued to do
well and was transferred to the hospital [**Hospital1 **].

The patient did well initially, but eventually decompensated,
had increased wheezes, rhonchorous breath sounds, and
eventually desaturated.  He was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit and was re-intubated.  Chest x-ray showed
multi-focal lung opacities, consistent with an infectious
process or adult respiratory distress syndrome.  The patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit for several more days and
eventually improved markedly.  He was extubated successfully.

Since then he has done well with aggressive pulmonary toilet.
He was on nebulizer treatment around the clock and was
getting aggressive chest therapy with incentive spirometry.
He has done much better and on the date of discharge he is
saturating well on room air.  Other studies performed here
included chest CT scan angiogram which showed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism, the pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium,
and pneumothoraces seen initially and consolidations of the
lung bases.  Other studies also revealed that the patient has
signs of obstructive pulmonary disease.

2.  Orthopedics:  The patient has a left hip fracture status
post open reduction, internal fixation.  The patient has done
well with this and is now on weight bearing as tolerated
status with his left hip.  The patient is remaining on
Coumadin for his hip fracture and deep venous thrombosis
prophylaxis.  The patient is also in a cast for his left
wrist and sling for the right arm.  These two issues are
non-operative and are to be followed up in several weeks by
Orthopedics.

3.  Neurologic:  The patient has remained awake and alert
throughout his hospital course; however, since extubation,
the patient has remained somewhat confused as to location and
situation.  He is noted to be confabulating.  A CT scan head
on [**2184-11-2**] showed no evidence of acute intracranial
pathologic process.  The patient was placed on vitamins for a
question of Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome.  This issue was
treated with community reorientation and support from his
family.  It was felt that there was no infectious disease or
structural etiology for this cause and was likely secondary
to deconditioning and change in environment after the
accident.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient presented initially on
Tequin and Kefzol.  These were discontinued.  The patient was
followed for infectious disease throughout his hospital stay.
During his initial Intensive Care Unit course, he had several
days of fever.  There was no known source.  Numerous sputum
cultures, line cultures, and other investigations for
infectious disease were negative.  The patient subsequently
had an ultrasound guided hip joint catheter to rule out
infection there, which was also negative.

At one point, the patient was placed on several antibiotics,
including vancomycin, for empiric treatment.  This was
subsequently discontinued after several days and the patient
defervesced.  It was unclear if the patient had a febrile
response to the treatment or if he actually had an infectious
disease.  For the remainder of this [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay,
he has been off of antibiotics and has been afebrile.

DISPOSITION:  The remainder of the patient's issues have been
stable.  He has had no cardiovascular issues.  He has had
mild tachycardia which we feel is secondary to Albuterol
treatment.  He is eating with encouragement and assistance.
He is making urine and stool is to be transferred to [**Hospital6 **] facility today for continued chest
physical therapy and strengthening exercises.
