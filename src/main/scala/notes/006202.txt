CXR:
1. Endotracheal tube tip 2.5 cm from the carina.
2. Cavitary lesion in the right lung apex, consistent with
diagnosis of lung cancer.

HCT [**1-20**]:
Limited study. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter differentiation in the
right parietal and occipital lobe raises concern for acute right
MCA and PCA territory infarction. No hemorrhage

HCT [**1-21**]:
Since [**2126-1-20**], evolution of large infarct involving the majority
of the right cerebrum with sparing of the right ACA territory.
This finding suggests that there is likely a fetal right
posterior cerebral artery. The sparing of the right thalamus
suggests that it may be supplied by an artery of Percheron
arising from the left.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. A long
discussion with her family took place to clarify the goals of
care. Her likely course including significant intracerebral
edema and herniation were explained. Her family clearly stated
that they did not want a craniotomy. She was therefore continued
on mannitol. The following morning, she was able to follow
simple commands on the R side, however later that day, she
pupils became unresponsive and she did not follow commands. The
repeat CT showed worsening edema and beginnings of herniation.
These findings were discussed with her family and they
re-iterated their desire not to take her to the OR. Her mannitol
was increased. Over the night she developed increasingly dilated
pupils. On exam in the morning, her pupils were fixed and
dilated and she had no corneal or gag reflex. These findings and
the fact that she was herniating was discussed with her family
again. They decided to make her CMO that afternoon. She died
shortly after extubation.
