Radiologic Studies-
[**3-22**] CXR PA/LAT: no definite effusions or consolidations
[**3-25**] CXR PA/LAT:
*
[**3-23**] CT A/P non-contrast: A 4 mm renal stone is noted in the
midpole of the left kidney, nonobstructing. There is no renal
hydronephrosis. The spleen, pancreas, stomach, and bowel loops
are normal. No masses are seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the medicine service with a
supratheraopeutic INR in setting of levaquin and ARF. She
underwent parathyroidectomy on [**2112-3-28**] that was complicated by
hypoxia and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Hypoxia: She was started on BIPAP and given a nitro gtt on the
night of admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to reduce preload. She was
diuresed with lasix. Her CXR continued to worsen. There was
concern for DAH v. post negative pressure pulmonmary edema v.
diastolic CHF v. TRALI. She was given solumedrol in case this
was DAH. She was given morphine for pulmonary venous dilation.
IVC filter was placed given her history of PE.

HEME:- Initially admitted with supratherapeutic INR. THis fell
after holding coumadin. Her hct was falling and she was guiaic
positive. GI was consulted but her hct stabilized after
transusions and they did not want to scope her in setting of
repsiratory distress.

Primary hyperparathyroidism- Patient had recently diagnosed
primary hyperparathyroidism by labs and confirmed with imaging
U/S and parathyroid nuclear scan. Underwent surgery on [**3-29**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5182**]. We continued on Vitamin D supplementation.  Post
op course complicated by hypoxia.

Renal insufficiency- She presented with acute on chronic renal
insufficiency. This was felt likely pre-renal based on her
clinical hypovolemia. However, initial Fena was 2% (on last
admission was also >2%). Her high FeNa was felt secondary to
hypercalcemic state. She was hydrated with stabilization of her
renal insufficiency. CT stone protocol was repeated to r/o
obstructing stone. This showed a 4mm stone- still
non-obstructing with no associated hydronephrosis. Urology
service was also formally consulted to evaluate potential
treatment of stone. However, it was felt that treatment was not
indicated at this time given her supratherapeutic INR and
urinary infection. Renal was consulted and attributed her renal
failure to hyperparathyroidism but the acuity was not consistent
with this. Hemodialysis was considered but the family and pt
refused.

Cardiac: Echo showed EF of 20-25% on [**2112-3-31**]. This was felt to
be secondary to an MI in the midst of the ICU stay. She was
started on dobutamine for inotropic support.

Goals of care: Given the pt's poor prognosis and multiple organ
failure: renal, cardiac, respiratory a family meeting was held
and it was decided to make the patient CMO on [**2112-4-1**] and passed
away peacefully with family at her side on [**2112-4-2**].

5. anorexia- This is a chronic issue for the patient and may be
related to her underlying hypercalcemia. She was encouraged to
[**Last Name (un) **] in PO's and supplements with meals. However she continued to
have poor intake. She was hydrated gently with standing IVFs.

6. UTI- started on Bactrim for 14 d course (given recurrent
proteus UTI). follow INR closely on abx.

7. leukocytosis- unclear [**Name2 (NI) **]. f/u urine cx final data, CXR,
blood cultures.

8. Anemia- AOCD (likely from RA). Increase aranesp to 30 mcg q
week SC. Rec'd 2 U PRBC's on [**2112-3-23**]
