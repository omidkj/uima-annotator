Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
neutropenic fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-10-30**] arthrocentesis

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o F w/lymphoma s/p SCT x2 last [**11-1**], now with
transfusion-dependent MDS, s/p recent hospitalization
(summarized below) [**Date range (3) 95146**] who presents with fever.
Since her discharge on Thursday, she has been feeling pretty
well with the exception of knee pain.  She reports having
trouble with her left knee since [**2118**], but on Thursday she was
walking up the stairs and slipped.  She landed on her son, did
not hit her head, no LOC, but did twist her left knee.  Since
then, it has been swollen and painful, and she has had
difficulty walking on it.  Over the weekend, she felt well
otherwise.  Today she had clinic appointments with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to be neutropenic.  When she went home,
she was febrile to 101.  Also today she slipped in the bathroom;
she fell onto the toilet and in the process hit her head on the
wall.  Again she had no LOC, denies neurologic complaints.
Because of her fever, she called the BMT fellow and was told to
come in.
.
In the ED, her temp was 100.1.  Her initial BP was 126/65 and
dropped to the 80s during her course there (not documented in ED
notes but given to RN in pass-off).  She was admitted to BMT for
further management.
.
Currently, her only complaint is of knee pain and mild dysuria.
She denies headache, shortness of breath, cough, weakness,
numbness, abd pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
.
In terms of her recent hospitalization, she was initially
admitted with shortness of breath.  This was felt due to a
combination of CHF and pneumonia.  Her hemodynamics were
difficult to manage throughout her hospital course as she was
intermittently hypotensive (SBPs to 70s) but would quickly
develop pulmonary edema with minimal amounts of fluid.  At one
point she required ICU admission for her hypotension requiring
pressors.  [**Last Name (un) **]-stim was negative at the time.  It was felt by
the ICU team that she likely has a restrictive physiology with a
tenuous balance between shock and pulmonary edema.  Her hospital
course was also complicated by febrile neutropenia.  Her
neutropenia was felt to be possibly due to her MDS.  She was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for this.  She did
develop a severe rash to cefepime but tolerated both aztreonam
and meropenem.  Her infectious w/u was significant for numerous
negative blood cx, urine cx positive for enterococcus (rx
w/dapto), positive toxoplasma IgM with negative IgG (repeat was
negative, felt to be artifact), positive EBV titer, negative
beta-glucan and galactomannan, negative LP, negative
thoracentesis.

<br>
She was first diagnosed in [**2144**] when she presented with a right
neck mass. She underwent radiation to her mantle and below the
diaphram. In [**2145**], more nodes wer found, and she underwent
chemotherapy at that time. In [**2147**], she underwent high dose
chemo with stem cell rescue, which was successful. Her post
transplant course was complicated by disseminated Zoster (had
for years--treated with acyclovir), encephalitis/ meningitis
(?on Bactrim). She also suffered from depression and was started

on Prozac during that time. She was doing well until [**2157**] when
she was admitted for work-up of a left lower lobe mass. LN
Biopsy revealed an anthracotic node and lung wedge bx showed
only patchy areas of scarring and bronchial metaplasia, with no
malignancy identified in either tissue.
.
Around [**2161-10-28**], she started to feel 'not right'. She
presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat. In mid [**Month (only) 404**], she had

a recurrence of her shingles (treated with Valtrex; recurred on
right chest, left neck). She also saw an ENT for her sore throat

who saw a mass on her tonsillar pillar. Biopsy revealed findings

c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features,
given the proliferation fraction of ~90%. The alternative
consideration of an atypical Burkitt was considered less likely
given the nuclear pleomorphism and reported bcl-2 positivity.
She followed-up with her Oncologist after the biopsy was done
and underwent BM bx revealing no marrow involvement.
She underwent cycle 1 of ESCHAP 2/17-22/05. Her course was c/b
fluid overload, profound nadir and mucositis. She had a PET scan

[**2-2**] showing marked interval decrease in FDG-avid disease within
the pulmonary parenchyma and interval resolution of FDG-avid
lymph-adenopathy within the neck, mediastinum, and hila. Pt was
admitted from [**Date range (1) 95143**] /05 when she received [**Hospital1 **]-R chemo,
which she tolerated well. [**Date range (3) 95144**] - she was admitted
for a 2nd autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM
chemotherapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o F w/MDS, CHF, hypotension, who presents with fever and
neutropenia.
.
# Neutropenic Fever: Pt reported a single fever at home.  Pt was
afebrile on arrival and throughout admission. Pt initially
started on meropenem and daptomycin. Pt has multiple drug
allergies to antibiotics. She had a swollen knee as a result of
a recent fall which was concerning for septic arthritis.
Arthrocentesis ruled out infection. All blood, urine, joint, and
pleural fluid cultures remained negative throughout her
admission and her fever did not return. Daptomycin and meropenem
were ultimately discontinued.
.
# R knee pain: Pt presented with a swollen knee s/p a mechanical
fall. Her knee was tap
