.
Ms [**Known lastname **] has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Pulmonary Clinic, seen
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] during last hospitalization. As per Dr.[**Name (NI) 70440**]
summary, she initially presented with SOB, which worsened in
[**3-1**]. In [**10-1**] she presented severely hypoxemic, with an
elevated BNP and bilateral pleural effusions, an echocardiogram
demonstrated severe PH (pulmonary hypertension) with a TR
gradient of 58 mmHg as well as markedly dilated RV, severe RV
hypokinesis, moderately dilated RA, and moderate symmetrical LVH
with a normal ejection fraction. She was aggressively diuresed
and underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated
elevated right-sided filling pressures with a RA mean pressure
of 13, RV diastolic pressure of 18. Her pulmonary artery
pressure (PAP) was 82/27 with a mean of 46 and the mean wedge
pressure was 12. The PVR was 777. With the addition of 100% FiO2
and inhaled nitric oxide her PAP did not significantly change,
78/27 with mean 43, but the wedge pressure rose to 16. The PVR
dropped to 480 due to the rise in cardiac output from 3.5 to 4.5
(cardiac index from 1.9 to 2.5). She was started on sildenafil
50 mg three times daily. She initially improved, but then became
progressively short of breath and more hypoxemic despite no
change in her weight. Repeat echo demonstrated worsened TR with
gradient worsened to 94 mm Hg. Pt notes increase in 7 lbs in
weight over last 2 weeks, some increased abdominal girth
associated with it. She notes very mild increase in orthopnea,
although still using only 1 pillow, no PND. Her functional
status includes ambulation around her house to the batroom, she
is able to climb 6 stairs at a time before having to stop. She
lives by herself, performs ADLs. She also notes that ocassionaly
her HR is in the 40s during which times she hold her digoxin.
She took her coumadin 2.5mg this morning.

IMAGING:
[**2126-1-16**] ETT:
The patient exercised for 3 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol and
stopped due to progressive shortness of breath. This represents
a poor functional capacity for age. The patient denied any arm,
neck, back or chest discomfort throughout the study. There were
no significant ST segment changes noted over baseline
abnormalities. The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with
intermittent VPBs (which tended to decrease with exercise) and a
rare vent couplet. The HR response to exercise was exaggerated
and there was an abnormal blood pressure response to
exercise.
.
[**2126-1-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated. There is moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

[**2126-1-21**] FOOT XR:
1. Possible erosion medially at the left first TMT joint
involving the distal aspect of the medial cuneiform.
2. Soft tissue swelling at the level of the right ankle,
particularly laterally.
3. No acute fracture or dislocation.
.
[**2126-1-28**] CXR: The right transjugular Swan-Ganz line loops in the
right atrium and passes into the right ventricle where the
course is obscured by cardiac motion, but I suspect it is still
below the pulmonary outflow tract unchanged since 1:58 a.m.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pulmonary edema.
Small left pleural effusion is probably present. No
pneumothorax. Lungs are
essentially clear.
.
[**2126-1-29**] CXR: Tunneled catheter terminates in SVC at level of
carina. Catheter has not been advanced into the pulmonary
artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64yo F with a PMH of afib, severe pulmonary artery
hypertension (4+ TR, gradient 94mm Hg), 1+ MR, and HTN. She
presented on [**2126-1-14**] for scheduled R sided cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate her pulmonary artery
hypertension. On admission, patient had a supratherapeutic INR
from her coumadin and was felt to be volume overloaded (~7lbs up
from her dry weight. She was gently diuresed while her INR
trended down. Once her volume status was stable and her INR was
normal, she und
