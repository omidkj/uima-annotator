Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VP shunt removal [**2181-8-7**]
Endotracheal intubation [**2181-8-6**]


History of Present Illness:
63 y/o M w/ non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain
with VP shunt placed for obstructive hydrocephalus who p/w
abdominal pain to OSH. Prior to his presentation, he reportedly
had not had any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or altered
mental status. He did not have fever or leukocytosis. He was
treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole, followed by
ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**],
which was attributed to narcotic therapy used for severe
abdominal pain. An abdominal CT showed a 3 cm RUQ fluid
collection at the distal tip of the VP shunt. He underwent
ultrasound-guided aspiration of this fluid collection on [**2181-8-4**]
with drainage of purulent material. A RUQ drain was left in
place. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation
given the concern for VP shunt infection.


Past Medical History:
NSCLC met to brain - diagnosed [**11-18**]; s/p whole brain XRT,
avastin, taxol, carboplatin completed [**5-20**]); s/p resection

Pertinent Results:
7/28/098 MRI HEAD W/ CONRAST
There are changes from a right frontal and left parietal
craniotomy. There is
slight decrease in the soft tissue swelling overlying the left
parietal
craniotomy. The soft tissue overlying the right frontal
cranitomy is stable.
There is a right frontal ventricular catheter with its tip just
past the left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is a postoperative cavity in the left parietal lobe with
blood products
within it, which appears to be relatively stable in terms of
size and mild
associated enhancement. Enhancing lesion in the right cerebellum
appears to
be stable. No new enhancing foci are seen.
Previously noted subdural fluid collections and dural
enhancement have
decreased to a large degree.
There has been progression of confluent periventricular
hyperintensity, which
may reflect post-treatment sequela. The ventricles are mildly
enlarged
compared to the prior study.
The post-gadolinium enhancing volume of the right cerebellar
lesion measures
1.16 cm3. In the right cerebellum, the FLAIR volume measures
239.9 mm3 .
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative changes, no new enhancing foci are seen. Stable
enhancement in the right cerebellum and in the left parietal
operative bed. Progression of white matter hyperintensity which
may reflect radiation sequela.
.
[**2181-8-4**] CXR There are low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.
There is atelectasis in the right base. Ill-defined opacity in
the right apex
is consistent with patient's known lung cancer.
Cardiomediastinal contours
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
.
[**2181-8-6**]
CT CHEST:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Increase in size of the previously described spiculated
lesion in the
right upper lobe, now extending to the pleura.
3. New lung nodules as described above.
4. Atelectasis of the right lower lobe, associated with
effusion; no pleural nodule.
5. Bronchomalacia of the right main bronchus and intermedius
bronchus,
evoked by expiration.

[**2181-8-6**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT
1. No evidence of intracranial abscess or VP shunt infection.
However, CT has significantly limited sensitivity in this
regard, compared to MRI.

2. Known enhancement in the left cerebellum and at the left
parietal surgical site, seen on the [**2181-7-9**] MRI, is not
appreciated due to differences in technique.

3. Increased hemispheric white matter hypodensity without mass
effect, likely related to radiation therapy. Further evaluation
of tumor burden may be performed by MRI.
.
[**2181-8-8**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT
The patient is status post right VP shunt removal with a small
locule of air
noted non-dependently within the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] in addition
to a trace
amount of likely post-surgical intraventricular hemorrhage noted
dependently
within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Examination is otherwise
unchanged from
[**8-6**]. There is stable appearance to the left parietal
surgical resection
bed. Small extra-axial fluid collections are unchanged.
Subcutaneous
emphysema and a mild amount of edema is noted along the external
old VP shunt
site. Mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells and
sphenoid sinus
is stable as is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:
1. Trace amount of blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**],
otherwise no
significant interval change status post VP shunt removal.
.
[**2181-8-12**]
R Humerus Xray:
Two views. There is an oblique fracture of the proximal shaft of
the humerus. There is callus formation at the fracture site,
although the fracture line is partially visible. Fracture
fragments are not significantly displaced. Bones are osteopenic.
There is no evidence of dislocation. Mild degenerative arthritic
change is present in the shoulder joint. A PICC line is present.

IMPRESSION: Healing fracture proximal humerus.
