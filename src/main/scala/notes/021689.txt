Admission Date:  [**2198-2-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2198-3-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-1-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70 year old female
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2180**],
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, chronic
renal failure, chronic renal artery stenosis status post
stent, who is on chronic Coumadin and Plavix, who was
admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**] [**2198-2-14**], after a
fall in her bathroom at which time she hit her head, and on
presentation, her INR was super-therapeutic at 3.4.  Her
Coumadin dose had recently been increased in anticipation of
an elective DC cardioversion for her atrial fibrillation.

The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral
gastritis.  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **]
Intensive Care Unit, where the patient developed left
extremity weakness.  A head CT scan showed large right sided
subdural hematoma with a slight midline shift.  At that time,
she underwent bur hole placement with [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
placement.

Per [**Hospital1 **], her neurologic examination improved
post procedure.  The patient initially required Mannitol
which was discontinued.  The patient remained intubated
postoperatively and was stable on a ventilator with
hyperventilation on IMV settings 16/500/50%, pressure support
of 10, PEEP of 5.  Her INR had been corrected with fresh
frozen plasma, two units, with eight units of packed red
blood cells and cryo precipitate and two doses of Vitamin K.
Her INR on transfer was 1.4, with a hematocrit of 29.

On the evening of [**2198-2-15**], the patient had numerous
episodes of ventricular tachycardia requiring a total of 25
shocks.  She was started on amiodarone and Lidocaine drips.
After recurrent episodes, she also got two doses of
procainamide.  At that point, she was transiently on
Neo-synephrine which was shut off prior to transfer.

Of note, her electrolytes were within normal limits at the
time of the ventricular tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female with a mildly
super therapeutic INR with gastrointestinal bleed, possibly
from gastroenteritis, who suffered a fall at home at which
time she hit her head with a resultant subdural hematoma with
slight midline shift for which she underwent bur hole
placement and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain placement at an outside
hospital.  Her hospital course was complicated by
ventricular tachycardia requiring 25 shocks.  She was
initiated on amiodarone and Lidocaine drips at which time she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

1.  VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:  The patient had no subsequent
episodes of ventricular tachycardia requiring shocks or any
other therapy.  The lidocaine was discontinued but she was
continued on the amiodarone drip.  Her electrolytes were
normal on transfer and the goal was to keep her potassium at
4.4 to 5.0, magnesium approximately around 2.0.

Following the shocks the patient had enzyme elevation.  Her
CK was followed and eventually trended downward.  Once
stable, beta blocker was reinitiated.

Primary concern upon transfer was the subdural hematoma with
the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain placement.  On admission, the patient
had a repeat head CT scan which demonstrated increased
midline shift as well as significant edema surrounding the
drain, which had migrated into the brain parenchyma.
Neurosurgery was consulted, who recommended taking the
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain off suction, and the drain was
subsequently removed.

Based on the patient's serum osms the patient was given a
dose of Mannitol, which was not repeated due to persistently
elevated sodium as well as hypernatremia, but due to the
bleed, the patient was not started on aspirin, Plavix or
Coumadin throughout her stay.

The patient also had an increase in her renal function during
her stay, likely secondary to her overall status.   Per
Neurosurgery, neurological checks were followed q. two to q.
four hours, and goal systolic blood pressure was less than
140 to decrease intracranial pressure.  In addition, her
coagulation panels were followed closely with reversal as
needed with fresh frozen plasma.  Goal platelets were to keep
greater than 100.

Based on further research in the setting of ventricular
tachycardia with normal electrolytes, it was determined that
possible treatment with Amoxafloxacine, a new fluroquonolone
could have precipitated the event.  The patient was instead
started on Levaquin for a urinary tract infection noted on
labs at the outside hospital.

Renal was consulted for the patient's creatinine of 4.6, and
they recommended gentle hydration, holding hypertensives with
a systolic blood pressure goal of greater than 130, with the
potential of hemodialysis should it be required.  All
medications needed to be dosed for a creatinine clearance of
less than 20.  Eventually, for blood pressure control,
Labetalol drip was started, and for better diabetes mellitus
control, the patient was also started on an insulin drip.

Goal blood pressures remained systolic of 110 to 140.  For
control we tried not to increa
