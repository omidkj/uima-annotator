History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 19yM unrestrained driver +EtOH s/p MVC with no
memory of the event. He was brought to the OSH and intubated for
"agitation". In [**Location (un) **] he had self-extubated and was noted to
move his upper extremities to localization of pain.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was mildly agitated with periods of
significant lethargy -- likely from narcotics he had previously
received. He was re-intubated for airway protection. It was
noted that upon intubation, when receiving versed he had a
significant reaction where he broke out in hives. He was given
120mg solu-medrol and 50mg IV benadryl. Repeat imaging showed a
progressive epidural hematoma of 18-19mm with associated
temporal bone fracture. He was loaded with dilantin and prepped
for the OR.
