Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 23 year old man with long
standing type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal
disease since [**2155-4-1**], congestive heart failure with an EF
estimated at 40 percent, who presented with three days of nausea
and vomiting and finger stick glucose in the 400s at home.  In
the emergency room patient was found to have ketones in his urine
and metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 22, consistent with
diabetic ketoacidosis.  Patient was started on an insulin drip
and admitted to the medical intensive care unit on [**6-21**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient
was a well-developed, well-nourished, white male, lying in
bed, in no apparent distress.  HEENT oropharynx clear, no
fruity breath odor, moist mucous membranes.  Neck supple with
no lymphadenopathy.  Heart normal S1, S2, regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.  Lungs clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nondistended,
mildly tender to palpation, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.  Neuro
alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves grossly
intact.  Conversant and appropriate.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 139, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarb 17, BUN 89, creatinine 6.9.  CBC white
blood count 18.1, hemoglobin 8.8, hematocrit 27.6, platelets
506.  EKG normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 130, no ST
changes, no T wave inversions, normal intervals, normal axis.
Chest x-ray diffuse increase in interstitial markings that
could reflect pulmonary edema versus an
infectious/inflammatory process.  CK 323.  Alka phos 167,
amylase 983.  CKMB 12, troponin I 5.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis/diabetes mellitus.  The patient was
admitted to the medical intensive care unit on an insulin drip.
Patient's serum glucose responded well to intravenous insulin and
trended down to within normal limits within the first day of
admission.  Patient's anion gap decreased from 22 to within
normal limits.  Patient was then restarted on his outpatient dose
of glargine insulin q.h.s.  Patient also had regular insulin
sliding scale throughout his hospital course.

2.  Myocardial infarction.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were
elevated on admission and increased during the first day of his
admission.  Patient's CK peaked at 334, CKMB 12, troponin I 20.4,
all on [**6-21**].  Patient was placed on a heparin drip for one day
in the ICU.  Patient was continued on aspirin, atorvastatin,
isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times a day as well as a beta
blocker throughout his hospital stay, initially metoprolol and
then switched to labetalol 600 mg twice a day.  Patient's cardiac
enzymes trended down throughout his hospital stay and continued
to trend down at discharge.  Patient was also started on a low
dose ACE inhibitor, captopril 12.5 mg three times a day.
Echocardiogram performed during this hospitalization revealed an
ejection fraction of 30 percent, down from patient's previous
ejection fraction of 40 percent.  Patient underwent cardiac
catheterization during his hospital stay which revealed normal
coronaries with no stenosis.

3.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient's left ventricular
ejection fraction was noted to be approximately 30 percent,
down from his previous ejection fraction estimate of 40 percent.
Patient was maintained on Lasix 80 mg twice a day.

4.  Increased white blood count.  The patient's increased white
blood count as well as x-ray suggestive of possible infiltrate
diffusely were concerning.  Patient was started on levofloxacin
250 mg every 48 hours, renally dosed, on admission and continued
this for a course of seven days total.

5.  End stage renal disease.  The patient was continued on
peritoneal dialysis throughout his hospital stay.  Patient
used his own cycler and fluids while on the floor.  Patient's
normal routine is nine hours per night on peritoneal dialysis
as he sleeps.

6.  Anemia.  The patient was continued on iron supplements
and Epogen.

7.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.  The patient was
continued on a low sodium, low cholesterol diet throughout
his hospital stay which he tolerated well.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was administered subcutaneous
heparin for DVT prophylaxis throughout his hospital stay
until he was ambulating well.  Patient was also maintained on
pantoprazole 40 mg q.d. throughout his hospital stay for GI
prophylaxis.
