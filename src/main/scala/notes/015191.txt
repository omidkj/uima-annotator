Brief Hospital Course:
38 y/o male with HIV-associated Hodgkin's Lymphoma C5 of AVD,
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with neutropenic fever, PNA, hypotension, now
with resolution of neutropenic fever.
.
# R-sided pneumonia: A CXR showed a new right upper lobe
extensive consolidation highly worrisome for rapid progression
of infectious disease and minimal left basal atelectasis. On the
floor the patient complained to left-sided abdominal pain with
radiation to his left shoulder. A chest CT was done that showed
a multifocal PNA. The patient was given a 14 day course of
vancomycin and cefepime for possible health-care associated
pneumonia.  He was given a 7 day course of levofloxacin.   Beta
glucan and galactomannan drawn returned negative. He was given a
14 day course of anti-fungals, starting with 9 days of
micafungin, then switching to posaconazole. He was continued on
posiconazole on discharge, with course to be decided by
outpatient heme-onc at appointment later this week.
.
# Neutropenic Fever: On admission, U/A negative, no sign of
mucositis or thrush on exam.  H/o C. Diff in [**5-/2130**]; BRBPR in
past 24 hours prior to admit, and then with copious diarrhea on
[**7-17**] after fluid resuscitation begun.  As per his BMT attending,
pt has often had profuse watery diarrhea when he has neutropenic
fevers after starting a cycle of chemotherapy, most of which
(other than cdiff) never had a clear infectious cause. Pt was
covered with vanc/cefepime/micafungin/PO flagyl, and per ID recs
Levofloxacin was added. He had C diff toxin sent x 2 both
negative. PCR was negative as well. Stool was sent for O&P,
bacterial culture, viral culture (pt has hx of CMV retinitis but
not colitis), microspora, cryptospora. These revealed no stool
infection. The patient had one blood culture drawn from his line
that grew out Coagulase negative staph; the line was treated
with vancomycin dwells for 14 days. The patient remained
afebrile while on the floor.
.
# Hypotension - On admission BP 80/40's, minimally symptommatic
with palpations and some lightheadedness with positional changes
in setting of neutropenic fever, poor PO intake. Likely volume
depleted with high insensible losses from fever, possible septic
shock, however no source located. No e/o pericardial effusion
(pulsus <10, heart size normal on CXR). Pt was volume
resuscitated throughout his course with LR boluses, never
requiring pressors, and was transfused 6units PRBC as well.
Hemodynamically his hypotension resolved quickly, however he
developed copious watery diarrhea on [**7-17**] and became tachycardic
to the 130s (sinus) secondary to volume loss, for which he was
again fluid resuscitated with LR with good response.  On
transfer, his HR is in the low 100s and his BP is 107/69. While
on the floor, the patient remained normotensive.
.
# Anemia - HCT 21.7 in setting of recent chemotherapy, presumed
secondary to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.  Pt did
present with BRBPR although this resolved quickly and no rectal
exam was performed as he is neutropenic, guiaics are negative.
He was transfused for HCT<25 for a total of 7 units. While on
the floor, the patient's counts recovered, and he did not
require transfusions.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - plt of 18 on admission, trending down to 9.
He received one unit of platelets as his transfusion threshold
is <10 without bleeding. Cause uncertain, presumed secondary to
chemotherapy akin to his anemia. While on the floor the patient
did not receive any platelet transfusions.
.
# HIV associated Hodgkin's Lymphoma - s/p  five cycles of ADV
(no bleomycin [**2-15**] emphysema). On admission, cell counts were at
a nadir (13 days after last chemotherapy) and on filgastrim. He
was continued on caphsol and filgastrim 480mg daily, as well as
a PPI (protonix [**Hospital1 **]). The patient's counts started to recover
during his hospital course, and he was no longer neutropenic and
filgastrim was discontinued.
.
# AIDS - Patient has a history of CMV retinitis, esophagitis,
disseminated [**Doctor First Name **], PCP [**2125**] treated with dapsone. He was
continued on his outpatient anti-retrovirals - Ritonavir (PI),
Raltegravir (integrase inhibitor), Maraviroc (ccr5 receptor
blocker), Truvada (NRTIs), Darunavir (PI), etravirine (NNRTI),
and was continued on dapsone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] and acyclovir ppx.
.
# Left lower quadrant abdominal pain: unclear etiology. CT scan
of the abdomen was done which showed no acute process. There was
some splenomegaly c/w previously known HIV-associated Hodgkin's
Lymphoma involvement.
.
# Patient also given prescription for occupational therapy after
seen by OT inhouse for han
