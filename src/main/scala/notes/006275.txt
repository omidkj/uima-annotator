CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The patient is status
post AVR and median sternotomy wires are intact. The Swan-Ganz
catheter, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left-sided
mediastinal catheter have been removed. There is no
pneumothorax. Mild cardiac enlargement persists. There is
minimal left basilar atelectasis as well as blunting of the
costophrenic angles bilaterally likely indicating small pleural
effusions.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax status post removal of Swan-Ganz
catheter and mediastinal catheter.

INTRAOPERATIVE ECHO

PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic
valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric,
directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. There is also an
eccentric jet directed at the membranous interventricular
septum.
6. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits).

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is AV
paced.
1.. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 18 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Biventricular function is preserved.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged
