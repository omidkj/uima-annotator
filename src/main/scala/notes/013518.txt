History of Present Illness:
86yoF with DM, HTN, CAD, s/p fall out of bed on [**2105-6-22**]. Patient

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT  [**2105-6-22**]
Fracture lines through the left intertrochanteric area, with
bone fragment and displacement of the distal fracture fragment
laterally.

ECHO Study Date of [**2105-6-23**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of all walls except the
posterior wall, with apical akinesis. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Tissue velocity imaging
demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular
filling pressure (>12mmHg). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. The study is inadequate
to exclude significant mitral valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial
effusion.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2105-6-24**]
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
severe three vessel disease. The LMCA was angiographically
without
disease. The LAD was proximaly occluded and filled in the mid
section
via left-to-left collaterals. The LCX was heravily calcified in
the
proximal segment and filled a small OM1 with and ostial 95%
stenosis
(2.0 mm vessel). There was a very large OM2 with a hazy 80%
stenosis.
The OM2 gave collaterals to the LAD as well as to the RCA. The
RCA was
the dominant vessel which was occluded proximally. The rPDA and
the PL
filled via left-to-right collaterals from the OM2.
2. Successful POBA of the OM2 with a 2.5mm balloon with great
results
(see PTCA comments).

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT  [**2105-6-26**] 2:16 PM
FINDINGS: Two intraoperative images from the operating room
demonstrates interval placement of a lateral plate and dynamic
hip screw fixating an intertrochanteric fracture of the left
proximal femur. A small displaced lesser trochanter fragment is
noted. Please refer to surgical report for further details

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86yoF with L hip fracture and NSTEMI.
.
# CAD: She developed chest pain with CE leak few days prior to
her hip surgery. CEs positive, consistent with NSTEMI. Cath
([**6-24**]): Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant
system with severe 3VD. The LMCA was angiographically without
disease. The LAD was proximally occluded and filled in the mid
section via left-to-left collaterals. The LCx was heavily
calcified in the proximal segment and filled a small OM1 with
and ostial 95% stenosis (2.0 mm vessel). There was a very large
OM2 with a hazy 80% stenosis. The OM2 gave collaterals to the
LAD as well as to the RCA. The RCA was the dominant vessel which
was occluded proximally. The rPDA and the PL filled via
left-to-right collaterals from the OM2.  s/p POBA to LCx.
Cardiology was following her and was started on ASA, plavix,
statin, BB, ACEI. They recommended outpt follow up for further
discussion about ICD placement. She has an appointment in [**Month (only) 205**]
for this.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: had one episode in postop period after
which she spontaneously reverted back. After she was transferred
to the floor, she went back into Afib. She was tachy in the 130s
with pressure in 90's. She got 5mg IV lopressor after which her
rate came down to the 80's with pressure in 110's. Her BB was
increased and then she reverted back to sinus rhytm. She
remained in sinus rhythm. She was started on Amiodarone with a
loading dose and also started on Digoxin. Her BB was titrated.
It was decided not to anticoagulate her with coumadin as she is
very high risk for falls. This was done in discussion with the
patient, her family and PCP.
.
# Hip fracture: She had a DHS procedure for her left hip
fracture. She was placed on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis which
was to be continued for total of 14 days after surgery. She was
seen by physical therapy and there was no restriction on her
activity.
.
# UTI: u/a consistent with UTI, cx shows coag + SA, but could be
skin flora contaminant.  repeat urine cx NGTD. She completed 5
days of Ciprofloxacin and 3 days of Levofloxacin.
.
# HTN: Her BP remained stable.
.
# CRI: Cr elevated to 1.4 from baseline 0.8-0.9 on admission,
then resolved, likely dehydrated.
.
# DM2: continue fixed humalog and ISS as needed with QID f/s.
Humalog was titrated during this hospital admission.
.
# conjunctivitis: continued to treat with erythromycin drops.
erythema and discharge improved.
