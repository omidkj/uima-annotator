Admission Date:  [**2180-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2109-8-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT

ADDENDUM:

RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray on [**2180-10-17**]:
No pneumothorax.  Lung fields are clear.  Moderate left
ventricular enlargement.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound:  The liver has a homogeneous
echotexture and contains two small echogenic lesions, both of
which are in the right lobe.  These are compatible with small
hemangioma.  No other focal liver lesions.  The gallbladder
was mildly distended.  No gallbladder wall edema, no evidence
of cholelithiasis.  Common bile duct measured 4 mm and was
within normal limits.

Impression:  Normal appearing gallbladder given the patient's
fasting state without evidence of cholelithiasis, small
hemangioma ....................

CT of the abdomen and pelvis:  Impression:  1.  No fluid
collection or abscess identified.  2.  Mild thickening of the
wall of the ascending colon, similar to prior examination.
This pattern is persistent since the last CT examination and
raises the possibility of colitis, infectious, ischemic, or
inflammatory.

CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis:  Impression:  1.  Left
pneumothorax with epicardial pacer wires traversing the left
pleura.  This is not the expected course of epicardial pacing
wires.  2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive
atelectasis in the lung bases.  3.  7 mm nodule in the right
major fissure.  While this appears to have increased since
the prior study, there may be associated volume averaging
from the fluid in the fissure.  Follow-up study suggested.
4. Extended gallbladder.  5.  Possible thickening of the
cecum which is most likely due to circumferential fluid.
There is no surrounding fat stranding.

Echocardiogram on [**2180-9-11**]:  Conclusions:  1.  Left atrium is
mildly dilated.  2.  There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is very difficult
to assess but is probably moderately depressed.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3.  Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  4.  Mitral
valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  5.  No pacing wires
were visualized.  6.  Compared with the findings of the prior
report of [**2180-9-5**] there is probably no significant change.
Ejection fraction 20-25%.

Echocardiogram on [**2180-9-5**]:  Conclusions:  1.  Left atrium
mildly dilated.  The right atrium is mildly dilated.  In some
views, very small 2 mm, highly mobile echodensity seen in
close proximity attached to the atrial lead consistent with
possible thrombus vegetation artifact.  Left ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size normal.  There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior
inferolateral walls.  No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated.  There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened but not stenotic.  Mitral
leaflets were mildly thickened.  Mild 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] pericardial
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was
transferred over to [**Hospital6 256**] with
evidence of cellulitis surrounding the pacemaker site.  The
patient was started on Zosyn empirically, then ID was
consulted to further assist with management.  Blood cultures
and cultures from site resulted in MSSA
(methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus).  The patient
was changed from Zosyn over to vancomycin and ceftriaxone and
then subsequently switched to Oxacillin and then eventually
placed on vancomycin for complete regimen and treatment of
MSSA.

During treatment with Oxacillin, the patient developed
Clostridium difficile infection.  The patient was started on
Flagyl and then transitioned over to vancomycin p.o.
treatment.  The patient's blood cultures grew back fungemia
with evidence of yeast in the blood.  The patient was placed
on Casofungin and then the antifungal was switched to
fluconazole.  The patient was successfully treated with
fluconazole for elimination of the yeast infection; however,
the patient developed transaminitis with ALT peaking at 419
and AST peaking at 746.  Fluconazole was discontinued and
transaminitis shortly resolved over time.

During the episode of transaminitis, the patient's statin was
held until liver function tests improved.  All other
hepatotoxic agents were also withheld.  Now the patient is
currently completing a course of IV vancomycin and p.o.
vancomycin.  The patient needs to complete a 42 day course of
1 gram IV vancomycin and a 49 day course of 150 mg p.o.

The patient had three stools negative for Clostridium
difficile and contact precautions were discontinued.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient on admission had late
extraction of right atrium and right ventricle and CS leads
in the Operating Room.  The patient had placement of left
ventricular leads (epicardial) and left atrial lead.
Pacemaker replacement was deferred until infection was
successfully treated.  The patient was treated for congestive
heart failure with a successful regimen of milrinone,
Natrecor, and Bumex.  Over time, the patient's total body
edema decreased, the patient was able to be stabilized on
breathing room air with 100% saturations and good
stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure.  Natrecor was
shut off, milrinone was weaned down, and ACE inhibitor was
titrated up and eventually Bumex was converted over to a p.o.
Lasix regimen.

On [**2180-10-17**], the patient had a pacemaker revision
without any complications.  Throughout the course of the
hospital stay, the patient had an episode of NSVT on
telemetry and was replaced on Amiodarone.  The patient was
maintained on heparin throughout the hospital course due to
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was started on
Coumadin on the day prior to discharge.  The heparin was off
for procedures and restarted right after.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis on the chest x-ray and
appreciated on the examination.  It was likely secondary to
the patient's recent thoracotomy that he underwent prior to
admission to our service.  With aggressive diuresis for
volume status and continued respiratory support, the
patient's lung examination improved with improvement and
resolution of effusions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient has baseline chronic renal
insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.5 to 1.9.  The patient's
creatinine waxed and waned with milrinone therapy with
eventually stabilization of creatinine from 1.5 to 1.7.
There was a notable increase in creatinine and renal function
with replacement of the patient's pacemaker.

5.  OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient had an eye examination due to
treatment of yeast infection with fluconazole.  No evidence
of .....................

6.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient had two episodes of gout
each lasting about three days with tenderness, warmth and
erythema over the left ankle on the first episode and left
metatarsal joints on the second episode.  The patient was
treated with Percocet and compressions to the left foot.
Self-limiting, and lasted only about three days.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had elevated LFTs
secondary to treatment with fluconazole.  Once fluconazole
was discontinued, the patient's LFTs returned to [**Location 213**] and
was restarted on his statin.
