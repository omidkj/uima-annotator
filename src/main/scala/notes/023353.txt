ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1
of 0.82 with recent admission in [**2114-2-27**] for exacerbation
and discharged on antibiotic and steroid taper.  He was
admitted at this time with two to three days of shortness of
breath with acute decline over the past 12 hours prior to his
presentation.

On initial presentation he complained of some recent nasal
congestion and cough productive of white sputum.  In the
Emergency Department he had positive wheeze with a blood gas
of 7.39, 52 and 303.  He was placed on BiPAP and transferred
to the medical intensive care unit for noninvasive mask
ventilation which he was on for two hours and then
discontinued.

On his current evaluation for transfer to the floor he denied
shortness of breath, felt well and had been ambulating to the
bathroom without any problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Crohn's disease.  2. Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 0.82, 34% of
predicted in [**2113-12-30**].  Forced vital capacity of 45%
with a normal TLC.  3. Moderate aortic stenosis with an
ejection fraction of 60-65%.  4. Mild pulmonary artery
hypertension.  5. Diabetes.  6. Back pain with spinal
stenosis.  7. Degenerative joint disease.  8. Lower extremity
edema.  9. Peptic ulcer disease.  10. Benign prostatic
hypertrophy.  11. Erectile dysfunction.  12. Glaucoma.  13.
Hypertension.  14. Osteoporosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Asacol 1,200 b.i.d.  2. Univasc
7.5.  3. Folate 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.  4. Metformin 850 mg b.i.d.
5. Prilosec.  6. Prednisone eyedrops.  7. Azmacort.  8.
Serevent.  9. Atrovent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His initial examination on transfer to
the floor was temperature of 98.3, blood pressure 87/54,
heart rate 65, respiratory rate 17, 99% on two liters.  In
general he was sitting in a chair in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Anicteric, mucous membranes were moist.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at the upper
sternal border.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally
with wheeze in the upper lobes.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds, obese, distended and nontender.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer to the floor his laboratory
studies showed a white count of 10.6, hematocrit 34, platelet
count 216, sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 213,
calcium 7.1, magnesium 2.0 and phosphorous 4.6.  His latest
arterial blood gas was [**3-24**] which was 7.33, 45 and 150.
His sputum drawn on [**4-24**] showed less than 10 polys and
greater than 10 squamous epithelial cells and no respiratory
pathogens grew.

Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  He did
have prior granulomatous disease unchanged from prior.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Pulmonary/COPD exacerbation:  The
patient was placed on BiPAP in the medical intensive care
unit for two hours, started on Solu-Medrol, given nebulizer
treatments and started on amoxicillin.  The BiPAP was
discontinued and the next day he was transferred to the floor
where he was changed to a macrolide antibiotic, continued on
a steroid taper with nebulizers and did well and was
saturating well.  He was desaturating when he walked with
physical therapy to 88% and it was recommended that he have
pulmonary rehabilitation.

2. Diabetes:  The patient continued on his insulin and
metformin while in house.  On the Solu-Medrol his sugars were
in the 200s but once he was changed back to prednisone he
resolved his hyperglycemia.

3. Anemia:  Patient had slightly low hematocrit.  Iron, B12
and folate were sent, all within normal limits.

4. Crohn's disease:  The patient was started on Asacol
without incident.

5. Hypertension:  The patient was continued on his ACE
inhibitor throughout this admission without incident.

6. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  He was continued on a
diabetic diet, multivitamin and folate.

7. Prophylaxis:  He was continued on proton pump inhibitor
and subcutaneous heparin.

8. Glaucoma:  He was continued on eyedrops.

9. Osteoporosis:  He was continued on his calcium and vitamin
D.

He was full code throughout.

DISPOSITION:  He was discharged to rehabilitation.
