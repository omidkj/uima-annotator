Admission Date:  [**2148-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-12-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2090-5-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male, with
a history of aortic stenosis, bicuspid atrial valve,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, with a recent admission
to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**11-20**], following a one
week episode of shortness of breath, increase in lower
extremity edema, PND.  The patient was placed on lasix and
Nitroglycerin to which he responded quite well and was
eventually discharged on [**12-7**].

A cardiac echo done at the outside hospital revealed mildly
dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness, severe
diffuse hypokinesis, ejection fraction 30%.  The valve is
bicuspid, calcified and severely stenotic, with a mean
gradient of 44 mmHg, with a peak gradient of 79 mmHg, and
calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2.  There was 1+ mitral valve
regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with an
estimated pulmonary arterial pressure of 51 mmHg.  On certain
views there appeared to be a 2 cm gelatinous mass attached to
the lateral wall of the right atrium just below the tricuspid
valve.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lipitor 20 mg po qd.
2. Coreg 6.25 mg po bid.
3. Potassium mEq po qd.
4. Digoxin 0.25 mg po qd.
5. Lasix 20 mg po qd.
6. Aspirin 325 mg po qd.
7. Vitamin E, Vitamin C.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient was afebrile, heart rate 66, in
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 104/68.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm
with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur, and a II/VI
holosystolic murmur noted at the apex through the axilla.
Abdominal exam - soft, nontender, nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly noted.  The patient had 2+ carotid,
femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses noted.

EKG showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with a QRS
interval of 0.1.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC - white blood cells 7.2, hematocrit
41.6, platelets 214.  Chemistry - sodium 137, potassium 4.4,
chloride 101, bicarb 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.8, glucose 132,
ALT 24, AST 20, digoxin level 0.9, GT 13.6, INR 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a cardiac
catheterization on [**2148-12-13**].  The results of this
are as follows:  Moderately elevated filling pressures, mean
transaortic gradient approximately 60 mmHg.  Posterobasal
akinesis, global moderate hypokinesis, [**12-20**]+ mitral
regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction of
approximately 30%.  Right dominant coronary angiography:  LAD
80% stenosis at the proximal level, 30% stenosis at the mid
level.  Left circumflex:  80% stenosis at the proximal small
intermedius, 90% proximal large OM1, occluded mid left
circumflex.  OM2 fills via left to the left collaterals.
RCA:  100% stenosis proximal, small PDA fills via
left-to-right collaterals.

Following this cardiac catheterization, the patient was
referred to cardiothoracic surgery for consult as to aortic
valve repair and CABG.  It was determined that the patient
needed to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to
evaluate the questionable mass seen on the echo from the
outside hospital.  On [**12-17**], the patient underwent the
TEE, and this demonstrated no discernible mass on the right
atrium.

On[**2148-12-18**], the patient underwent an aortic valve
replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting x 3, and
replacement of his ascending aorta.  The aortic valve was
replaced with a 23 mm CE pericardial valve.  The CABG was an
LIMA to left anterior descending, SVG to acute marginal, and
SVG to OM.  The ascending aorta was replaced with a
supracoronary Gelweave graft of 26 mm. Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] did
the procedures, assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**].  The
nurse practitioner on the case was [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  There were
no complications during the case, and the patient tolerated
the procedure without difficulty.  The patient remained
intubated when leaving the operating room and was sent to the
CSRU on an epinephrine and a propofol drip.

In the CSRU, the same day of his operation, the patient was
weaned off his epinephrine drip and also weaned off the
propofol.  The patient was gently weaned and extubated that
same night, and placed on 50% face mask which maintained his
O2 sats at 97-98%.

On postoperative day #1, the patient did quite well.
Nitroglycerin was weaned to keep his systolic blood pressure
from 105-120.  The patient was given 2 units of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.9.  The patient was
started on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated without
difficulty.  The patient was also started on oral medications
for pain control.  The patient's chest tube drained a
moderate amount of sanguineous and serosanguineous fluid, no
air leak or crepitus were noted.  The patient remained on an
insulin drip which maintained his blood glucose within
excellent limits.

On postoperative day #2, the patient continued to do well,
was weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula, with his oxygen
saturation remaining over 96%.  The patient was transferred
out of the CSRU and sent to the floor.  While on FAR-2, the
patient's chest tube was removed.  The patient tolerated this
procedure well, and there were no complications.  The patient
also had his Foley removed.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, and the
patient was able to ambulate 450', steady gait, with no gross
balance defects.  It was determined that the patient would be
discharged to home following [**12-20**] more sessions with physical
therapy.

On postoperative day #3, the patient's course was complicated
by an episode of atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
administered 4 doses of Lopressor 5 mg IV.  This failed to
convert the patient, and the patient was placed on
intravenous amiodarone.  The patient quickly reverted out of
atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm at the starting of
the intravenous amiodarone.  The patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm for the remainder of his hospital stay.  The
patient continued to increase his activity and tolerated his
diet without any difficulty.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was taken off the
intravenous amiodarone and placed on po amiodarone 400 mg
[**Hospital1 **].  The patient did not experience any change in his heart
rate or rhythm following this medication alteration.  Also on
this day, the patient had his pacing wires removed.  The
patient tolerated this procedure well with no change in blood
pressure.  The patient was followed up by physical therapy,
and it was determined that the patient would no longer need
physical therapy at this point and was cleared to go home.
On postoperative day #5, the patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged to home to
follow-up with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **],
in [**12-20**] weeks.  The patient was also to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] in [**1-21**] weeks.  The patient was asked to
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in 4 weeks.

afebrile, ambulating intermittently, pain well-controlled on
oral medication, in normal sinus rhythm.
