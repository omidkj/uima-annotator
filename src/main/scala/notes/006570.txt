Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis; Coag negative staph bacteremia, ?line associated
DKA
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 57 yo woman with severe COPD, CHF (unknown EF),
DM2, was found by her niece to be unresponsive sitting in stool
around [**3-6**], sent to OSH- found to be septic with fever to
103.2, hypotensive to 70/36, positive UA (Lg Nit, Lg Le,
>100WBC, many bacteria). She was treated with vancomycin,
levaquin. She was also found to be in DKA with hyperglycemia to
735 and AG of 17. She was given 3L fluid, insulin gtt.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where first EKG shows ST elevation in III
and AVF with diffuse ST-T changes elsewhere. Troponin positive
at 0.2, CK of 274. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was started on ASA 325mg,
plavix 300mg, heparin gtt, Cards consulted and felt that this
may represent inferior ST elevation MI, and recommended medical
therapy with no acute catheterization given other acute medical
illness with DKA and sepsis. Levophed gtt and insulin gtt 8U/hr
and vanc/zosyn initiated. Right IJ sepsis line placed. DKA
resolved and transitioned to lantus. Subsequently remained chest
pain free. Cx. from OSH grew [**3-14**] coag negative staph. Was
transitioned from zosyn to levaquin, and completed vanco course
for transient CoNS bacteremia, which rapidly cleared (negative
cultures at [**Hospital1 18**]), and indwelling line was pulled.
.
Of note, she reports a severe adverse reaction to lasix, which
resulted in "welts" and skin sloughing.  This was thought to be
another potential source of the transient Coag neg staph
bacteremia.


Past Medical History:
1. severe COPD
2. CHF
3. DM2; patient reports not being on prior meds or insulin
therapy. Documented as previously on Glyburide in [**12-15**].

tobacco use. Denies ETOH or other drug abuse. Lives with parent
and adult son. Disabled secondary to chronic low back pain.
