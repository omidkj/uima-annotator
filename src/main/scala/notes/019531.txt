CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2136-11-11**]
Atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or edema.

Chest CT [**11-13**]:
NONCONTRAST CHEST CT: Extensive bilateral airspace opacities,
much of which is ground-glass in appearance are present
throughout the lungs, which spare the peripheral lung and
relatively spare the lung bases, where the distribution is more
patchy. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is
normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. The airways
are patent bilaterally to the subsegmental level. Mediastinal
lymph nodes measure up to 1 cm in short axis in the pretracheal
station.
There are no bone lesions concerning for malignancy.
This study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation
except to note a laparoscopic band around the proximal stomach.
There are no bone lesions concerning for malignancy.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, with large
areas of ground-glass opacity. The distribution and lack of
pleural effusion are most suggestive of ARDS. Borderline
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are most likely reactive.
.
CXR [**11-15**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there has been
a slight
improvement in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
consistent with ARDS or widespread pneumonia.

.
Microbiology results:
Influenza A/B negative
Respiratory cultures contaminated with respiratory secretions.
Legionella urine antigen negative
Legionella culture pending, but preliminary negative.
PCP negative
HIV antibody negative
Blood culture [**11-11**], [**11-13**] pending, no growth to date
Urine culture negative
.
Pending at discharge:
Hypersensitivity panel

Brief Hospital Course:
37 yo woman with asthma who presents with several days of cough,
shortness of breath, and fever and radiographic evidence of
diffuse bilateral parenchymal infiltrates.
.
#. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, in setting of asthma:
The patient was initially treated on the floor with Ceftriaxone
and Azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia and
Oseltamivir for possible influenza pneumonia. Influenza DFA came
back as negative and Oseltamivir was discontinued. The second
day of the patient's hospitalization she became increasingly
hypoxic and tachypnic and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management. Azithromycin was discontinued and
Levofloxacin was started. Steroids were changed from Prednisone
40 mg PO daily to Methylprednisolone 60 mg IV Q8H. The patient
was also placed on Nebs both standing and PRN. Sputum gram stain
and cultures and urine cultures were sent. Urine was negative
for legionella antigen. The morning after transfer to the ICU,
the patient felt much better and was ambulating on room air. Her
steroids were transitioned to Prednisone 60 mg PO daily. Despite
the patient's clinical improvement, a non-contrast CT was
ordered and revealed diffuse bilateral opacities, concentrated
in the apices, with sparing of the periphery, concerning for a
hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Clinically this seemed consistent
given her rapid clinical improvement on steroids and removal
from any possible environemntal exposures at home. On further
questioning, the patient did report a possible recent mold
exposure in her home. After transfer to the floor, she was seen
by the pulmonary service, and beta glucan (for PCP) and
hypersensitivity panel were sent (still pending at discharge).
She improved clinically, and was oxygenating well on room air.
A repeat CXR prior to discharge showed small amount of
improvement, but persistent bilateral opacities,  concerning for
ARDS or multifocal pneumonia.  She will require pulmonary follow
up, as the differential continued to include a hypersensitivity
pneumonitis or a viral or bacterial pneumonia.  She was
discharged on levofloxacin and a slow prednisone taper, as well
as cough suppressants and nebulizers.
.
#. Dehydration: Patient presented with an elevated lactate of
2.1 and ketones in her urine, for which she received IVF on the
medicine floor. Lactate had returned to [**Location 213**] by transfer to
the ICU but patient still appeared hypovolemic and continued to
receive IVF.
.
#. Sinus tachycardia: Patient presented with sinus tachycardia
to the 150s that was attributed to either her fevers,
dehydration or frequent albuterol nebs, or some combination of
each. HR decreased to low 100s by transfer back to the medicine
service following IVF and Tylenol PRN for fevers.   This
persisted, but slowly improved over her hospitalization.
.
#. Hematuria: Patient on depoprovera injections, expecting
menstrual period. No further episodes were observed in the ICU.

Outstanding tests:  as mentioned above, hypersensitivity panel,
beta glucan, blood cultures and urine culture.  Also final CXR
read.
.
# Key follow up:  PCP follow up next week, and pulmonary follow
up in 2 weeks.
