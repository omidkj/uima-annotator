male with no significant past medical history who presented
earlier this evening to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center
complaining of substernal chest pain associated with dyspnea
and diaphoresis times 30 minutes. EKG disclosed ST segment
elevation in II, III, aVF, ST segment depression in I, aVL,
V1 through V4.  The vital signs at the outside hospital
included a blood pressure of 98/palpable, heart rate 84,
respiratory rate 20, 02 saturation 98% on room air.  The
patient was given Retavase times two.  The patient still
complained of chest pain and was transferred by helicopter to
[**Hospital1 18**].  While in the helicopter, the patient became
pain-free.

At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was immediately taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory.  He was found to have occlusion
of the distal RCA.  He underwent Angiojet thrombectomy times
one and removal of the thrombus.  Two stents were placed in
the RCA. Final residual was 0% stenosis with normal flow.
The patient was transferred to the CCU overnight.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  None.  The patient takes aspirin
"once a week" for shoulder pain/neck pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  The membranes were
moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  JVP at ear.  Heart:

Sodium 132, potassium 3.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24, BUN
11, creatinine 1.2, glucose 113.  Troponin I less than 0.1.
Myoglobin 26.9.

EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm, 100 beats per minute,
normal intervals, normal axis, ST segment elevation 6 mm in
II, 7 mm in III, 7 mm in aVF, T wave inversions in I, aVL, V1
through V4.

EKG post catheterization revealed a normal sinus rhythm, 93
beats per minute, normal intervals, normal axis, ST segment
elevation in lead II, 3 mm in lead III, 4 mm in lead aVF, 3
mm ST segment depression in I, aVL, V1 through V2.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 51-year-old male with a
positive family history of coronary artery disease and
history of smoking, status post thrombolysis with Retavase,
now status post catheterization with RCA stent placement.
The patient was noted to have elevated right and left-sided
filling pressures in the Cath Lab.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU for management overnight.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was administered aspirin,
Plavix, and statin as his blood pressure tolerated.  He was
started on a beta blocker and low-dose ACE inhibitor.  His
cardiac enzymes were followed and were noted to peak at 2,200
on [**2142-4-7**].  The patient remained chest pain-free
during the hospital stay.

The patient was noted to have episodes of NSVT.  He also
remained tachycardiac and there was concern for alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient was monitored on the CIWA scale and
was given empiric benzodiazepines.  His level on CIWA scale
was never greater than 10.

On [**2142-4-8**], the patient was noted to spike a
temperature to 101.7.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were
obtained and were negative.  Chest x-ray did not disclose
evidence of infiltrate or pleural effusion.

Echocardiogram on [**2142-4-9**] disclosed an EF of 50%.  The
left atrium was mildly dilated.  A symmetric LVH resting
regional wall motion abnormalities included inferior and
basal inferior septal akinesis.  The RV cavity was mildly
dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally
normal.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened with
1+ MR.  There was borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypotension.  There was no pericardial effusion.

The patient remained tachycardiac and his Lopressor was
titrated up to 150 mg t.i.d.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with his primary care
physician in one to two weeks.  He will also follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times nine months.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lopressor 150 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
