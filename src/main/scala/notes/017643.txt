Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Right leg swelling and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79M with a history of ESRD on HD (ANCA-related
GN) and DM with recent admission for fever without clear source
who presented to the ED with worsening right lower extremity
erythema and pain. The patient underwent biopsy a lesion on the
dorsum of his right foot in [**2124-4-11**], with residual ulcer
formation. Pathology revealed necrotizing vasculitis. The
patient reports significant increase in pain and erythema over
the dorsal surface of his foot over the last few days since
recent discharge. On the day of admission, he visited his
podiatrist, who debrided the ulcer. He denies fever, chills,
nausea, and vomiting.
Of note, the patient had a recent hospitalization from [**Date range (1) **]
after presenting with fever and weakness. He was noted to have a
mild leukocytosis on admission, but otherwise unremarkable
labwork and imaging studies, including a film of his right foot.
At the time, his right foot ulcer appeared clean and without
drainage, swelling or erythema. After 72 hours of negative blood
cultures, his antibiotics (vancomycin) were stopped. Podiatry
did not feel that the ulcer site was infected, and recommended
f/u with vascular.

Initial VS in the ED: 98.7 88 164/79 17 100% RA. On examination,
there was a small 0.5 x 0.5 cm ulcer with fibrinous exudate,
erythema and warmth over the entire shin, creeping up to just
below the patella. Patient was given IV vancomycin 1 g X 1. CXR
revealed interval increase in pulmonary edema and a stable
L-sided loculated effusion. He was taken to HD directly from the
emergency room.

On the floor, the patient reports mild shortness of breath. He
states his R foot is painful, but redness improved.

[**2124-6-5**] CHEST XRAY:
IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions, large and
loculated on the left appearing stable, and small right effusion
appearing slightly diminished from prior.

[**2124-6-5**] R FOOT FILM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Soft tissue swelling and dorsal ulceration along the mid
foot overlapping the cuneiforms.  No definite radiographic
evidence for acute osteomyelitis.
2.  Irregularity involving the base of the fifth proximal
phalanx which is stable since the prior study and may represent
a subacute fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79M with a history of ESRD on HD (ANCA-related
GN) and DM with recent admission for fever without clear source
who presented to the ED with worsening RLE cellulitis, improving
on IV Vanc and Ceftazidime.

Acute issues:
# RLE cellulitis and bacteremia: The patient's clinical findings
and leukocytosis to 27.0 with bandemia were most suggestive of a
soft tissue infection though there was no evidence of systemic
toxicity in the form of fevers.  Blood cultures grew out
pan-sensitive Serratia while would culture from his right foot
ulcer grew out both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia. The
patient was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn for his cellulitis
as well as Tylenol for pain; the patient's cellulitis improved
significantly with antibiotics and the patient was able to
ambulate with assistance. The patient's leukocytosis improved to
9.2 on [**6-9**]. The patient was transitioned to vancomycin and
ceftazidime to be administered at future hemodialysis sessions
(unable to receive PO Ciprofloxacin given his Levaquin allergy).

#Hematochezia: The patient had 8 episodes of BRBPR during this
hospitalization. Given the intermittent nature of these
episodes, they were may have been due to hemorrhoids although
the patient has a history of severe diverticulosis and AVMs. On
hospital day 3, the patient experienced further episodes of
BRBPR overnight without hypotension or tachycardia. The BRBPR
continued into the following day with an episode associated with
some dizziness and pre-syncope.  NT lavage was attempted, but
unable to draw back fluid. He received 2L NS and 2 units pRBCs
and was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.  In the
ICU, his Hct remained stable at 30 after 2 units prbcs. He did
not have any further BRBPR and remained hemodynamically stable
throughout. Pt was then transferred to the floor where he passed
a large blood clot and received an additional 1 unit red cells.
He remained hemodynamically stable and his Hct was stable x
>36hrs prior to discharge.  GI followed through his discharge.

# ESRD on HD: MWF HD schdule. Patient was significantly volume
overloaded at admission, but improved with HD. He was placed on
strict free water restriction after gaining 6.2 kg body weight
on [**6-9**] after his last HD session on [**6-7**]. The patient was
continued on his home Nephrocaps and Sevelamer.

# Dyspnea: Patient was initially dyspneic at admission due to
volume overload in the setting of his ESRD. CXR on [**6-6**] showed
significant improvement of his initial pulmonary edema as did
his clinical exam. Patient did not report any problems regarding
his breathing at discharge.
