Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation
2. Central venous catheter
3. Arterial line


History of Present Illness:
84 year-old female PMH DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia brought to the ED
by her children for difficulty urinating. History mainly done
through her son. [**Name (NI) **] reports she complained of fatigue since
yesterday then this morning difficulty urinating. She described
the sensation as needing to urinate but unable. Her daughter
reported hematuria - however on further questioning this was on
the toilet paper only so unclear whether urinary or GI related.
Otherwise patient has been her usual state of health. She has
had a chronic non-productive cough for the past month but not
increased recently in severity. Denies fevers and chills. Denies
sick contacts. Denies shortness of breath or chest pain. Denies
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Reports having regular BM
(today and yesterday). Does describe a decreased appetite in the
last week. No lower extremity edema, orthopnea or PND.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 97.9, HR 77, BP 175/85, RR 18, O2 Sat
93%. Patient then triggered for hypoxia with O2 sat 83% RA which
improved with nasal canula. Abdominal exam notable for
distention - when foley was placed 200cc urine returned and
patient felt better. Patient was guaiac negative with no stool
in the vault. CT Ab/pelvis was done which demonstrated
cholelithiasis, small amount of free fluid in the pelvis but
otherwise unremarkable. CT chest demonstrated moderate bilateral
pleural effusions, bilateral basilar consolidations L > R
concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia. Patient was treated
with Levo/Flagyl, 1 L NS. Bedside ECHO demonstrated enlarged
right ventricle and due to high BNP in setting of hypoxia CTA
was done which was negative for PE. Labs notable for Na 111,
lactate 1.3, WBC 12.5 (N 80, L 10.2), HCT 30.5. Mental status
reported as agitated. Patient hypertensive throughout her stay.
VS on transfer BP 138/94, HR 94, RR 24, O2 96% 4 L.

.
ECG: HR 95. Normal axis. Irregular rate - A Fib. No ST
elevations/depressions. No old for comparison.
.
CTA chest and CT abd/pelvis-
IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread centrilobular nodules in a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
distribution in the
right lung, with possible small cavitating nodules in the right
lower lobe. Findings are compatible with a small airways
infectious process, and
endobronchial spread of tuberculosis is within the differential.
Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy are likely reactive.

2. Fibrotic changes within the right lung apex compatible with
history of
prior tuberculosis.
3. 2-cm left upper lobe subpleural consolidative opacity could
represent an area of infection, but neoplasm is not completely
excluded. 4. 4. No
pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
5. No diverticulitis. No small bowel obstruction.
6. Tracheobronchomalacia.
7. Marked coronary artery disease.
8. Bilateral small-to-moderate sized pleural effusions.
9. Significant gallbladder edema in a nondistended gallbladder.
This finding could be secondary to third spacing or reflection
of underlying liver disease.
10. Severe L1 compression fracture, likely chronic.
.
TTE ([**2173-2-16**]):
The left atrium is elongated. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is present as detected by color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**2173-2-18**]):
The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in
the stomach.  The right internal jugular line tip is at the
level of mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Multiple perihilar interstitial opacities that have developed in
the interim are new and consistent with worsening interstitial
edema. The left lateral consolidation seen back on [**2173-2-13**] has gradually decreased . Bronchiectasis volume loss and
chronic fibrotic changes in the right upper lung are
demonstrated. Bilateral pleural effusion is at least moderate,
unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen.
.
CXR [**2173-2-23**]-FINDINGS: A single portable AP radiograph was
obtained. Atelectatic changes are presenet at the left base with
blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of a small
amount of pleural fluid, unchanged from prior study.  The right
lung is relatively clear with no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No pneumothorax is present. The heart and mediastinal contour
are normal.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest
