History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23919**] is a 75-year old with dyspnea on exertion which has
been gradually progressive over the last 5 years. She becomes
dyspneic performing ADL's and ambulating down the hallway at
home. A year ago she could do aquatic exercises but now becomes
dyspnic. She denies chest pain, syncope, lightheadedness,
wheezing, and coughing. She reports stable [**2-10**] pillow orthopnea
and mild lower extremity edema. Sometimes she awakes at night
with breathlessness that resolves after sitting up for a few
minutes. Her husband noted that she does snore. She has tried
albuterol in the past but states this did not help. A recent
chest CT and spirometry with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] suggested her
symptoms
are more than expected for primary lung disease. She
subsequently underwent a cardiac cath and echocardiogram which
revealed moderate aortic stenosis and regurgitation, along with
one vessel coronary artery disease. She presents today for
surgical consulatation.
Cardiac Catheterization: Date: [**2113-7-15**]     Place: [**Hospital1 18**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
mid 25% stenosis. The LAD had slightly slow flow consistent with
microvascular dysfunction, a large D1 and a distal LAD which
wraps around the apex. There was a ramus intermedius.  The LCx
had slightly slow flow consistent with microvascular
dysfunction. There were twin high OM1 with a modest caliber
medial high pole and a large lateral pole, a tiny OM2, a large
patent LPL1 with a small LPL2.  There were minimal luminal
irregularities.  The RCA had proximal catheter induced
spasm/kinking (improved with IC TNG and withdrawal of the
catheter.) There was a proximal-mid 50% stenosis, a distal
44%stenosis between AM1 and RPDA, both lesions persisting after
IC TNG. There was slow flow consistent with
microvascular dysfunction.

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2113-8-30**]
Prebypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Due to eccentric jet (Coanda effect), the severity of aortic
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated. Aortic
annulus is approximately 19mm and concern over possible patient
prosthesis mismatch was discussed. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Postbypass:
Initial imaging postbypass showed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation that was significantly worse than prebypass.
Second attempt to come off bypass shows a well seated prosthetic
valve in the mitral position. The mean gradient is 8 mm Hg
across the mitral valve. The aortic valve continues to be well
positioned. The mean gradient is 15 mm Hg across the aortic
valve. Neither valve has a significant perivalvular leak. Left
ventricular function is preserved and unchanged from prebypass.
There is no evidence of an aortic dissection.

[**2113-9-1**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal-to-hyperdynamic (LVEF 75%). An apical intracavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position
with a prominent septal bounce. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
The gradients are higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Aortic and mitral valves have been
replaced; severe pulmonary hypertension is now present.
