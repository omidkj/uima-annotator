Recurrent cholangitis

2. Partial appendectomy.
3. Liver biopsy.
4. Extended adhesiolysis


History of Present Illness:
This 65-year-old gentleman who has a history of a presumed
unresectable pancreatic malignancy over 4 years ago. This was
never biopsy proven. He ultimately received an indwelling
metallic stent for this for an anticipated short term survival.
As it turns out, he has survived over 4 years.  There appears to
be no evidence of tumor at this point in time. He never received
adjuvant therapies. In the interim, he has had obstruction of
the metal stent and on multiple occasions, has had cholangitis.
Most recently, he had a
significant cholangitis and pneumonia and during that period of
time, he was found to have biliary obstruction above the stent
in the liver. A plastic stent was placed through the metal stent
in order to obtain drainage of the biliary tract.  He settled
out from this and went to rehabilitation for a week and now
comes back for definitive operative approach to his long-term
festering bile duct infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted following the above procedure.  He had
an NGT placed intraoperatively, foley to gravity, JP drain in

control.

[**2-9**] epidural removed, continued on PCA for pain control,
continued NPO, IVF

[**2-10**] continued NPO, IVF, PCA for pain, mild confusion noted and
patient placed intermittently in restraints

[**2-11**] transferred to the unit for significant bradycardia followed
by tachycardia, continued NPO, IVF, cardiac enzymes negative

[**2-12**] diet advanced to clears, started on amiodarone

[**2-13**] changed to oral metoprolol for rate control, d/c PCA,
started on PO pain medication, central line removed, PICC line
placed

[**2-14**] vancomycin started for central line infection (MRSA), diet
advanced to regular, started on heparin drip

[**2-15**] continued heparin drip, coumadin started, continued PO
lopressor, regular diet, transfused one unit RBC, central line
placed for hypotension

[**2-16**] - heparin drip stopped, lovenox started, continued coumadin,

medication

[**2-17**] - continued coumadin, lovenox, diet advanced from clears to
regular

[**2-18**] - held coumadin and discontinued lovenox due to
supratherapeutic INR
