History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 y.o. F with hypertension, atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, recurrent UTIs on suppressive therapy, s/p CVA with
residual L sided weakness, who presents with fever and shortness
of breath. The patient's symptoms started 5 days ago with
shortness of breath and fever 101-103. She also complained about
cough productive of white sputum. She tried treating with honey
for the cough. Also complained of nasal congestion but no
rhinorrhea. Denies myalgias. Denies sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recent
hospitalizations in the last 6 months. Per her husband, the
patient was more confused than her baseline dementia. From OMR
notes, on [**7-11**], husband called PCP and said patient was coughing
up "fluids" and requested [**Month/Year (2) 269**] evaluation. PCP [**Name (NI) 653**] [**Name (NI) 269**] for
evaluation on that day. Husband called again later that day to
say the patient's cough had improved with only edema over the
shins. At that time, no shortness of breath. PCP called
spironolactone 25 mg daily in that day. On [**2192-7-12**], [**Date Range 269**] visited
patient who stated fever 101 and sounded very congested. At that
point, PCP referred to [**Name9 (PRE) **] and she was brought in by EMS.

In the ED, initial VS: T 99.1 HR 122 (120-140s) BP 128/80 RR 28
98% NRB. Labs drawn and significant for leukocytosis 25.8 and
INR 4.4. UA contaminated with epi. Blood Cultures and Urine
cultures pending. EKG with ? new RBBB. Portable CXR and CTA
completed. She was given aspirin 325 mg po x 1, levofloxacin 750
mg IV x 1, and vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 (ordered, but not given).
2 L NS given. Foley catheter placed.

STUDIES:
[**2192-7-12**] EKG: ? new RBBB, atrial fibrillation of 140s, nls axis,
no acute Q waves, TWI, ST changes. compared to previous in
10/[**2190**].
.
[**2192-7-12**] PORTABLE CXR (my read): RML and LLL infiltrates,
perihilar lymphadenopathy.
.
[**2192-7-12**] CTA (wet read): Limited study due to motion artifact.
Within limitation, no e/o PE to the segmental level. Multifocal
peribronchial opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia or
aspiration. Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy likely reactive,
but some nodes measuring up to 12mm. Recommend repeat scan when
symptoms resolve and patient is able to perform breath hold to
ensure resolution.
.
[**2192-7-18**] CT CHEST:IMPRESSION: Increased small bilateral pleural
effusions and worsening bilateral lower lobe and lingular
atelectasis. Secretions are noted in the right main bronchus,
right bronchus intermedius and segemental branches.
.
[**2192-7-13**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2192-7-18**] ECHO WITH BUBBLE STUDY:
The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac shunt is suggested
with intravenous saline contrast at rest x 2 (patient unable to
cooperate with maneuvers). There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-7-16**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.
.
[**2192-7-19**] EEG PORTABLE
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and
slow
background throughout. This indicates a widespread
encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing,
but
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no
epileptiform
features.
