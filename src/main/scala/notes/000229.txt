Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
84 yo F with PMHx of ischemic cardiomyopathy, MI and CABG in
'[**81**], PTCA [**October 2096**] with stent to SVG/LAD, rpeat stent to SVG/LAD
in '[**98**], stent to LMCA-LCX in '[**99**], brachytherapy for LMCA-LCx RCA
and PDA in [**December 2100**], LMCA intervention in [**May 2101**].  Recently
([**Date range (1) 92238**]), had 2 serial cath.  1sst with ulcerated 80%
lesion of the proximal SV to LAD graft s/p stent.  2nd LCx w/
serial 70% lesions at themid segment. The SVG-LAD was patent.
Mid LCx was successfully stented at that time.

Pt presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] after having anginal
sx, DOE prior to admission, went to scheduled HD and was sent to
ED for worsening dyspnea and CP.  Pt also complained of cough
over the last few days with sputum.  ROS: +orthpnea, +dietary
indiscretion consuming [**4-30**] 8 oz glasses of fluid/day, not
adhering CHF/renal diet.  In OSH ED, BP 145/66 followed by
hypotension.  In OSH ED, she got neb, CXR w/ bilateral patchy
infiltrates/? consolidation.  WBC 19.1  Given a dose of
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Pt given morphine for CP/SOB and
BP dropped to 74/42->66/39.  Started on Dopa drip.  EKG with
LBBB (old).  She was ruled in by enzymes toponin 3.1->5.1->3.7.
Pt in CHF with elevated JVP, BNP of 2168.  On [**11-28**], pt was
diazlyzed 2 L.  Echo at OSH showing EF 25%, significant AS,
2+MR, trace TR.  Heparin not started for guiac positive.  [**11-30**],
Started dialysis at 11am but was dropping blood pressure/ no
fluid removed.  Pt then developed chest pressure.  At 1:30pm, pt
having CP, tachycardic in 120-130's, and was more tachypneic, BP
55/39.  EKG w/ same LBBB.  Dopa increaed to 20 mcg/kg/min and BP
improved to 100/60.  Heparin gtt was then started. Due to
tachypneia, pt was on 100% NRB then pt was intubated and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab:  Pt found to have LAD occluded proximally,
LCX with 90% leision in the mid-distal segment, RCA without
lesions, SVG-LAD patent with previous proximal stent [**90**]% lesion.
 S/P Cypher stent to LCx, and SVG-LAD.  PCWP 20 mmHg Cardiac
index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2 by Fick.

Pertinent Results:
CATH:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
multivessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent, flow-limiting disease. The LAD was totally occluded
proximally. The LCx had serial 90% lesions in the mid to distal
segment.
The RCA was without flow-limiting disease. The SVG-LAD had a
proximal
90% in-stent restenosis and diffuse noncritical distal disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated filling pressures with
mean
PCWP 20 mmHg. Central blood pressure was 102/61 mmHg on dopamine
IV.
Pulmonary pressures were elevated with PA systolic 40 mmHg.
Cardiac
index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2 by Fick.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to emergent
nature of the
procedure and to minimize contrast administration in patient
with known
renal failure.
4. Successful placement of 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in LCx
postdilated with a 3.0 mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
5. Successful placement of 3.5 x 23 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
SVG-LAD postdilated with a 4.0 mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).

ECHO:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left
ventricular hypokinesis with some preservation of basal lateral
and basal
inferior wall motion. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely
depressed.  EF 20-25%
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2105-9-30**], left
ventricular
systolic function has deteriorated, and the severity of mitral
regurgitation
has increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Hypotension: Unclear as to what triggered her hypotension.
DDx: 1)HD related hypotension which caused chest pain secondary
to decreased coronary perfusion 2)Cardiogenic shock after NSTEMI
but CI 2.5 so unlikely.  3)Sepsis from pneumonia causing
hypotension then angina from decreased coronary persusion. Pt
reports SOB/Cough that came before chest pain which may suggest
pneumonia/sepsis -> hypotension ->angina.  Pt was initially on
Neosynephrine gtt after cath to keep her MAP>60 but was able to
wean off 2 days post-cath/extubation.  Eventually, she was able
to tolerate po metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid and lisinopril 2.5 mg
po qd with good BP.

2)CAD: Pt presented with NSTEMI with positive enzymes.  Peak CK
360 and MB 68, and troponin 3.29.  Pt got stents to LCx and
SVG-LAD.  Pt was initially on Neosynephrine drip to keep her
MAP>60 but was able to wean off and able to start po metoprolol.
 She was continued on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Lipitor; and was started on
metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 2.5 mg po qd.

3)Pump: Last echo done at [**Hospital1 **] showing EF 30-35% with 3+MR,
mil-mod AS. Echo done on [**12-1**] showing EF 20-25% (worsened), 4+
MR, mild pulm HTN.  Worsened EF most likely secondary to
ischemia from the LCx and SVG-LAD territory prior to
intervention.  Pt was discharged with po metoprolol and
lisinopril.

4)Rhythm: Pt has LBBB with underlying sinus.

5)Renal: Pt has chronic renal failure and HD dependent.  Cr 3.8
on admission.  Pt gets dialyzed 3x/week and has AV fistula that
is working well.  Pt also came in with HD tunnel catheter on her
L chest.  Pt was seen by renal and got HD with adequate
ultrafiltration, given EPOGEN, and PRBC transfusion.  Pt
received Sevelamer 1600 mg po tid and Nephrocap 1 cap po qd.
Since her right arm AV fistula working well, her tunnel cath was
successfully removed by the transplant surgery.

6)Pulm: Pt intubated on arrival, but self-extubated on [**12-1**].  Pt
was maintaining good O2 sat initially with NC and later on RA
after HD with adequate fluid removal.  Pt also had pneumonia on
CXR and productive cough on admission.  Her symptoms improved
after treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Pt completed
5 day course of azithromycin 500 mg qd and Ceftriaxone was
continued.  She will complete a total of 14 day course of
Ceftriaxone, last day [**12-14**].

7)ID: Pt was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
possible PNA seen on CXR at OSH and WBC of 19. Pt showed
clinical improvement with lower
