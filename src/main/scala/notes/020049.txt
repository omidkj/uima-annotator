History of Present Illness:
HPI: 51 female with PMH significant for HIV, HCV cirrhosis s/p
orthotopic transplant in [**2179**] c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear and
varices, pancytopenia, transferred from MICU after presenting
with one day of BRBPR and hematemesis on [**2181-11-19**]. She stated
that she had several large bowel movements one day prior to
admission with BRBPR and large clots. Later that evening she had
4 episodes of vomiting blood. The following day she was very
weak, felt palpitations and was admitted to the hospital.

endoscopy revealed no source of bleeding. She was given 80mg IV
protonix and 80mg oxycontin. She had a femoral cortis placed.
Her blood was sent for type and crossmatch. She was admitted to
MICU.

CT CHEST [**2181-11-23**]: 1. New small amount of intra-abdominal
ascites. 2. 6 mm peripheral right upper lobe nodule, which may
have mildly increased in size. Diagnostic considerations again
include infectious or neoplastic entities. Short interval
follow-up is recommended.
3. Scattered centrilobular ground-glass opacities with upper
lobe predominance, which in a [**Last Name (LF) 1818**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent respiratory
bronchiolitis.
.
ECHO [**2181-11-22**]: Conclusion- The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypetension.
.
LIVER U/S [**2181-11-21**]: 1. Increased moderate amount of ascites. 2.
Elevated resistive index in the right hepatic artery of
uncertain significance. Clinical correlation and short-term
followup is recommended. 3. Splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
51 yo W with h/o HIV, HCV cirrhosis s/p orthotopic transplant
[**2179**], presented with acute GI bleed.
.
# GI Bleed: Patient was admitted to the MICU for acute drop in
HCT associated with hematemesis. EGD on night of admission
showed Grade I varices with no active bleed, normal stomach and
duodenum. It is felt that her bleeding was variceal in nature
given hematemesis, and patient had recent colonoscopy that did
not demonstrate any potential sources of bleeding. Repeat EGD
demonstrated esophageal varices as well as gastropathy. Banding
was not done as that would likely make gastric varices worse. If
patient were to re-bleed, there is no further endoscopic
intervention and she would require urgent TIPS. HCT trend from
27.8, 28.4, to 26.1. Patient's HCT trended down slowly and was
noted to have guaiac positive stool, but no acute drop occurred
and patient had no further episodes of bright red blood, melena
or dark stools. Patient was therefore maintained on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and
nadolol. Patient was treated with ceftriaxone x 5 days for
prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed.
.
# HIV: She has chronically low CD4 counts and has had difficulty
with different regimens due to anti-rejection meds. Patient was
continue on home regimen of  antiretrovirals  and dapsone and
azithromcyin for MAC/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# Cirrhosis / transplant: Her last biopsy did show a progression
to stage 3 fibrosis in her transplanted liver. Patient also with
portal hypertension, ascites and variceal bleed demonstrating
worsening of her liver disease. Patient's tacrolimus level was
monitored with a goal fo [**4-13**] and was dosed weekly.
.
# Prior pulmonary nodules seen on imaging: CT CHEST revealed 6mm
peripheral RUL nodule with mild increase in size, ? infectious
vs neoplastic. Recommend short interval follow up CT. Also some
ground glass opacities centrilobular, likely bronchiolitis in
[**Month/Day (3) 1818**]. Patient was directed to follow up findings on CT in a
few months.
.
# Pancytopenia: Patient is pancytopenic at her baseline. Prior
workup was unrevealing but pointed toward effect of HIV or
antiretrovirals.
.
# Depression: Mood seems appropriate. Patient states she was
thinking of becoming nursing assistant and will now likely need
to change her plans due to progression of fibrosis of her liver
transplant. She was continued on home dose celexa.
.
# Fibromyalgia: She takes oxycontin 40mg [**Hospital1 **] at home for pain.
This was continued in house.
.
# ARF: Patient was noted to have impaired creatinine clearance
with serum creatinine elevated to 1.7. Her baseline creatinine
is 1.1-1.4, and her creatinine and BUN returned to baseline
during her course. Her ARF was felt to be secondary to to
dehydration and hypovolemia due to bleeding and poor PO intake.
She had good urine output and creatinine clearance improved with
