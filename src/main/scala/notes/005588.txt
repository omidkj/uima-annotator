PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
ascending aorta is 3.9cm in diameter. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 47344**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-5-18**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve stenosis. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
using a tissue prosthesis. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade and
aspirin were resumed. On postoperative day one, she was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. Narcotics were
found to sedate her heavily and were therefore discontinued.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
her postoperative strength and mobility. She complained of
diminished strength in her left lower extremity and an
ultrasound was obtained which ruled out a deep vein thrombosis.
