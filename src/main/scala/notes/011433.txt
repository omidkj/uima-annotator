Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo man w/ CAD, COPD on home O2, DM, CRI, MVR, afib on
coumadin presents s/p fall with hypercarbia and aspiration
pneumonia. Admitted to MICU on [**2-26**] and called out to floor
[**3-1**]. Patient died [**3-6**].
.
1) Aspiration PNA: In the MICU, aspiration pneumonia was
suspected- no infiltrate on CXR, but copious purulent
secretions. He was briefly on Bipap and then transitioned to
shovel mask. Staph aureus found on sputum cx. Hypercarbia may
have been secondary to concomitant COPD exacerbation, although
no documented h/o COPD (despite smoking history). No longer
hypercarbic by transfer to floor. Low probability of PE
(although pt has h/o cancer) given supratherapeutic PT. No
evidence of ischemic changes on EKG. Pulmonary edema with
bilateral pleural effusions seen on CXRs [**2-26**] and [**2-27**]. He was
started on vanc/levo/flagyl (day 1 = [**2-26**]) and
prednisone/nebs/chest PT for presumed COPD exacerbation. He was
kept NPO and failed swallow study on [**2-28**]. PEG placement was
recommended and presented to the patient and family as an option
which they decided not to pursue as it was against the patients
known wishes.  Tube feeds were given as temporizing measure
until family took patient home.  He was breathing comfortable on
shovel mask and received frequent chest PT to help mobilize
secretions.

2) Anasarca: However, his course was complicated by significant
volume overload/anasarca. He received IVF boluses in MICU (+6
liters during stay) for low BPs and had 3rd spaced much of this
fluid. He was diuresed w/ increasing doses of IV lasix which
worsened his renal function.
.
2) Fall/MS changes: DDx of fall is mechanical, orthostasis,
ischemic. Mental status slightly better [**2-28**] but he is demented
at baseline and still w/ waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. There
were no EKG changes to suggest myocardial ischemia and MI ruled
out. Initial head CT was negative and CT neck w/ chronic
mid-thoracic changes; no change from prior. It was likely his
current infection that was causing delirium which is
exacerbation baseline dementia. Olanzepine was started for
agitation.
.
3) CAD s/p CABG: no evidence of ischemic ekg changes. MI ruled
out.
He was continued on aspirin & statin & metoprolol held for
hypotension & COPD
.
4) AFib: Alternates with normal sinus rhythm. He was initially
supratherapeutic on coumadin (stopped [**2-28**])- likely from
levoquin- and it was held for this reason and for hematuria (h/o
bladder CA).  Coumadin was not restarted when his INR normalized
after several days, since risk of bleed high and only on
anticoagulation for AFIB.
.
5) CRI: Creatinine elevated above baseline (which is upper 1s to
low 2s). Not pre-renal. Sediment with muddy brown casts and [**2-12**]
hyaline casts. Renal U/S was unchanged from prior- with chronic
stable mod left hydronephrosis and chronic nonobstructing stones
in left ureter. He was given prn boluses in MICU to improve
urine output, then lasix was started [**2-28**] for which he did
respond, however it was difficult to get him net negative since
so many fluids going in. Antibiotics were concentrated and other
IV infusions minimized. Lasix was increased which did worsen
renal functioning. A mild hypernatremia was treated w/ free
water boluses. His only option to remove this fluid was
hemodialysis, but this aggressive measure was not pursued as his
care was transitioning to comfort measures, as well as it is
unclear if this would actually provided any benefit or improved
quality of life.
.
6) HTN: Metoprolol and hydralazine held for hypotension in the
MICU. Getting IV hydralazine prn for hypertension. ACE avoided
[**1-12**] renal failure.
.
7) Type II DM: RISS; HgbA1C 5.5 [**2-12**]
.
9) Anemia: Hct slowly dropping while in MICU, likely from
hematuria- no other obvisou source of bleeding. Baseline likely
mid-30s. He was given 2 unit PRBCs during admission.
.
10) Code: Initally was full code, however after many discusses
with wife and discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14069**] and patient's
daughters, he was changed to DNR/DNI. Social worker closely
involved. Palliative care was consulted and plan was to go home
with hospice on Monday [**3-7**].  His care was predominately comfort
care, however treatment continued until decision for hospice to
be made on [**3-7**] (when daughter arrived in town).

However, Mr. [**Known lastname **] passed away the night of [**3-6**].  The
