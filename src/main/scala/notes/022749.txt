[**12-23**] GI Bleeding scan: No evidence of gastrointestinal
bleeding.

CXR: FINDINGS: Again seen is bilateral hilar prominence and
moderate cardiomegaly. There is no new infiltrate or effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1. GI bleeding/hypotension: Given history of diverticuli, brisk
lower bleed and significant hct drop, the most likely cause of
bleeding is the sigmoid diverticuli. The patient was admitted to
the ICU and was transfused 2 U PRBC on the day of admission. NG
lavage was negative. She underwent a RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL tagged
RBC scan that was negative for an acute bleed. She was monitored
in the intensive care unit and on HD#3 was noted to have a
recurrence of melena. A repeat bleeding scan was negative. She
received additional blood transfustions. Her hematocrit remained
stable and she was transferred to the general medical floor the
next day.  On the floor, she had an additional episode of
hematochezia with small amounts of blood.  Given the low volume
of blood, another RBC scan was not performed.  She was monitored
in the hospital for another 36 hours. She had no recurrent
bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.  The primary team
on the floor had a discussion with the patient and her son. The
patient again reiterated that she would not want to have a
colonscopy or surgery, and thus no further evaluation was
undertaken during this admission. She would however consider
angiography should she have recurrent bleeding in the future.
Given the likelihood of recurrent bleeding and the patient'd
desire for hospitalization, transfusions, and possible
angiographic intervention, she was instructed to return to the
hospital should she have episodes of blood on or in the stool or
bright red blood per rectum. Both the patient and her son had
good understanding of this. I encouraged the patient to continue
ongoing discussions with her primary care giver about these
issues.  The patient and son were also educated about the
discontinuation of ASA.
.
2. dCHF: Patient with grade II diastolic dysfunction. Has not
had event of decompensation in approx 1 year. She received lasix
with some of the blood transfusions and remained euvolemic.
.
3. Allergy history: the patient has history of multiple
allergies including shellfish. Thus would require pretreatment
with solumedrol, benadryl and famotidine should she require an
angiography procedure in the future.
.
4. Vaginal bleeding: Patient had an episode of vaginal bleeding
during this hospitalization. She was seen by OB-GYN who noted a
pocket from a previous suture, but no evidence of bleed.
.
5. Hypothyroidism- continued home meds
.
6. Osteoporosis: continued calcium when taking POs. Vitamin D
was initiated.
.
# Code: DNR/I. This was confirmed several times during this
hospitalization. Patient clearly had capacity to make medical
decisions.
.
