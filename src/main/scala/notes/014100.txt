Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LMCA, LAD and LCx
IABP placement
Swan-Ganz catheter placement
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
R IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with known CAD (details unknown) who is reported to have
developed SOB without chest pain/pressure on [**2193-2-7**] p.m.
although with GERD like symptoms. Per discussion with the
patient's family, the patient had episodes of shortness of
breath starting one week prior that were self limiting. Early
morning on [**2193-2-8**] the patient's symptoms persisted and EMS was
called. The patient was found to be dyspneic with respiratory
rate in the 40s, but was reported to be A+O x3. The patient was
taken to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital and given lasix and SL nitro on
arrival. In the ED the patient's ECG was remarkable for NSR at
115bpm with LBBB (presumed to be new, but not definitely known
given none for comparison) with BP 144/77, O2 Sat 90% on NRB
with rales bilaterally with 1+ LE edema. The patient was
intubated for respiratory failure with subsequent development of
hypotension with SBP in the 90's. Given LBBB and hypotension
there was concern for ACS for which the patient was given a 25cc
bolus of integrillin with subsequent gtt, Heparin, Plavix 300mg,
ASA and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. In the cath lab
the patient was noted to have pressure of 60/48 for which she
was started on double pressor therapy with Dopamine gtt
(13mcg/kg/min) and Levophed (12mcg/min) with an ABG notable for
7.13/53/86 on AC 100%, PEEP 2.5 600 x 12.
.
Cardiac enzymes from OSH were noted to be CK - 45, Trop 0.73. In
the cath lab Right heart cath was performed with the following
pressures: RA 26 ; RV 63/25 ; PCWP 46 ; PA 66/44/54 with
hemodynamic measurements revealing a CO of 4.26 and CI 1.96 on
pressors. The patient had an emergent echo that revealed EF 25%,
3+ MR, [**12-17**]+ TR, with apical hypokinesis/akinesis. Given the
patient's depressed CI and CO an IABP was placed.
.
Left heart Cath revealed the following on arteriography: (225
dye)
Left Main: 70% at origin, 90% distal
LAD: 90% at origin, Mid 100%,
Left Cx: 80% at origin, long 95% mid
RCA: 70% mid lesion, PDA 90% , posterolateral 70%
.
CT surgery was consulted given the extensive CAD but did not
feel the patient was an operative candidate given the
hypotension, acidosis and poor distal targets. Therefore, the
left main and LAD were stented with DES with good flow. The LCx
initially appeared worse after stenting but improved with wire
passage down vessel.
.
Repeat Right cath pressures after intervention revealed CO of
6.21 with CI of 2.91 on Pump and 10 Dopamine. The patient's
course was additionally complicated by episode of VT in the cath
lab x 1 minutem which terminated before DCCV was performed. The
patient was bolused with 150mg amiodarone and 100mg Lidocaine
and initially continued on lido gtt which was discontinued on
transfer to the floor. Of note, the patient had 800cc urine
output at the end of the case without diuresis

Social History:
(per OMR) Pt lives alone. She gets a daily phone call from her
son who lives in [**Name (NI) 86**]. She reports that  she is afraid to
travel due to concerns about running into health issues while

cooking, [**Location (un) 1131**], and watching TV as well as other activities.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this critically ill
patient revealed severe three vessel CAD.  The LMCA had a 70%
origin
stenosis and a 90% distal stenosis extending into the LAD.  The
LAD also had a mid 100% occlusion and supplies a one large
septal.  The LCX was diffusely disease with a 80% origin
stenosis and a long 95% mid stenosis. The rest of the vessel was
diffusely diseased as well.  The RCA was diffusely diseased with
70% mid stenosis, 90% PDA stenosis and a 70% posterolateral.
2.  Initial resting hemodynamics revealed severe cardiogenic
shock with elevation of right and left sided pressures (RA mean
26 and PCWP mean 46mmHG).  There was severe pulmonary
hypertension with mean of 54mmHG. The cardiac index was low at
1.96 despite pressors.  Initial PH was 7.09 with metabolic and
respiratory acidosis.  Initial blood pressure was 100/80.
3.  Intra aortic was placed with improvement of augmented
pressures to 121/53 and cardiac index to 2.91.
4.  Echo was performed during the case showing EF about 25% with

moderately severe mitral regurgitation and akinesis in LAD
territory.
The wall motion was best at the base.
5.  Urgent surgical consult was obtained and patient was
declined due to poorly amenable anatomy and severe metabolic and
hemodynamic
derangements.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with critical left main
disease.
2. Severe cardiogenic shock.
.
ECHO [**2193-2-8**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis,
apical akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, and anterior hypokinesis.
No apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
reg
