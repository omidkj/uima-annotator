Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3311**] is a 68 yo man with a history of severe CAD s/p MI,
3V CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, sequential SVG-D1-OM) in [**2169**] and
multiple PCIs who presents with acute onset chest pain. The
patient states that he was in his usual state of health when he
woke up this morning [**10-2**]. He was in his kitchen when the next
thing he knew he woke up on the floor. He denies any prodrome
including dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, focal weakness,
or aura. He does not know how long he was unconscious, but when
he awoke he was experiencing acute onset [**10-8**] retrosternal
chest pain. The pain was diffuse and located at the midline. It
was not positional and was not acutely associated with nausea or
vomiting. It did radiate up to his jaw, which alarmed him since
this was exactly what he experienced when he had his MI. He does
not think he fell on his chest. He was able to get up on his
own, climb the stairs, and call EMS.

He was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where he was given ASA and
nitro SL without relief of his chest pain. He was started on a
TNG drip but still complained of [**10-8**] pain. EKG showed
ventricularly paced rhythm with no acute ST or QRS changes from
prior. A Troponin-I measurment was 0.14. Myoglobin was 103. His
INR was 4.3. An ABG on 2L NC at that time was 7.32/46/95/24/Sat
97%. He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
catheterization.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He is unable to walk
very far due to left leg pain, but states this is due to an
established neuropathy. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations.

ECG [**2183-10-2**]  2:27:24 PM
Ventricular paced rhythm at 69 bpm with indeterminate underlying
cardiac rhythm, possibly atrial fibrillation. Compared to
previous tracing of [**2183-7-26**] no diagnostic change.

[**2183-10-2**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**2183-7-24**], there is no
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs, or the
pacemaker device. No evidence of acute pneumonia.

[**2183-10-3**] Rib xray: There is a dual lead left-sided pacemaker with
distal lead tips in right atrium and right ventricle. Median
sternotomy wires are seen. There is cardiomegaly which is
stable. No focal consolidation is seen. Markers have been placed
over the right lower rib cage, in this location, no focal
fractures are seen. There are no lytic or blastic lesions.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3311**] is a 68 yo man with CAD s/p CABG and multiple
subsequent PCIs who presented with a syncopal episode followed
by acute onset [**10-8**] CP not relieved by nitrates, slightly
elevated cardiac enzymes in the setting of acute renal
insufficiency.

1) Chest pain: Given strong history of CAD, his chest pain was
initially concerning for cardiac ischemia/ACS and arrhythmia and
he was admitted to the cardiac ICU.  His cardiac enzymes were
minimally elevated (CKMB to 14, TnT to 0.20 with a rise and
falling pattern, in contrast to minimal abnormalities in the
past at 0.02) and consistent with a NSTEMI, however his chest
pain was very atypical in that it was constant and not relieved
by nitrates.  He has had a recent catheterization in [**Month (only) 216**] with
no treatable lesions (and in fact complicated by perforation of
the RCA during attempted angioplasty of a chronic total
occlusion), and CTA had shown no evidence of aortic dissection.
He was transferred to the floor for further management.  His
chest pain was improved with Dilaudid and Ativan. The benefits
of repeat cardiac catheterization were not felt to outweigh the
risks, and he was treated medically.  He was discharged the
following day on medical management with ASA, lovastatin,
metoprolol and isosorbide.

2) Syncope - concerning for possiblity of VT/VF arrhythmia given
lack of prodromal symptoms in a patient with significant
CAD/prior MI. There was no evidence of VT at rate greater than
180 on pacemaker interrogation, however concern would be for
slower VT. Other possiblity is orthostatic hypotension although
less likely given lack of prodrome and generally feeling well.
His ICD was reset to trigger at VT >140bpm.

3) Chronic Systolic and Diastolic heart failure: with slightly
reduced EF of 45-50% on recent echo. No evidence for CHF
exacerbation at this time, although patient does have elevated
right-sided filling pressures as evidenced by elevated JVP.  He
was continued on metoprolol.

4) Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker- paced rhythm in 70's. His
warfarin was held as INR supratheraputic.  He was set up for
outpatient INR recheck and monitoring of Coumadin dosing.

5) Acute renal insufficiency - currently at baseline creatinine
compared with prior admission in [**Month (only) 205**], however consistently
elevated above baseline one year ago which was normal,
suggesting possibly interval worsening of renal failure vs.
hypertensive nephropathy.

6) Gout: no acute issues; he was continued on allopurinol daily.

7) Hypertension - currently well controlled; he was continued on
metoprolol

8) Hyperglycemia- elevated blood sugar
