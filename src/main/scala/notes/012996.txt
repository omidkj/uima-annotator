transfer for worsening BL alveolar and interstitial infiltrates
and possible lung biopsy

History of Present Illness:
89 yo with h/o afib, HTN, pulm HTN, and RV dysfunction,
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital at request of the pt for
management of worsening BL alveolar and intersitial infiltrates.
 The pt was admitted at the OSH from [**Date range (1) 66239**] with an initial
presentation of 5 days of SOB, weakness, and ?URI.  Per OSH
records, the pt had a h/o interstitial lung dx on CXR from
[**8-29**].  After admission to OSH, the pt was transferred to the
ICU on HD 2 for respiratory distress and was intubated.  He was
started on abx (CTX and azithro initially) and was diuresed, but
he continued to fail therapy.  R heart cath was performed to
assess RV function and revealed PA pressure 52/22, wedge 10, RA
pressure 16-18.  BAL was performed on [**12-29**] and revealed several
AFB staining bacilli.  During the BAL, the pt was unable to
tolerate spontaneous breathing.  The pt was shortly treated for
TB, however culture revealed atypical mycobacteria and TB tx was
discontinued.  CXRs continued to demonstrate this BL infiltrate
and the pt remained hypoxic.  The pts endotracheal tube became
plugged with thick brown-black secretions and was changed.
Repeat BAL on [**1-8**] was concerning for HSV cytopathic changes.
The pt was treated with 7 days of acyclovir 750 mg IV qd prior
to transfer.  He was also started on solumedrol on [**1-12**].  Chest
CT on [**1-11**] revealed BL interstitial lung involvment and 10 mm
mediastinal and aorticopulmonary window nodes.  The pts
oxygenation improved and he was extubated on [**1-15**].  However, [**1-26**]
hrs later he failed and was reintubated. The pt was transferred
to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and monitored overnite on [**1-16**]
and was transferred to MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] on [**1-17**] as pt was scheduled
for VATS by thoracic. Pt's heparin gtt (for a fib was held)
prior to OR. Pt went to the OR and have RUL and RML wedge bx. Pt
came out w/ 2 chest tube to wall suction.

CXR [**1-16**]- IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe opacities. Tubes and
lines in appropriate position.
Tissue/Pathology -
1. Lung, right middle lobe, wedge resection (A-E):
     A. Organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis
obliterans organizing pneumonia. See note.
     B. Interstitial fibrosis with areas of honey comb change.
     C. No granulomas or [**Month/Year (2) 18617**] inclusions seen.
2. Lung, right upper lobe, wedge resection (F-I)
     A. Organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis
obliterans organizing pneumonia. See note.
     B. Interstitial fibrosis with areas of honey comb change.
     C. No granulomas or [**Month/Year (2) 18617**] inclusions seen.
*** The biopsies show a background of interstitial lung disease,
suggestive of UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) with
superimposed organizing pneumonia with features of BOOP
(cryptogenic organizing pneumonia -COP).  A [**Month/Year (2) 18617**] or bacterial
etiology should be considered.
*** A GMS stain performed on a representative section of lung is
negative for fungal organisms.

[**1-17**] Pleural fluid cytology- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**1-18**] Echo. Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular  systolic function is borderline normal. There is
abnormal septal  motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload.  The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve  stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2182-1-24**] - CXR - Tracheostomy tube is 7 cm above the carina. No
pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Diffuse bilateral
interstitial disease as previously demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo with h/o afib, HTN, pulm HTN, and RV dysfunction,
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital at request of the pt for
management of worsening BL alveolar and intersitial infiltrates.
.
#Respiratory failure(hypercarbia)/BL alveolar/interstitial
infiltrates: Unclear etiology after extensive w/u at OSH (s/p 2
BALs with atypical mycobacteria from 1st BAL and changes
concerning for HSV on 2nd BAL; neg Legionella and influenza).
Pt was initially treated with Azithro/CTX, tx for short time for
?TB, and was discharged on levoflox and prednisone.  Per
reports, pt has an acute on chronic process (h/o interstitial
process in [**8-29**]).
.
Here he underwent a VATS procedure with RUL and RML wedge bx,
sample sent for fungal cx, gram stain, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**] studies.  Two
chest tubes were placed during the surgery.  He underwent an
echocardiogram which was notable for pulm HTN, dilated RV,
borderline Right ventricular  function.  Antibiotics were
stopped and after the biopsy results returned he was started on
Solumedrol 60 mg IV bid for UIP vs COP.  Chest tubes were manged
by thoracis and were discontinue [**Male First Name (un) **] [**2182-1-24**].  Solumedrol was
changed over to prednisone 60 mg daily on [**2182-1-23**].  He also had a
low grade fever and was treated for a 7 day course of zosyn.  He
required mechanical ventilation.  Trials of changing over to
pressure support were attempted however pt became tachypneic and
volume controlled ventilation was continued.  Pt underwent
tracheostomy on [**2182-1-24**] and PEG on [**2182-1-23**].  Plan on discharge is
to wean mechanical ventilation as tolerated.  He should be
continued on Prednisone 60mg daily for 3 months (~[**2182-4-25**]),
