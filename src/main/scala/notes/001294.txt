CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding at right AV fistula site.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year old
female with end-stage renal disease secondary to IDDM and
hypertension; on hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday at the [**Location (un) **] Hemodialysis Unit. Her attending is
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bleeding from her
AV fistula site. The first time was spontaneously. The second
time was secondary to the patient disturbing the dressing.
The bleeding was controlled in the ED with a stitch. She was
in her usual state of health, although had an extra
hemodialysis session for volume overload.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No complaints, though the patient has
dementia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for Alzheimer's with
vascular dementia, right AV fistula, post angioplasty, recent
admission in [**2174-12-1**] for mental status changes and
question encephalopathy and hypercalcemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy and a nephrectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aricept 10 mg p.o. at bedtime, aspirin
81 mg p.o. daily, Cozaar 100 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
daily, insulin daily, Zantac daily, Glucotrol 5 mg p.o.
daily, Renagel 2400 mg p.o. t.i.d., Nephrocaps 1 p.o. daily,
Sensipar 30 mg p.o. daily, hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and
50 mg at bedtime.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unable to obtain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2, BP 148/78, heart
rate 75, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 100% on room air,
weight 139.8 pounds. She was alert and oriented x1. In no
acute distress. Lungs clear. Positive systolic murmur.
Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is soft and nontender with
positive bowel sounds. No lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Right upper extremity AV fistula is positive for thrill, and
this was palpable at the proximal aspect of the fistula.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count was 7.3,
hematocrit 32.5, platelet count 174, creatinine 9.3, BUN 61,
with a potassium of 7.7 (which was hemolyzed), calcium was
9.7, magnesium 2.1, and a phosphorous of 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for bleeding of
her AV fistula while in HD. This was stitched. She was taken
to the OR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. The patient underwent an
excision and repair of right arm AV graft pseudoaneurysm with
a 6-mm PTFE jump graft. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was extubated and transferred to the recovery room
in stable condition. Noted that it was okay to use the upper
arm portion of the AV graft for dialysis.

The patient was sent directly from the OR to dialysis. Her AV
fistula was cannulated on the upper without any problem. She
underwent hemodialysis without any problems; 0.5 liters were
ultrafiltrated.

The patient was admitted to the medical surgical unit after
hemodialysis. Noted that the patient was having mental status
changes. She appeared confused, only responded to painful
stimuli and sternal rub. She was shouting. Her O2 saturation
dropped to the mid 80s. She was put on an 02 nonrebreather.
ABGs were sent off as well as a full set of labs. O2
saturation improved to 100%. A central line was placed.

She was transferred to the SICU for monitoring. During
evaluation, the daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**]. It was noted that the
daughter stated that the patient's behavior was typical, that
she has dementia. She had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of
consciousness. She received no sedation. Neurology was
consulted. A head CT was done. ABGs were done as well; pH was
7.39, pO2 420, pCO2 45. Head CT demonstrated no acute
intracranial hemorrhage, and the recommendations from
neurology included MRI/MRA to evaluate for stroke. They
recommended treating empirically with vancomycin and
ceftriaxone for infection, as it was felt that it was unsafe
to perform a LP due to a low platelet count and coagulopathy.
No antiepileptics were recommended. Of note, during
hemodialysis the patient had a low blood pressure of 70/40.
This responded to Trendelenburg position and a fluid bolus.
She is normally anuric. Her blood sugar was normal. The
patient was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 20. Hematocrit increased to 28. The
patient was transferred back to the medical surgical unit.
Seizure was likely secondary to uremia. A temporary dialysis
catheter was placed in radiology as the right AV graft
thrombosed. The patient continued to receive hemodialysis via
the temporary catheter.

The patient returned on [**2-1**] to the OR for thrombectomy
of the right upper arm AV graft with fluoroscopy. The surgeon
was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30642**] [**Name (STitle) **]. The
patient received local with MAC. Impression included proximal
stenosis, and a venography was recommended with possible
dilatation of more proximal stenosis.

On [**2-2**], IR was unable to perform a venogram secondary
to the patient being uncooperative and agitated. This was
felt to be secondary to her dementia. She remained on IV
antibiotics for possible infectious etiology for seizure;
although this was less likely, this was a low probability.
The patient had episodes of semi appropriate responses and
answers to questions.

On [**2-6**], the patient underwent a right arm AV
fistulogram and a venogram via the right common femoral vein
catheter. A catheter was placed with the SVC that
demonstrated an approximately 2-cm occlusion extending from
the right brachiocephalic vein to the upstream portion of the
superior vena cava. Extensive venous collaterals were
demonstrated at the right upper chest, shoulder, and the
right upper arm. The recanalization of occlusion with a 0.035
glide wire was unsuccessful.

On [**2-8**], the patient underwent an MRI of the chest and
mediastinum to evaluate the left arm for future access to
rule out central stenosis. This study demonstrated a widely
patent left subclavian vein, internal jugular vein,
brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava. An occlusive
thrombus was noted within the right brachiocephalic vein with
partially occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein. No
flow was seen in the right internal jugular vein. Enhancement
of the vessel walls suggested subacute age, probably within 2
weeks. A 2.5-cm peripheral lung lesion with T2 hyperintense
center and rim enhancement was noted. Findings were noted to
be possibly related to infection; although given thrombus
seen within the central right veins, a septic emboli and
infarct were also amongst the differential diagnoses. The
differential diagnoses included neoplasm. After discussion of
MRI findings with the patient's daughter, a chest CT without
contrast was done to evaluate the left upper lobe lesion.
This was confirmed by CT. A left upper lobe peripheral
pleural based mass like opacity was noted. A small cavitation
was seen on the reformatted images. Given this rapid
development compared to a chest radiograph from [**2174-12-16**] a neoplasm seemed unlikely.

PLAN THIS HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated by
physical therapy. PT recommended for strengthening and
safety. The patient's daughter called and noted that the
patient was unsafe at home. She was afraid to take the
patient home and wanted the patient to be placed in a nursing
home. Social service was consulted and followed along
closely. The patient has been living at [**Hospital3 2558**] and
did have a bed to return to. Throughout the remainder of this
hospital stay the patient was relatively cooperative. She did
have a one-to-one sitter. A one-to-one sitter was stopped
after her left groin temporary hemodialysis catheter was
removed. Her vital signs were stable. She continued on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone for empiric treatment for
meningitis; although this was felt to be low probability, and
her mental status changes were attributed to uremia and
dementia. An EEG was recommended by neurology. It was felt
that this could be done as an outpatient
