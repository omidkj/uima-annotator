HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, a 64-year-old male with
coronary artery disease status post recent non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction with stenting of the left anterior
descending artery x2 presents with a left chest pain and
pressure beginning at 10 pm the night prior to admission
while at rest.  Patient improved with Protonix, sublingual
nitroglycerin x1, but pressure persisted.  The patient called
ambulance, was given aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin x2
with resolution of symptoms.  Patient stated the pain was
same as prior episode of left chest pain, no radiation, no
shortness of breath, no back or abdominal pain, no cough, no
nausea or vomiting.  No palpitations.  Currently was pain
free on admission.  Heparin was started in the Emergency
Department.

Patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation with a few crackles at the base.  Heart
rate was irregularly, irregular.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**2165-1-16**].  The patient had a catheterization which found
three vessel disease, had stents placed in the left anterior
descending artery x2, and had a subsequent gastrointestinal
bleed.  An echocardiogram on [**1-18**] showed left
ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of greater than
55%, 1+ AR.
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. End-stage renal disease on dialysis Monday, Wednesday,
Friday.
4. Pancreatitis.
5. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Hypertension.
7. Diverticulosis.
8. Gout.
9. History of cerebrovascular accident in [**2159**].
10. Hematemesis in [**2157**].  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy done at
[**Hospital1 **].
11. Fistula repairs done on [**1-15**].

MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75.
2. Enalapril 20.
3. Labetalol 200.
4. Isordil 20 tid.
5. Clonidine patch #3 every Monday.

8. Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **].
9. Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of smoking or alcohol.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 9.0, hematocrit of
30, platelets of 198.  Electrolytes were 138, 3.6, 97, 24,
62, 9.0, and 147.  PT is 13.4, INR 1.2, PTT 32.  Patient had
a CK of 46, troponin of 1.8.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed Q wave in lead III, 70s versus
flutter with variable block.

CHEST X-RAY:  Showed no infiltrates and no effusions.

The patient was admitted and underwent a second
catheterization which showed 80% instent restenosis in the
proximal stent in the left anterior descending artery and a
50% restenosis in the distal stent, 80% complex bifurcation
stenosis involving enlarged branching OM and a tortuous
vessel with severe diffuse disease with 80% in the right
coronary artery.

Preoperative cardiac evaluation had  mention of an atrial
fibrillation/flutter this admission, but the arrhythmia was
not deemed sufficient significance to provide additional
surgical risk.  The patient was explained his increased risk
due to his other medical conditions.  He understood and
agreed to proceed.  The patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x3 with a LIMA to the left anterior descending
artery, saphenous vein graft to the DRCA and saphenous vein
graft to the OM.  The patient tolerated the procedure without
complication, extubated on postoperative day one, had an
episode of atrial fibrillation, which resolved.

On postoperative day two, the patient continued to well, and
continued to attend his hemodialysis sessions without
problems.  The patient had some issues with hypertension
being controlled on a nitrodrip.  Progress was made onto oral
medications and patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #4.  The patient continued to do very well,
and was evaluated by Physical Therapy.  It was believed that
Mr. [**Known lastname **] would benefit from a stay in the rehabilitation
facility before returning to live with his daughters.  The
patient was tolerating po intake, had good pain control, and
was with good blood pressure control on oral medications.
Patient was felt to be ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six
weeks and with his primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-20**] weeks.
