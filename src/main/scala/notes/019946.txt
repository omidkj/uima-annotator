Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
acute onset chest pain/shortness of
breath/hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2190-10-5**]
Drainage of pericardial effusion


History of Present Illness:
71 yo s/p AVR/CABGx2 on 8/ whose post
op course was complicated by ileus, was discharged to rehab on
[**9-30**].  He states he was having a bad day, unable to eat anything
or urinate, and while straining to urinate he developed acute
onset chest pain similar to what he felt prior to his surgery
with associated shortness of breath.  The rehab called 911 and
he
was brought in for further evaluateion.  In the Ed he was found
to have >2mm ST elevation in leads 2,3,aVf, V4, V5 and V6 with
ST
depression in aVR.  Patient was taken to the cath lab by
cardiology for evaluation of his grafts.

Pertinent Results:
[**2190-10-5**] Echo
Conclusions
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
large pericardial effusion which is largest posterior to the
left ventricle and is small anterior to the right ventricle and
small to moderate anterior to the right atrioventricular groove.
There is some stranding/organization in the pericardial space,
particularly anteriorly. There is mild indentation of the right
atrium without collapse. No right ventricular collpapse is seen.
There is some phasic motion of the interventricular septum.
There is probably mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared to the prior study of [**2190-10-4**], the pericardial
effusion appears larger, particularly posterior.
.
[**2190-10-9**] Echo:
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.
There is a tiny small pericardial effusion, primarily apical
with the patient in the supine position.

IMPRESSION: Tiny residual pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-10-5**],
pericardial effusion is much smaller.


Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac cath showed patent grafts.  He was returned to the CVICU
for further observation.  He was kept NPO and had an NGT placed
for an ileus on KUB, which would resolve. He tolerated a full
diet and regained bowel function prior to discharge.  He went
into acute renal failure with creatinine peak of 4.9.  Renal
function would recover and urine output increased.  Creatinine
returned to baseline of 1.0 prior to discharge.  Echo revealed
pericardial effusion and the patient was returned to the
Operating Room on [**10-5**] for exploration and evacuation of
pericardial effusion.  He tolerated this well and returned to
the CVICU for observation and recovery.  He continued to make
progress and was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD 2.
AFib persisted and coumadin was resumed.  Follow-up echo
revealed trace pericardial effusion with EF 55%.  He was
discharged to the MACU at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
