left circumflex 90% OM2 and right coronary totally occluded
proximally, left greater than right.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, elderly
pleasant woman in moderate respiratory distress with audible
wheeze.  Neck:  Supple, obese, unable to use jugular venous
distention.  Lungs:  Wheezing bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service and underwent carotid study on [**2187-3-22**], which
showed narrowing of 40 to 59% bilaterally of the internal
carotid arteries and right subclavian steal.  A Vascular
Surgery consultation was called regarding the subclavian
steal and no vascular intervention was recommended at that
time.

Initially, the patient was refusing surgery.  On [**2187-3-25**],
a Cardiac Surgery consultation was called as the patient
seemed to change her mind regarding the intervention.
Although the patient was high-risk for coronary artery bypass
graft it seemed to be the best option for the patient.  This
was explained to her.  A consent was signed on [**2187-3-25**].

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2187-3-26**],
for a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
reverse saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery and to
obtuse marginal.  The morning of postoperative day number
one, the patient was re-intubated for poor oxygenation and
mental status changes.

A Pulmonary consultation was obtained and they suggested
aggressive diuresis with a wedge pressure of 10 to 15 as
goal.  The patient received two units of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 23.5 on postoperative day number
one.  A ventilator wean was started on postoperative day
number three and the patient was extubated.  The patient
continued to require chest PT and suctioning for good
pulmonary toilet, but the patient did not require
re-intubation.

On postoperative day number five, the patient had an episode
of atrial fibrillation.  The patient was given Amiodarone
p.o. and spontaneously converted to sinus.  The patient
continued to improve and by postoperative day number nine was
off all drips.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day nine.  On postoperative day number ten, the
patient's wires and Foley catheter were removed.  Physical
Therapy worked with the patient on postoperative day number
ten and recommended rehabilitation facility.

On postoperative day number eleven, the patient was
discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
