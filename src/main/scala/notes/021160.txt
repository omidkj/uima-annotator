History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 y.o. male transferred from OSH with large left SDH.
 Per reports family state that he was drinking all night and
became more confused and was not responding to verbal stimuli.
He was taken to [**Hospital1 **] MC where a HCT showed a large acute on
chronic L SDH ~2.8cm wtih greater than 1.5cm shift.  He was
intubated and sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further

injury.

Pertinent Results:
[**7-10**] CT Head- IMPRESSION:
1. Status post surgical evacuation of large compressive left
subdural
hematoma with significantly improved mass effect on the
underlying brain, with decreased right shift and subfalcine,
transtentorial, and uncal herniation.  No new focal hemorrhage.
2. Stable subcentimeter right frontal lobe hypodensity.

[**7-10**] CXR
 Marked increase of now large pneumothorax with near complete
collapse of the left lung and early signs of tension.

[**7-11**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is further
improvement. No left apical pneumothorax is seen on today's
image. Along the cardiac silhouette, a band-like lucency
suggests the presence of a minimal amount of intrapleural air.

[**7-11**] MRI Brain- IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarct involving the anterior aspect of the left
temporal lobe and smaller infarct within the left subinsular
white matter and left putamen.  Smaller infarcts are also seen
in the left posterior temporal/anterior parietal cortex
inferiorly and within the adjacent white matter.
2. Expected changes from recent left craniotomy for subdural
hematoma
evacuation with slight interval decrease in amount of
pneumocephalus and
slight interval decrease in mass effect, when compared to the
recent
postoperative CT. There remains rightward midline shift of the
septum
pellucidum, and enlargement of the right lateral ventricle which
has improved slightly compared to prior.

[**7-13**] CXR
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left
chest tube has
been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Suggestion of some
increasing opacification at the right base that could represent
atelectasis or possibly supervening pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting. In addition, in view of the enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette, some of the opacification is consistent with
engorged pulmonary vessels and elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.

[**7-21**] LENIS
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.

[**7-21**] Head CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Small predominantly low signal density, residual left
subdural collection with post-craniotomy changes and overlying
extracranial soft tissue thickening.

2. Mild residual shift of midline structures without
hydrocephalus or
intra-axial bleeding.

3. Left temporal encephalomalacia.

4. Unchanged hypodensity adjacent to the right frontal lateral
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] and the
lateral ventricle.

[**7-23**] CXR
The left subclavian line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is unremarkable. Contrast
material is noted in the esophagus and stomach. There is
interval improvement in widespread
parenchymal opacities.

[**7-23**] Video swallow
IMPRESSION:
Trace aspiration with administration of thin liquids. An episode
of
penetration but no aspiration with administration of nectar.






Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED he was given 100g mannitol, 40mg Lasix, and the HOB
was elevated > 30.
Patient was taken emergently from the emergency room to the OR
for evacuation of the SDH. Surgery was without complication.
Post operatively he was noted to be not moving the left side and
minimally withdrew to stimuli. Post op Head CT revealed improved
MLS and hematoma evac with pneumocephalus. FFP & Vit K was given
for elevated INR, PRBC's were given for decreased HCT and
Platelets. dilantin bolus was given for subtherapeutic level. A
central line placement was complicated by pneumothorax in the
afternoon of [**7-10**] therefore a chest tube was placed. An MRI was
ordered due to the continued somnolence and left hemiparesis.
This was performed overnight and revealed acute infarct
involving the anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe and
smaller infarct within the left subinsular white matter and left
putamen.  Smaller infarcts are also seen in the left posterior
temporal/anterior
parietal cortex inferiorly and within the adjacent white matter.

 On [**7-11**] his neurological exam was stable. SBP was liberalized to
160 but he was kept on close neuro checks.
 On [**7-12**] he was again neurologically stable, but slightly more
wakeful. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital
aquired pneumonia.
 On [**7-13**] his chest tube was DC'd without complication. A chest x
ray showed no residual pneumothorax.
 On [**7-14**] he was extubated without difficulty. His neuro exam
improved on this day and his eyes were open spontaneously, he
was talkative though he was not oriented to self, year or
location. He moved all extremities spontaneously.
 On [**7-16**] he was transferred to the floor in stable condition. On
[**7-17**], his dilantin level was low, his dose was increased to 200mg
TID. He remained stable otherwise.
 On [**7-18**], patient's exam unchanged. Dilantin level was 7.0
despite increase in dose, he was changed to keppra. Speech and
swallow is to re-evaluate today.
 On [**7-19**], the patient's exam seemed to slowly improve although he
remained uncooperative, NGT was self dc'd and replaced by house
staff. MS improved somewhat
 On [**7-20**], self dc'd NGT again, replaced again after evaluation
from speech and swallow who recommended video swallow study on
Monday vs going ahead with PEG due to pt mental status.
 On [**7-21**], he had screening LENIS. He thought to be more
lethargic so a Head CT was done which was stable.
 On [**7-23**], sutures were d/c'ed, pulled NGT out x2, febrile to
102.9, tylenol with good effect, cultured blood/urine/cxr,
repleated K. Passed video S&S.
 On [**7-24**] he was taking a PO diet and was on calorie counts. He
worked with PT and OT and awaited rehab placement.
On [**7-25**] he was accepted to rehab and was discharged in the
afternoon with instructions for continued care and follow-up
