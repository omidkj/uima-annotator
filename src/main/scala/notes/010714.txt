Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 33815**] is a 79-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG
times three vessels in [**2193**] (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 **]),
who currently presents with increasing chest pain with
shortness of breath times duration of past one year.  Patient
has been known to have had aortic stenosis which had been
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7659**] for many years.  Cardiac
catheterization today revealed three widely patent grafts,
however, aortic valve area was 0.9, indicating significant
aortic stenosis.  The patient was referred to Cardiothoracic
Surgery at this time for aortic valve replacement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 99, pulse 75
and sinus, blood pressure 126/66, respirations 18, 94%
saturation on room air.  HEENT: Sclerae are anicteric.
Cranial nerves II-XII intact.  Mucous membranes moist.  No
evidence of oral ulcers.  No cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Sternotomy signs.
No evidence of erythema, no evidence of drainage.  Sternum
was stable to palpation.  No click elicited.  Cardiac:
Regular rhythm and rate.  No evidence of murmur.  Abdomen:
Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Soft,
nondistended, nontender.  No inguinal lymphadenopathy noted.
Extremities: +1 edema symmetric.  No evidence of rash.

PERTINENT LABS:  [**2201-5-15**] - White blood cells 12.7, hematocrit
34, platelets 333.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, glucose 105.  PT
15.9, PTT 60.7, INR 1.7.  Calcium 8.9, phosphorus 3.7,
magnesium 2.1.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 33815**] is a 79-year-old male
with a history of significant aortic stenosis status post
CABG times three V in [**2193**], who presented to the
Cardiothoracic Service for AVR.  Upon successful completion
of preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent an
uncomplicated aortic valve replacement on [**2201-5-6**] (21 mm C-E
pericardial valve).  Postoperatively, the patient was
maintained intubated and sedated on propofol and taken to the
CSRU for close observation.  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm with no evidence of ectopy at this time.  The patient
was started on diuresis and given CPAP trial for weaning to
extubation.

By postoperative day number two, the patient was extubated,
however, the patient developed atrial flutter which was
controlled with Lopressor.  Atrial flutter resolved, however,
throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient
developed intermittent atrial fibrillation which lasted less
than one minute.  Given this finding, the patient was
initiated on heparin anticoagulation with target INR between
2.0-2.5.

By postoperative day number three, the patient was doing
well, transferred to the floor.  However, the patient
developed persistent cough with decreased breath sounds over
the right lower chest with subsequent chest x-ray findings
consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient was
initiated on levofloxacin and closely monitored.  By [**2201-5-13**],
the patient's respiratory symptoms had completely resolved
and repeat chest x-ray revealed almost complete resolution of
the right lower lobe consolidation.  The patient's clinical
status had, also, dramatically improved, allowing achievement
of level-5 physical therapy status which is the discharge
criteria for patient's being able to return home without
rehabilitation.

By [**2201-5-15**], the patient's INR was 1.7 after having received 3
mg of Coumadin for the past three days.  At this time, the
decision was made to discharge the patient in good condition
to home with a follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7659**] on [**5-18**] at 3
p.m. for evaluation of Coumadin level and effectiveness of
anticoagulation therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post aortic valve replacement (21 mm pericardial
valve).
2.  Atrial flutter and intermittent atrial fibrillation -
anticoagulation.
3.  Postoperative pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix, 20 mg PO b.i.d. times seven days.
2.  Metoprolol, 125 mg PO b.i.d..
3.  Levofloxacin, 500 mg PO q d times eight days for a total
of two week treatment of pneumonia.
4.  Potassium chloride, 20 mEq b.i.d. times seven days while
taking Lasix.
5.  Colace, 100 mg PO b.i.d..
6.  Percocet, one to two tablets PO q 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain.
7.  Coumadin, 3 mg on [**5-16**], [**5-17**].  On [**5-18**], patient is
to have INR level checked and needs to meet with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7659**] at his office at 3 p.m. for Coumadin re-dosing.
