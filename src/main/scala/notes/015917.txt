History of Present Illness:
66F with ESRD on HD complicated by calciphylaxis, atrial
fibrillation on lovenox, DM2, OSA, hypothyroidism, HL,
depression presenting with hypotension from [**Month/Day/Year 2286**],
generalized weakness, fever/chills in setting of nausea/vomiting
for one day.

Of note, she was recently admitted from [**2108-7-31**] to [**2108-8-10**] for
weakness and melena concerning for GIB in setting of INR > 19.
She was admitted to the ICU s/p six units of pRBC. Endoscopy was
within normal limits. Her hospital course was complicated by
calciphylaxis. Pain management was also an issue with IV
dilaudid, PCA, and fentanyl patch being utilized.  She was
discharged to rehab on lovenox for anticoagulation, sodium
thiosulfate for calciphlaxis, PO dilaudid, fentanyl patch, and
APAP for pain.

Patient endorses a 3-day history of poor PO intake with weight
loss over the past month. She has apparently been receiving
extra sessions on Thursday for ultrafiltration per [**Hospital 100**] rehab
notes. She received [**Hospital 2286**] on day of admission with HD stopped
after approximately 3.7 L was removed secondary to shivering,
RVR to 130s, and asymptomatic SBP drop to mid-80s. She was given
500 cc back. For her fever, she was cultured and started on
vancomycin and imipenum.

In the ED, initial vs were: 99.5 [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96398**] 18 99% 4L. Exam
notable for systolic blood pressures ranging between 69 and 90.
Afebrile throughout stay. Diffuse abdominal tenderness to
palpation but no rebound or guarding. CT abdomen given diffuse
abdominal ttp and vomiting in the setting of a febrile with no
acute process. Given the concern for hypotension in the setting
