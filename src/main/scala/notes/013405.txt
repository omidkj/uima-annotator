Imaging:

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
3. Mild sinus disease.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-12-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Extensive multilevel degenerative changes.
.
CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-19**]
1. Distal femur fracture. No concerning lesions to suggest
pathologic
fracture.
2. Severe osteoathritis with large loose bodies, including one
superior to
the patella.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2136-12-20**]
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-20**]
Five images obtained during fluoroscopy of the open reduction
internal
fixation of the distal femoral fracture were reviewed. The study
demonstrates the sequential process of open reduction internal
fixation. The fixation plate and the screw devices appears to be
unremarkable. One of the screws is not attached to the fixation
plate and should be correlated with its desirable position, most
likely is supporting fracture line. For precise details please
review the procedure report.
.
FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-25**]
1. No acute fracture is seen.
2. There are degenerative changes particularly at the MTP joints
with normal alignment.
3. There is considerable soft tissue swelling.
.
ECHO Study Date [**2136-12-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric
hypertrophy. Difficult to assess left ventricular function given
limited windows, but appears probably globally normal. Severe
pulmonary hypertension.

Endoscopy: A few small benign appearing polyps noted in the
stomach body. No obvious causes of dysphagia noted by EGD
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Sigmoidoscopy: Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids (biopsy)
Stool in the colon. Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to
recto-sigmoid junction. Recommendations: Return patient to
floor.
Await biopsy reports. Start Anusol-HC 2.5% rectal cream tid for
hemorrhoids. Recommend manometry if the symptoms of incontinence
do not resolve with treatment of hemorrhoids. Pt needs to follow
up with outpatient GI.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83991**] presented to the Emergency Department with a left
femur fracture. She was evaluated by the Orthopaedics
department. She was admitted, consented, and medically cleared
for surgery. She was prepped and brought to the operating room
for a left femur ORIF. She tolerated the procedure well without
any complication. Post-operatively, she was transferred to the
PACU and floor for further recovery. On POD#1, she was
transfused 1u PRBC for postoperative anemia.

Her course was complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR
resulting in flash pulmonary edema.  She required a short MICU
stay.  Her home atenolol was changed to metoprolol and this was
titrated up.  She remains in sinus rhythm on metoprolol.  She
was diuresed with IV Lasix and is now doing well.

Her issues include:
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient went into atrial fibrillation
post-operatively and once when she missed one of her doses of
metoprolol. This was likely a stress reaction in the
postoperative course.  Metoprolol was titrated up for rate
control.  She does not have a history of atrial fibrillation.
She should follow up with her PCP.
.
# Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute, now resolved:
Patient had pulmonary volume overload after IVFs.  She was
diuresed with IV Lasix.  ECHO was suboptimal but did not show
systolic dysfunction.  She likely has diastolic dysfunction
given her age and history of hypertension. She is discharged on
her home ACE-I and a beta blocker.
.
# Left femur fracture, s/p ORIF:  She is working with PT. We
will continue her on Lovenox for a total of 4 weeks.   She is
currently touch down weight bearing on the left lower extremity.
.
# ARF:  Her Cr had peaked at 1.4 and is now at baseline of 1.0.
This was felt to be secondary to volume depletion and resolved
with additional fluids.
.
# LLL effusion:  Seen on CXR [**12-23**]. This was likely related to
volume overload/post op atelactasis.  She should continue with
IS. She has been afebrile.
.
# Aspiraton: Patient was seen by speech and swallow.  A video
study showed that she was retaining food in her esophagus. She
was evaluated by GI. An endoscopy was performed which did not
show a reason for this problem. She also had a flexible
sigmoidoscopy for fecal incontinence prior to her surgery. She
had grade 2 hemorrhoids. It was recommend that she use a Anusol.
She had several biopsies taken and was to follow up with a GI
doctor closer to her home. She can have meds crushed with
applesauce and thickened liquids. She can eat ground solids and
nectar thick liquids.
