Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Dissected LAD during cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement x 3
Diagnostic catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81 y.o. man PMHx with atrial fibrillation, HTN, HLD and
presented to OSH on [**2167-9-4**] secondary to acute onset chest pain
at rest and overwhelming fatigue.  While the patient was at the
office he started to feel a heaviness above his sternum that did
not radiate.  The chest pain was associated with diaphoresis,
but not shortness of breath.  He went to emergency department.
At OSH the patient was found to have a troponin leak of 0.23.
The patient had anticoagulation reversed and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catherization.

During the cardiac catherization the LAD was found to have a 40%
proximal stenosis, 50-60% diffuse stenosis in the mid-LAD, and a
focal 95% stenosis in the distal LAD.  While attempting to
deliver a  stent across the LAD lesions the wire was lost and
the mid and distal LAD were dissected.  A balloon was used to
tack up the dissection.  Three endeavor stents were deployed
overlapping and post-dilated to 3 mm.  The post angiography
revealed normal flow and no residual stenosis.  The distal
dissection was observed to be stable and was not flow limiting.
He was started on integrillin and admitted to the CCU overnight
for close monitoring.  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
the procedure.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CATH REPORT [**2167-9-10**]: COMMENTS:
Limited coronary angiography was done of left coronary system.
Seperate ostia  for LAD and LCX. Only LAD engaged selectively
LAD-Widely patent stents. No visible dissection. Mid vessel 40%
stenosis. Diagonal 70% proximal stenosis
LCX: mild disease (unchanged)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Widely patent stents in LAD.
2. Continue current medical management

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y.o. man with chronic atrial fibrillation, HTN, HLD, DM, and
new onset chest pain admited to CCU after cardiac
catheterization was complicated by left anterior descending
artery dissection, s/p 3 stents.

# LAD dissection s/p stent placements: CCU course was
uncomplicated. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and
without evidence of tamponade. Integrillin was continued for 18h
post cath per protocol, and ASA 325 mg daily was started;
Clopidogrel 75 mg daily was also started for a planned course of
6 months. Repeat catheterization on [**9-10**] showed no visible
dissection with widely patent stents.

# CAD/Angina: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
throughout the hospitalization. He had 2 bouts of chest pain in
the setting of no ischemic changes on EKG. Discharged on ASA,
Plavix, Statin.

# Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: Remained well rate controlled on
Digoxin 0.25mg daily (same as home dose) and Diltiazem 60mg TID
(home dose, Cartia XT 180mg daily). As recommended by his
primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**], he was discharged on his
home regimen without changes. Prior to discharge, the patient
was started on ASA 81mg daily and 5 mg Coumadin for
anticoagulation.

# HTN: He remained normotensive throughout the hospitalization.
The patient's daily 40mg Lasix dose was held during the
hospitaliation and restarted prior to discharge.

# Diabetes: Blood sugars remained well controlled on an ISS. His
home metformin dose was restarted prior to discharge.

# GERD: Omeprazole was stopped and Ranitidine was started given
initiation of Plavix.

The patient was full code for this admission.
