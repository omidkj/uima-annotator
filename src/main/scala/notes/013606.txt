Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital3 105**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with removal of tracheal granulation tissue,
tracheal dilation and tracheostomy tube change


History of Present Illness:
71F transferred from [**Hospital3 105**] for evaluation of blocked
tracheostomy tube, increasing ventilatory pressures. Initially
at [**Hospital1 **] with trach in place and then she had increasing PEEP
and bronch showed 90% stenosis distal to ostomy site. Pt sent to
[**Hospital3 **] to have trached changed. On [**3-28**], pt sent to [**Hospital1 1774**]
where trach changed to Shiley #7. Bronchoscopy there showed
granulation tissue and edema.  Transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] and
tolerated trach for a while and then became increasingly
difficult to ventilate, now granulation tissue at distal portion
of trach. On [**4-18**] RT noticed increased airway pressure and
replaced T tube with Portex #7 fenestrated tube. Today pt had
respiratory arrest and had ET tube passed and non-fenestrated
tube placed. Transferred for another change of trach in OR.
Transferred on AC 600 X 12 FiO2 50%.

Past Medical History:
-- Admitted [**12-9**] to [**Location (un) 48951**]with respiratory failure.
Found unresponsive at home, intubated in the field.  In ED found
to be in 3rd degree HB with rate of 20 requiring external PCM.
Pt also had R sided PNA and MRSA bacteremia. Tx with Vancomycin
and ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for vent weaning.
Failed vent weaning and was trached. Also with Klebsiella
UTI/PNA.  Tx with Vanc and Imipenem.  Pt then found to have LLL
infiltrate with pleural effusion (Klebsiella empyema) that was
drained by thoracentesis and then chest tube placed (removed
[**2110-3-14**]).

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-4-22**] 1:58 PM
CHEST AP: A lucency is visualized in the right apex and at the
right lung base. Due to the marked obliquity of this chest
x-ray. There is cardiomegaly. The patient is status post
tracheostomy. Right-sided effusion is visualized. Emphysematous
changes are present.

IMPRESSION: Lucencies in the right apical and basilar regions,
which could represent a pneumothorax. Due to marked obliquity of
this examination, the assessment is difficult. A repeat chest
x-ray is recommended.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-4-23**] 1:09 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.

CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2110-4-23**] 1:08 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. High-grade tracheal stenosis immediately below the
tracheostomy which its lower part most probably is due to
extensive granulation tissue. High-grade narrowing above the
tube insertion may be due to granulation tissue and/or edema.
2. Moderate right-sided pneumothorax. These findings were
reported to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
3. Loculated moderate right pleural effusion and small left one
which suggests lung atelectasis.
4. Cardiomegaly.
5. Suspected splenic artery aneurysm. Hypodense lesion in the
left kidney, further evaluation with ultrasound is recommended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-4-24**] 6:29 PM
IMPRESSION:
1) Tracheostomy tip advanced, now approximately 3 cm above the
carina.
2) Ovoid lucencies in the right medial upper lung zone and large
lucency at the right lung base likely residual pneumothorax,
allowing for differences in positioning, not significantly
changed from the prior study.
3) Opacity in the right lower lung zone, corresponds to the
known loculated effusion seen on the prior CT.
4) Retrocardiac oapcity, likely effusion and/or consolidation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-4-24**] 8:02 AM
IMPRESSION: Improvement of the right pneumothorax.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2110-4-24**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion
is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Tracheal stenosis: The patient was admitted with tracheal
stenosis confirmed by bronchoscopy and tracheal CT. This was
relieved [**4-24**] by trach change to longer 8 [**Doctor Last Name 66741**] without
complication. She was discharged on pressure support [**10-9**] on 30%
oxygen breathing comfortably. She should return in approximately
1 month for another trach replacement.

2) Right sided ptx: Incidentally noted was a right sided
pneumothorax. This was followed with serial chest X-rays and
thoracentesis or chest tube were not felt to be indicated.

3) Splenic aneurism and kidney hypodensity, incedental. The
patient was noted to have these findings on CT. Outpatient
ultrasound can be considered to follow up these findings.

4) Hyptertension: the patient was noted to have hypertension to
the 130-170s and was treated with her usual medications
(clonidine patch, coreg, lasix), except captopril was
discontinued in favor of hydralazine as her creatinine was
increasing.

5) History of CHF: She is on bet blockade but no ACE inhibitor,
which was not felt to be necessary as her echo showed EF 60%,
1+AR, no WMA. She was continued on lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **].

6) DM2: She was continued on lantus 24 QHS with TFs (Glucerna),
ISS, and reglan for gastroparesis.

7) Depression: Celexa was continued.

8) Anemia of chronic disease: She is on iron and Epo
