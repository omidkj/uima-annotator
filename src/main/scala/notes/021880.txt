IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple tiny calcifications at the renal hila are most
likely vascular.
Possible small calculus in the right kidney, which is not
causing any
obstruction.

2. Thick-walled bladder with intraluminal air, which may be due
to recent
instrumentation but could also be due to chronic cystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female multiple medical problems including type 1
diabetes, peripheral vascular disease s/p BKA with multiple
revisions (most recently [**2113-9-4**]) and wound infections, ESBL
klebsiella urosepsis, C.diffile colitis presents with fever and
hypotension.
.
#SEPSIS: She was admitted to the medical ICU given her SIRS
criteria (fever, leukocytosis) and hypotension concerning for
septic shock. There was suspicion of urinary source of infection
given her risk factors and history of multi-drug resistant
organisms. She was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics. Her
foley catheter was changed. The hypotension was fluid responsive
and she did not require vasopressors. Her antibiotics were
narrowed to Meropenem and PO vancomycin to prevent C. Diff
colitis given her history. Her urine ultiamtely grew
pan-resistant Klebsiella Pneumonia.  Even though her urine was
not sensitive to meropenem, she improved and had no further
fevers. ID was consulted for this complicated infection. She
completed an entire 7 day course of antibiotics for her UTI.

#Urinary Incontinence: Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction from
diabetes has put patient at higher risk for developed recurrent
UTIs. Urology was called and will meet with her outpatient to
teach her CIC and learn to self-catheterize herself to decrease
her UTIs. Urology will also present the idea of an appendicela
conduit if patient continues to get repeated UTIs. Pt went home
with diapers until her appointment with urology in 1 day.
.
#HISTORY OF C. DIFF COLITIS: She was noted to have large volumes
of stool, although this was after receiving kayexcelate. C.
difficile was sent and returned negative. She was continued
emperically on PO vancomycin while she was on antibiotics.
.
#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Baseline creatinine of 1.1-1.2 with
elevated creatinine to 1.5. Likely pre-renal in setting of
fever, poor po. Her Cr dropped with fluid hydration and it was
0.9 on day of discharge.
.
#HYPERKALEMIA: Pt's K was elevated on admission, most likely [**3-7**]
ARF and lisinopril. Lisinopril was held. Cr improved with IVF.
.
#DIABETES: Patient had several episodes of hyperglycemia up to
the 400s and hypoglycemia down to the 30s. She was put on an
insulin sliding scale throughout her hospitalization with
adjusted parameters based on her glucose level. Pt has history
of brittle diabetes per OMR notes, likely explaining her range
of glucose levels. Pt told to continue her home insulin regimen
and follow with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
#HYPERTENSION: Her home metoprolol and lisinopril were initially
held in seting of SIRS on admission. Metoprolol and lisinopril
were added back after pts BP normalized.
.
#NEUROPATHY: Continued her home medications for neuropathy.
