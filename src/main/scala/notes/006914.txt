Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2193-1-20**]:
FINDINGS: An evolving infarction in the superior right middle
cerebral artery territory is again seen. Previously noted foci
of hemorrhage within the infarction is slightly less dense.
Multiple other previously described foci of parenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage have become slightly less dense as well.
Hyperdense subdural blood remains present along the left
tentorium. There is no evidence of new acute hemorrhage. The
hypodense left frontal subdural collection is stable in size.
Moderate diffuse ventricular dilatation is stable, with blood
again seen in the posterior lateral ventricles. There is no
evidence of new cerebral edema or new major vascular territorial
infarction.

There is mucosal thickening and aerosolized secretions in the
right sphenoid sinus.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving subacute infarction in the right superior middle
cerebral artery territory with slightly decreased density of
blood products.
2. Expected evolution of intra-axial and extra-axial
intracranial hemorrhage. No evidence of new acute hemorrhage.
3. Stable chronic subdural collection along the left convexity.

4. Stable diffuse ventricular dilatation with stable
intraventricular
hemorrhage.

CXR [**2193-1-19**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study [**1-19**], the opacification at
both bases persists, most likely reflecting bilateral
atelectasis. The possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot
definitely excluded in the absence of a lateral view.

The degree of free intraperitoneal gas is decreased, a finding
related to
prior tube placement.

Tracheostomy tube and right central catheter remain in place.

Upper Extremity U/S Right [**2194-1-23**]:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right axillary and upper right
basilic veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU  after having an MVA and was
intubated and sedated. On repeat imaging his bleeds were
increasing. Therefore on [**2194-1-11**] a bolt was placed to monitor
ICP. Additionally it was felt that his neuro exam was slightly
worse. His ICP remained normal and the bolt was removed on
[**2194-1-13**]. The patient received a trach and peg on [**2193-1-16**] as he
was unable to be extubated. His family consented to this
procedure but they did make his code status DNR.

On [**1-17**] the patient was found to have drainage from the wound on
his right elbow. This wound was from the initial accident. The
culture from the site grew coag. neg. staph. Ortho was consulted
who recommended dressing changes [**Hospital1 **]. The WBC was 18 that day as
well. The following day CXR revealed a new infiltrate. ID was
consulted and the patient was placed on triple antibiotics for a
ventilator-associated-pneumonia. The WBC started to decrease and
the neuro exam remained stable.

He was transferred to the neuro stepdown unit on [**1-20**]. His exam
has remained unchanged. He opens his eyes slightly and has
purposeful movement with RUE. LUE has no withdrawal. He moves
his legs spontaneously.

The patient was treated for a pneumonia and completed his course
of antibiotics. He has been afebrile for several days and his
WBC is trending down. His oxygen requirement has been stable.

The patient was noted to not be moving the RUE very often and
nursing felt that he as guarding it. A clavicle fx was found
which is non-displaced. He does not need surgery on it and has
no restrictions for ROM or weightbearing on the arm.

The patient was evaluated by PT and OT who recommended rehab. He
is currently on a trach mask and is not requiring frequent
suctioning. He will be discharged today [**2194-1-28**].
