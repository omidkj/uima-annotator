History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old man with a PMH significant for
unilateral kidney, ADHD, and hyperlipidemia who presents with
chest pain. He was running up a [**Doctor Last Name **] to catch at bus at 3:30 on
[**2117-12-24**], when he noted some substernal nonradiating, pleuritic
chest pain, which lasted 10 minutes, and then resolved with
rest. He then had a reoccurance of this same pain at 7:30 PM,
and a friend with him noted him to be pale and diaphoretic, and
so he was brought to [**Hospital1 **]-N ER. He was noted to have some TWI on
his EKG, but notably had a tropinin of 0.075, and so got a total
of 325 mg ASA and was started on a heparin gtt.  Other labs were
notable for a Cr of 1.3, Trop 0.075, ALT 61, AST 28. He has no
prior history of CAD, and has never had chest pain like this
before. Overnight, he was started on carvedilol and plavix
loaded.
.
On the morning of [**2117-12-25**], pt had several recurrences of chest
pain, relieved with SL nitro. However, given chronic recurrence
of pain, pt was started on a nitro drip. His pain, however,
continued to worsen and repeat EKG showed new ST elevations in
II, III, avF. He was taken urgently to cath.  Cardiac
catheterization showed thrombus in RPL branch, CTO of the RPDA.
He had 2x drug eluting stents placed in the RPL.  The patient
was hemodynamically stable throughout this uncomplicated
procedure.
.
On arrival to the CCU, he denied chest pain, dyspnea
palpitations, nausea, vomiting.  He reports that he has no prior
history of CAD, and has never had chest pain like this before.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
Cardiac Cath [**2117-12-25**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel distal RCA and RPL branch followed by
deployment of a
3.0 x 18 and a 3.0 x 8 mm Promus drug-eluting stents, reducing a
99%
stenosis to 0% residual stenosis.
3. Patient will remain on aspirin indefinitely and prasugrel for
one
year.

TTE [**2117-12-27**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due
to papillary muscle dysfunction. Pulmonary artery hypertension.

CXR PA and Lateral [**2117-12-28**]:
FINDINGS: No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged, but there is no vascular congestion or pleural
effusion. No definite focal pneumonia.  On the lateral view,
there is suggestion of some increased opacification at the base
in the retrocardiac region. This may well represent only
crowding of vessels and mild atelectasis. However, in the
appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
to be considered.
