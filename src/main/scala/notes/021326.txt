which showed R SDH (reported as 8mm) with no midline shift and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].


Past Medical History:

- rheumatic heart disease c/b mitral stenosis
- status post multiple mitral valve replacements ([**2105**] porcine
mitral valve replacement, [**2115**] redo with a Carbomedics Valve)

now on anticoagulation
- depression/anxiety

HEENT: non-icteric sclera, tympanic membranes clear
CV: irregular rhythm, I/VI SEM
Pulm: expiratory wheeze, clear b/l at bases
Abd: soft, NT, ND
Ext: L LE with extensive bruising

MS: oriented to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Month (only) **] and [**2129**]. Naming intact, fluent
language, repetition intact. Calculation intact w/ no evidence
of
neglect or apraxia.

lower
extremities

Sensation: intact to light touch, pinprick throughout. No
deficits in proprioception.
Coordination: FNF intact w/ no dysmetria, HTS intact with no
dysmetria
Gait: not tested

Exam on discharge:
Intact

Pertinent Results:
EKG: [**2130-9-7**]

Atrial fibrillation. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 with a QRS
duration
of 108 milliseconds. Slight non-specific ST segment depression
in
leads aVF and V3-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-9-14**]
the
ST segment changes are much less prominent than was true at that
time.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interval change.

Carotid doppler:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

CT head [**9-10**]:

Expected evolution of right cerebral convexity acute on
chronic/subacute subdural hematoma. No new hemorrhage is
detected. 2-mm
leftward shift of midline structures and effacement of the right
cerebral
sulci, is unchanged. A slightly dense focus in the right side of
medulla may relate to volume averaging from the adjacent
vertebral artery- attention on follow up.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100329**] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service and
initially went to the Intensive care unit. She was given FFP at
the outside facility to reverse her INR. She was stable in the
ICU overnight and was transferred to the floor. In light of a
mechanical mitral valve since she remained neurologically stable
we only held her Coumadin for 48 hours.

We consulted Neurology for her history of frequent falls. They
recommened holding all of her diuretics, but given her cardiac
history we did not feel like this was safe. We will advise Ms.
[**Known lastname 100329**] to seek close follow up from her cardiologist upon
discharge.

I had a lengthy conversation with the patient, the patient's
husband and son and explained to them the need for close follow
up and monitoring should her balance and headaches not improve
after  some time at rehab. The patient and family seemed to
understand the increase risk and possibility that the Subdural
hematoma may expand when the patient is on Coumadin requiring
surgery.
