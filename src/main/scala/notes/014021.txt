Studies:

RUQ US ([**2158-10-24**]):
1.  Patent hepatic veins with normal pulsatility and without
evidence for
Budd-Chiari.
2.  Moderate amount of ascites, relatively unchanged from prior
CT.
3.  Cirrhosis without focal lesions.

TTE ([**2158-10-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

RUQ US ([**2158-10-31**]):
1.  Cirrhotic liver.  Splenomegaly. Moderate amount of ascites.

2.  Doppler assessment of the main portal vein shows patency and
appropriate directionality of flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25699**] is  a 71 yo female with a PMH of AIH/cryptogenic
cirrhosis and portal hypertension complicated by fluid
retention, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy and HCC s/p RFA
[**2158-10-11**] (solitary 2.0 cm segment III liver lesion), severe AS,
who presented with increasing abdominal pain for 4 days.

# Abdominal Pain: Upon admission the pt reported 4 days of
worsening abdominal pain and distention. This was thought to be
due to post-procedural pain from her recent RFA of an HCC 1.5
weeks prior to admission, as well as distention from ascites
secondary to her cryptogenic cirrhosis. She had a diagnostic
paracentesis performed in the ED which showed no evidence of
SBP. She had a RUQ ultrasound performed which showed patency of
the hepatic vessels, as well as moderate ascites relatively
unchanged from her prior CT scan on [**2158-10-11**]. She was given
oxycodone 5mg Q4H PRN, which adequately controlled her pain. On
[**2158-10-26**] a therapeutic paracentesis was performed with
ultrasound guidance. This markedly improved her pain and
distention. At time of discharge she did not have any abdominal
pain.

# Hypervolemic Hyponatremia: Upon admission the patient's Na was
119, down from a baseline of 125 during her last admission. This
was thought to be due to hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to
her cirrhosis. She was asymptomatic with regards to the
hyponatremia with no mental status changes. She was initially
maintained on 1L of daily fluid restriction, and her home Lasix
and spironolactone were held in order to preserve sodium.
However, over the course of 2 days this did not result in
appreciable increase in her sodium, which ranged from 116-119
from [**Date range (3) 40847**]. As such she was started on Tolvaptan
15mg on [**2158-10-25**], and her fluid restriction was liberalized. Her
Tolvaptan was increased to 30mg daily on [**2158-10-25**] due to no
increase in her sodium on the 15mg dose. She continued to have
poor response to this so it was stopped and she was ultimately
started on CVVH for removal of fluid with resolution of her
hyponatremia. Due to [**Last Name (un) **] (see below) she was continued on
hemodialysis and her diuretics were stopped.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient developed progressive volume
overload that was refractory to diuresis. She was initially
started on octreotide and midodrine out of concern for HRS but
ultimately transitioned to CVVH for removal of approximat
