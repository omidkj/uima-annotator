Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
65 yo F with ESRD s/p renal transplant back on HD, DM type II,
CAD, diastolic CHF, and HTN who presents with acute SOB. Pt went
to usual HD session on Monday and has been adhering to low Na
diet and taking all meds. Was drinking cup of tea yesterday
night when acutely felt SOB and had her daughter call EMS. Pt
denies fevers, + chills but has these at baseline. No cough,
wheezing, CP, HA, neck stiffness, dysuria, diarrhea, or
abdominal pain. Upon EMS arrival, pt reportedly in respiratory
distress with bilateral crackles in lung fields, placed on CPAP
with improvement in tachypnea.

In the ED, T 103.2, BP 244/70, HR 86, RR 29, O2 sat 100% on NRB.
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema, EKG with no new ischemic
changes, UA negative, lactate 2.6. She was given vancomycin 1 gm
IV X 1, levaquin 750 mg IV X 1, ceftriaxone 1 g IV X 1, tylenol
1 gm X 1, lasix 40 IV X 2 then 80 mg IV x1 with 180 cc urine
output, [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg, captopril 6.25 mg X 1, and started on a
nitro gtt which was turned off once SBPs were < 140. CPAP was
reattempted to due tachypnea to 40s, but pt was unable to
tolerate and was placed back on a NRB. She was seen by
nephrology who recommended HD once pt was admitted. As the pt
remained on a NRB, she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
care. Prior to transfer, pt was given 10 units reg insulin, 1
amp D50, and 1 amp CaGluc for K 6.8.
.
Currently, the pt feels her breathing is much better but not
back at baseline. ROS is otherwise notable for occasional mid to
lower back pain, chronic

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2173-12-26**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2173-12-26**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

ECHO [**2173-12-24**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva
manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
No vegetations or abscess seen. Moderate symmetric LVH with
moderate resting LVOT gradient that increased with Valsalva.
Mild aortic stenosis, at least mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-9-21**],
the degree of LVOT gradient has increased. The other findings
are similar.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2173-12-24**] 7:40 PM
FINDINGS: The PICC line tip is at the brachiocephalic/SVC
junction. This finding was discussed with the PICC nurse caring
for the patient on the evening of [**12-24**]. Heart continues
to be severely enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. There is no
new infiltrate.

ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-23**]  10:41:22 AM
Sinus rhythm. Borderline right axis deviation. Minor right
ventricular
conduction delay. Prolonged QTc interval with diffuse
non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2173-12-22**] no major change.


US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR LEFT  [**2173-12-23**] 1:58 PM
FINDINGS: Son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of the patient's AV graft in
the left forearm demonstrates some wall-to-wall flow, with no
evidence of thrombosis. There is no edema of the surrounding
tissues and no fluid collection identified.
IMPRESSION: Patent AV fistula, with no surrounding fluid
collection or edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2173-12-22**] 3:55 AM
AP PORTABLE CHEST: Moderate cardiomegaly and the mediastinal
contours are unchanged. Redemonstrated is severe thoracic
dextroscoliosis. The pulmonary vasculature is less well defined
