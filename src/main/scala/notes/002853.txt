Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the floor and diuresed. TEE on [**12-26**] showed
no thrombus and on [**12-26**] he underwent a flutter ablation.  He
became hypotensive from diuresis and was started on dopamine and
tranferred to the CCU. Cardiac surgery was consulted for his
severe AS and MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was started on tube feeds for dysphagia. He
remained on a heparin drip. He had a VT arrest requiring CPR,
and recovered to rapid afib. He was started on amiodarone. He
was intubated electively, and cardiac cath was done and [**12-29**]
and graft to OM was stented.  He was treated for a klebsiella
UTI. Repeat echo showed no improvement in EF after stent. He was
seen by renal for increasing creatinine however continued to
have good urine output with lasix and diuril. He was extubated
on [**1-1**]. He agreed to surgery, and on [**1-7**] was taken to the
operating room wher he underwent a redo sternotomy/AVR/MV Repair
and aortic endarterectomy. He became asystolic immediately post
op and was reopened with resolution and no findings. He was
transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition on epi,
neo and propofol. He was given vancomycin periop as he was in
the hospital preoperatively. He was hypotensive overnight,
milrinone and pitressin were added, and he was transfused. His
pressors and vent were slowly weaned and he was diuresed.   His
vasoactive drips were weaned to off and He was extubated on POD
#7. He had several runs of VT. He remained on heparin IV for
atrial fibrillation and Coumadin was held with plans for AICD.
He was started on a lasix drip, and required free water for
hypernatremia. On [**1-17**] he was reintubated for PCO2 of 90. AICD
placement was cancelled until patient is stabilized.  After
multiple extubation attempts, on [**1-28**] a trach and were placed.
Diamox was added for diuresis.  Coumadin was restarted. He
continued to progress and was able to tolerate trach collar
trials.  Diuresis was stopped.  EP was reconsulted in relation
to AICD and Mr. [**Known lastname 40177**] should follow up in one month with EP.
His distal incision began to drain serous fluid and it was
opened and packed. His trach was changed to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] on [**2-5**]. His
sternum continued to open and He was taken to the operating room
on [**2-5**] for a sternal debridement and a VAC was placed. He
suffered a cardiac arrest in the operating room and was
resuscitated. He was started on 3 pressors and vanco zosyn and
flagyl. He was seen by nephrology for decreased urine output. He
was started on fluconazole for yeast in his sternal wound. He
was started on CVVH. He remained on multiple pressors. He
remained on full ventilator support, an dpressors for a number
of days.  He stabilized hemodynamically, and weaned off
pressors.  On [**2128-2-23**], he was again taken to the OR with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] (plastic surgery) for a sternal debridement.  He was
again returned to the OR for delayed sternal closure with
plating by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2128-2-25**].  He was able to tolerate
hemodialysis, no longer requiring CVVH, so he had a RIJ
tunnelled hemodialysis catheter placed on [**2128-3-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
He has remained hemodynamically stable, and is now ready to be
transferred to rehab for continued physical therapy, and
ventilator weaning.  His Zosyn will be completed on [**2128-3-22**].
Fluconazole is to be lifelong.  Daptomycin should continue for 4
week from start date of [**2128-3-11**].
