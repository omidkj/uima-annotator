Brief Hospital Course:
Femoral central line placed in ED. Insulin drip started. Patient
broadly covered empirically for possible respiratory infection
or sepsis with Vanco/Levo/Zosyn.

Coded in ED. We ordered multiple pressors (dopamine, norepi,
vasopressin) to keep his blood pressure within acceptable
limits. Phenylephrine added during his time in the CCU.

Multiple codes (primarily PEA/asystole) while in CCU. Patient
continued to be unresponsive with pupils fixed and dilated.
Family called, plans of care discussed. Early in admission,
patient had been stabilized, family felt full code was
appropriate because patient was so recently s/p transplant and
had been doing well. After family had gone home, patient coded
again (PEA) and family was called back. Attending ([**Doctor Last Name **])
discussed evolving situation and worsening prognosis with wife
and son. Wife in room s/p resuscitation, witnessed ongoing
efforts to stabilize and treat patient.

After several additional codes including many chest compressions
and courses of ACLS medications appropriate to evolving rhythms,
patient's wife agreed that resuscitation efforts should be
suspended if situation did not improve. Patient continued to
re-enter PEA/asystole, and soon expired. Family asked for
autopsy without brain findings in order to find out what had led
to patient's relatively sudden death.
