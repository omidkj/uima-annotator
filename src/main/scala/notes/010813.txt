Admission Date:  [**2114-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-10-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2065-7-29**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year-old
woman with idiopathic cardiomyopathy diagnosed one to two
months ago with an EF ranging from 25 to 40% on various
echocardiograms, Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 18 treated with
chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy to the mediastinum,
history of left bundle branch block, hypertension, coronary
artery disease, who presents from the outside hospital with
presenting symptoms being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and weakness for two days.
Although she has had dyspnea on exertion as well as weakness
in the past and this is correlated with pulmonary edema, she
has never had associated nausea and vomiting and diarrhea in
the past.  She had two days of these symptoms and then had
near syncope on the two days prior to admission and on that
day she was admitted to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 189**].

There she ruled in for a nonST elevation myocardial
infarction with a peak CK of 427 and an MB of 21 and a
troponin of 5.82.  She developed a junctional rhythm with a
rate of 44 and a blood pressure of 90/48 at that time.
However, this resolved.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization and
possible PCI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, Hodgkin's disease at age
18 status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the
mediastinum.  Known coronary artery disease with workup to
date as follows, cardiac catheterization on [**6-13**] showed a
codominant system with a 50 to 60% lesion at the left
circumflex and 80 to 90% right coronary artery osteal
narrowing, normal left ventricular EF, moderate 2+ mitral
regurgitation, wedge of 22 and pulmonary artery pressure
40/22.  Cardiac output not measured at that time.
Echocardiogram of [**6-18**] showed an EF of 40%, left atrial
enlargement, normal left ventricular dimensions, 2 to 3+
mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  ETT on
[**9-10**] exercise nine minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, stopped for
chest tightness and progressive dyspnea on exertion.
Electrocardiogram not interpretable.  Echocardiogram on [**9-6**]
left atrial dilation, moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis with EF of 25%, 4+ mitral regurgitation and no
pericardial effusion.  Cardiac catheterization on [**8-18**], right
coronary artery osteal lesion 80%, EF 41% and 2+ mitral
regurgitation.  An exercise MIBI in [**8-18**] showed a mild septal
wall defect.

Her cardiomyopathy appears to be manifest itself as
paroxysmal pulmonary edema.  This is often in the setting of
hypertension.  Apparently carcinoid and pheochromocytoma have
already been ruled out on a prior admission.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Enalapril
20 mg po b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po q day, Lovenox 70 mg subQ
b.i.d., Pepcid 20 mg po b.i.d., Coreg 12.5 mg po b.i.d.,
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually q 5 minutes with a maximum
of three prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has asthma.  No diabetes mellitus,
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or angina
known in the family.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or ethanol.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.0,
hematocrit 28.9, hemoglobin 10.3, platelets 371.  Chem 7
sodium 131, potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarb 23, BUN 40,
creatinine 1.9, glucose 120, calcium 8.4, magnesium 2.1,
phosphate 5.1.  She ruled in for myocardial infarction by
enzymes at the outside hospital as described above.  Upon
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] her CK was 167 with an MB of 6.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with a
left bundle branch block, which is old.  Chest x-ray within
normal limits.  No pulmonary edema.  No cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 49 year-old female with a recent
history of congestive heart failure in the setting of
hypertension and one vessel coronary artery disease involving
the osteal of the right coronary artery.  She is transferred
with recent GI complaints that were followed by shortness of
breath and junctional rhythm, increased troponin and
transient hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  A:  Coronary artery
disease:  The patient ruled in for a nonST elevation
myocardial infarction at the outside hospital.  Upon arrival
at [**Hospital1 69**] she went to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory where a left heart
catheterization revealed 99% right coronary artery osteal
stenosis with TIMI one flow.  This was successfully stented.
We continued her on aspirin and initiated a months course of
Plavix.

B:  Ventricular function:  Hemodynamics measured a cardiac
catheterization revealed significantly elevated right and
left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 15, mean PAP of
22, mean wedge of 15 and LVEDP of 16.  Left ventriculogram
showed anterolateral wall hypokinesis and the LVEF was
calculated at 50%.  No significant mitral regurgitation was
seen.  Given the patient's systolic and diastolic ventricular
dysfunction Lasix and ace inhibitor was continued.  Final
doses of these are listed under discharge medications.  Once
it was certain that the patient's blood pressure had remained
stable on diuretic and ace inhibitor, we restarted the
patient's Carvedilol.

C:  Rate and rhythm:  There is no recurrence of the patient's
junctional rhythm and in fact this had resolved by the time
she was admitted to our hospital.  Her left bundle branch
block persisted throughout her hospital stay and her rate was
within normal limits.

2.  Renal:  The patient was admitted with renal
insufficiency, but this resolved with hydration.

3.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit dropped by six
points over the first night of her admission, however, this
was felt secondary to hemodilution.  Recheck of the
hematocrit revealed that the hematocrit was stable and no
bleeding was suspected.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Electrolyte
repletion was provided to maintain the patient's potassium
above 4 and the her magnesium above 2.  She followed a
cardiac diet.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Enalapril 10 mg po b.i.d.  2.
Coreg 12.5 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.  4.
Aldactone 25 mg po q.d.  5.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.  6.
Plavix 75 mg po q.d. for one month.  She was instructed to
drink approximately 2 liters of fluid per day and follow up
was arranged with her cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13584**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  NonST elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Successful stent to right coronary artery lesion.
3.  Cardiomyopathy.
