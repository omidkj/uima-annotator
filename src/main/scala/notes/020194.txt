HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old female
with multiple medical problems, anxiety and depression, who
was initially admitted to medicine on the [**7-9**]
secondary to failure to thrive with decreasing p.o. intake,
diarrhea, increasing depression.  All of these symptoms
escalated over approximately one week prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination was
significant for temperature of 95.4; heart rate of 69; blood
pressure 151/68; respiratory rate of 20; 98% on room air. The
patient was lying in bed in no acute distress.  HEAD, EYES,
EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Significant for dry mucous membranes.
Neck was supple.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate
and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  There was no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema in the extremities. Skin
examination was notable for diffuse psoriatic rash.

LABORATORY DATA:  QT's were performed and were without
evidence of ischemic changes.  Echocardiogram was performed
initially on the [**6-12**] and revealed symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function,
mild diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  Pulmonary function tests were scheduled for
the day of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the medicine
service on the [**6-24**] following an 11 day
admission to the medical Intensive Care Unit, during which
time she was intubated from [**10-12**] to [**10-22**], secondary to
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  At this time, she was
aggressively diuresed and her clinical condition continued to
improve.  She was transferred to the medical service.
However, during her Intensive Care Unit stay, she was noted
to have a urinary tract infection which was treated with
Ciprofloxacin for seven days.  Furthermore, the patient
received Vancomycin for seven days beginning on [**2161-10-17**],
secondary to what was thought to be a line induced
Staphylococcal bacteremia.  Upon arriving on the floor, the
patient was tolerating p.o. and was breathing comfortably
