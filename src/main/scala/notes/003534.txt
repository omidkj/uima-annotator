History of Present Illness:
77 yo female who lives at [**Hospital3 1186**] (baseline, oriented to
person and place) had a fall at [**Hospital3 1186**]. 4 hrs later found
unresponsive. Intubated at scene. CXR with RLL
collapse/infiltrate; bronch/endotracheal specmen grew MSSA.
Also with COPD exacerbation, on prednisone and vancomycin (given
unknown PCN/ceph allergy). Extubated last week, failed (believed
[**1-7**] COPD) and re-intubated. Extubated again on  [**2152-2-18**] and now
stable on 2L. Post-second extubation, made DNR/DNI.
_______________
MICU summary by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:
HPI: 78f, h/o DM, HTN, found unresponsive 4 hrs after she was
put into bed after a fall, intubated on scene, now more
responsive - intubated/sedated. According to notes, she fell out
of bed around 2am (denied trauma to head); assessment revealed
normal vitals and patient was apparently mentating
appropriately. She was put back in bed. About 3 hours later, she
was found by staff to be unresponsive (she had been complaining
of SOB--85% RA, improved with O2). VS were otherwise stable, BG
was 97. EMS was called, and she was intubated on the seen and
brought to the ED. In the ED, she was hypertensive (220/palp),
afebrile, was responsive to commands when off sedation. Initial
gas showed severe acidosis (7.11/111/141), potassium was
increased to 6 with a creatinine of 1.8. One set of CEs that
were negative. EKG showed sinus brady with no obvious ST/T
changes. She was given 3 L IVF (was transiently hypotensive to
90s while on propofol -- this resolved off propofol and with
IVF). She was found to have a positive UA and was given a dose
of levofloxacin. She was given kayexalate for hyperkalemia
(improvement of K to 5.3). FAST scan was negative, and she had
CT neck/head. CT neck was significant for ?right RP soft tissue
prominence (no fracture or dislocation), and CT head was
negative for acute event. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.
__________________________________________
MICU course -- per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] notes:
[**2-10**]: Bronch without mucous plug. BAL with 1+GPC pairs. Vanc and
prednisone started. Echo with preserved EF, sm-mod pericard
effusion.
[**2-11**]: Failed PS trial due to tachypnea/tachycardia. Restarted
lasix and increased lopressor. Added back home clonidine.
Changed TFs started. Proteus returned [**Last Name (un) 36**] to
cephalosporins/zosyn, so switched cipro to ceftriaxone
[**2-12**]: Cleared c-spine clinically. On PS for several hours. UOP
very low, gave repeated fluid boluses. Lasix d/c'd for rising
Creatinine.
[**2-13**]: Extubated, but retained C02/somnolent and required
re-intubation. Lantus restarted at 1/2 home dose.
[**2-14**]: RUE US - for DVT. Spoke with brother RE: trach, he's
thinking about it but likely will pursue. Increased BP meds
(clonidine). Diuresed with lasix X 2.
[**2-15**]: Brother re: trach: no. Prednisone tapered to 40. Lantus
increased to 30.
[**2-16**]: DNR/DNI per family. Plan thoracentesis tomorrow,
extubation Fri.
[**2-17**]: Further discussion with family. No plan for trach. [**Female First Name (un) **]
planned but not a large enough effusion. D/c'd antibiotics.
[**2-18**]: Extubated. Tolerating at time of writing. Officially
DNR/DNI: No re-intubation planned if she worsens.
