History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8976**] is a 53 year old male with a history of end-stage
liver disease secondary to hepatitis C, HIV (CD4 322) and
pulmonary hypertension who presented to the emergency room with
weakness, nausea and cough.  Mr. [**Known lastname 8976**] was recently discharged
from this hospital on [**2155-3-29**].  He was at home doing realtively
well on tube feeds per Dobhoff but had recently switched to oral
feeding only for the past 1.5 weeks.  Per his caregiver [**Name (NI) 553**],
he was in his usual state of health until 4 AM on the morning of
presentation. He has baseline abdominal discomfort and nausea
but these were at baseline.  At 4 Am he was found slumped
towards the left side on the couch, incontinent of urine and
stool (he wears depends at baseline), and disoriented.  Prior to
this event he was not experiencing any confusion, hematemasis,
melena or change in his abdominal pain.  He was compliant with
his medications including lactulose.  He was transferred to the
emergency room by EMS.

In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 98.1, BP:
98/70, HR: 103, RR: 24, O2: 94% on RA.  His lacs were notable
for a lacatete of 8.0, WBC count of 25.2 with 9% bands,
creatinine of 1.2 (baseline 0.9), negative cardiac enzymes, and
a total bilirubin of 5.5 (unchanged from baseline).  He had a
chest xray which showed a right lower lobe effusion and possible
infiltrate.  He had a RUQ ultrasound with moderate abdominal
fluid, a single large gallstone and gallbladder wall thickening.
 His blood pressure dropped to 85/63 and he received 6 L IVF.
He had an episode of hypoglycemia with a finger stick of 30 for
which he received 1 amp of D50.  He was given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, vancomycin and then zosyn for broad antibiotic
coverage. His still was guaiac negative.  He was transferred to
the ICU for further management.

In the ICU he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics with
vancomycin and zosyn.  His HAART was held secondary to elevated
lactate.  He underwent broad infectious workup including blood
and urine cultures which were negative. Rapid viral screen was
negative.  Stool cultures were negative for clostridium difficle
x 3 but concern was high so he was started on flagyl.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was negative for SBP. CT chest
abdomen pelvis showed evidence of a RML pneumonia and colitis as
well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Lactate trended down with
IVF and antibiotics. A PICC line was placed for IV access.  He
was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

EKG [**2155-5-13**]: Normal sinus rhythm at 97, normal axis, normal
intervals, borderline prolonged QT, no ST elevation or
depression.  TWI in 3, V1 with flattening in 2, avF.  Unchangd
from prior dated [**2155-3-25**].

[**2155-5-13**]: RUQ Ultrasound:
1. Moderate ascites, with the deepest pocket marked at the
lateral right mid abdomen.
2. No evidence of portal vein thrombosis, as questioned.
3. Diffusely heterogeneous and coarsened hepatic echotexture
with no focal lesion identified.
4. Single large gallstone with gallbladder wall thickening,
which may be related to the patient's hypoalbuminemia. No
specific sign of cholecystitis.

[**2155-5-13**]: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. There is dilatation and distention of the esophagus around a
gastric tube. Given the extensive inflammatory change in the
right middle lobe in particular, aspiration must be considered.
2. Compared to the most recent cross-sectional study, the CT
examination of [**2155-4-16**] there has been interval mild
progression of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Diffuse small bowel dilatation is identified. There is no
evidence of pneumatosis nor of a transition point. In the colon
there Appears to be pancolitis and C-Diff is suspected.
4. Pancreatic lesions, likely cyst or pseudocyst cysts and
unchanged from prior MR examination.
5. There is no evidence of vascular abnormality outside the
varices and portal hypertension. The portal vein appears
relatively [**Name2 (NI) 67562**], but unchanged from multiple prior
cross-sectional imaging studies. SMV, SMA, celiac vessels all
appears patent.

[**2155-5-13**]: Portable CXR:
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are chronic. The rounded
lung lesions in the left lower lobe last documented on chest CT
[**3-26**] and PET/CT [**4-16**] are still present, and although
attributed to rounded atelectasis are best evaluated with a
contrast CT of the chest. T
