Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. On HD2 he
underwent ORIF/IMF of his bilateral mandible fractures and a
simultaneous open tracheostomy. This was performed for airway
protection given his extensive facial and cervical fractures,
and in anticipation of a prolonged ICU course. Orthopaedic spine
surgery saw the pt and recommended non-operative treatment for
his C1 fx; a hard collar was to be maintained for 6 weeks. In
the ICU he had a delayed wean off of sedation secondary to
agitation. He was weaned off the ventilator and ultimately
transferred to the floor on HD 8. On the floor the pt developed
CDiff diarrhea, likely secondary to the peri-op clindamycin.
This responded after 4 days of treatment. Infectious disease
recommended PO vancomycin as well.

The pt initially passed a bedside speech and swallow evaluation,
but after allowing the pt to eat it became clear he wasn't
tolerating an oral diet. He developed an aspiration pneumonia
(acinetobacter/klebsiella) for which he underwent a two week
course of levoquin. The pt was retested with a video swallow
evaluation and aspirated all consistencies. He was thus made NPO
and underwent a PEG placement on [**2-9**] (HD 20). His tube feeds
were started after 24 hours and advanced to goal without
difficulty. He was discharged home with services for trach and
PEG care on [**2-13**] (HD 25).
