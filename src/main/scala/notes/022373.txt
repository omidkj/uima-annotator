GI bleed and type 2 aortic dissection

None

History of Present Illness:
71 y/o female with PMH significant for CAD, HTN, and dementia
admitted on [**6-12**] from [**Hospital6 2910**] with a
decreased Hct and type 2 aortic dissection. Pt was in her normal
state of health until around late [**5-/2111**] when she developed
fevers, cough, and was found to have new acute renal failure
that was attributed to dehydration. Her creatinine increased to
2.1 but subsequently decreased to 1.2 following hydration. Then,
on [**6-11**], the pt developed new nausea and vomiting associated
with coffee ground emesis. At that time, she denied abdomnal
pain. Her Hct decreased from 36 to 24 and the pt was transferred
2 units PRBC. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained to
evaluate for expansion/dissection of the pt's known AAA. Images
were compared to a previous scan from [**4-28**]. There were
bilateral pleural effusions L>R. The thoracic aorta was enlarged
and tortuous which was similar in appearance to the previous
study. There was air within the abdominal aortic aneurysm
measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter which is unchanged. The
aorta tapers ot approximately 2.5 cm at the renal arterial level
and dilates again to nearly 3.5 cm. This more distal dilation
was new since [**4-28**] and the margins of the aorta were ill
defined which suggests aortic aneurysm leakage. The dissection
appears to end at the thoraco abdominal junction. Pt was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care regarding her Hct drop and
type B aortic dissection.

On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was initially admitted to the VICU
but was then transferred to the SICU on the day of arrival as
her SBP was extremely elevated at 200. On arrival to the SICU,
her VS were 97.6  187/79  94  24  96% RA. Pt was guiac positive
and her abdomen was diffusely tender on exam. A repeat CT scan
was done. It showed a thracic aortic aneurysm in which the
thoracic aorta measured 4.4 cm in diameter at the level of the
arch and 4.1 cm at the aortic root. There is prominent mural
thrombus within the thoracic aorta and areas of contrast
extending into the aortic wall consistent with ulcerating plaque
within the inferior aspect of the descending aorta. There is
excessive tortuosity of the aorta just at the level of the
diaphragmatic hiatus with numerous saccular aneurysms. This has
the appearance of a complex aneurysm rather than a focal type B
dissection. There is also a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm
extending from the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus to the
infrarenal aorta. At its largest diameter, within the inrarenal
aorta, the aneurysm measures approximately 4.7 cm. There is
extensive mural thrombus and irregular atheromatous plaque
within the aorta. The aneurysm extends to the level of the
aortic bifurcation and involves the left common iliac artery.
There is mild stranding surrounding the aneurysm just inferior
to the level of the renal arteries and just above the
bifurcation without evidence of periaortic fluid collections or
free fluid in the abdomen to suggest rupture. Given the pt's
multiple medical issues and clinic picture, she was not a
surgical candidate and medical management with tight blood
pressure control was persued. On [**6-13**], a GI consult was
obtained to further evaluate the pt's Hct decrease. At that
time, the pt had guiac + [**Known lastname **] stool and a negative NG lavage.
It was felt that the Hct decrease was not due to bleeding from
her aneurysms but likely a GI source, most likely gastritis. On
[**6-14**], a surgery consult was obtained for increasing abdominal
pain. There was a concern for mesenteric angina given the pt's
low flow state from her severe BP conrol. Her BP was libralized
and she was started on IV levo, vanco, and flagyl. At this time,
the pt will be transferred to the MICU service for further care.

CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST  [**2111-6-12**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is
a thoracic aortic aneurysm. The thoracic aorta measures 4.4 cm
in diameter at the level of the arch and measures 4.1 cm at the
aortic root. There is prominent mural thrombus within the
thoracic aorta, and areas of contrast extending into the aortic
wall consistent with ulcerating plaque within the inferior
aspect of the descending aorta. There is excessive tortuosity of
the aorta just at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus, with
numerous saccular aneurysms. This has the appearance of multiple
saccular components of a complex aneurysm rather than a focal
type B dissection. There is no evidence of periaortic hematoma.
Bilateral pleural effusions are low density and not suggestive
of hemothorax. The pulmonary arteries appear unremarkable,
without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus. A
nasogastric tube is in place. There is no pathologic appearing
mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is
atelectasis within the lower lobes adjacent to the pleural
effusions. No focal nodules or masses are identified within the
pulmonary parenchyma. The airways are patent to the level of the
segmental bronchi bilaterally.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There
is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm extending from the level
of the diaphragmatic hiatus to the infrarenal aorta. At its
largest diameter, within the infrarenal aorta, the aneurysm
measures approximately 4.7 cm (series 3, image 55). There is
extensive mural thrombus and irregular atheromatous plaque
within the aorta. The aneurysm extends to the level of the
aortic bifurcation and involves the left common iliac artery.
There is mild stranding surrounding the aneurysm just inferior
to the level of the renal arteries and just above the
bifurcation, without evidence of periaortic fluid collections or
free fluid within the abdomen to suggest rupture. The liver,
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. The
left kidney is atrophic and does not enhance. There are several
small, rounded, hypodense lesions within the right kidney, too
small to accurately characterize but possibly representing
cysts. The visu
