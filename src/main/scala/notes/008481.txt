Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity cellulitis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
--paracentesis x5 ([**4-21**], 2, 9, 17, and 23)
--intubation
--incision and drainage of left foot ([**4-28**])
--upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy ([**4-30**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85084**] is a 52-year-old man with history of cirrhosis and
alcoholic hepatitis who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-20**] due to LLE
cellulitis.  He was started on IV antibiotics at that time
(eventually broadened to vanc/zosyn) and had his left foot I&D'd
by podiatry.  Wound cultures from left foot were positive for
pansensitive klebsiella.  [**Hospital **] hospital course was also
complicated by SBP, for which he was given 5 days of treatment.
Repeat diagnostic paracentesis were negative.  On [**4-29**], patient
began complaining of worsening abodminal pain and his mental
status began to deteriorate; he also spiked a fever to 101.  He
subsequently had a bright red bowel movement.  In the context of
this clinical change, Mr. [**Known lastname 85084**] was transferred to the MICU
for further care.

In the ICU, patient had an EGD, which showed severe gastritis
and enteropathy.  He had one non-bleeding grade I varix; a flex
sig showed bleeding hemorrhoids.  CT scan on [**5-1**] showed
pneumotosis intestinalis thus, patient was unable to receive
lactulose.  Mr. [**Known lastname 85084**] was eventually intubated due to
worsening mental status and inability to protect airway.  NG
tube was placed for bowel decompression and TPN was started.  ID
suggested broad spectrum antibiotics including:  dapto, flagyl,
zosyn, and cefepime.  Klebsiella grew in wound and in sputum,
but all cultures are otherwise NGT.  Antibiotics were tailored
to just cefepime.  On [**2189-5-5**], patient self-extubated.  He was
transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 on [**5-6**].

Upon examination in the MICU, patient is oriented only to self.
He cannot accurately explain where he is, but does think it is
the "17th" instead of the "16th" of [**Month (only) **].

Past Medical History:
1) EtOH abuse
2) Cirrhosis (diagnosed in [**2185**]) EGD screening for varicies on
[**2189-4-9**] showed portal hypertensive gastropathy without
esophageal or gastric varicies
3) GERD
4) VRE screen positive
5) Psoriasis
6) Onychomycosis

CT CHEST [**2189-4-26**]:
1. Scattered ground-glass opacities predominantly in the left
upper lobe,
lingula and right lower lobe. The appearance is nonspecific and
may represent infection, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Followup is recommended
post-treatment.
2. Scattered up to 6-mm pulmonary nodules. Followup chest CT is
recommended in six months as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines.
3. Incompletely evaluated cirrhosis of the liver, upper
abdominal ascites and splenomegaly.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**5-1**]:
Multiple loops of dilated small bowel, with no large bowel seen,
more compatible with obstruction. A nasogastric tube terminates
appropriately within the collapsed stomach.

LENI [**2189-5-8**]: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremities.

CT [**2189-5-8**]
1. Upper lobe predominant centrilobular ground-glass opacities
likely
reflecting an infectious or inflammatory etiology.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Moderate ascites with cirrhosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52-year-old gentleman with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis who was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for lower
extremity cellulitis.  Patient subsequently developed sepsis,
and was transferred to the MICU on [**4-29**] for BRBPR, fever,
tachycardia, and SBO.  He was transferred back to the floor in
stable condition, though still encephalopathic and with fevers.

# CELLULITIS:  This was patient's presenting complaint and
reason for coming to the hospital.  He was initially started on
vancomycin and Unasyn, later switched to vancomycin and Zosyn,
however, he failed to respond to treatment.  A CT scan was
performed of left foot, which showed evidence of subacute
fracture.  Orthopedics was consulted and did not recommend
immediate surgical treatment, but recommended follow-up in 6
weeks with touch-down weight bearing status.  Podiatry was
consulted as well, who recommended I&D in OR.  Patient went for
I&D on [**4-28**], and cultures came back as pan-sensitive klebsiella;
vanc and Zosyn were continued.  However, on [**4-29**], patient became
increasingly restless, started spiking fevers, and his mental
status deteriorated.  He was started on multiple broad spectrum
antibiotics and transferred to the MICU.  Podiatry followed
patient in MICU and continued to direct dressing changes.  Upon
discharge a wound vac was placed by the podiatry service.  This
should be changed every three days until patient follows up in
podiatry clinic, which should be scheduled for one week after
discharge.

# FEVER:  Mr. [**Known lastname 85084**] had low-grade fevers throughout his
hospital course.  Initially it was thought that fevers were from
cellulitis.  On [**4-29**], patient was transferred to MICU for fevers
and change in mental status, and at that time, his antibiotics
were broadened to include VRE and fungal coverage.  Mr. [**Known lastname 85084**]
was intubated for airway protection, and a BAL was done, which
grew out MDR klebsiella (sensitive to cefepime).  Antibiotics
were eventually switched to cefepime and Flagyl.  A CT scan
showed multiple infiltrates, suggestive of pneumonia.  The
Flagyl and cefepime were stopped after a seven-day course, and
patient defervesced.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Patient had worsening mental status,
starting around [**4-29**], which was likely secondary to infection and
worsenin
