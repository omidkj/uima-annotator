Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] where she was admitted for
atypical chest pain and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Central venous line insertion into R IJ
-Multiple attempts at securing arterial access


History of Present Illness:
62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in
[**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and COPD who was admitted
to OSH [**12-23**] for atypical chest pain and SOB. She ruled out for
ACS with by enzymes (MB 8 -> 7 -> 5; Trop 0.06 -> 0.07 -> 0.06)
and EKG without acute ischemic changes but was found to have a
BNP of 11K on admission. She was assessed as having severe
decompensated R-sided CHF and was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix in
the ED but later that day experienced [**9-9**] back pain with desat
to the 50's and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring
with HR in the 60's and BP's in the 90's. She had ECHO on [**12-24**]
which showed severe pulmonary hypertension, RV pressure
overload, modestly depressed RV function, and LVEF of 55-65%.
.
Here in the CCU she describes feeling gradually more short of
breath over the past 2 months which has become acutely worse in
the past 1-2 weeks. Interestingly, about 1 month ago she was
started on sildenafil for treatment of her pulm htn but felt she
became more short of breath when taking that medication and
stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago when she started feeling
acutely more short of breath. She states that she has only
gained about 2-3lbs in the past two weeks but noticed increased
ankle swelling, increasing need for oxygen (she is usually at
88-92 on 3LNC at home but prior to these past 2 weeks she has
only used oxygen at night). She has 2 pillow orthopnea, but
denies PND. She denies dietary indiscretion, recent illnesses,
fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, or other symptoms.
According to her family she has never had low back pain as a
problem before but the patient states her back pain gets better
with positional changes and rubbing. Also, her baseline daily
function has decreased as she is normally able to move around
the rooms of house but has not been able to walk more than 10
feet due to shortness of breath in addition to her basleine
vascular claudication.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

CXR Portable [**12-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present, along
with a very small right pleural effusion, decreased since [**9-5**]. Heart size is top normal, and the main pulmonary artery is
substantially dilated, as before indicating persistent pulmonary
arterial hypertension. Previous mediastinal adenopathy
documented on the chest CT in [**Month (only) 216**] is difficult to assess but
probably has not worsened. No pneumothorax.
.
Aorta/Branches U/S [**12-25**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Atherosclerosis.

CXR Portable [**12-25**]:
Tip of the new right internal jugular line ends in the region of
the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or increase in
small right pleural effusion. Interval increase in mediastinal
caliber due t
