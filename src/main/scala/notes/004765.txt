TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild-moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is mild-moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6
mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with hyperdynamic left ventricular function and no LVOT gradient
at rest. Mild aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Mild-moderate
functional mitral stenosis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with extensive PVD, CAD, dCHF (EF~75%),
paroxysmal a-fib (not on coumadin), and CKD who presented with
an ischemic RLE POD from angiography, angioplasty, and stenting
on [**2102-1-20**] transferred to the ICU in setting of Afib with RVR.
Patient was found to have pulmonary edema and was subsequently
diauresed to euvolemia with return of NSR.
.
# Ischemic Right Foot
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service under
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] on [**2102-1-19**] after being transferred from an OSH with
a cold right foot. The patient was premedicated for angiography
that was performed on [**2102-1-20**]. The patient was found to have an
occluded right external iliac artery that was then stented. The
patient's right superficial femoral artery was also stented x3.
The patient's sedation was lightened on POD 1 and the patient
was extubated. The patient tolerated the extubation well. The
patient was then transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring. The patient was started on plavix and kept on her
home dose full aspirin.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Failure
On POD 3 the patient's foley was removed. The patient failed to
void and replacement of foley catheter yielded 40 cc of urine.
Patient was bolused with IVF and urine lytes showed a FeNa of
0.2. On POD 4 the patient was oliguric despite fluid boluses.
DDx includes ATN  vs. CIN vs poor forward flow in setting of
volume overload. Pt was hypotensive post-op predisposing to ATN
and also received dye load in setting of angiography making CIN
possible. The fluid boluses likely exacerbated patient's
underlying heart failure leading to poor forward flow, evidenced
by the fact that patient's kidney injury improved with
aggressive diuresis.  Patient was diuresed and had improvement
in her creatinine near her base line of 1.4-1.6.
.
# Respiratory distress: MICU was consulted for respiratory
distress that developed on POD 5 with oxygen saturations
dropping into the high 80s, and using accessory breathing
muscles. An echo was performed that showed severe pulmonary
hypertension but no evidence of right ventricular strain. The
patient was stablizied on a face mask at FiO2 35% with oxygen
saturations in the mid 90s. There was strong suspicsion for PE
given her S1Q3T3, troponin elevation, new Chest X ray findings
demonstrating pulmonary arterial hypertension though V/Q scan
was very low likelihood.  Her respiratory distress was
ultimately felt to be from pulmonary edema and patient's hypoxia
resolved with diuresis.  Patient responded well to 80 mg
torsemide which was held at the time of discharge as the cause
of her edema was felt to be largely iatrogenic and did not
respresent a need for on-going diuresis.
.
# Afib with RVR
Patient developed Afib with RVR on POD 5 with pressures
transiently in the 60s. The rhythm did not respond to IV
lopressor so patient was transferred to the MICU for further
management. Trigger for dysrrhytmia likely enlarged right atrium
in the setting of heart fa
