14 days. His tube feeds were restarted but patient had some
emesis, a dulcolax suppisitory was given and he had a bowel
movement. We also continued to follow his serum K and increased
his PO K intake. Patient also continued with hypertension and
tachycardia and medication changes were made with good effect. A
repeat head CT was obtained on [**3-24**] which showed no change. Exam
remained stable. Patient was offered a bed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**]
