=========================
ECHO: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. No right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

=========================
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Large pericardial effusion
similar to last examination.  There is a right small-to-moderate
loculated pleural effusion and tiny left pleural effusion.
Additionally, bronchiectasis and
consolidation is present in the anterior portion of the right
lower lobe.
Coronary vascular calcifications are present.
The multiple liver lesions, spleen, adrenals, right kidney,
pancreas, stomach and small bowel loops are unchanged.  The left
kidney is surgically absent, and there is a wide-mouthed (5cm)
incisional hernia over the left posterior flank.  The right
renal artery stent is again noted.  Small nonpathologically
enlarged lymph nodes are unchanged.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bladder, distal ureters, small
bowel loops are normal.  The sigmoid colon has scattered
diverticula.  Cecum and right colon are airfilled but normal.
There is no free fluid, lymphadenopathy, or free air. In the
right lateral vastus muscle, there is an intramuscular lipoma
that is incompletely imaged, measuring 20 x 44 mm.

BONE WINDOWS:  A bone island is present in the right iliac bone.
 There are degenerative changes in the pubic symphysis, and
spine.
==========================
CXR: Again seen is prominence of the right mediastinal and hilar
region
with increased interstitial markings in the right upper lobe.
There are right greater than left pleural effusions with volume
loss at both bases.


Brief Hospital Course:
75y/o WF w/ TCC s/p L nephrectomy is being called out from the
CCU after an admission for SOB.  She was originally admitted to
BIDN on [**12-27**] with flank pain and SOB and was found to have
hilar masses and liver lesions.  At [**Hospital1 18**], she was initially
managed on the floor where ECHO showed no tamponade but CT chest
showed partial collapse of the L bronchus by her hilar mass as
well as a pericardial effusion.  She was prepped for
bronchoscopy with probable stent placement but desaturated
during preparation for the bronch and was transfered to the MICU
for further management on [**1-2**].
.
In the ICU, she was treated symptomatically with morphine for
her SOB with improvement and possible pericardiocentesis and
tissue biopsy were discussed with the family.  However, in light
of her over all poor prognosis, discussion was initiated with
palliative care at the request of both the daughter and the
patient.  Plans now exist for the patient to be transfered home
with hospice services on [**1-4**].  She denies any complaints
currently outside of some lower back pain and mild dyspnea which
is much improved since admission.  She is comfortable with
avoiding vital signs and blood draws for the remainder of her
admission but elected to continue taking her home medications.
Home hospice companies were contracted and supplies delivered to
the home.  Standard home hospice prescriptions (pain meds, bowel
regimen, anxiolytics, and antisecretory agents) were filled out
and faxed to the hospice per their protocol.  She was d/c home
on the day after call-out to the floor with home hospice
services.
