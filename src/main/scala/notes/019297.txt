Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-2-19**] left heart Catheterization, coronary angiography
[**2125-2-19**] Emergent Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery X 3
(left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery, with vein grafts to PDA and ramus)


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with known coronary disease
and multiple cardiac risk factors. Over the last year, she had
noticed intermittent exertional chest discomfort. Despite
medical therapy, her angina persisted. She underwent cardiac
cathterization in [**2125-1-21**] at [**Hospital3 417**] which revealed
a mid 50% and distal 80% lesion in the right coronary while the
LAD and circumflex had only mild disease. She was therefore
admitted for angioplasty/stenting of the right coronary artery.

During attempts at this, there was acute dissection of the right
coronary artery and emergent revascularization was undertaken.

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease
Prior MI with History of PTCA in [**2107**]
Hypertension, Dyslipidemia
Type II Diabetes Mellitus
Obesity, Vertigo
s/p thyroidectomy
s/p hysterectomy
s/p hernia repair
s/p appendectomy
s/p breast lump removal
s/p cataract surgery with right eye lens implant


Social History:
Married, lives with husband. Quit tobacco in [**2107**].

Family History:
No family history of premature coronary disease.

[**2125-2-19**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Limited angiogaphy of this right dominant system
demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease. The right
coronary artery was diffusely diseased and heavily calcified
with a tight 90% lesion just proximal to the PDA bifurcation.
The left system was not engaged but prior films demonstrated
disease in the proximal LAD and LCX.  2. Attempted PTCA and
stenting of the mid RCA complicated by proximal/ostial vessel
dissection.  Rescue PTCA and stenting of the proximal/ostial to
mid RCA with three (3) overlapping Xience drug eluting stents
with incomplete expansion of the distal stent despite multiple
inflations with multiple non-compliant balloons.
[**2125-2-19**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
An epiaortic scan was performed that showed simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta with no extension of the hematoma seen in
the cath lab. POST-CPB: On infusion of dopamine, phenylephrine.
AV pacing. Preserved biventricular systolic function on
inotropic support. Trace MR. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for planned percutaneous intervention
of the right coronary artery. The procedure was complicated by
proximal/ostial vessel dissection of the right coronary artery.
She left the cath lab pain free with no significant ST
elevation. She was emergently brought to the operating room for
emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Please see
operative note for details. Following the operation, she was
brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Early postop, she
remained hypoxic which did not allow for extubation. She
concomitantly experienced fevers and was empirically started on
broad spectrum antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia.
Bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum cultures grew out Haemophilus
influenzae. Antibiotics were titrated accordingly. Blood and
urine cultures remained negative. Patient remained in the ICU
d/t issues of ongoing hypoxia. She was transferred from the ICU
to the floor on [**2-26**] when her oxygen requirement decreased and
her oxygen saturation remained above 90% consistantly.  By
post-operative day nine she was ready for discharge to rehab for
IV antibiotics and pulmonary therapy.
