Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer of care from OSH for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with PTCA to LAD


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 46525**] is an 80 year-old woman with a histrory of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who initially presented to an OSH
and now presents on transfer with a STEMI.
.
Per the OSH records, presented on [**12-22**] with sudden onset
dizziness while sitting down at Bingo. The dizziness was
described as vertiginous. After taking two steps she fell to her
left, down to her hands and knees. EMS was called and she was
taken to an OSH. Her VS were initially stable with a BP of
142/60, HR of 70 and O2 of 98% though this was noted to decrease
to 88%. She was noted to vomit twice. For a possible PNA she was
given CTX.
.
On the day of transfer she had acute onset of SSCP with an ECG
showing ST-elevations in V2-V6. She was given ASA 325mg, 600mg
of plavix and started on a heparin gtt.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
though she does experience dyspnea on exertion. She cannot sleep
flat but cannot describe why. She denies PND.

Imaging/Studies/Interventions:
.
ECG [**12-23**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. R wave
reversal in
leads V1-V2 with Q waves through to lead V6 with ST segment
elevation.
Extensive anterior myocardial infarction, probably acute. No
previous tracing
available for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Cardiac Catheterization:
.
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
revealed
three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had mild diffuse
disease.  The LAD had a 100% distal cut-off suggestive of a
proximal
thrombus with distal embolization.  The LCX had a 70% mid-vessel
stenosis.  The RCA had an 80% distal stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated
biventricular filling pressures, with an PCWP a-wave of 37mmHg
and an
RVEDP of 16 mmHg.  Cardiac output and index were preserved.
3. POBA of mid distal LAD with 2mm balloon.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures
3. Preserved cardiac output.
4. POBA of LAD
.
Atrial fibrillation. Since the previous tracing anterior ST
segment elevation
is less prominent. Tracing is consistent with evolution of
anterior myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.

 The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
the distal anterior septum and apex. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. Normal mitral valve leaflets with
no mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild distal septal and
apical hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular ejection
fraction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
ECG [**12-25**]
Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads I and aVL. RSR'
pattern
in lead V1 with ST segment elevation and T wave inversion with R
wave
regression and ST segment elevation in the remainder of the
precordial leads.
Anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. Since the
previous
tracing of [**2143-12-24**] the rhythm is now sinus. Otherwise, as
previously note
