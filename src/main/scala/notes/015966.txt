STUDIES:
.
EGD ([**11-15**]): Scar present lower third of the esophagus at site
of
obliterated varices. No varices noted. Erythema, congestion,
abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Erosions in the
stomach body and antrum. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum
.
CT SCAN ([**11-15**]): (prelim) cirrhosis, splenomegaly, varices.
small
hypodense liver lesions, too small to characterize, close f/u
recommended. no evidence of diverticulitis. Called by ED with
report of: swelling around [**Female First Name (un) 899**] c/w vasculitis worse than prior.

.
MRI Abdomen ([**10-23**]): No evidence of hepatoma. Cirrhotic liver
with
evidence of portal hypertension. Marked splenomegaly

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9935**] is a 56 year-old gentleman w/ HCV cirrhosis
complicated by recurrent varices s/p banding and
thrombocytopenia who presented with bright red blood per rectum
in the setting of 2 episodes of epistaxis. Due to his history of
esophageal varices, he was initially admitted to the ICU given
concern for variceal bleed.

1. GI BLEED- Patient was hemodynamically stable throughout
hospital course and did not require transfusion of blood
products. He had upper endoscopy while in the ICU which showed
no evidence of variceal bleed, but showed portal hypertensive
gastropathy and erosions in the stomach body and antrum. There
was no definitive source of upper GI bleeding found. Since his
hematocrit was stable and there were no further episodes of
bleeding, he was discharged with close GI follow-up. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 732**] from Dr.[**Name (NI) 6670**] office was notified of his admission
and will set up closer follow-up and discussion on whether
colonoscopy would be beneficial to identify possible lower
source of GI bleed such as hemorrhoids. Of note, patient's last
colonoscopy was in [**2131**] and was normal.

2. LUQ ABDOMINAL PAIN- The patient describes a vague LUQ
abdominal pain similar to what he has experienced on and off in
the past. Given a negative EGD, this most likely represents
recurrent discomfort secondary to splenomegaly or perhaps due to
vasculitis as evidenced by [**Female First Name (un) 899**] swelling on CT-he will plan to
follow this up in outpatient clinic.
