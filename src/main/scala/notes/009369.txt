CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Scrotal and lower extremity swelling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old male with
a history of CHF, CAD status post MI, diabetes type 2,
hypertension, a-fib, who presents with a several week history
of scrotal swelling which has markedly worsened in the last

although family members tell a different account.  The
patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, lightheadedness, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation.  The patient has one pillow
orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion.  However, he is able to
climb four flights of stairs.  Patient with a history of
a-fib, however, not compliant with INR monitoring.  The
patient spilled grease from the stove on his right lower
extremity which resulted in an ulcer and erythema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 65 year old male, poor
historian with significant past medical history for CHF, CAD,
status post MI, diabetes, hypertension, a-fib, who presents
with a several week history of worsening scrotal and lower
extremity edema.

1.  Cardiac.  As above patient with history of CHF.  New and
total body fluid overload with marked edema, etiology likely
multifactorial, poor medicine compliance, EF question.  No
shortness of breath.  Mild crackles on physical examination,
however, O2 sat 91% on 2 liters.  History of a-fib not on
Coumadin because of lack of compliance with INR monitoring.
Currently a-fib controlled rate 110.  The patient will need
vigorous diuresis as well as optimization of medicine
regimen.  Lasix diuresis, strict Is and Os, daily weights.
Continue digoxin, Zestril, HCTZ, aspirin, beta blocker.  Will
consider echo to assess cardiac function.  Telemetry.  EKG in
a.m.  To keep O2 sats greater than 93%.  Consider adding
spironolactone.  Check lipid panel.  Heparinize, possible to
switch to Coumadin.  Followup serial enzymes for rule out MI.

2.  Endo.  History of diabetes type 2.  Will continue
outpatient regimen of glyburide and metformin with insulin
sliding scale.  Check finger sticks four times a day.  Check
hemoglobin A1C.

3.  ID.  Right lower extremity cellulitis with purulence and
ulcerations.  Started on Ancef in E.D.  Afebrile.  No
leukocytosis.  Positive scrotal edema in a diabetic.  Must
consider Fournier gangrene.  No eschar noted at this time.
Continue IV Ancef.  Blood cultures times two.  Wound care
nurse consult.

4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure increased.  Will continue
HCTZ, Zestril, Lopressor, Lasix and adjunct as necessary.

5.  Prophylaxis with Protonix and heparin.  Code is full.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient ruled out for MI.  The patient
was diuresed consistently 1 to 2 liters per day.  He was
started on heparin drip for a-fib.  The patient had an
echocardiogram which showed global right ventricular
hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  He was
started on Ancef for his lower extremity cellulitis.  He had
minor three to four beat nonsustained VT during his C-MED
stay.  Overnight on [**11-27**] to [**11-29**] the patient desaturated to
the 80s in room air and 70% on face mask.  Chest x-ray showed
no change later that day.  The patient was then admitted to
the MICU on [**11-29**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure and
hypoxia.  The patient required 24 hours of intubation.  The
patient's decompensation was thought to be secondary to COPD
with obstructive sleep apnea and multiple factors.  The
patient had a CT angiogram on [**2163-12-3**] which showed no evidence
of pulmonary embolus with small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient was continued on aggressive diuresis with IV
Lasix and then subsequently switched to p.o. Lasix 80 mg
t.i.d.  Continued to diurese approximately 2 liters per day.
Heart rate controlled on diltiazem.  Dose was increased from
30 to 60 q.i.d. in the MICU.  The patient's echocardiogram on
[**2163-11-28**] showed an ejection fraction of approximately 70%
with global right ventricular hypokinesis as above.  The
patient's chest x-ray on [**2163-12-1**] showed slight improvement in
CHF with enlarged cardiac contour, increased opacity in left
retrocardiac region, question atelectasis versus effusion.

The patient was then extubated on [**2163-12-1**].  He was doing well.
Was planned for night time positive pressure noninvasive
ventilation.  The patient didn't tolerate the face mask as he
said it didn't fit well and had trouble using it while
sleeping.  Nasal BiPAP was tried with two separate masks with
no effect.  The patient was then transferred back to the MICU
and did fine through the day on 6 liters nasal cannula with
sats 90% to 92%.  The patient then had an inpatient sleep
study to assess his obstructive sleep apnea as probable cause
of desats during the night.  Sleep apnea study is pending.
The patient was on captopril 50 mg t.i.d. in the MICU.  The
patient had some poor blood pressure control with continued
diuresis.  Captopril was discontinued and has since not been
added back in until the patient's blood pressure is stable.
The patient's blood pressure on discharge here is now 120/80.
Captopril will be restarted.

The patient's right lower extremity cellulitis continued to
improve and eventually healed.  The patient's ulcer
completely healed with granulation tissue and no need for
dressing changes.  The patient was switched from cefazolin to
Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  On [**2163-12-4**] GU was consulted to rule
out Fournier gangrene due to erythema and severe scrotal
edema with some gas seen in the scrotum.  Due to the
possibility of Fournier gangrene, the patient was put on
Flagyl 500 mg IV q.eight hours, ampicillin 2 gm IV q.four
hours and levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.24 hours.  On GU followup
with clinical exam and CT of the scrotum diagnosis was made
that it was strictly sc
