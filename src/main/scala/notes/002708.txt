Chief Complaint:
left carotid artery stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 74-yo man with hyperlipidemia, possible
hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25-45%, CAD s/p MI
and emergent 4vCABG + LV Aneurysmectomy [**2151**], and left carotid
artery stenosis, who presents for angiography and
revascularization of carotid artery stenosis. Recent
surveillance testing has shown the left carotid artery to have
80-99% stenosis with a peak systolic velocity of 514 cm/sec and
diastolic velocities of 151 cm/sec. There was retrograde flow
involving the left vertebral artery consistent with a probable
subclavian artery stenosis. The patient has no history of prior
stroke or TIA, and has not had any neurological symptoms
including difficulty with speech, headaches, changes in vision,
weakness, numbness or tingling. He also denies any cardiac
symptoms including chest pain, SOB, DOE, orthopnea, PND, leg
swelling, palpitations, syncope or presyncope, or claudication.
.
The pt underwent carotid angiography and stent placement in the
cardiac cath lab, and is admitted to the CCU for further care
and monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with severe left carotid artery stenosis.
He underwent angiography and stent placement of the left carotid
artery.  He was then admitted to the CCU for intense blood
pressure monitoring and frequent neuro checks.  He was given
