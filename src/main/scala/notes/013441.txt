Pertinent Results:
[**2188-7-10**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free
wall contractility.
4. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened and heavily calcified with
leaflet restriction. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). [**Location (un) 109**] = .4. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Significant aortic regurgitation is
present, but cannot be quantified due to the presence of an
IABP.
6. . The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild
to moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The IABP is 4 cm below the LSCA and was advanced to 2 cm
prior to CPB.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine, epinephrine,
vasopressin. AV pacing for long pr interval, sb. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with trivial ai,
trivial aortic stenosis with peak 11, mean gradient 5 mmHg.
Preserved biventricular systolic function on inotropic support.
LVEF = 40%. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] are 1+. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation. IABP is in good position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-7-9**] from [**Hospital1 3793**] Hospital for a cardiac catheterization and further
management of her myocardial infarction. Her catheterization
revealed severe left main and three vessel disease as well as
severe aortic stenosis. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
for coronary perfusion. The cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical management and she was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner.

On [**2188-7-10**], she was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent aortic valve replacement with an [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial
Valve and coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively she was
taken to the intensive care unit on Epinephrine, Propofol and
Neo Synephrine infusions.

The next morning her intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and
removed without issue. She was extubated on POD #2. Bedside
swallowing evaluation was done to assess aspiration risk. she
developed atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone
and reverted to sinus rhythm.  Pressors were weaned.

A couple of days later she was thrashing in bed and very
agitated (treated with Haldol). Shortly thereafter, sternal
drainage was noted and Vancomycin was  started. She returned to
the OR for sternal debridement and wound VAC placement. She was
kept intubated and sedated and returned to the OR on [**7-21**] for
further debridement, rib plating, bilateral pectoralis flap
advancement and sternal closure.

Drains were managed by the Plastic Surgery service and the first
one was removed on POD 7. Vancomycin was administered
perioperatively until OR cultures came back negative when it was
stopped. A JP drain was removed and she had a large amount of
drainage from the removal site. Echo at this time showed no
pericardial effusion.  The drainage had stopped by the time of
discharge. **PLEASE DO NOT PULL JP DRAIN - DR [**First Name (STitle) **] TO PULL AT
FOLLOW-UP VISIT**
Sternal wound at discharge has 1.5 inch triangular eschar at
midpoint of incision with slightly erythematous edges.  Keflex
is started at the request of PRS.

She remained stable and was extubated again on POD 3. She was
tube fed transiently and was taking a regular diet eventually at
which time tube feeds were stopped. Physical Therapy worked with
her for strength and mobility. She was gently diuresed towards
her preoperative weight.  ACE Inhibitor was not initiated- as
blood pressure would not tolerate it.

A stay at rehab was appropriate for further recovery and
arrangments were so made.
Medications, follow up, precautions  and restrictions are as
outlined elsewhere.
