HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ONCOLOGY:  The patient presented with AML with increasing
   blasts on smear.  The patient underwent chemotherapy with
   the FLAG protocol, which included Fludarabine, Ara-C and
   GCSF.  The patient had an echocardiogram on presentation
   which was normal.  He had an uncomplicated course during
   his hospitalization stay.  He got GCSF continual and his
   hematocrit continued to drop during the hospitalization
   course.

2. HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's transfusion hematocrit
   threshold was 25.0.  He was given blood transfusions in-
   house to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 25 as well
   as platelet transfusions to be greater than 10.  He had an
   episode where he required steroids, Decadron times one,
   prior to platelet transfusion as this had been occurring
   during his previous hospitalization stay at an outside
   hospital.

3. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was maintained on
   Bactrim, Diflucan and Acyclovir for prophylaxis.  Levaquin
   was added once his ANC was less than 500.

4. DIET, FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
   maintained on a neutropenic diet.  When counts decreased,
   then he was maintained on intravenous fluids.  Once his
   hydration reached an equilibrium after chemotherapy, he
   was switched to KVO during the day and maintenance fluids
   at night times one liter.

5. ACCESS:  The patient had a left Portacath already in place
   on admission.  He received a right triple lumen catheter
   at the Interventional Radiology in the right subclavian.
   He had some pain associated at the site and got Oxycodone
   as needed.

6. VERTIGO:  The patient experienced a one time episode of
   vertigo while getting blood and while getting high dose
   ARA-C.  Otoscopic examination was unremarkable.  He had an
   MRI with gadolinium which was negative for any
   abnormalities except for mastoid and sphenoid fluid.
   Vertigo resolved.

7. OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient had a history of a visual
   field cut defect and optic disc swelling right greater
   than left.  The patient had Ophthalmology consulted in-
   house.  They recommended an orbital MRI to rule out
   leukemic infiltrate.  The patient had a fine cut MRI of
   the orbits which was negative for a leukemic infiltrate or
   mass effect.

Followup of a lumbar puncture that was performed in the
patient prior to admission was obtained from the outside
hospital and was negative for malignant cells or any
infectious process.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be
dictated in a future discharge addendum summary by the next
intern taking care of this patient.
