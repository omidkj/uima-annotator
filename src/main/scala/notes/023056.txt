HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13393**] is a 71 -year-old man
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation,
as well as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and previous
peripheral vascular disease and transient ischemic attacks,
who presented after a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty with a complaint of unstable angina.  He was
catheterized on [**2-7**].  This demonstrated a diffuse
moderate hypokinesis of the left ventricle and an ejection
fraction of 30% to 35%.  He also had mild mitral
regurgitation at the mitral valve and 85% stenosis in the
left circumflex, 80% stenosis in the left anterior
descending, 90% stenosis in the diagonal, 80% stenosis in the
right coronary artery, and 90% stenosis in the posterior left
ventricular.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypothyroidism, diabetes
mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, peripheral
vascular disease, previous transient ischemic attacks, atrial
fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery
disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes an appendectomy and carotid
endarterectomy in [**2152**].

ALLERGIES:  Quinidine, shellfish, and IV contrast material.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Captopril 75 mg [**Hospital1 **], Coumadin 4.0 mg
on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3.0 mg on Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday, and Sunday, Lasix 20 mg po q day, Humulin 70/30,
and nifedipine 90 mg po q day, Prevacid, Celexa, and Lipitor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a prior smoking history, he quit nine
years ago.  He denies any alcohol use or any recreational
drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was 5 foot, 8 inches tall with a
weight of 210 pounds.  His blood pressure was 178/74 with a
pulse of 45.  He was in no apparent distress.  He was alert
and oriented times three.  On chest examination he was clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  His cardiac examination
demonstrated an irregular rate and rhythm, but there were no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2-10**], he was admitted for a coronary
artery bypass grafting where he underwent a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, a saphenous vein
graft to diagonal, a saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery, and to posterior left ventricular with a
jump graft.  He tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit with an A-V paced rhythm of 91 beats per
minute, a mean arterial pressure of 78, a central venous
pressure of 15, a PAD of 23, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 31.

He was on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, and propofol drips.
He was extubated by postoperative day one when his Coumadin
was restarted and he was transferred to the floor.  On
postoperative day two his tubes were removed, his wires were
capped, his central line was removed, his Foley was removed,
and he began to diurese.  He was again treated with Coumadin
for his atrial fibrillation.  He was also evaluated by
Physical Therapy for ambulation monitoring and found to be
rather slow to ambulate and rehabilitation planning was
initiated.

On postoperative day three it was felt that he was going to
require a significant amount of this pulmonary toilet and the
preceding diuresis.  The patient's physical examination had
improved by postoperative day four.  At this point he had a
high temperature of 99.3 F, current of 99.3 F, his blood
pressure was 122/70, his pulse was 66, respirations 18, and
his O2 saturation was 93% on two liters. He had diuresed
approximately one liter the evening before of free fluid.  He
was started on Vioxx for his osteoarthritis in order to help
control the osteoarthritis and promote ambulation.

His BUN was 33 and his creatinine was 1.0.  These were down
from the day before and the patient was doing well.  A bed
became available and plans were made to transfer the patient
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg po q day times seven
days, K-Dur 20 mEq po q day times seven days, Vioxx 25 mg po
q day times two days, then 12.5 mg to 25 mg po q day for
osteoarthritis, Coumadin 4.0 mg po q Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, 3.0 mg po q Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday,

mg po q day, and aspirin 81 mg po q day, as well as NPH
insulin 45 units subcutaneous q AM and 25 units subcutaneous
q PM.  The regular insulin sliding scale is as follows: 0 to
60, give 1 amp of D50 or juice, 61 to 150 - do nothing, 151
to 200 - 2 units, 201 to 250 - 4 units, 251 to 300 - 6 units,
301 to 350 - 8 units, 351 to 400 - 10 units, 401 to 450 - 12
