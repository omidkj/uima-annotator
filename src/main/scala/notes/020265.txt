Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]-INTERNAL MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20 year old
previously healthy man transferred from Bermuda after
sustaining a closed head injury secondary to motorcycle crash
[**2177-8-4**].  He was unresponsive at that accident site and
presented to the Emergency Department with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma
Score of 3.  He had a right frontal hemorrhagic contusion
with numerous skull and facial fractures and air noted within
the skull vault.  EEG was done and the patient was found to
have no activity to noxious stimuli.  A liver laceration was
noted with blood in the pelvis and the patient underwent
exploratory laparotomy.  There were no abnormalities in the
spleen or bowel and liver bleeding was stopped after
hemostasis with packing.  No repair to the liver was needed.
A right tibial fracture repair was also performed with two
cancellous screws placed.

His hospital course in Bermuda was significant for a three
week Intensive Care Unit admission for increased intracranial
pressure, urosepsis and minimal improvement in neurological
status.  A tracheostomy was placed around [**2177-8-15**], and a
PEG tube was placed on [**2177-8-28**].  Of note, one plus
Pseudomonas grew from sputum culture which was not treated
and thought to be a colonizer.  The Pseudomonas was
susceptible to Ciprofloxacin.  His enterococcus was treated
with a course of Cefepime.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2177-8-30**].  On presentation, he was noted to have
a temperature of 101.0 F., copious sputum production, and an
arterial blood gas was done in the Emergency Department that
showed pH 7.47, pCO2 37, pO2 50.  Due to the concerning
arterial blood gas he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for suctioning purposes as well as
stabilization.  His Intensive Care Unit course was brief,
lasting approximately 24 hours.  It was uncomplicated with a
fever curve trending downward after being started on Levaquin
and Vancomycin.  As patient no longer needed frequent
suctioning and sputum production had decreased, he was
transferred to the Medicine Floor for further work-up.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient worked as a jet ski instructor.
He smoked approximately one pack per day.  Social alcohol use
only.  Occasional marijuana use per parent's history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family medical history noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:
1.  Erythromycin ophthalmologic drops twice a day.
2.  Levaquin 500 q. day.
3.  Heparin 5000 units twice a day.
4.  Vancomycin one gram twice a day.
5.  Lansoprazole 30 mg q. day.
6.  ProMod tube feeds with fiber at 80 cc an hour.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to the
Medicine Floor are temperature of 100.0 F.; blood pressure
110 to 130/70s; heart rate 70; respiratory rate 20; oxygen
saturation 100% on 40% O2 via tracheostomy.  On physical
examination in general, the patient is not responsive to
commands.  He moves his left lower extremity on occasion with
non-purposeful movements.  Tracheostomy is in place with
minimal secretions present.  His oropharynx was clear.
Mucous membranes were moist.  His neck was supple and sclerae
were anicteric.  He had coarse breath sounds bilaterally
which may have been secondary to upper airway radiation of
sounds.  His heart was regular rate with normal S1 and S2.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  His abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel
sounds.  PEG tube site was without signs or symptoms of
infection.  His lower extremities were in multi-Podes boots
with his right calf and heel in dressings with no drainage
noted.  Pulses were two plus bilaterally in the lower
extremities and his skin was warm and dry.  On Neurologic
examination, he occasionally responded to sternal rub.  He
withdrew from noxious stimuli on occasion.  His right pupil
is sluggish to nonreactive.  His left pupil is reactive from
6 mm to approximately 3 mm.  He does not move his right upper
extremity or right lower extremity and will occasionally have
non-spontaneous movement of the left upper extremity and
lower extremity.  There is no tracking with pupils noted.
His toes are upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 13.3, hematocrit
29.2, platelets 362.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride
102, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.5, glucose 100.
Calcium 9.0, phosphorus 4.5, magnesium 1.5.  PT 13.5, PTT
25.7, INR 1.3.

Urinalysis:  Trace leukocyte esterase, many bacteria, 25
white blood cells, less than one squamous epithelial cell.
Urine culture grew Enterococci pan sensitive.

AST 97, ALT 204, alkaline phosphatase 366, total bilirubin
1.0, amylase is 56, lipase 47, albumin 3.6, lactate 0.8.
Repeat urine culture [**2177-9-4**], showed no growth.

Sputum culture [**2177-8-31**], Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus
aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.

Blood cultures [**2177-8-30**], negative times four bottles.

PERTINENT STUDIES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
1.  Chest x-ray [**2177-8-30**], bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left.  Tracheostomy and PEG tube in place.

2.  Head CT scan on [**2177-8-30**], right frontal
encephalomalacia, multiple facial fractures, no abscess, no
midline shift, no intracranial hemorrhage.

3.  EEG [**2177-9-2**], moderate diffuse encephalopathy with
background 6 to 7 Hz.; per report, slight improvement
compared to EEG done in Bermuda.

4.  MRI of the brain / cervical spine [**2177-9-3**]:  Right
frontal and temporal contusion and evidence of multiple areas
of shear injuries.  Complex facial fractures with destruction
of cribriform plate.  Cervical spine normal.

5.  CT scan of the right maxillofacial area [**2177-9-4**],
multiple orbital fractures including the floor, compression
of ethmoid cells.  Left lateral wall of maxillary sinus
fractured.  Mucocele in left maxillary sinus.  Depression of
cribriform plate.

IMPRESSION:  20 year old with closed head injury status post
motor vehicle crash [**2177-8-4**].  The patient is comatose with
minimal neurologic improvements over the last month.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient initially presented to outside
hospital on [**2177-8-4**], with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Score of 3.  His
EEG done at that point showed no activity even to noxious
stimuli.  Intracranial pressures were as high as the 30s.  He
has shown very minimal progress in neurologic symptoms and
will occasionally withdraw to pain.  He is unresponsive and
sporadically moves his left extremities with non-purposeful
movements.  His right pupil is sluggish to non-responsive,
while his left is still appropriately responsive to light.

The Neurology Team was consulted and recommended a repeat EEG
as well as an MRI of the brain and cervical spine.  The
results are as listed above.  Essentially, the EEG showed
minimal improvement compared to report from Bermuda, however,
no significant clinical improvement has been noted.  The MRI
showed significant damage to the frontal and temporal lobes
with destruction of the right ethmoid sinus.

The patient worked with Physical Therapy during
hospitalization and is to be discharged to [**Hospital 13623**]
Rehabilitation.  The family understands that the patient's
prognosis remains poor with zero to 15% chance of any
meaningful recovery.  The family is realistic, but at the
same time hopeful that some recovery will occur.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with a history of sepsis
at outside hospital believed to be urosepsis secondary to
enterococcus.  He was treated on Meropenem and Gentamicin
there.  On presentation to [**Hospital1 188**], he had a temperature spike to 101.0 F. with a white
count of 16.  He was started empirically on Vancomycin and
Levaquin and urine cultures grew enterococcus again.  As
sensitivity showed enterococcus was pan sensitive, Vancomycin
was discontinued and he was
