History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old gentleman with CLL, CKD, apical
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Afib on coumadin, recent PPM
placement one month ago, presenting with dyspnea, edema, and
mild weight gain.  He is followed by VNA at home, and was noted
by wife to have decreasing urinary output, generalized edema,
and dyspnea with minimal exertion.  Weight slightly up from
157.5 at last clinic visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] one week ago, now up
to 158.5 lbs, though his wife notes that his baseline weight is
actually 145 lbs. Patient notes that he has been feeling
increasingly short of breath over the last week with minimal
exertion.  He feels bloated with swelling of his face, abdomen,
back, scrotum.

On review of systems, he does admit to some lightheadedness.  He
notes that he feels he has something in the back of his throat
but cannot cough it up.  Otherwise denies any chest pain,
orthopnea, cough, hemoptysis, constipation, diarrhea, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does have frequent urination, unchanged from prior. He also
notes dry mouth, which he "always" has.  Does also complain of
right shoulder pain, particularly with movement.

CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2140-4-26**] 6:25 PM

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-26**] through [**4-18**]:

Since [**4-18**] minimal increase in severe chronic cardiomegaly and
pulmonary
vascular congestion could be due to different phases of cardiac
and
respiratory cycles, while small bilateral pleural effusions have
decreased,
and there is no pulmonary edema. Transvenous right atrial and
right
ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective
positions.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2140-5-2**] 2:49 PM

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral lower
extremity veins. Visualization of the tibial veins was difficult
due to leg swelling. There is normal compression, augmentation
and phasicity of the common femoral, thigh femoral, and
popliteal veins bilaterally. There is no deep venous reflux
bilaterally.

There is reflux in the right greater saphenous vein below the
knee. There is no reflux in the left greater saphenous vein.
There is no reflux. The lesser saphenous veins bilaterally.

Tibial veins were visualized and noted to be patent by color
flow evaluation.  Cannot rule out nonocclusive thrombus.

Incidental note is made of a right groin node measuring 2.4 cm.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of proximal deep vein thrombosis in
bilateral lower extremities. Cannot rule out nonocclusive tibial
vein thrombosis. There is reflux only on the right greater
saphenous below the knee.

CAROTID ULTRASOUND ON [**2140-5-13**]
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the
right and left ECA, ICA, CCA, and vertebral arteries. Grayscale
imaging demonstrates mild plaque within the right and left ICAs.
No left carotid artery dissection is seen. Antegrade flow is
seen within the vertebral arteries. The following velocity
measurements were obtained:
RIGHT: Proximal ICA 88/16 cm/sec, mid ICA 82/26 cm/sec, distal
ICA 52/18
cm/sec, CCA 104/22 cm/sec, ECA cm/sec, vertebral artery 50
cm/sec. The right ICA/CCA ratio is 0.84.
LEFT: Proximal ICA 91/17 cm/sec, mid ICA 67/23 cm/sec, distal
ICA 81/15
cm/sec, CCA 106/20 cm/sec, ECA 121 cm/sec, vertebral artery 43
cm/sec. Left ICA/CCA ratio 0.85.
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with less than 40% stenosis
bilaterally.

RENAL ULTRASOUND ON [**2140-5-14**]

CLINICAL INDICATION: Elevated creatinine.
This study was done portably at the bedside demonstrating the
right kidney to measure 10.4 cm in length and the left kidney
10.1 cm. These measurements are unchanged from a prior scan of
[**4-5**]. Neither kidney shows evidence of hydronephrosis, stone
disease or concerning masses. There is a small subcentimeter
lower pole cyst in the right kidney and a 1.2 x 1.5 cm
parapelvic cyst in the left kidney with a single thin septation.
These are
also unchanged in size. The bladder is not well evaluated due to
limited
amount of urine within, but there is evidence of ascites in the
pelvis and
right flank.
CONCLUSION: Normal-sized kidneys without evidence of obstruction
and without significant change since [**4-5**]. There is new ascites
however.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ON [**2140-5-27**]
The left and right atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is
diastolic septal flattening c/w right ventricular volume
overload. Apical hypertrophy is not appreciated, but there is an
apically displaced papillary muscle and the apex is now well
delineated. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitati
