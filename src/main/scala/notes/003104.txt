HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary - The patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic
surgery who recommended VATS for diagnosis as well as
treatment of the pleural effusion which was done on [**2137-9-19**],
with open wedge resection, removal of infarcted lung.
Postoperative with poor gas, pH 7.18, pO2 78, which improved
significantly with nasal airway.  Respiratory acidosis
thought secondary to narcotics as well as splinting.  The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
observation.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
did well, did not require intubation and was saturating well
with five liters of oxygen and was transferred to the floor
for further management.  At the time of this dictation, the
chest tube is still in place and will be removed according to
Cardiothoracic surgery recommendations.  The patient is to be
continue on Levofloxacin as well as Flagyl for treatment of
pulmonary infection and will be slowly weaned from oxygen
requirement and was put on Lovenox which was changed over to
Coumadin for treatment of the pulmonary embolism from [**Month (only) 216**].

2.  Infectious disease - The etiology of current presentation
is unclear; as due to necrotic lung mass or to superinfection
for other reasons, the patient will be continued on
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for now.  Further workup was done
with PPD and HIV testing, the results of which are pending at
this time.

3.  Hematology - The patient with a hypercoagulable state
which was addressed with hypercoagulable workup including
lupus anticoagulant, Factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**], prothrombin G mutation,
however, the patient's current presentation may be secondary
to the ulcerative colitis which is actually an increased risk
factor for hypercoagulable state.  The patient will be
continued on Coumadin to complete course of treatment for
pulmonary embolism.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was initially started on
Asacol for continued treatment of ulcerative colitis, however
it was recommended by gastroenterology that this could
actually increase symptoms of ulcerative colitis and the
Asacol was discontinued.  If he is to reflare, the patient
will be started on steroids instead.

5.  Depression - The patient was on Paxil as an outpatient
for which he is doing well with his depression and will be
continued on this while an inpatient and postdischarge.
