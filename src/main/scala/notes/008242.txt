Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 61 y/o with Etoh abuse and hematemesis

Coffee ground emesis: The patient had an upper GI bleed by
postive NG lavage with no sign of active bleeding by arrival.
Serial HCT's were all stable. he was monitored in the ICU then
EGD revealed areas of esophagitis and gastritis. He was given a
PPI and sucralifate to take at home. Biopsies were taking and
pending at the time of discharge(patient aware).

Hyponatremia, Hypokalemia, Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia: The
patient had a number of electrolyte abnormalities which were
consistent with his poor po intake and heavy etoh abuse. All
were corrected by the time of discharge.

Etoh: Patient states he has no interest in stopping alcohol use.
Counseling was offered and declined. He was given a few doses of
valium for anxiety, but did not register significantly high
scores on a CIWA scale.

Etoh induced hepatitis, pancreatitis: The patient had normal
hepatic synthetic function, but had an elevated bili and lipase.
These improved without intervention and were suspected to be due
to etoh use. It was suggested to the patient that he be followed
by gastroenterology as an outpatient, although he declined.
