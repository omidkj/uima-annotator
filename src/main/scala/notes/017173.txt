COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had 20% stenosis.
The LAD
had 40% proximal and 100% total chronic mid occlusion. The D1
had upper
and lower poles that were both acutely occluded. The LCX had
moderate
disease with occluded OM1. The RCA had proximal 30% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 12 mmHg, mean PCWP was 45 mmHg).
There
was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with mean PA
pressure of
43 mmHg. The cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.6
L/min/m2.
3. Successful balloon angioplasty of the D1 upper and lower
poles with a
2.0 mm balloon. Final angiography demonstrated a minimal
residual
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal
flow (See
PTCA Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute occlusion of upper and lower D1 poles. Chronic mid LAD
occlusion.
3. Markedly depressed cardiac index.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of the upper and
lower D1 poles
...
CXR ([**11-9**]): Findings consistent with CHF.
CXR ([**11-10**]): The heart size is enlarged. No pleural effusions or
focal consolidations demonstrated. There is prominence of the
central pulmonary vasculature and increased vascular markings
towards the upper lobe consistent with some underlying cardiac
failure, but mildly improved compared to the most recent chest
x- ray with resolution of interstitial edema.
...
ECHO ([**9-11**]): mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], mild LV systolic dysfunction,
40-45%. [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1. Inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. RV nl. Moderate AS, mild AR, mild MR,
moderate PA HTN.
.
ECHO ([**11-9**]): There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior
walls, and moderate hypokinesis of the anterior and lateral
walls; the apex also appears hypokinetic. At least mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. At least
mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
...
Scrotal u/s: 1. Large left inguinal hernia with multiple bowel
loops and fluid within the scrotum.
2. Single testis and epididymis are identified and appear
normal. Soft tissue adjacent to scotal wall which is of
uncertain etiology, but may represent an atrophic testis.
Correlation with the patient's history is suggested.
3. Hydrocele.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 86yo man w/ known CAD and LAD occlusion, CHF, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, CRI, presenting with SSCP and
STEMI, taken to cardiac cath, where he had balloon angioplasty
of D1 upper and lower poles, admitted in CHF.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. CAD - Mr. [**Known lastname 92971**] was admitted with an ST elevation MI. He has
a known history of LAD occlusion and was found to have occlusion
of the upper and lower poles of his first diagonal branch. The
lesions of the first diagonal were opened with balloon
angioplasty, the LAD lesion was treated medically as before. He
was treated with dobutamine post-catheterization, but this was
quickly weaned off without difficulty. During his
hospitalization, he had multiple episodes of angina with pain in
his right shoulder or chest. The pain was not associated with
dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness,
dizziness, or other symptoms. They were relieved with one
sublingual nitro, tylenol, or spontaneously resolved after
several minutes. This was likely his stable angina and was not
associated with new EKG changes. He was treated with a nitro
drip in the CCU and was changed to a long acting po nitrate on
the floor, which was titrated up for chest pain as his blood
pressure tolerated. He was on Imdur 90mg on discharge. He was
also restarted on his norvasc prior to discharge for angina. H
