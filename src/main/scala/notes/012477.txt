HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 27636**] is a 70
gentleman with the past medical history significant for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe hypoxemia
at baseline requiring supplemented oxygen, obstructive sleep
apnea, cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension, and morbid
obesity.  The patient was admitted to the hospital for
elective tracheostomy.  He had tracheostomy on [**1-30**].
The night following the tracheostomy, he had desaturations
with respiratory acidosis.  He was quickly weaned to a
tracheostomy tube mask.  Baseline ABG prior to the operation
revealed pH 7.32, pCO2 68, pO2 51 on 5 liters of oxygen by
nasal cannula.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He has a 50 pack
per year smoking history.  CT of the chest in [**2154**] showed
severe emphysema in all lobes and enlarged pulmonary artery.
This was pulmonary arterial hypertension.  PFTs in [**2155-11-20**] showed restrictive ventilatory defect.  The FVC was 51%
of predicted.  The FEV1 was 54% predicted.  There was a
markedly reduced DLCO.
2.  Congestive heart failure.  TTE in [**2155-5-20**] showed
moderately dilated left atrium, enlarged right atrium,
moderately symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and
decreased left ventricular systolic function, and markedly
dilated aortic root.
3.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
4.  History of positive PPD, status post left atrial myxoma
repair.
5.  Morbid obesity.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Status post appendectomy.
8.  Status post C2 diskectomy.
9.  Status post removal of throat polyps.
10. Status post transtracheal catheterization in [**2154**].
11. History of SVT.

MEDICATIONS: (at home).
1.  Demodex 40 mg q.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
3.  Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d.
4.  Potassium chloride 60 mEq b.i.d.
5.  Diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d.


ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives on [**Location (un) **]
with his wife.  The patient has a 50 pack per year smoking
history.  He reports occasional alcohol use.  He is a retired
coroner.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient reports no family history of
asthma, coronary artery disease or cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, heart rate 74, blood pressure
120/70, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 95% at 50%
oxygen delivered via tracheostomy tube collar and four liters
of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula.  He was awake, alert,
and speaking complete sentences.  He was in no apparent
distress. He was in no respiratory distress.  His face was
plethoric.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular muscles are intact with no nystagmus,
anicteric.  No conjunctival pallor.  NECK:  Neck was full and
supple.  Tracheostomy tube site was nontender and intact.
LUNG:  Examination demonstrated distant lung sounds, but
bibasilar crackles and expiratory wheezes.  HEART:  The heart
sounds were distant, but regular in regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  There was no
clubbing or cyanosis, and 1+ pitting bilateral pretibial
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 9.9, hematocrit 43.5, platelet count 183,000.
Electrolytes were notable for BUN of 28, creatinine of 1.2.
The ABG was 7.36, 58, and 77.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit electively following the tracheostomy.  He had an
uneventful night in the Intensive Care Unit, and he was
transferred to the medical floor.  His post tracheostomy
hospital course was somewhat complicated.  After initial
transfer to the medical floor, he continued to have nocturnal
desaturations.  He was electively transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring of his oxygen
saturation.  Upon arrival to the ICU for the second time, he
was fluid overloaded.  During his stay in the ICU for one
week he was successfully diuresed, approximately one to one
and one half liters of fluid per day.  During this time, he
had clear improvement in his oxygenation, both during the day
and nighttime.  Oxygen regimen during his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit was optimized to the following regimen:
6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula during the day with
tracheostomy tube cap on and 3 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula 35% tracheostomy tube mask in the evenings.  During
the stay in the Intensive Care Unit he was started on
Medroxyprogesterone to stimulate central respiratory drive,
as a sleep study done prior to this admission had shown both
a central and obstructive component to his sleep apnea.

Upon transfer from the medical Intensive Care Unit to the
medical floor on [**2-11**], the patient was saturating
well, even during ambulation with assistance.

The second Intensive Care Unit stay was somewhat complicated
due to difficulties in finding the correct size of his
tracheostomy tube and the appropriate appendages, such a
tracheostomy tube cuff and tracheostomy tube cap.  The
patient's tracheostomy tubes were displaced and extruded
several times during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit
often during episodes of coughing.  This resulted in several
episodes of hypoxia and one episode of subcutaneous
emphysema, when the patient was being ventilated manually
during a hypoxic episode.  The patient was transferred from
the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor on [**2-11**].
he stayed on the floor for the rest of his hospital stay.
During this time he awaited the delivery of a longer
custom-made tracheostomy tube.  The tracheostomy tube, which
he had in place on transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to
the day before discharge, was kept in place during his stay
on the floor, and he had no further episodes of extrusion of
the tracheostomy tube.

On the day prior to discharge, his tracheostomy tube was
replaced with a custom made 120-mm fenestrated tracheostomy
tube.  Both before and after the tracheostomy replacement he
was saturating well both during the day and at nighttime.  He
was ambulating without assistance during the day on 6 liters
of portable oxygen via nasal cannula.

The tracheostomy replacement procedure went uneventfully.  On
the day of discharge the patient was maintaining good oxygen
saturation on 6 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula with
tracheostomy capped during the day time and 6 liters of
oxygen via nasal cannula with 40% oxygen delivered via
tracheostomy mask at nighttime.

On the day of discharge, arterial blood gas was performed to
determine whether the Medroxyprogesterone was successfully
stimulating central respiratory drive.  The ABG on 6 liter
nasal cannula with tracheostomy capped revealed a pH of 7.41,
pCO2 46, pO2 s61.  Given the significant decrease in the
arterial CO2 on the Medroxyprogesterone, decision was made to
continue the Medroxyprogesterone therapy as an outpatient.
