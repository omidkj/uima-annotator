Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Mild spontaneous [**Hospital1 113**] contrast in the
body of the LA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated
LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Moderately
depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
masses or vegetations on aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess.
No AS. Severe (4+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous [**Last Name (Prefixes) 113**]
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately to severely dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is globally, moderately depressed
(LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricle displays normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is
severe prolapse of right coronary cusp and also some prolapse of
one of the other leaflets. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward
the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion.
The patient was AV paced. There is normal right ventricular
systolic function. The left ventricle displasia new septal
dyskinesis that may be secondary to pacemaking vs. new
intraventricular conduction delay vs. ischemia. The rest of the
left ventricular segments display improved function relative to
the pre-bypass exam. Overall ejection fraction is likely
marginally improved to the 35-40% range. There is a bileaflet
prosthesis in the aortic position. It appears well seated and
displays normal leaflet motion. At a cardiac output of 6.5
liters/minute, the maximum gradient across the valve was 28 mmHg
woith a mean gradient of 13 mmHg and an effective area of about
1.9 cm2. There is trace aortic regurgitation as consistent with
this prosthesis. The thoracic aorta is intact after
decannulation. No other significant changes from the pre-bypass
findings.

PA and lateral chest compared to [**10-8**]:
Left lower lobe atelectasis nearly resolved. Small residual
pleural effusions and stable normal-appearing postoperative
cardiomediastinal silhouette, heart size increased since the
last preoperative study on [**9-30**]. No pulmonary edema. No
pneumothorax.

EKG
Normal sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block with secondary
ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-9-29**] the
left
bundle-branch block is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
55-year-old patient with progressive intolerance for activity
over the previous several months was found to have a cardiac
murmur.  A subsequent  investigation showed severe aortic valve
regurgitation with some dilatation of the left ventricle with an
ejection fraction about 35%. A`coronary angiogram had non
obstructive coronary artery disease.
The patient was admitted for elective aortic valve replacement
on [**2145-10-8**]. He was taken to the operating room and had Aortic
valve replacement with a mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] size 23-mm valve,
his bypass time was 145 minutes with a crossclamp of 132
minutes. Please see operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and sedated in stable condition. He weaned off pressor
support, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin for his
mechanical valve. Beta-blocker and diuresis were initiated. All
tubes, lines and drains were discontinued per cardiac surgery
protocol. On POD1 he was t
