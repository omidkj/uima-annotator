History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 18252**] is a 75 year old gentleman with pmh of HTN, HLD,
afib, chf with EF of 15%, s/p ICD [**2114**] after 3 separate cardiac
arrests. Patient underwent an BIV upgrade [**7-27**] at [**Hospital1 18**] after
being transferred from [**Hospital1 46**], s/p VF arrest at that time. The
patient says that the site of the pacer never healed after
surgery he had in [**July 2117**]. He reports that he recently visited
his Cardiologist in [**Location (un) 3320**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60610**], it was decided
that he need to undergo surgical repair. The patient has not had
any pain at the site of the infection. He feels the reddness is
stable. He denies fevers or chills. He reports that he can
visualize the pacer lead and that it has been that way for quite
some time. He has been on keflex TID for at least 1 month. Pt
discontinued his coumadin 2 days previously as instructed by his
cardiologist. He is being admitted today for IV antibiotics in
preparation for lead/pocket revision in OR 1 on Monday [**1-31**] at
2pm.
.
ROS: he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**2118-1-27**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-3**], there is little
change.
Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
in a patient with pacemaker device in place. No evidence of
vascular congestion or pleural effusion. The nipple ring has
been removed.
EKG [**2118-1-27**]: V paced HR 60with no significant change compared
with prior dated [**2117-8-2**].
[**2117-8-2**] EKG: Ventricular paced rhythm with intermittent atrial
pacing.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2118-1-31**] demonstrated:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis.
4. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion after extraction of the
leads.
.
ETT performed on [**2116-8-10**] demonstrated:
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with an uninterpretable
EKG.
Possible drop in blood pressure with exercise. Frequent ectopy.

Nuclear report:
1. No reversible perfusion defects at the level of exercise
achieved. 2. Severe, global hypokinesis of the left ventricle.
3. Further increase in left ventricle cavity size compared to
the prior study.
4. EF 17%.
.
CXR - [**2118-2-4**]
The three pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium, right
ventricle, and left ventricular epicardial vein. The lungs are
essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 18252**] is a 75 yo male with a history of severe CHF, AFib,
HTN, HLD, CAD who presented with concern for an infected
pacemaker, s/p CCU stay for hypotension.
.
# Pacemaker pocket infection: Likely chronic cellulitis of
pacemaker pocket since 7/[**2117**]. Blood cultures persistently
negative, wound swab gram stain/culture non-revealing. Pt was
started on vancomycin for a 10-day course (day 1: [**2118-1-27**]).
Previous L-sided ICD removed and new right-sided BiV-ICD placed
on [**2118-2-3**]. At the time of placement of new pacer on the
right, a pocket hematoma of the left pacer site was evacuated
and a drain placed.
.
# Hypotension: Pt w history of HTN, however, became hypotensive
into 70s post-ICD lead removal on [**1-31**] likely [**2-21**] poor forward
flow from CHF, hypovolemia from being NPO, opiates during
procedures, and loss of biventricular synchrony after ICD
extraction. Echo did not show pericardial effusion or tamponade.
Initially required phenylephrine gtt in the peri-procedure
hours, which was transitioned to dopamine gtt which was then
weaned. His carvedilol, lisinopril,  furosemide, spironolactone
were held in setting of hypotension, but restarted once symptoms
resolved in the CCU.
.
# Pump: Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with LVEF 15%.
S/p new right-sided BiV-ICD placement on [**2118-2-4**]. ACE-I/BBl
held for hypotension on transfer to CCU. Once stable, pt
restarted on carvedilol, lisinopril, digoxin, furosemide and
spironolactone.
.
# Coronaries: Pt with history of multiple previous MIs, but no
history of CABG or PCI. Pt had episodes of substernal
pressurelike 5/10 chest pain in the setting of anemia and
hypertension. These were thought to be [**2-
