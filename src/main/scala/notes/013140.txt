Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural
effusions, probably stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is
unchanged. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
leads in standard placements, unchanged. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course, by problem:
.
#UROSEPSIS:  Patient started on vanco and zosyn in ICU.  BP
responded to fluids.  Per HCP and family pt was DNR/DNI and did
not want any CVL.  BLood cultures grew out GNR eventually
speciated as klebsiella and E coli, which were both sensitive to
Zosyn; UA markedly positive.  Pt defervesced and WBC improved.
BB and ACE-I initially held d/t hypotension but then restarted.
Will complete a total of a 14 day course of IV abx.
.
#? Otitis externa:  No significant otitis noted on exam but pt
had h/o MRSA otitis.  As there was no evidence of ongoing
infection, vanco d/c'd.
.
#ELEV INR:  INR up on admission.  coumadin held and vit k given.
 INR trended down and coumadin restarted at 5mg.  He was
transfused for HCt in low 20s but Hct remained in 20s.  No
evidence of bleeding and iron studies show ACD.
.
#ARF:  Cr over 3 on admission.  With hydration and treatment of
sepsis trended down steadily to 1.2 upon d/c
.
#Anemia:  HCT noted to be low on admission (21.7); the patient
was given 2U PRBC with elevation to 24.9; HCT remained stable
during rest of admission.  Labs consistent with Anemia of
Chronic disease.  Epogen should be started as an outpt along
with iron.
.
#CHF:  the patient developed volume overload in the setting of
volume resuscitation.  Once BP stabilized, Lopressor and
Captopril readded, along with PO lasix.  He can be further
diuresed at rehab.  Lopressor and Captopril should be titrated
as BP/HR allow.
.
#Speech/Swallow:  pt had ?aspiration event while in house.
Speech swallow consult obtained; recommended obtaining a video
swallow.  This showed mild-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia
characterized by reduced base of tongue retraction, hyolaryngeal
excursion, and laryngeal valve closure resulting in
moderate-severe vallecular residue which builds up over time.
This residue is more significant with solids than liquids
andputs the pt at increased risk for penetration and aspiration.
 As such, s/s team recommended:  diet be restricted to pureed
solids
and thin liquids with PO meds crushed in purees.  Strict
aspiration precautions and swallowing strategies should be
followed.  Pt would benefit from follow up by speech/swallowing
therapy at rehab to determine appropriateness for a repeat video
swallow study for possible diet upgrade.
.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Pureed solids and thin liquids.
.
2. PO meds crushed in puree, wash down with sip of liquid.
.
3. Strict aspiration precautions including:
   a) Swallow twice for every bite.
   b) Alternate between sips and bites.
