Studies:
.
CXR: The study is limited secondary to positioning. The lateral
aspects of the mid right hemithorax have been excluded. The
lungs are well expanded and clear. The mediastinum is
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for
size. No effusion or pneumothorax is evident. The osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Within limitations stated above, no acute pulmonary
process.
.
EKG: Sinus tach at 107, nonspecific, rate-related ST
depressions, peaked T waves in V4-V6


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 54 yo woman h/o type 1 DM w/ gastroparesis and neuropathy,
HTN, Hep C presents with DKA (initial Glc 777, AG 33) and fevers
to 102 x2d with N/V (nonbloody), worsening gastroparesis pain
and nonproductive cough.
.
Pt reports compliance w/ home insulin. EKG without definite
ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes negative and pt dneied any new
meds. Infection most likely trigger of DKA given fever x2 days
with N/V and WBC with mild left shift. Abdominal exam
nonspecific given DKA and no rebound/guarding. No abdominal
imaging or abx for now. UA clean. CXR unremarkable. Possible
trigger viral gastroenteritis. Pt did not have a flu shot so flu
to be considered but less likely. Thyroid dysfunction can
trigger DKA but her free T4 and T3 were all within normal limits
and she will continue her anti-thyroid medication for Graves'
Disease. Last A1c [**3-26**] was 6.0, now markedly elevated at 10.
Last DKA in [**2129**]. AG closed at 6 w/ fluids and insulin gtt. Her
electrolytes were repleted accordingly. Glucose levels were
labile off the insulin gtt.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and
recommended restarting home glargine dose at 36units at bedtime.
 Her humalog sliding scale was increased and patient was
instructed to take the humalog after meals if she is able to
tolerate the meal given her gastroparesis.  Her fingersticks
remained in 100s and she tolerated a PO diet. She did not
require any antibiotics for her GI symptoms.  She will f/u with
[**Last Name (un) **] and her PMD next week. No other changes in her
medications were made.
