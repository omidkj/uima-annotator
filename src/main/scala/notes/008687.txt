Pertinent Reports
CXR ([**2120-10-23**]): The left lung shows minimal basilar
opacification, but is otherwise clear with no pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax. There is complete opacification of the right lung
concerning
for pleural effusion. Mild leftward shift of the mediastinum and
trachea is appreciated.
.
CXR ([**2120-10-24**]):  In comparison with the earlier study of this
date, there has been apparent reaccumulation of right pleural
effusion. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Prominence of interstitial markings is consistent
with some
elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Relatively mild
atelectatic changes seen at the left base.
.
CXR ([**2120-10-25**]): In comparison with study of [**10-24**], there has been
removal of substantial pleural fluid from the right chest. No
definite pneumothorax is appreciated. There is a structure
simulating a pleural line, but this appears to be an extraneous
tube on that side.
.
CXR ([**2120-10-26**]): In comparison with study of [**10-26**], there is
further re-accumulation of the large right hydrothorax.
Respiratory motion makes it difficult to determine whether there
is true prominence of interstitial markings consistent with
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left lung remains
relatively clear.
.
CT chest ([**2120-10-28**]): 1. Extensive bronchocentric abnormality is
either multifocal aspiration pneumonia or a primary pulmonary
hemorrhage and right middle lobe pneumonia.
2. Small residual non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion with no
demonstrable pulmonary cause, since it preceded the multifocal
pneumonia; basal pigtail catheter.
.
CXR ([**2120-10-31**]):
1. Decreased right pleural effusion since [**2120-10-28**].
2. Faint left mid lung opacity corresponding to CT finding.
Other
consolidations seen on CT are not visible on the current
radiograph.
.
TTE ([**2120-10-25**]): Normal RV cavity size. Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension
.
Liver US ([**2120-10-25**]): 1. Patent left and right portal veins with
normal direction of flow.
2. Cirrhosis.
3. Right pleural effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old female with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with
progressive dyspnea and pleurisy found to have massive
right-sided pleural effusion likely due to hepatic hydrothorax.


1. Hepatic hydrothorax - Her initial thoracentesis fluid
analysis showed pleural effusion:serum ratio of total protein to
be 0.1 and LDH eff:serum ratio of 0.14, both consistent with
transudative effusion. Patient has normal LVEF and diastolic
function on TTE. Gram stain was negative, no organisms, no
polys.

Effusion recurred within 6 hours of her first thoracentesis in
the ED (~3 liters removed).  She was transferred to MICU on day
#2 of her admission due to progressive shortness of breath due
to her pleural effusion.

She was diuresed in the ED with IV lasix and received
thoracentesis x 2 with pig tail placement to drain the fluid
after the second thoracentesis.

Her pleural effusion did not recur after her pig tail catheter
was removed.  She continued to do well on room air.  She was
discharged on lasix 40 mg po qdaily, spironolactone 100 mg po
qdaily and tolvapton 15 mg po qdaily

2. Hyponatremia: She was noted to have hyponatremia on admission
which was thought to be due to nonosmolar vasopression related
from her ESLD.  Since she needed continued diuresis with lasix
and spironolactone to help with her pleural effusion, tolvapton
15 mg po qdaily was started.  It was discontinued while she was
in the MICU as her sodium normalized.  On
