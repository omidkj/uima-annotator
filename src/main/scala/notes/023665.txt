Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p pericardial drain

History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with CLL, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], s/p matched
sibling donor allo-[**First Name (STitle) 3242**] in [**2-16**] discharged on [**2142-12-30**] after
presenting with nausea, chills, tachypnea, hypoxia, and
tachycardia after being given platelet transfusion and IVIG,
thought to be CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed and breathing
greatly improved.  Patient denies orthopnea and states he only
gets short of breath with activity, which is also limited by his
lack of strength.  The patient was also recently admitted from
[**2142-11-28**] to [**2142-12-26**] for resistant HSV c/b CHF exacerbation.
During that admission he was started on captopril and BB.  Echo
in [**8-20**] with EF 50-55% and in [**9-19**] with EF 20-25%.  Patient was
seen by cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in [**10-20**] and it was thought
that cardiomyopathy was probably related to chemotherapy (?from
campath/alemtuzumab) vs viral.  In [**11-19**] showed EF 20% and
moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.  He had
appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] today and Echo was done showing large
pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.  Patient had
pericardial drain placed by cardiology.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
CLL, diagnosed in [**2137**] Treated with fludarabine then relapsed
allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**] from his brother in [**2-16**] c/b grade I skin and hepatic
GVHD, and febrile neutropenia.
In [**7-19**] his CLL relapsed and he underwent DLI in
[**9-18**] and [**10-19**]. in [**7-20**] his WBC rose and he developed
lyphadenopathy. It was decided to start campath. He has suffered

from oral lesions, and has been on famvir.

-2nd degree, Mobitz I, heart block.
-s/p inguinal hernia repair
-Cardiomyopathy: Moderate pericardial effusion and markedly
reduced EF (20%) noted on echo in [**9-19**], presumed viral vs.
chemotherapy induced. Followed by cardiology.

[**2143-1-4**]: Echocardiogram: EF 10-15%.
1.There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
2. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion.
4.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**2143-1-4**]
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained without contrast enhancement.
CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a
hiatal hernia. There is a large right pleural effusion and a
small left pleural effusion. There is no pericardial effusion.
Images of the abdomen demonstrate a dense liver likely secondary
to blood
transfusions and iron deposition. There is no biliary
dilatation. Low
density is present in the left lobe of the liver which was not
seen previously but has a nonspecific appearance on this
non-contrast study. It measures 1.6 x 0.9 cm. There is mild
splenomegaly again noted. There is poor visualization of the
pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys. There is a large amount
of ascites. There are no dilated bowel loops. There is no
hyperdense fluid in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space.
Dense lymph nodes are present in the porta hepatis and in the
paraaortic regions which were seen on the CT from [**2141-8-15**].
CT PELVIS FINDINGS: There is a small focus of gas in the urinary
bladder.
Surgical clips are present in the anterior lower pelvic wall,
suggestive of prior hernia repair. There is a large amount of
pelvic free fluid. There is mild atherosclerosis.
Bone windows demonstrate a mottled appearance of the ilia and
proximal femora is seen bilaterally and is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. No peritoneal or retroperitoneal bleed as clinically
questioned.
2. Large amount of ascites. Large right pleural effusion and
small left
pleural effusion.
3. Otherwise, fairly limited evaluation of the abdomen secondary
to lack of contrast and large amount of ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old male with CLL with cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15% and
pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade s/p
pericardial drain.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  One
day after the drain was placed, it was removed.  Several hours
after the drain was pulled, the patient had a systolic blood
pressure that decreased from 90's to 50's.  He was asymptomatic
with this blood pressure, was mentating and making urine.  His
white count increased from 4.5 to 29 in one day.  His temp was
noted to be 99 degrees.  There was an initial concern of septic
shock given his immunosuppression and he was started on stress
dose steroids as well as Vancomycin and Cefepime.  His
Hematocrit was also noted to have dropped from 31 to 23 and he
was tranfused 2 units.  The next day his hematocrit had not
increased despite the transfusion and he had an abdominal CT
scan that was negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  Hemolysis
labs were checked and negative.  Patient likely had decreasing
hematocrit because he is transfusion dependent at baseline
requiring [**12-17**] transfusion/week also in setting of positive fluid
balance by 1-2 liters/day as he was dehydrated on admission.
His Hct increased to 36 and remained stable.

1.  CV: Pump: EF 10-15% by Echo.  S/P pericardial drain, fluid
sent for flow cytometry (to be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].  Echo
checked post-procedure and no evidence of reaccumulation of
effusion.  Patient never had a pulsus during admission.  Patient
appeared hypovolemi
