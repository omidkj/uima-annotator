Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old man
who presents with two days of intermittent chest pain from an
outside hospital.  The patient states that he developed chest
pain at rest approximately two days ago with some shortness
of breath and diaphoresis.  The patient took Aspirin and
Maalox without relief.  The chest pain continued
intermittently for two days.  On the day prior to admission,
the patient had chest pain throughout the night.  He came to
[**Hospital3 **] on Sunday morning complaining of chest pain,
four out of ten.  Electrocardiogram showed minimal ST
elevations in leads V1 through V3 with Q waves in leads II,
III and aVF.  The patient was given Aspirin and Plavix and
put on Nitroglycerin and Heparin drips.  He was also started
on Integrilin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.  Upon arrival to
the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department, the patient was chest pain free and was taken to
the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  Catheterization
showed a totally occluded right coronary artery, which was
not able to be opened up.  During the procedure, the patient
developed a dissection of the coronary artery.  An
echocardiogram did not show any evidence of tamponade or
effusion.  Right heart catheterization showed normal filling
pressures.  The patient was transferred to CCU for further
observation given the coronary artery dissection.  Upon
arrival to the CCU, the patient denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, back pain or groin pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Ventolin meter dose inhaler two puffs three times a day.
2.  Theophylline.
3.  Advair one puff once daily.
4.  Folic Acid.
5.  Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco or illicit
drug use.  He is a social alcohol drinker.  He lives with his
wife and two daughters.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of early heart
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed the
patient is afebrile with a blood pressure of 120/70, pulse
80, respiratory rate 12 and oxygen saturation 95% on two
liters.  In general, the patient is well appearing and in no
apparent distress.  Pulsus was measured at 8 mmHg.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is unremarkable.
Neck examination showed jugular venous distention at 6.0
centimeters.  The chest is clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs or rubs. The
abdomen is benign.  Extremities show right groin
catheterization site which is clean, dry and intact with no
hematoma and no bruit.  The patient has 1+ dorsalis pedis
pulses on the right and 2+ on the left.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count was
unremarkable.  Chem7 is remarkable for a blood urea nitrogen
of 17, creatinine 1.5.  Initial CK was 717 with a MB of 81
and MB index of 11.3 and troponin T of 0.66.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per
minute with a normal axis and normal intervals.  There are ST
elevations of 2.0 millimeters in leads V1 through V3 with Q
waves in leads II, III and aVF and biphasic T waves in leads
V3 and V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Inferior myocardial infarction - The patient had a
totally occluded right coronary artery which was not able to
be intervened.  After the cardiac catheterization, the
patient was continued on Aspirin.  He was also started on
Lipitor at 80 mg once daily.  The patient was also started on
ace inhibitor which was titrated up for blood pressure
control.  Initially, he was not started on a beta blocker due
to concern for cardiac tamponade and masking of tachycardia
as well as due to his asthma.  However, after initial 24
hours without any evidence of cardiac tamponade from his
coronary artery dissection and significant hypertension, the
patient was started on beta blocker.  This was gradually
titrated up.  The patient actually became mildly hypotensive
on Lopressor 50 mg twice a day and Zestril 20 mg once daily.
Therefore upon discharge, the doses of these two
antihypertensive medications were reduced.  The patient's CK
enzymes were followed and continued to trend down after the
cardiac catheterization.  The patient did not have any
further chest pain.

2.  Coronary artery dissection - The patient was monitored
closely for sides of pericardial effusion and tamponade
secondary to his coronary artery dissection.  Pulsus
paradoxus was checked for periodically throughout the first
24 to 48 hours, however, this remained stable and there were
no other signs of effusion or tamponade.

3.  Fever - Approximately 48 hours after the cardiac
catheterization, the patient developed a fever of 101.5.  He
was also complaining of myalgias.  Both the fever and the
myalgias were relieved and there were no focal signs of
infection.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  A chest
x-ray was also done.  Upon discharge, there was no evidence
of infection from any of these.  As the patient was afebrile,
he was not started on any antibiotics and no further workup
was done.   The patient was discharged home with instruction
that his blood cultures would be followed up upon by the CCU
team after discharge and he would be contact[**Name (NI) **] if they were
positive and required treatment.

4.  Asthma - The patient did not have any acute asthma
exacerbations during his hospitalization despite the addition
of beta blockade and he was maintained on his outpatient
regimen of Advair, Flovent, Theophylline and p.r.n.
Albuterol.

5.  Code Status - The patient was full code on admission and
at discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable.  He was
ambulating, chest pain free, with blood pressure well
controlled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Asthma.
5.  Coronary artery dissection.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Advair discus one puff twice a day.
3.  Flovent one puff twice a day.
4.  Albuterol as needed.
5.  Theophylline 300 mg q12hours.
6.  Folic Acid one tablet once daily.
7.  Lipitor 80 mg once daily.
8.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.
9.  Toprol XL 75 mg once daily.
10. Zestril 10 mg once daily.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS AND DISCHARGE PLANS:
1.  The patient was asked to follow-up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 55003**], approximately one week after discharge.
2.  The patient was also asked to follow-up with
cardiologist, either Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55003**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], from this
hospital admission, approximately one week after discharge.
3.  He was also asked to call his primary care physician if
he had any further fevers, chills, chest pain or shortness of
breath.
