Pertinent Results:
[**7-10**] Angio:
There are diffuse atherosclerotic changes with calcifications.
An atherosclerotic plaque is present in the origin of the right
internal carotid artery with less than 50% stenosis by diameter.
The right MCA and its branches fill briskly without evidence of
branch occlusion.
Three aneurysm clips are seen in the region of the right MCA
bifurcation aneurysm. There is residual aneurysm filling
medially and inferiorly to the clips measuring approximately 7 x
10 mm whereas this previously measured approximately 10 x 13 mm.
The aneurysm maintains a broad base and does mot appear easily
amenable to coil embolization. Two small aneurysms, each
measuring approximately 2 mm are present arising from the
pericallosal artery ventrally/superiorly and are unchanged from
previous. All major branches of the right internal carotid
artery and its branches remained perfused.

[**7-11**] Head CT:
Postoperative changes consistent with right craniotomy and
aneurysm clipping in the right MCA territory seen. Extensive
pneumocephalus and small right sided post-operative subdural are
seen.

EEG [**2116-7-15**]:
 Abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow and
disorganized background. This indicates a widespread
encephalopathy
affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications,

metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although
encephalopathies
may obscure focal findings. There was frequent sharp artifact,
but
there was no clear epileptiform features.

CTA head [**2116-7-14**]: Again demonstrated are three aneurysm clips in
the region of the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation
aneurysm. There remains a residual aneurysm filling medially and
inferiorly to the clips not significantly changed from recent
cerebral angiogram. Also stable are two smaller aneurysms
measuring approximately 2 mm each arising from the pericallosal
artery on the right. A 4 mm aneurysm with a 2 mm daughter
aneurysm is again seen at the bifurcation of the left middle
cerebral artery, also unchanged. The branches distal to the
middle cerebral artery bifurcations opacify well and are patent
bilaterally. Similarly, the anterior cerebral and posterior
cerebral artery circulations appear patent and are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of dissection or aneurysm of the
vertebrobasilar system. The left vertebral artery is dominant.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally at the level just proximal
to the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].

[**2116-7-27**]:Plain film abdomen (pt w/ ileus):
The large and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
free air underneath the hemidiaphragms. There is a percutaneous
gastrostomy tube. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

MRI/MRA [**2116-7-28**]:
1.No acute infarction or clear area of intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged postoperative appearance of the right frontal lobe.
2. Increased sinus mucosal thickening and fluid as described
above, likely related to patient's intubated status.
3. MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] susceptibility artifact in the
region of right middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipping. No
change in the aneurysm seen at the left MCA bifurcation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service and underwent a
R MCA aneurysm clipping. Three clips were placed around the
aneurysm at the time of operation. Immediately postoperatively,
she was taken to the angiography lab to evaluate clip placement
and cerebral circulation. The angiography revealed partial
clipping of the R MCA aneurysm as well as adequate blood supple
to the right brain. She was transferred intubated to the ICU and
overnight she was successfully extubated. On POD1 she was awake
and following commands, not conversational but not agitated or
confused.  However, throughout the day she became more somnolent
and required reintubation for agitation and decreased mental
status. A STAT head CT did not reveal any acute changes. She had
an increase in her work of breathing and a poor ABG, so she was
reintubated. When her sedation was weaned later that day she was
no longer following commands or answering questions (by head
movement as she was intubated) which was thought likely to be
secondary to uncontrolled diabetes. A Neurology consult was
obtained and they recommended EEG which was negative for
seizure.  CTA which showed no significant change in right middle
cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm and associated small
daughter aneurysm as well as two small aneurysms arising from
the pericallosal artery on the right in comparison to cerebral
angiogram [**2116-7-10**]. No change in left middle cerebral
artery bifurcation aneurysm compared to cerebral angiogram [**6-2**], [**2116**]. Patent bilateral middle cerebral arterial circulations
distal to the aneurysms.

She was given supportive care and was extubated on POD5 however,
once again, she required reintubation for decreased mental
status and agitation. On the morning of POD6, she was noted to
be awake and following commands, an improvement from her
previous examination.

She continued to follow command for approximately the next two
days 23/[**7-18**] but then only followed intermittently.  Follow
up CTs showed normal progression of subdural blood. No new
strokes.

She was found to be fluid overloaded requiring a Lasix drip.
She had fevers on POD [**1-6**] and found to be growing gram
negative rods in sputum was treated with three days of
Ceftriaxone.
