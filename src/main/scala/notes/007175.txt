Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59523**] is a 72 year old woman with [**Known lastname 59735**],
COPD, CHF and type II diabetes. She was admitted [**12-26**] for
removal of metal stents from her L main bronchus and trachea and
developed dyspnea thereafter over the next 5-6 hours. Her
respiratory rate increased to 20-25 range and she developed
increased work of breathing. O2 sats remained nl but given
likely obstruction to her breathing, BiPap therapy was initiated
and she was transferred to MICU.
She had undergone tracheoplasty and bilateral bronchoplasty with
mesh in [**1-/2143**] and had done well until [**10/2145**] when she
worsening dyspnea. Bronchoscopy and dynamic airway CT revealed
recurrent [**Year (4 digits) 59735**]. A silicone Y-stent was placed
but the patient could not tolerate this secondary to coughing
and it was therefore removed. The plan was then to trial her
with metal stents to the L mainstem bronchus and trachea and
this was on on [**12-6**]. She seemed to do fairly well with this.
Follow up bronchoscopy revealed some endotheliazation and the
stents were therefore removed today

1) [**Month/Year (2) **] s/p tracheobronchoplasty [**1-15**]
2) GERD s/p Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication [**4-15**] with
revision
[**10-15**] for symptom recurrence
3) Type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent
4) CHF, diastolic with LVH
5) HTN
6) COPD
7) IBS
8) osteoarthritis
9) Cecal AVM
10) h/o rheumatic fever in childhood


Social History:

secretary. She drinks alcohol occasionally and socially. She is

not a current smoker. She stopped smoking 7 years ago and she
smoked for almost 40 years 1.5 - 2 packs a day and she denies
any history of any asbestos exposure.

Physical Exam:
T 96 BP 91/58 P 87 RR 15 O2 100 on BiPap
Gen: Elderly Caucasian woman, wearing BiPap mask, currently NAD

Neck: No jugular venous distension appreciated. No tracheal
stridor
Chest: Lungs CTA b/l, no wheezes appreciated, fair air movement

Brief Hospital Course:
This 72 year old woman with severe [**Month/Year (2) 59735**], and
GERD s/p Nissen fundoplication was admitted [**12-27**] for removal of
metal stents from trachea and L mainstem bronchus.  Shortly
after the procedure, she developed severe dyspnea with tachypnea
and required BiPap and transfer to the MICU overnight.  Her
oxygenation remained nl throughout this time  She improved on
the continuous BiPap and, by the following morning, was able to
wean off of this--requiring the BiPap only intermittently.  The
following day she was transferred to the floor under the
Interventional pulmonary service.  She underwent EGD for
assessment of her reflux prior to possible tracheoplasty.
.
1) [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have recurrence of collapse, seems
to be responding well to BiPap. Had no desats on bipap
overnight.   Thereafter, only requiring this intermittently.
Has been off bipap for 2hr this am. Doing well. Now requesting
to go back on.
-maintain BiPap prn for now, mainly at night
-considered steroids if question of tracheal inflammation but
held off, improved without this
-cont PPI
-undergoing EGD for assessment of GERD, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59736**],
however, not a candidate for revision of fundoplication at this
time.

.
2) CHF, diastolic, do not suspect decompensation, no signs of
overload or edema on CXR
-continue torsemide, lasix
-would consider beta blocker at some point
-would consider aspirin, will hold pending need for procedures
.
3) COPD--this does not seem like COPD flare
-cont advair, spiriva, albuterol
-considering steroids but holding off for now
.
4) GERD s/p fundoplication
-continue protonix
-EGD for assessment of GERD.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], unlikely to be
candidate revision of Nissen /tracheoplasty.

5) FEN, .
6) Ppx: Hep SC, bowel regimen as needed, PPI as above, morphine
