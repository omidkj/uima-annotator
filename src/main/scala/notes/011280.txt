History of Present Illness:
37 y.o. male who had a 70foot fall [**2164-6-15**], unconscious,
initally unclear whether he fell or was pushed, presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED unstable with a GCS of 3, SBP 60's.  Difficulty
intubating in the field, airway secured in ED and bilateral
chest tubes placed.  Blood pressure stabilized and a bag of
white powder was found in his rectum.  He was taken to CT then
x-ray where he dropped his pressure again, was transfused and

Pertinent Results:
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2164-6-14**] 11:37 PM
FACIAL BONES CT: Transverse fractures through the left frontal
bone and frontal sinus is present with associated small
pneumocephalus. The frontal bone fracture extends inferiorly to
the nasal bones. There are fractures involving the superior,
medial, lateral and inferior walls of the right orbit as well as
the superior and medial walls of the left orbit. There is no
evidence of rectus muscle entrapment. The superior ophthalmic
vein and optic nerves bilaterally are intact as well as the
globes. Significant amount of extraconal air is seen
bilaterally. Globes are intact and no significant proptosis is
noted. Preseptal edema is present and more pronounced on the
right than on the left. Additionally there is a fracture through
the lateral wall of the right sphenoid sinus as well as the
anterior, medial and lateral walls of the right maxillary sinus.
Fractures through the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus is
also apparent. High density fluid is seen within both frontal,
both maxillary, both ethmoid and both sphenoid sinuses
consistent with blood. The visualized portion of the brain
appears unremarkable without evidence of intra or extraaxial
hemorrhage. The mastoid air cells appear well pneumatized.

The sphenoid sinus fracture involves the right carotid canal,
raising an concern of carotid artery injury. There is a fracture
along the medial wall of the right optic canal, potentially
injuring the right optic nerve.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pneumothoraces with pulmonary contusions.
2. Numerous right-sided rib fractures, transverse fracture
through the T1 vertebral body, comminuted fractures through the
sacrum and left superior and inferior pubic rami as described
above. Large pelvic hematoma seen in the presacral space.
3. Location of right superior chest tube with tip tracking along
the medial aspect adjacent to the mediastinum.
4. No significant injury identified within the abdomen or
pelvis.

ANKLE/FOOT (AP & LAT) SOFT TIS; TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) SOFT TISSUE
IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted fracture through the proximal third of the right
fibula and medially displaced fracture of the proximal tibia.
2. Comminuted fracture of the right calcaneus with rotation and
dislocation of the left talus.
3. Irregularity of the right ankle mortise and proximal
compression deformity of the right talus.

[**Numeric Identifier 12345**] SEL CATH 2ND ORDER  [**2164-6-30**] 8:06 PM No evidence of
carotid vertebral artery dissection or stenosis and no evidence
of intracranial pseudoaneurysm or dural fistula.

ART DUP EXT UP BILAT COMP  [**2164-9-3**] 2:04 PM

The bypass was patent, with no evidence of significant, flow
limiting stenosis. The peak systolic velocities were measured at
119 cm/second in the native left subclavian artery, 90 cm/second
at the left-sided bypass anastomosis, between 106 and 120
cm/second within the bypass itself, 68 cm/second at the right,
distal bypass anastomosis, and 149 cm/second in the native right
subclavian artery.

US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR LEFT  [**2164-9-6**] 4:52 PM IMPRESSION:
Heterogeneous collection is seen superior and anterior to the
axillary graft at the site of the drainage. This would be in
keeping with hematoma or infected collection as suspected
clinically.

UNI-LAT BRACHIAL  [**2164-9-10**] 7:09 AM Infected left-to-right
axillary-to-axillary artery bypass graft of PTFE status post
trauma.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo male s/p jump/fall aprox 70 feet brought to [**Hospital1 **] ed by
ems seen by trauma and orthopedics in ed  x rays showed open
bilateral tibal fxs and bilteral calcaneal fxs and rt calvicular
fx open rt humerous fx lft cuniform and 1st mtp fx left thumb
avulsion fx  multiple pelvic fxs  ptatient was seen by
orthopedics and taken to or emergently  and underwent bilateral
open reduction and exfix of tibial fxs on [**2164-6-15**]  on [**2164-6-28**] he
 went back to the or for bilateral exfix of his calcaneal fxs
post op he was on the trauma service  with orthopedics
consulting and following his orthopedic injuries  Pt was
intially evaluated with bilateral UE/LE angiography (read as
normal), Lax-ax w/ PTFE([**2164-6-15**])trach/PEG bedside [**6-27**].  An IVC
filter was placed by IR on [**6-16**] and removed on [**7-11**].  Pt went to
the floor [**7-6**] (HD #21). Chest tubes were d/c'd [**7-14**] after
prolonged airleak that finally sealed.  Pt was decannulated
[**7-16**].  Pt was diagnosed with several injuries while inpt as
listed in d/c diagnosis section of this report.  Pt was on
lovenox  for DVT prophylaxis in light of immobility as inpt.
[**Hospital 1094**] hospital course is further notable for noncompliance with
brace/splints. Pt's pain was treated with morphine sulfate,
oxycodone-acetaminophen as inpt and the pain service was
consulted.  Psych was also consulted to address pt's anxiety
while inpt.  Pt's Gtube was removed without complication while
inpatient.  On Hospital day 58 patient was noted to have a thick
discharge from a pin site on his external fix of the RLE,
cultures were taken, the patient was started on Vancomycin, and
eventually the the pin was replaced intraoperatively by
orthopedic surgery.  Of note during this hospital course pt also
complained of RUE pain.  An EMG was performed which was unable
to be completed secondary to patient's refusal to continue.
However, it appeared that the problem could be localized to the
elbow or brachial plexus.  A plain film of the elbow was
obtained which was unchanged per ortho from previous studies.
Pt was sent for a CTA of the right shoulder to assess for
obvious vascular or bony pathology as a possible etiology of the
pain, but this study revealed no abnormalities.
On [**2164-9-3**] a follow-up US study of the pt's ax-ax graft was
performed s
