Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

PRBC transfusions
FFP transfusions


History of Present Illness:
61 year-old man with history of cirrhosis [**3-4**] EtOH and possibly
NASH with known esophageal, gastric, and rectal varices,
mechanical AV valve on anticoagulation, presenting with four
days of dark stools, which are now black.  He notes that he has
become increasingly weak over past four days. He endorses
lightheadedness, fatigue, and general malaise.  Patient had been
in [**State 1727**] and given dark stool he stopped taking coumadin several
days ago.  Of note, the patient has had a URI over the past
several weeks.  He was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**5-26**].  Labs at that
visit were significant for a new renal failure with a creatinine
of 2.9.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.2 P 101 BP 92/56 R 18 O2 sat
100% on RA. Exam was notable for conjunctival pallor and black
stool on rectal exam. Labs were notable for HCT of 30.3 down
from 34 one week ago and 41 in [**2172-1-1**], BUN of 132,
Creatinine of 2.9, INR of 3.2.  Patient's SBPs went down into
70s, but improved to 90s - 100s prior to transfer. Patient
received 4L NS, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and was started on
protonix and octreotide gtt.  Patient was found to be
hyperkalemic and received insulin, calcium gluconate.  He did
not receive kayexelate given GI bleeding. Patient underwent NG
lavage, which was negative. Hepatology was consulted and
recommended treating with ceftriaxone - patient received start
of dose of ceftriaxone, but it was stopped as patient has
cephalosporin allergy.  Patient was ordered 2 units PRBC and 2
units of FFP, but this was not started prior to transfer from
ED.  Patient has 3 18 gauge peripheral IVs.  Transfer vitals are
P 56, BP 101/49, R 14, O2 sat 100% on RA.
.
On the floor, patient is comfortable.  He feels tired, but has
not had any further melena.  He refuses to have a foley catheter
placed because he has had difficulty with foley placement in the
past. He does not currently feel like he has to urinate. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath.

Imaging:
========
[**2172-6-8**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-8-23**],
the AVR gradient is slightly higher. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension is now detected (was not measured on the prior
study).
.
RUQ U/S: Normal abdominal ultrasound, specifically no thrombus
seen in the portal or splenic veins.
.
Hepatic venogram with pressures prior to attempted TIPS
procedure:
1. Right heart pressure 20 mmHg.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Portosystemic gradient at 5 mmHg.
IMPRESSION: Based on the elevated right heart pressure (20 mmHg)
and
relatively low portosystemic gradient (5 mmHg), and after
discussion between Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4154**], no TIPS was
performed.
.
CXR [**2172-6-11**]:
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours
are also stable. The patient is status post valve replacement
and multiple median sternotomy wires appear intact. Possible
small bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged. Dense
opacities seen in both lungs appear new since [**6-9**] though
unchanged from one day prior, possibly areas of aspirated
barium. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.
.
CXR [**2172-6-12**]:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Moderate cardiomegaly is
unchanged in
severity. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Note is
again made of
multiple median sternotomy wires as well as an aortic valve
prosthetic. There
is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral
pleur
