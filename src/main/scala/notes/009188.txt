Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 47 year old male smoker with asthma
(mild intermittent on albuterol prn and occasionally on flovent)
who, according to his wife typically has worsening asthma in the
spring due to allergies. She noticed he was using his inhaler
more frequently started 5 days ago. He remained stable until
last night when he had fever to 101.2, and worsening of his
shortness of breath (couldn't sleep). The patient was going to
see his PCP this morning but the cab never came so he
rescheduled for tomorrow. However, his wife noticed he was
working to breathe this evening so she brought him to the ED.
Last night and in the ED, the patient reported nausea and
vomited for the first time in the ED
.
Of note, the patient's wife and 10 year old daughter have had
mild [**Name (NI) **] symptoms over the past two weeks. The patient did
receive his flu shot this year. His last travel to [**Country 11150**] was in
[**2123**]. He requires yearly TB testing for his job and was last PPD
positive about 4 years ago and had 9 months of INH.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.6 121 SBP 166 22 97% RA.
Labs notable for WBC of 6.5 (14% bands), creatinine of 4.7,
lactate of 6.5. CXR showed LLL opacification obscuring left
hemidiaphragm concerning for infection. Patient initially given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs and levofloxacin. However, his
pressures started to decrease and he triggered for SBP 60. At
the same time, he was reportedly on a non-breather so he was
intubated and sedated with midaz, fentanyl and 10 of Vec.
Central line was placed and patient started on levophed and neo.
Tried on left to get aline but failed. Vanc/CTX were ordered. He
was given 4L of IVF. Bedside ultrasound with ? poorly squeezing
heart. On transfer, HR 129 BP 115/81 on neo at 1mcg/kg and
levophed at 0.3, RR 24 on A/C, 15/5, Volumes of 410, Rate of 15,
100% Fi02.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's initial SBP [**Location (un) 1131**] was
155 but on repeat it was 43. He appeared mottled and cool and he
became progressively hypoxic. Attempt was made to place a
femoral aline but was unsuccessful. Labs were drawn and VBG
showed 6.96/60/213/15. Patient was given 6L of fluids and put on
max doses of 3 pressors (levo, neo and vasopressin). He
continued to become more mottled and his abdomen became rigid.
He was very difficult to ventilate and had to come off of the
vent an be bagged. He was given several amps of bicarb as well
as calcium citrate for low ionized calcium of .076 and magnesium
for Mg of 0.7 Finally, anesthesia was able to place an arterial
line and ABG showed: 6.97/106/79/HCO3/26. His pressure on the
a-line were improved from the cuff readings and he was weaned
off of pressors.
.
He remained difficult to ventilate and this was felt likely
secondary to volume overload as well as developing ARDS. He was
given 80 IV lasix and he put out >1L of urine before the AM.
Renal was called in for possible dialysis for volume removal.
They spun his urine and saw muddy brown casts consistent with
ATN. He was eventually paralyzed and put back on the Vent and
was more synchronous. On Pressure Control Ventilation with
driving pressures of 50 and PEEP of 15 and rate of 30 and his
respiratory acidosis started to improve. He was able to wean
down to Pressure of 40, PEEP of 15 but Fi02 of 100%. After being
bolused with sedation prior to Vec, his SBP again dropped to the
high 70s so low dose levophed was started. Serial lactates
stayed stable around 4.7-4.9.
