admitted to an outside hospital on [**2119-1-17**] with a three-
day history of shortness of breath, fever and cough.  He also
had an elevated CK with ST depressions in V3 to V5 on
electrocardiogram.  He had new onset atrial fibrillation and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]  on
[**2119-1-19**] for treatment. He had a known diagnosis of three
vessel coronary artery disease by cardiac catheterization in
[**12/2115**] with intervention at that time.  He has been treated
with antibiotics since admission and had a rising creatinine
with Renal following him.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a history of coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular
disease, neuropathy, retinal hemorrhages, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia.  He is status post amputation of the second
right toe and bilateral knee arthroscopy.

He is allergic to Lipitor.  He gets myalgias.  To intravenous
contrast, he gets vomiting.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o.  once a day.
2. Heparin drip.
3. Insulin subcutaneously sliding scale.
4. Mucomyst.
5. Lopressor 75 mg p.o.  twice a day.
6. Lasix 40 mg p.o. once a day.
7. Ativan p.r.n.
8. Rocephin 1 gm intravenously once a day.
9. Nitroglycerin drip.
10.      Crestor 20 mg p.o.  once a day.
11.      Zithromax 500 mg p.o.  once a day.
12.      Pepcid 20 mg p.o.  once a day.
13.      Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife and works
part-time as a clerk, and is a retired police officer.  He
has never smoked cigarettes and drinks alcohol rarely.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for congestive heart failure,
bilateral edema, claudication.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed white male in
no apparent distress.  Vital signs stable, afebrile.  HEENT
examination:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles
are intact, oropharynx benign.  Neck was supple, full range
of motion, no  lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids 2
plus and  equal bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs had
bibasilar rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1, S2 with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen
was soft, obese, nontender, with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had bilateral pedal edema, 1 plus, with no
varicosities. Pulses were 2 plus bilaterally in the radials
and 1 plus bilaterally in the DP's and PT's.  Neurological
examination was nonfocal.

The patient was admitted and continued on antibiotics.  He
had a rise in creatinine  and Renal was following him.  He
also had a drop in hematocrit and Gastroenterology was
consulted and they recommended PPI and endoscopy as an
outpatient in four to six weeks.  He also had atrial
fibrillation which was treated with heparin and amiodarone
and he converted to sinus rhythm.  On [**2119-1-25**], he
underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed the LAD
had an 80 percent stenosis, left circumflex had an 80 percent
stenosis, OM1 had a subtotal stenosis, OM2 had proximal
disease, RCA had 100 percent occlusion and he had mitral
regurgiation with V waves to 40 mm.  He had an echocardiogram
which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent and 1 plus
mitral regurgitation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] was consulted.  He
recommended treating his pneumonia until it was improved and
he also got carotid duplexes which revealed a less than 40
percent stenosis on the right and a 40 to 59 percent stenosis
on the left ICA.  His creatinine  improved.  He also had an
Ophthalmology consultation and they felt he could tolerate
anticoagulation during the surgery.  Renal continued to
follow him.  On [**2119-1-31**], the patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times four with LIMA to the LAD, reverse
saphenous vein graft to PDA, OMI and OM2 sequential.  Cross
clamp time was 68 minutes.  Total bypass time was 94 minutes.
He was transferred to the CSICU on Nitroglycerin, insulin and
Propofol in stable condition.  He was extubated on
postoperative night. He was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day one.  He remained on some perioperative
antibiotics.  He had his chest tube discontinued on
postoperative day number two.  He continued to progress.  He
was also anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.  His
epicardial pacing wires were discontinued on postoperative
day number 4.  On postoperative day number nine, his INR was
2 and he was discharged to home in stable condition.

LABORATORY DATA:  His labs on discharge were white count
5,600, hematocrit 27, INR was 2, platelets 178,000, sodium
141, potassium 5, chloride 106, CO2 32, BUN 33, creatinine
1.9, blood sugar 99.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day for 14 days.
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o.  once a day.
4. Percocet one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.
5. Crestor 20 mg p.o. once a day.
6. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day for one week, than 400
   mg p.o.  once a day for a week, then 200 mg p.o. once a
   day.
7. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
8. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. once a day.
9. Insulin NPH 45 units every morning and 5 units every
   evening with a regular insulin sliding scale.
10.      Coumadin 2 mg p.o.  once a day for an INR goal of 2
   to 2.5.
11.      Potassium 20 mEq p.o.  once a day for 14 days.

He will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] in three to four weeks,
and by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.
