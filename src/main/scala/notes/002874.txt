History of Present Illness:
The patient is an elderly gentleman who has an entire
aortobiiliac bypass graft with occlusion of the right limb and
femoral-femoral crossover graft. He presented to [**Hospital3 13347**] with knee pain and they thought that he had a septic
knee. He represented with worsening foot pain and discoloration.
He was sent here urgently. When we evaluated him, he had a very
ischemic foot. He had limited sensation, but did have motor,
although it was not completely normal. He had some calf
tenderness.

Reason: eval [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with RLE thrombosis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval pre-op
EXAMINATION: AP chest.
INDICATION: Right leg thrombosis.
A single AP view of the chest was obtained [**2123-5-23**] at 18:13 and
is compared with the prior study performed [**2118-9-19**].
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The lungs show no
evidence of acute infiltrate, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is some minimal linear atelectasis in the left base.
IMPRESSION:
Minimal linear basal atelectasis. No other acute process
demonstrated.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
check ETT position
AP CHEST 1:27 A.M. ON [**5-24**]
HISTORY: Ischemia. Check ET tube placement.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-23**] at 6:13 a.m.:
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is new, accompanied by
increased dilatation of pulmonary arteries though heart size is
normal and unchanged. Pleural effusions may be collecting
posteriorly, but are not substantial in size. ET tube in
standard placement. No pneumothorax.

EXAMINATION: Right knee, 8:20 p.m., on [**5-24**].
HISTORY: Possible effusion.
IMPRESSION: Frontal and a lateral view of the right knee
suggests a small joint effusion in the suprapatellar recess. The
knee is other unremarkable. A vascular catheter lies posterior
to the lower femur and an arterial stent is posterior to the
upper aspect of the tibia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: assess pulm edema
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with RLE ischemia, MI s/p angio
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess pulm edema
INDICATION: Right lower extremity ischemia, myocardial
infarction.
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with multiple previous examinations,
the most recent being [**2123-5-24**]. Endotracheal tube is
unchanged in position. Pulmonary edema has resolved. Cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours are now within normal limits.
Bilateral small pleural effusions may be present. No
pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unchanged. A 5-mm round
opacity overlying the right lung field has not been seen on
previous studies and probably represents a confluence of
shadows.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions. Improvement in
pulmonary edema

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: r/o infiltrates
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with RLE ischemia, MI s/p angio
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infiltrates
HISTORY: 84-year-old man with right lower extremity ischemia,
myocardial infarction, status post angiogram.
COMPARISON: [**2123-5-25**].
CHEST, AP: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
There is mild pulmonary edema, not significantly changed from
prior exam. The small bilateral pleural effusions appeared to
have slightly increased in size accounting for differences in
technique. Endotracheal tube is in unchanged position.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. Slight increase in size of
small bilateral pleural effusions.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2123-5-26**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% to 60% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
16-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional dysfunction with
focal mild hypokinesis of the distal septum and mid-anterior
walls. The remaining segments contract normally and overall LVEF
is preserved. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD or focal myocarditis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
