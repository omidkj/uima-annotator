Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
new lung mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
71F with a history of hypertension, anxiety, abnormal LFTs,
macular degeneration, GERD,fibroid uterus, urinary incontinence,
hyperlipidemia, and pancreatitis who is admitted today following
a newly diagnosed RLL lung mass.  She was recently discharged
form the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2168-11-10**] after presenting with 1 day of
blood-streaked sputum, mild dyspnea and wheezing in the setting
of 6 months of a non-productive cough.  At that time, she denied
chest pain or syncope.  A CXR at that time showed a RML
pneumonia with a new ill-defined opacity noted overlying on of
the mid-thoracic vertebral bodies.  She was sent home with ten
days of levofloxacin 500mg po daily for the pneumonia.  In
follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she noted no further
hemoptysis and an improvement in her mild dyspnea and wheezing.
A repeat CXR on [**11-30**] showed a persistent infiltrate/atelectasis
in the RML; it also showed a mass-like enlarged right hilum and
a new 8-mm nodular density projecting over the left lung apex.
Her PCP started her empirically on 10 days of
amoxicillin/clavulanate at this time and scheduled a chest CT.
.
The CT on [**12-7**] showed bulky mediastinal adenopathy with
collapse of the right middle bronchus, occlusion of the right
superior pulmonary vein, encasement/constriction of the right
main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins,
displacement/deformation of the left atrium, and
narrowing/invasion of the superior vena cava.  It noted a 3.5 x
3cm mass in the right lower lobe, presumed to be the primary
tumor.  A 7mm apical nodule was deemed consistent with a
granuloma.  No pleural or pericardial effusions were seen.  Both
adrenals were noted to be enlarged.  The liver was noted to
likely be cirrhotic along with intraabdominal ascites.  Of note,
a CXR on [**2167-9-15**] was normal.
.
Her PCP sent her to the ED for expedited workup and management.
In the ED, her vitals were T 96.9, HR 90, BP 150/90, RR 16, Sat
99% on room air.  Her exam was notable for wheezes in the right
lung field.  She received 40 mEq of PO KCl due to a level of 2.3
and was put on telemetry.
.
ROS: Reports one week of excessive fatigue.  Reports normal
appetite and [**3-19**] lbs weight gain over past several weeks.
Reports mild increase in abdominal girth.  Denies changes in
urinary or bowel habits.  Denies any recent fevers, cough,
dyspnea, or wheezing over the psat 3 weeks.  Reports chronic,
worsening vision loss.  Denies headaches.  She denies any recent
chest pain, pedal edema, exertional or rest dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest ([**12-7**]): The hilar component of a 6 x 5cm, mass
involving the right hilus and middle mediastinum, obstructs the
right middle lobe bronchus, producing collapse of the RML,
significantly narrows the upper lobe bronchus and protrudes into
the bronchus intermedius, narrowing it as well. Proximally,
endobronchial tumor extends to 1 cm from the carina. The mass
occludes the right superior pulmonary vein and encases and
constricts the right main pulmonary artery and inferior
pulmonary veins. It displaces and deforms the left atrium,
obliterating adjacent fat planes; no pericardial effusion is
present. Mediastinal tumor in the right paratracheal station
from the right upper lobe bronchus to the level of the aortic
arch, up to 4.5cm in diameter, severely narrows and invades the
superior vena cava. Subcarinal adenopathy measures 3 x 4 cm. A
3.5 x 3 cm mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe
is most likely the primary lung cancer. A 7mm left apical nodule
is most likely a granuloma.  Mild emphysema is predominantly
apical. The pleural surfaces are smooth and there is no pleural
effusion.  Both adrenals are enlarged, the left 6.0 x 2.6 cm,
the right 4.7 x 2.0 cm. Ascites is present and the lobulated
liver margins, irregularity and heterogeneity of the liver
suggest cirrhosis. Hypodense renal lesions are likely cortical
cysts. There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
.
CT head ([**12-8**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
ECG ([**12-8**]): sinus rhythm at 101 bpm, normal axis, normal
intervals, ST depression in II, V2-V5, no Q waves, no ST
elevations


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt's chest CT was concerning for malignancy.  Pt was seen by
Interventional Pulm who placed a stent in her RML bronchus
~[**12-8**] and obtained a biopsy which revealed small cell
carcrinoma.  She was started on pip/taz and vanco for
post-obstructuve PNA.  She continued to have hypokalemia and
hyperglycemia causing concern for an ACTH secreting
paraneoplastic syndrome.  She was the transfered to the oncology
service on [**2168-12-10**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  She
received 3 doses of carboplatin and etoposide on [**11-9**],
and [**12-14**].
.
Pt was transfused 2 Units of PRBC's on [**12-13**] with an increase in
her HCT from 23 to 25 (HCT 40 on admission).  She was therefore
given an additional 2 Units [**12-14**].  On [**12-15**] at 6AM she was noted
to have diarrhea with blood.  HCT was again 23.  She was
transfused 1 Unit of PRBC's with an appropriate increase to 27.
She remained stable until the evening of [**12-15**] when she dropped
to 23.   She received 2 Units and bumped to 30.  Her HCT
decreased from 30 to 20 over the next 24 hrs.  She is now being
transfused 2 Units.  Of note on [**11-30**] she underwent an EGD
notable for mild gastritis and a C-scope notable for several
adenomatous polyps.  She had a RBC scan which was unremarkable
on [**12-15**].  NG lavage clear but was without bile.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:
# GIB:
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**12-17**] for repeat EGD in the
setting of GIB.  At the time she denied CP/SOB/N/hematemesis/abd
pain/fever/chills.  +appetite.  Repeat EGD was unremarkable for
source of acute bleeding.  As such, lower GI source was
suspected, given recent polypectomy on [**11-30**].  However, pt's
diarrhea contained only modest melena/red streaks.  As such, GI
deferred colonoscopy on [**12-18**].  Pt is also s/p recent negative
tagged rbc scan on [**12-14**].  Hemolysis labs were obtained on [**12-18**]
which was unremarkable.  Pt's WBC was <0.5 raising concern for
neutropenia, thus GI deferred colonoscopy again on [**12-19**].  Given
pt was otherwise hemodynamically stable, decision was made
