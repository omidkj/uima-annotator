At the time of admission the chief complaint was abdominal
pain.

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with 6 weeks of fatigue,
malaise and intermittent abdominal pain.

IMAGING:  She was evaluated at an outside hospital where she
underwent an ERCP with stone extraction, and subsequently
laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Postoperatively she was then noted to be distended and
hypotensive.  She required 1 unit transfusion.  Subsequent to
that she continued to be febrile, and also developed a left
hemiparesis and facial droop, at which time her family
requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

At the time of arrival here she was tachycardic but afebrile.
Initially she spiked 101.1, and was complaining of abdominal
pain.  Her medical history included hypertension, high
cholesterol, CVA, anemia, diabetes, PVD, and COPD.  Other
surgical history aside from lap chole which unclear, although
the patient has a midline incision, she did not recall for
what operation.  At baseline she was living at a rehab
facility, but had previously lived with her daughter.
Examination on admission was significant for a soft but
distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness to percussion with
guarding.  She had a white blood count of 8.6 but with left
shift.  The creatinine was 1.4, other electrolytes fairly
normal with lactate of 2.1.  She underwent an ultrasound of
the right upper quadrant which demonstrated an 8 mm common
bile duct, and also demonstrated complex collection in the
gallbladder fossa.  The subsequent CT scan showed the same
fluid collection with rim enhancement, containing either gas
levels or Surgicel, with a central calcified lesion, possibly
stone.  There was a slightly nodular contour of the liver.
She also underwent HIDA CT which demonstrated a prior infarct
in the paracentral region.  The patient therefore was first
evaluated with abdominal tenderness, a right lower lobe
pneumonia, some hepatic fluid collection, pulmonary edema,
apparent sepsis.

In the emergency department the family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss the DNR, DNI, and the DNI was rescinded.
She was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress,
transferred to the ICU.
Antibiotic were initiated.  Neurology was involved.  She
underwent further evaluation with MRI which revealed a
possible new embolic stroke.  She was therefore begun on
anticoagulation.  That collection was drained, antibiotic
coverage was maintained.  Neurology continued to be involved.
This was thought to be secondary either to atrial
fibrillation or to aortic atheroma.  Neurologic status failed
to improve and she was unable to be weaned from the
ventilator.  Neural status failed to improve.  The patient,
having been intubated by the family's agreement, emergently
stayed intubated but remains DNR.
