Head CT [**2175-3-3**]
There are increasingly apparent bilateral inferior frontal lobe
intraparenchymal contusion (3A:10, 3A:11), left greater than
right with
minimal leftsided edema, sulcal and left quadrigeminal cistern
effacement(3A:12). No appreciable shift of midline structures.
The previously noted left frontal and left parafalcine
extra-axial hemorrhage thought to be due to subdural hematoma is
less apparent on current study likely due to redistribution of
blood products from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Tiny left
frontal subdural hematoma remains. Extraaxial hemorrhage now
noted layering along the left frontoparietal lobes, left sylvian
fissure and bilateral peri-anterior falcine sulci.  There is
redemonstration of the known right nondisplaced occipital
fracture.  Overlying skull fracture there is an incompletely
visualized subgaleal hematoma.
IMPRESSION:
1. Contrecoup injury with bilateral inferior frontal lobe
intraparenchymal
contusions as well as bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage with
interval
redistribution of blood products to the bilateral parafalcine
region, left
sylvian fissure and left high frontoparietal lobe sulci.
2. Right occipital fracture with incompletely visualized right
parietooccipital subgaleal hematoma.

CXR [**2175-3-3**]
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is
subtle opacity in the right suprahilar region/medial right upper
lung. Anunderlying consolidation may be present. The remainder
of the lungs is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
see
