revealed the entire vagina was everting, could not be
reduced).

Chest x-ray [**11-14**] at [**Hospital1 **] consistent with mild congestive
heart failure.  Electrocardiogram [**11-14**] at [**Hospital1 **] revealed
normal sinus rhythm with lateral T wave inversions, which
were unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is an 81 year-old G2 P2 with
significant cardiac history (ejection fraction 15 to 20%)
admitted preoperatively with stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse
and resolving urinary tract infection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted preoperatively as
a transfer from [**Hospital1 **].  She was given a clear diet and
gentle bowel prep.  All cardiac medications were continued.
On [**2166-11-19**] the patient underwent total vaginal hysterectomy,
anterior and posterior colporrhaphy, sacrospinous colpopexy,
and SPARC with cystoscopy for stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse
(procidentia) and urinary incontinence.  Please see operative
note for complete details.  During the surgery the patient
had transesophageal monitoring as well as Swan-Ganz catheter.
The patient was extubated in the Operating Room.  Immediately
postoperatively the patient was somewhat nauseated and was
unable to take her po cardiac medications.  She was
hypertensive to systolic blood pressure of 200 and was thus
started on a nitroglycerin 0.5 microgram drip with good
effect.  Given the patient's cardiac history the patient was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight monitoring.
The patient had no events.  Her electrocardiogram was
unchanged.  A set of cardiac enzymes were negative.  Her
postoperative hematocrit was 26.9 as she received one unit of
packed red blood cells with a post transfusion hematocrit of
33.  The patient was transferred to the regular floor on
postoperative day one.  She recovered routinely.  She was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously, tolerating a regular diet
and had good pain control.  She was discharged home on
postoperative day number three.  She will continue on all
cardiac medications as well as restart her baby aspirin.
