Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-10-24**] - Ventricular tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
80M with significant cardiac history that includes CAD s/p CABG
x2, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), s/p ICD for inducible
VT who presented with chest pain. He reports substernal chest
pain radiating to the left arm associated with nauseas and
dyspnea began last night at rest around 3AM. He took three SLNG
with improvement but not resolution of symptoms.  He also
reports that ICD fired 2 days ago. He had not been feeling well
prior to this but after the shock he felt better.
.
In the ED, the initial vitals were: 96.6 72 149/75 20 96%RA.
Labs notable for CK:53 MB:4  T-trop: 0.06 with creatinine of
2.3.  EKG with HR 71, V-paced, left axis, no obvious ST segment
changes. Patient was given aspirin 325mg and sublingual
nitroglycerin with resolution of pain initially.  Plan was to
admit patient to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] under his PCP/cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Then patient developed chest pain again with telemetry showing
wide complex tachycardia with rate in the 130s.  Procainamide
was ordered but not given.  EP was called and had difficulty
interrogating ICD.  Patient's BP noted to be slightly lower in
the high 90s/low 100s, but otherwise he remained stable.
Carotid sinus massage was attempted w/o success.  He was also
attempted to be paced at higher rates, but this would only break
VT for 2-3 beats.  So given concern for ventricular tachycardia
patient is being taken to the EP lab for investigation. Of note
blood sugars also in the 600s so given 10 units insulin in ED.
.
In the cath lab, he was noted to have 3 foci for inducible VT,
but the culprit focus for causing his current VT was ablated.
However, the other foci were not intervened on.  He was in
normal sinus prior to transfer.  In ICU, he was noted to be in
no acute distress, in good spirit, chest pain free.  Not
reporting any dizziness or lightheadedness.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y.o. man w/ PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG x2, ischemic
cardiomyopathy s/p ICD (EF 20-25%), s/p ICD for inducible VT who
presented w/ CP that initially resolved w/ SL NTG, had episode
of CP while in the ED went into a wide-complex tachycardia and
now presents to the CCU after EP ablation of VT focus

#Ventricular tachycardia - Pt came to the ED reporting chest
pain and was found to have an episode of VT while in the
emergency room.  He has an ICD which did not fire because the
rate was below the ICD threshold.  EP was consulted and they
were unable to suppress his VT by adjusting pacer settings.  He
was taken to the EP lab where her underwent ablation of a focus
of inducible VT which was thought to be the culprit.  Three
others were also found but not ablated.  He was subsequently
admitted to the CCU for monitoring.  In the CCU, he remained
hemodynamically stable and did not have any recurrent episodes
of VT on telemetry.  He will not continue his home maiodarone
after discharge.

#Diabetes - Pt had history of "diet controlled" diabetes.  He
was not on any oral hypoglycemics or insulin at admission.  His
blood sugars were severely elevated to the 400-500 range at
presentation.  He was given insulin via sliding scale during
this admission.  An A1c was checked whcih was 13%.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
contact[**Name (NI) **] but not formally consulted.  [**Name8 (MD) 6**] NP from [**Last Name (un) **]
provided teaching on checking his blood sugar at home.  We did
not start long acting insulin and did not discharge him on
insulin as he was being discharged and his insulin dose was not
able to be titrated.  At discharge, he has been started on
glipizide 5mg daily and he has been arranged follow-up with
[**Last Name (un) **] soon after discharge (we chose to avoid metformin as a
first [**Doctor Last Name 360**] because of elevated creatinine).

#UTI - UA was very suggestive of UTI with WBC >182.  UCx showed
coag-negative staph.  We wanted to avoid medications that may
prolong his QTc, and he was given ceftriaxone which he will
continue as cefpodoxime for a total 5 day course.

#CAD - Pt
