Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma with
recent PE diagnosis who presents with shortness of breath and
decreased abdominal Pleurx drainage.
.
She was recently admitted [**2175-9-11**] to [**2175-9-14**] with atrial flutter
and shortness of breath.  She was treated for atrial flutter
with a diltiazem drip and then oral diltiazem.  She also was
initially heparinized for her PE but per the discharge summary,
frequent blood draws or injections would not be consistent with
her goals of care and anticoagulation was discontinued.  She
also had a Pleurx abdominal catheter placed for palliation due
to recurrent ascites.
.
She reports having intermittent abdominal pain around the site
of the Pleurx since discharge.  She then had progressive
shortness of breath over the last 2-3 days which worsened this
AM and prompted her to present to the ED.  She also reports that
her VNA went to drain her Pleurx today which didn't drain as
much as usual and this worried her.  She does report pleuritic
left sided chest pain with deep inspiration but no baseline
chest pain.  She has felt weak for the last several weeks.  20
lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 116**].  Denies current abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, or change in BM.  Does report frequent
burping.  Also has new bedsore.  She can walk only with
assitance.  Her Pleurx is drained every other day, about 1.5-2L
at a time.  Endorses low appetite.
.
In the ED, she was found to be in Afib with RVR with HR 150's.
She also complained of abdominal pain. CTA chest and abdomen
were performed which confirmed PE but also showed gas in the
peritoneum.  Surgery was consulted for the gas pattern.  She was
given vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.  She was given
10mg IV dilt x 2 for RVR.  She was started on a heparin drip.
She was guaiac negative.  Last vitals 97.8 113 90/48 20 99%RA.
She was confirmed DNR/DNI.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she reports feeling fatigued and mildly
SOB.  Denies other symptoms.
.
Review of systems:

IMAGING:

CXR:  Interval development of moderate-to-large left pleural
effusion
and persistent small right pleural effusion with bibasilar
airspace opacities, likely atelectasis though infection is not
excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

CT chest/abd/pelvis:
1. Interval development of hyperenhancement and thickening of
the peritoneum with large volume loculated ascites raises
concern for peritonitis. Presence of gas within peritoneum could
be due to indwelling catheter though gas forming organism cannot
be excluded. This finding was discussed with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 12132**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12133**]
at 19:24 on [**2175-9-28**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11623**] over the phone.
2. Small bowel wall thickening likely reactive given the concern
for infected peritoneal fluid. No bowel obstruction.
3. Unchanged bilateral pulmonary emboli.
4. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower
lobe consolidation, likely reflects atelectasis and aspiration.
5. Extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma who
presents with worsening shortness of breath, atrial fibrillation
with RVR, and pneumoperitoneum.
.
#. Shortness of Breath/Pulmonary Embolus: shortness of breath
and pleuritic chest pain likely related to known PE, confirmed
on CTA.  She was mildly hypoxic (92% on RA) but in no
respiratory distress.  After discussion with the patient and her
family, they opted to start anticoagulation (they had reportedly
declined last admission).  Lovenox was started and provided to
patient upon discharge.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: HR to 150s in the ED, given
10mg IV dilt x 2 and 30mg po dilt with some response (HR
decreased to 120s).  In the MICU she was continued on home
diltiazem 90mg po qid with PRN IV dilt for rate control as well
as fluids.  Anticoagulation as above.
.
#. Pneumoperitoneum/non-draining pleurex: Found to have locules
of gas within ascites on abdominal CT scan, which was initially
felt to be due to catheter placement rather than perforation
given her benign abdominal exam.  A small amount of ascitic
fluid was sampled and showed 825 WBCs (65% polys), cultures were
sent, and she was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for
presumed bacterial peritonitis. Culture grew bacteroides
fragilis. IR re-examined the CT abdomen, and felt that the
pleurex catheter looked like it had been placed through her
colon. Therefore they say that they cannot pull the catheter for
it will leave two open holes in her colon in communication with
her peritoneum.  Therefore, they said, that a func
