Allergies:
Iodine-Iodine Containing

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and jaw pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-4-17**]
Coronary artery bypass grafting times 5 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
and reverse saphenous vein graft to diagonal artery and
sequential saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal
artery, second obtuse marginal artery and the left posterior
descending artery


History of Present Illness:
71 year old male who in mid [**Month (only) 956**]
of this year presented to [**Hospital6 6640**] in [**Location (un) 8545**]
with rapidly progressive shortness of breath and some jaw
discomfort. He had congestive heart failure diagnosed and had a
brief trial of noninvasive ventilation, which improved his
breathing somewhat. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred
to [**Hospital6 **] for further workup. There he was
diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction by
troponins. He underwent further diuresis and then had a cardiac
catheterization by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] showing multivessel coronary
artery disease with anatomy as outlined below. He was evaluated
by CT surgery and was deemed not a good candidate for bypass
grafting (not get a clear sense of why). The patient seems to
think this was because of lack of suitable veins in the legs
(?or
poor touchdown targets). Regardless, his medical therapy was
optimized and he was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy
including low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. He was diuresed and
his discharge weight was 126.5 kilograms (280 lbs). He has
recently been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] who referred him to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for
possible coronary artery bypass surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-4-17**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The left coronary cusp is
immobile. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is A paced. The patient on a
phenylephrine infusion. Biventricular function is unchanged.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation.

Right internal jugular line inserted via exchange terminates at
the origin of the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax or associated
mediastinal widening.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lung is clear.  Band of
atelectasis in the left mid lung has coalesced.  Left lung is

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2200-4-17**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 5 (left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery
and reverse saphenous vein graft to diagonal artery and
sequential saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal
artery, second obtuse marginal artery and the left posterior
descending artery)with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. CROSS-CLAMP TIME:97 minutes.PUMP
TIME: 111 minutes.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  He arrived to
the unit fully vented, AV paced over Junctional Rhythm 40's but
stable, required neo for post-op hypotension. Neo was weaned off
successfully. Extubated the morning of POD#1 without difficulty.
He has a history of sleep apnea and required CPAP at night. His
rhythm returned to SR  with marginal bloodpressure. PW remained
in and betablockade was delayed. POD # 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact but was frequently noted to be
dropping things due to hand edema and weak hand grasps. He has
at baseline an elevated creatinine and it peaked at 2.7. He was
started on lasix and was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On POD#4 he transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #6 the patient was
stable, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 27060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 731**]  in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
