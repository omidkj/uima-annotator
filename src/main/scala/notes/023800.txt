History of Present Illness:
42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM, distant IBD > 20 yrs ago

last flare, recent cryptospordial infection presented to OSH
with worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.  She was
recently discharged on [**2189-2-11**] after admission with severe
pancolitis and small ileocolic intussiception wihtout evidence
of obstruction. The surgical service was consulted but saw no
acute indication for surgery and followed the patient with
serial abdominal exams.  Initially she was placed on vancomycin,
cefepime and flagyl which was then changed to flagyl only to
complete a two week course.  She was also found to have strep
pneumo in her BCx on [**2189-2-2**], unclear source.  She was asked to
be on IV ceftriaxone for a 14 day course per ID recommendation.
Her peritoneal tap showed 1500 wbc, 850 rbc, 27% poly and 70%
macro.  Gram stain and culture were negative.  Acid fast smear
was negative but culture is pending.  Her stool studies have
been negative.

Patient went to OSH with abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
Patient received Vancomycin there per verbal signout.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were T 101.8 (R), HR 113  BP 85/52  RR 38
 97% RA.  Her SBP improved to ? 150s with IVF.  She received 6.5
L of NS in total in ED.  Patient was agitated and not oriented.
She was intubated so that further workup could be done.  She
received fentanyl, etomidate, succinyl choline, and versed in
ED.  She also received 2 gram of cetriaxone, 2 gram of
ampicillin and 4.5 gram of zosyn.  patient also received
acetaminophen and lactulose in ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 y/o lady with CVID, HepC, Type 1 DM who presented with
abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.

# Sepsis:  Upon arrival to the MICU, she was hypotensive and
required three pressors.  In the setting of severe sepsis, she
was given Xigris.  It was discontinued after 24 hours due to a
prolonged PTT > 150.  ID was consulted. She was given IgG in the
setting of her known CVID.  She was initally treated with
Vancomycin and Meropenem as broad-spectrum coverage.  Vancomycin
was changed to Linezolid given history of VRE, but then
discontinued a few days later after cultures negative.  She
received IgG given her underlying CVID.  Patient gradually
improved and pressors were weaned to Levophed and Vasopressin.
She was treated with a 7-day course of Meropenem for a ? of RLL
pneumonia.  She was treated for c. diff with PO and PR
vancomycin as well as IV flagyl.  All micro data at our
institution remained NGTD, but positive c. diff toxin was
reported by OSH.  pressors were weaned off. Repeated imaging of
the abdomen revealed stable bowel wall thickening, no
pneumotosis. Tube feeds were attempted on multiple occasions but
failed due to high residuals.

# Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in the setting of
sepsis and subsequently developed ARDS.  She initially required
paralysis to maintain ventilator synchrony, as well as frequent
recruitment maneuvers.  An esophageal balloon was placed due to
high PEEP requirement.  A tracheostomy was performed at bedside
on intubation day #4.  Patient was eventually transitioned to
pressure support with gradual reduction of fentanyl and versed.


# Acute renal failure:  Patient developed a metabolic acidosis
with worsening renal function, rising creatinine, and oliguria
on ~[**2-18**].  Etiology of ARF was felt to be ATN in the
setting of sepsis and hypotension.  Renal was consulted for
urgent initiation of CVVH.  Acidemia was corrected with CVVH,
and urine output eventually resumed.  CVVH was continued, with
vasopressin, to remove ~ 20 liters of fluid which patient
retained following her resuscitation.  HD catheter was
successfully removed on [**2-26**] with stable urine output and
creatinine back to patient's baseline ~0.8. Pt resumed CVVH on
[**3-21**] for rising BUN and concern for uremia.

# Thrombocytopenia:   Platelets nadired to ~ 20K. Hematology was
consulted. Low fibrinogen, elevated INR, and thrombocytopenia
were suggestive of DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. underlying
liver disease.  Fibrinogen 173 at time of admission; thus
fibrinogen nadir at ~100 represented a drop from baseline.  HIT
antibody negative.  Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is also a
consideration with possible offending agents including
Linezolid, PPI, Caspofungin.   TTP-HUS less likely given lack of
 microangiopathic findings on the peripheral blood smear.
Patient was transfused 2 units platelets in preparation for a
procedure and subsequently platelet count remained > 100K and
upward trending.
.
# Anemia:  Patient received multple blood transfusions
periodically to maintain hematocrit > 25.  Hemolysis labs
reflected a low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, though no
schistocytes are apparent on peripheral blood smear, making TTP
unlikely.   Blood loss was associated with mucosal oozing as
above, given probable DIC.  Direct coombs antibody negative.

# Type I diabetes:  Patient initially presented with DKA in the
setting of sepsis.  She was treated with an insulin gtt.  The
insuli
