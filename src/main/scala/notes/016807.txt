History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year-old Female with a PMH significant for IgM
MGUS, iron deficiency anemia, celiac disease, primary biliary
cirrhosis, HTN, diastolic dsyfunction, OSA, depression and
chronic venous insufficiency who recently presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED ([**2173-12-25**]) with concern for right lower extremity cellulitis
and re-presented with right knee pain and hypotension.
.
She initially presented to the ED on [**2173-12-25**] with right foot pain
and swelling with erythema without fevers or chills. She was
prescribed Augmentin and Bactrim and discharged with close
follow-up. She had been having mild shortness of breath with
exertion and some URI symptoms with sore throat over several
weeks, and was taking Cipro PO for this. On the evening of [**12-26**],
she experienced a mechanical fall in the shower and from then on
had right lateral knee pain. She has known osteoarthritis and
the pain seemed similar. She returned to the ED on [**2173-12-27**] with
'knee buckling' and associated bilateral extremity pain. She
also had some chest pain and resting dyspnea transiently. She
had no joint pain or swelling; no erythema. In the ED, she had a
temperature of 101.9F and was given 1 gram of IV Vancomycin. She
was also transiently hypotensive to the 70-80s and received 1.5L
NS x 1 with improvement to the 90s. She was transferred to the
MICU - mentating well, with adequate urine output and without
lightheadedness or dizziness.
.
Upon admission to the MICU, she required Levaphed gtt to
maintain her systolic pressures and was having frequent ectopy
on telemetry. She was volume resuscitated with adequate UOP. Her
leukocytosis of 14.4 improved to normal with empiric IV
Vancomycin and Zosyn. Of note, her ESR and CRP were elevated.
Serial CXRs showed mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and
cardiomegaly. Bilateral knee radiographs showed no evidence of
infection or joint effusion; and an attempt at right knee
arthrocentesis resulted in a 'dry tap'. Her leg erythema did
improve with empiric antibiotics. A 2D-Echo showed mild
symmetric LV hypertrophy, preserved LVEF function of 55%, with a
severe resting LV outflow tract obstruction. Overall, she
improved with volume resuscitation in the setting of her LVOT
obstruction noted on 2D-Echo; and she was weaned from pressor
support. She did have some left conjunctival irritation,
periobital swelling and photophobia develop on admission with a
pruritic left eye. She denies visual acuity changes.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is breathing comfortably.
She has no headache and vision changes. No chest pain or trouble
breathing. Her left eye is pruritic and she has some
photophobia.

IMAGING:
[**2173-12-27**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Mild interstitial edema. Recommend
post-diuresis films to exclude underlying subtle pneumonia.
.
[**2173-12-27**] TTE - The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP > 18mmHg). There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are
