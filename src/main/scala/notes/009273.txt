History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104673**] is a 51 year old female with presumed rheumatic
heart disease who has undergone multiple mechanical mitral valve

replacments in the past x 3. In [**2182-4-13**], she was
hospitalized with Pasteurella bacteremia/sepsis which was
further

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2183-7-30**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal
motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR well
seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No MR.
[Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-14**]+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. No echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.


Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The
mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal disc motion
and
transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a small (~ 1cm) circumferential partially echofilled
pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study of [**2183-7-30**], the pericardial
effusion is new and
the mitral valve has been replaced with a normal functioning
bileaflet mitral
valve.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2183**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical decisions
regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2183-8-7**] 2:59 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old woman with redo MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after mitral valve
replacement.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to serial chest
radiographs from [**7-31**] to [**8-5**].

The patient is after median sternotomy, mitral valve replacement
redo and presence of a previously obtained triscuspid
valvulopathy. The heart size appears to be gradually increasing
since [**7-31**] with predominantly increase of the right heart
although the left border of the heart is also more pronounced.
The lungs are otherwise clear except for chronic bibasilar
opacities. The pleural calcifications are again noted involving
both sides being more pronounced on the left.

The marked distention of the azygos vein which was not present
before, also favors right heart failure. The other explanation
might be the temponade etiology if there is a presence of large
pericardial effusion. The right pacemaker is again demonstrated
with its two leads terminating in right atrium and right
ventricle.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14777**]. Recommendation
