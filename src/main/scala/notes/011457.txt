Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56yo M h/o MS (wheelchair bound), DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
h/o SDH who was found down at home in the bathroom on [**7-4**] and
admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**]. He was between the tub and sink
with
his head resting on the radiator and knees raised, "unresponsive
to all stimulation" but "eyes open and moving" per his ED note,
not able to verbally respond. He was being moved to a stretcher
and had "a grand mal [**Hospital3 862**]" and taken via EMS to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

There, he received narcan with no effect, as well as ativan and
etomidate and intubated for airway protection with concern for
status "asthmaticus" with all limbs "flailing" and
"unresponsive". CT showed "s/p L craniotomy w/o bleed or change
from prior scan [**2139-2-1**]" CT C-spine showed "cervical spondylosis
and cervical disc disease C4-C7". CXR negative for acute
infiltrates.

He was given dilantin 1200mg x 1, 2 doses of ativan, and then
propofol, and was admitted to the ICU.

Seen by neurology, there, who had followed the patient for
"break
through [**Month/Day/Year 862**]" and EEG had "suggested L TLE". Keppra was
started but discontinued due to "cognitive SE" and he was
maintained on "carbitrol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]". The consultant noted on
speaking to his RN that when propofol had been attempted to be
discontinued, he would have twitching of his "thigh and hand
(esp
R)" and pick at his clothes. It was unclear to the consultant
whether this represented [**Hospital1 862**] activity so the patient is
transferred here for taper off of propofol under continuous EEG
monitoring. He was given dilantin 1200mg IV on transfer.

IMPRESSION:
1. No cause for fever identified within the chest, abdomen, or
pelvis.
2. Extensive old traumatic injuries involving the ribs, pelvis
and vertebral column. Mild widening of the L3 vertebral body
anterior margin with soft tissue prominence is also likely
post-traumatic. However, an underlying destructive bone lesion
cannot be completely excluded. This is likely unrelated to the
patient's cause of fever and can be evaluated with a nonemergent
MRI.
3. Marked degenerative changes with near complete loss of joint
space involving the femoral heads bilaterally, likely related to
patient's history of avascular necrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26713**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of
long-standing MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] disorder transferred for the
question of continued [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] activity. His hosptial course by
problem is as follows:

1. NEURO: [**Last Name (Titles) **]. After admission to the ICU, he was quickly
weaned from propofol and was extubated. He had occasional
rhythmic beats of his ankle but remained alert.  On the 4th day
of admission the patient had an episode of confusion/agitation
that resulted in a code purple (psychiatric code) in the middle
of which he had a brief [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] episode characterized by head
turning to the right and right shoulder clonus.  Routine EEG
demonstrated initially demonstrated muscle artefact but a
subsequent study (on the 14th) revealed intermittent bifrontal
or generalized 4-7hz slowing. LP was performed by IR was notable
for slightly elevated protein at 52, normal glucose, no WBC, 1
RBC, negative HHV6 PCR, and negative HSV 1 and 2 PCR.  Gram
stain and culture were obtained.  CT from the OSH showed no mass
lesion or hemorrhage, which was confirmed here.  His carbatrol
was increased to 800mg q12.  He was initially started on
Dilantin, but this was stopped for fear that it was causing a
drug fever.  He was subsequently started on Keppra 1000 [**Hospital1 **].


2. ID. He had fevers as high as 102.4 over several days. He was
cultured numerous times and numerous imaging studies were
obtained including chest x-rays and a CT-torso.  No infectious
source found initially and thus the dilantin was implicated and
stopped.  Subsequently enterococcus grew from a [**7-9**] urine
culture, but was felt to be a contaminant as the UA wa negative
and the number of colonies was low (4000).  Also, his leg
wounds, likely sustained at the time of the fall were observed
to be infected.  A wound care consult was obtained and they
suggested consulting the plastics service for debridement.  They
performed some debridement and ultimately recomended against
antibiotics after suggesting them.  Again the CSF did not
demonstrate an infection.

3. RESP: Asthma. Continued on prn nebs and his steroid taper was
continued for asthma exacerbation.  The patient was also noted
to desat at night with sleep apnea.  Pulmonary was consulted and
will arrange for an outpatient sleep study.  Until that time the
patient should be maintained on nocturnal oxygen.  He shouldn't
need this during the day.

4.Psych: Confusion. On the second night of admission, he became
acutely confused, requiring restraints and seroquel to keep from
jumping out of bed. He had another episode of confusion on the
8th day of admission, threatening to through his urinal/jug at
the nursing staff.  No etiology could be identified despite the
toxic metabolic work
