CXR: FINDINGS: Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest
was obtained. The patient is rotated to the right. Chronic right
pleural thickening and evidence of old right rib fractures
without significant interval change.  There is elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm with overlying right basilar atelectasis.
Mild left base atelectasis is also seen. No definite focal
consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Retrocardiac rounded density may relate to patient's known
hiatal hernia. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable, given differences in the lung volumes, with tortuous,
unfolded aorta and mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.

CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Stable ventricular enlargement and prominence of the
extra-axial spaces.


Brief Hospital Course:
60M with organic brain syndrome, seizure disorder, cognitive
dysfunction and h/o DVT on coumadin admitted to ICU with
hypotension, UTI and renal failure.
.
1. Hypotension: Patient was transiently hypotensive in ED which
responded to IVF. Likely multifactorial secondary to infection
as well as hypovolemia given decreased PO intake recently. Pt
was treated with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for UTI and
cellulitis, respectively.  On [**2182-1-20**] pt was changed to
augmentin for UTI and cellulitis. On [**2182-1-22**] pt was changed to
cipro and macrobid given Proteus and staph urine culture
sensitivities. Pt will continue cipro and macrobid for five
additional days (10 day course total). Pt was noted to have
leukopenia likely d/t antibiotics, so WBC should be checked on
[**2182-1-24**]. Cipro may also raise the INR in [**1-24**] days, so please
check INR on [**2182-1-24**] as well.
.
2. [**Last Name (un) **]/Hematuria: Patient presenting with urinary retention and
[**Last Name (un) **] (Cr 0.7 on [**2182-1-8**]) likely secondary to foley dysfunction
since balloon was inflated in prostate causing obstruction. He
had improvement in UOP with repositioning of foley and kidney
injury resolved. Pt had been seen in urology clinic on [**1-16**] and
the pt's urologist was notified of the admission. He will follow
up as an outpatient with urology.
.
3. Cellulitis: Pt has chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally
and there was concern for possible superimposed cellulitis given
asymmetric erythema. Wound care was consulted and pt completed a
7 day course of ant
