Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31264**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
Reason for MICU transfer: Acute respiratory distress with
persistent tachypnea requiring observation in ICU setting

History of Present Illness:  Please see Medicine floor note for
full details.  In brief, this is an 83 year old male with
history of CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, CKD, rheumatoid arthritis, and
a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, presenting with
DOE.  He was previously treated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for
presumptive fungal PNA ([**Female First Name (un) **] on BAL) s/p course of mica +
HCAP coverage completed at rehab via PICC line. On [**9-12**], he
returned to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for recurrent dyspnea and (02 sat
was 86% on RA at rehab). He is not O2 dependent at baseline.  He
was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and micafungin,
in addition to lasix 80 IV and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

This evening, he became more dyspneic but was initially satting
100% on RA.  He had been getting potassium repletion through a
peripheral IV, so this required 500cc's of D5.  Elevated blood
pressures were never recorded.  Over the course of the evening,
he had progressive dyspnea while sitting in bed, eventually
requiring 35% FM O2.  CXR showed evidence of pulmonary
congestion and he was given 40mg PO + another 40mg IV
furosemide.  Chest CT from earlier in the day showed bibasilar
pleural effusions.  Prior to transfer to the ICU, a trial on RA
yielded a saturation of 96%.  He has been on vanc/cefepime since
admission.

Of note, he has also been bradycardic to low 50s, on AV-nodal
blockade with atenolol and diltiazem at home, with the atenolol
on hold prior to transfer.  He is also on digoxin for CHF, which
was held prior to transfer due to worsening renal failure.

Cardiology was consulted due to a troponin leak, which they
attribute to demand ischemia.  The pulmonary was also consulted
to weigh in on his interstitial lung disease and recurrent
desaturations/infections.

On arrival to the MICU, he is hemodynamically stable, mostly
concerned that he stooled himself in the bed earlier in the day.
