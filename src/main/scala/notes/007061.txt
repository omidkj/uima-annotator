CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral lower extremities weakness.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old
Caucasian male with a history of acquired factor 8
deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
walking times two days prior to admission.  The patient has
had periodic episodes in the past six months up to three to
four times, which typically lasts one to two days and then
resolved by itself.  However, at this time, the patient
complaints were not resolving and thus, he presented to the
emergency department.  Sensation and proprioception by report
were intact and there had been no incontinence.  The patient
after which he had an episode of emesis/hematemesis.  At that
time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] was thought to
have had hematemesis secondary to small [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
and he was not further evaluated.  At [**Hospital1 190**] he was noted to have cough and fever.  He
[**Hospital1 1834**] chest CT per pulmonary recommendations, which
showed diffuse emphysema, lunate configuration of the
trachea, consistent with tracheomalacia, narrowing of the
distal right upper lobe bronchus and some thickening of the
wall, which may represent neoplasm.  There were also
peripheral multifocal opacities especially in the right upper
lobe.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Known lastname 1834**] bronchoscopy, which showed right upper
lobe foreign body, which was notable for evidence of
aspiration pneumonia.  Thus, he was started on Levaquin and
Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia, as well as
treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

He was also seen by the Department of Neurology during his
admission, who thought that the main differential diagnosis
included AVM versus spinal ischemia as the mechanical cause
for his lower extremity weakness and also sensory deficit,
especially significant for pain and temperature changes.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Known lastname 1834**] MRI on [**2-24**], which showed increased T2
signal in the distal thoracic areas down to his conus
consistent with ischemia/demyelination.  Repeat MR was done
on [**3-6**], which showed diffuse atheromatous disease in the
infrarenal abdominal aorta, compression fracture of the left
vertebral body and focal stenosis in the origin of the
internal mammary artery.

The patient was then transferred from the Medicine Service to
the Neurology Service.  In the intervening days, the patient
was prepared for CT guided spinal angiogram on [**2147-3-9**].
The procedure required intubation secondary to the likelihood
of the procedure.  However, the procedure was unsuccessful
secondary to diffuse atherosclerosis in the spinal arteries.
Post procedure, the patient was extubated with respiratory
distress and re-intubated.  The ABG was noted to be peak of
7.20, pCO2 63, pO2 94.  At that time, he was reintubated and
transferred to the MICU for vent management.  He was also
treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with
Albuterol and Atrovent nebs and Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV q.8h.
He was quickly weaned off the vent and extubated early on
[**2147-3-10**].  At that time, the patient was then transferred to
the [**Location (un) 2655**] Service for further management.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on transfer were as follows:  White
count of 9.9, hematocrit 26.6, platelet count 376,000, PT
14.3, PTT 32.9, INR 1.4, factor 8 level 105.  Chem 7 showed
the following:  sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 109,
bicarbonate 23, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar 108,
calcium 7.0, phosphate 1.7, magnesium 1.4, most recent ABG on
the morning of [**2147-3-10**] showing a pH of 7.36, pCO2 42, and
pO2 100.

Chest x-ray on [**2147-3-9**] showed ill-defined opacity in the
right middle lobe and the right lower lobes, which were
unchanged since the previous examination.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary
function tests on [**2147-3-6**] showing FEV1 of 0.59, which is
22% and FEV1/FVC of 63% predicted.
2.  Factor 8 inhibitor.
3.  Status post right nephrectomy for hematuria, which was
complicated by retroperitoneal
bleed/hypertension/MAT/ARF/acute renal failure/ARDS/Serratia
gram-negative pneumonia.
4.  Tracheomalacia status post prolonged intubation after
nephrectomy.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Macular degeneration.
8.  Syncope.
9.  Polyps.
10. Distal humeral resection for lipoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  RESPIRATORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] has a history of
tracheomalacia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
recent aspiration pneumonia, which has overall contributed to
his shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.  He had no
oxygen requirement at home.  He likely failed extubation
secondary to sedation rather than chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation or pneumonia worsening.

During the intervening days, Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] finished a two-week
course of Levaquin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  Repeat bronchoscopy was offered secondary to
final rule out of possible neoplasm especially in the right
upper lobe with wall thickening.  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19125**] on
bronchoscopy at this time.  His oxygen requirement has been
weaned down from four liters to two liters with good results.
He is not required further Lasix.  He was discharged from the
MICU.

Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] continues on Albuterol and Atrovent MDI for his
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He has also continued
on Serevent and Flovent as well.  His steroids have been
tapered with a quick taper and he will be discharged on those
steroids.

Pulmonary consultation has been following him throughout his
stay and recommend no further intervention at this time.

NEUROLOGICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2690
