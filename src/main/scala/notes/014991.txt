Latex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1828**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o female with h/o hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic
anemia requiring IV iron and blood transfusions, h/o GIB with
known diverticuli and duodenal AVM, discharged from the hospital
3d ago for GIB, who presented to ED with generalized weakness,
new R leg pain, and found to be hypoxic to low 80's on RA, which
is new for her.
.
In the ED: 98  72  147/75  20  96% on unclear O2. She was found
to require NRB to maintain sats and also found to have Cr 2.0
which is new from baseline 0.7. Suspicion was high for a PE, so
she had a R LENI which was negative, but the proceeded to VQ
scan which was positive for multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She was started on Heparin gtt and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
Of note, she also had Trop 0.05 and BNP [**Numeric Identifier **], both of which are
new.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, tortuous thoracic aorta, no signs of
CHF or
pneumonia, and probable emphysema. Bedside u/s showed known
cardiomegaly and no effusion.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she c/o R leg pain/stiffness, "tried to
walk and it gave out," but denies fall, head hit, or LOC;
difficulty breathing and cough off/on for 2 wks; malaise last
week and decreased PO intake. She denied orthopnea, PND, CP,
palps, fevers.


Past Medical History:
1. GI bleed in [**2185**] (treated at [**Hospital1 112**])
2. Chronic Anemia - receives regular iron infusions
3. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (no TTE on record)
4. s/p Hysterectomy


Social History:
Lives alone in [**Location (un) 686**]. Retired. Denies drug use. Drinks
alcohol socially. Smokes [**12-23**] ppd since age 23. She uses a walker
at home.


Family History:
Mother with diabetes, several family members with tuberculosis.

aerosolized facemask
GEN: Thin female with NRB mask on, joking around in NAD
HEENT: Mouth with poor dentition, jugular pulsations noted at
the level of the earlobe
RESP: CTAB, no gross w/c/r/r but air movement only fair
CV: RRR with LLSB early systolic murmur and PMI noted there as
well; in conjunction with earlobe jugular pulsations would
suspect TR
ABD: Soft, NT ND, BS+
EXT: No BLE edema noted, LE's are warm until halfway of shins,
cool feet thereafter

.
EKG ([**2187-11-26**]): Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave
progression with late precordial QRS transition is
non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible prior anterior wall
myocardial infarction. Anterolateral lead ST-T wave
abnormalities with prolonged QTc interval may be due to
myocardial ischemia or possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic
effect. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing of [**2187-11-19**] sinus bradycardia is absent, delayed R wave
progression is more prominent and further ST-T wave changes are
present.
.
VQ Scan ([**2187-11-26**]): High likelihood of pulmonary embolus with
multiple bilateral emboli suspected.
.
Portable CXR ([**2187-11-26**]): Cardiomegaly, tortuous thoracic aorta.
No signs of CHF or pneumonia. Probable emphysema.
.
Right Lower Extremity U/S ([**2187-11-26**]): No evidence of R leg DVT
but the calf veins were not visualized. DVT in calf veins not
excluded but felt less likely.
.
TTE ([**2187-11-27**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. The gradient increased with the Valsalva maneuver.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is apparent "preservation"
of the RV apex function ("[**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign), consistent with
acute pulmonary hypertension, as in pulmonary embolism. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle in a pattern, consistent with acute pulmonary
hypertension. Small and underfilled left ventricle with
functional outflow obstruction.
.
EKG ([**2187-11-27**]): Sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave progression with
late precordial QRS transition is non-diagnostic but cannot
exclude possible anterior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. Anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities with
borderline prolonged QTc interval may be due to myocardial
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing of [**2187-11-26**] further lateral limb lead T wave
abnormalities are present.
.
CXR ([**2187-11-27**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the
patient has received a PICC line. The tip of the PICC line
projects over the mid-to-lower SVC. No evidence of
complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the
radiograph is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly. Tortuosity of
the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusions, no focal parenchymal
opacities. Moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
.
Left Lower Extremity U/S ([**2187-11-27**]): DVT of the left popliteal
vein and the left peroneal vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o female with reported history of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, chronic anemia requiring iron repletion and
blood transfusions, recent gastrointestinal bleed from
diverticuli versus duodenal AVM, who presented with hypoxia and
was found to have multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli on VQ
scan.
.
#. Pulmonary Emboli: Patient presented to ED with shortness of
breath and was found to be hypoxic requiring a NRB to maintain
oxygen saturations in the high-90s. A VQ scan (as CTA unable to
be obtained due to renal failure) revealed multiple bilateral
pulmonary emboli and a heparin gtt was started in the ED. The
patient was hemodynamically stable on arrival to the floor but
given a troponin of 0.05, a proBNP of [**Numeric Identifier **], and parasternal
heave on exam, a TTE was ordered and revealed evidence of right
heart strain with elevated pulmonary artery pressures. No
thrombolysis was offered as the patient was hemodynamically
stable and had recently been discharged for a gastrointestinal
bleed. Lower extremity dopplers were ordered given the right
heart strain to evaluate for further clot burden as there was
concern that patient may not be able to continue
anti-coagulation given her recent GI bleed and might require
placement of an IVC filter. The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and
it was decided that an IVC filter was not the best option for
this patient so Coumadin was started at 5 mg daily while patient
was on the heparin drip. INR was 1.4 the day after starting
Coumadin, which was the morning of transfer to the medicine
service. During her stay in the ICU, the patient was able to be
weaned from the NRB to face mask and finally t
