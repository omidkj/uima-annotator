History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a 75 year old male with a past medical history
of CAD s/p CABG with bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in
[**2164**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of suspected
endocarditis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was unable to
fully relate his history of present illness. Limited history was
taken from outside hospital discharge summary and admission
note. The patient was in his usual state of health, living
independently who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital [**1-5**] after
being found unresponsive by his daughter with tachypnea and
fever. He had previously complained of [**12-23**] days of general
malaise. He was taken to the ED, where he was found to be
hypotensive with a blood pressure of 85/49 and temperature of
102. He was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn. CXR per reports was
suggestive of CHF with bilateral infiltrates. He was also
started on stress dose hydrocortisone given history of
prednisone therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. He was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 1562**] ICU and started on pressors after receiving a few
small fluid boluses per report. Swan-ganz catheter was placed
and he was found to have a wedge of 26. He was given an unclear
amount of diuretics as well as an attempt at Bipap. Per report,
blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus and zosyn was
discontinued. TTE was completed on day of transfer however was
not read by the time of transfer. Per nursing reports he was
intermittently requiring dopamine and norepinephrine for
intermittent hypotension. At the time of transfer he was
continued on norepinephrine 5mcg/kg/min, dopamine 2.5mcg/kg/min.
Per report he also briefly required sedation with Precedex for
agitation however he was never intubated.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was sleepy but easily
arousable and conversant. He was oriented to hospital and his
own name but not to date. He denied chest pain and shortness of
breath. Denied headache, vision changes. Denied abdominal pain,
hemoptysis, black or red stools. He reported a history of
bleeding and bruising of unknown etiology, stated he had had
bleeding of his nose and gums previously which resolved without
intervention.

- CABG in [**2164**] with bioprosthetic AVR for aortic stenosis
- Gram Positive Cocci bacteremia
- Thrombocytopenia with baseline 50,000
- History of transbronchial biopsy with suggestion of
bronchiolitis obliterans [**2166**]

Social History:

lives near by. Has 9 children. Reports past history of tobacco
use 10pack/yrs, quit 20 years ago. Denies EtOH, IVDU. He was

Brief Hospital Course:
75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of S.
aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF.
.
# Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
MSSA at an outside hospital.  The patient was initially
continued on vancomycin but switched to nafcillin once the
sensitivities were available.  A transthoracic echo initially
showed no evidence of a vegetation (albeit poor windows), and a
TEE was obtained, which showed a small vegetation on the
patient's prosthetic aortic valve.  Infectious disease was
consulted who agreed with nafcillin and adding gentamicin and
rifampin.  The nafcillin was switched back to vancomycin when
evidence of acute interstitial nephritis was found.
.
# Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of
bacteremia.  His initial wedge pressure was 32 with a CVP of
14-24, which was consistent with a cardiogenic shock.  The
patient remained dependent on peripheral dopamine and initially
improved, but later again became severely hypotensive.  A swan
was re-floated which showed extremely high wedge pressure in the
60s in the setting of hypotension. Cardiac output numbers
however showed somewhat preserved cardiac output with an
extremely low systemic vascular resistance which was consistent
with septic shock. The patient remained dependent on maximum
pressor support, but his blood pressure continued to fall.   A
family meeting was gathered, and it was determined that the
patient was to be made comfort measures only.    The patient
expired on the evening of [**2168-1-11**] when pressors were
discontinued.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - The patient had evidence of
volume overload as above, and was diuresed with lasix.  However,
he developed acute renal failure and became unresponsive to
diuresis.
.
# Acute Renal failure - The patient was found to have evidence
of acute renal failure that worsened over the course of his
admission.  Renal was consulted, and white cell casts were found
on urine sediment inspection, which was concerning for acute
interstitial nephritis.  Nafcillin was discontinued and
vancomycin was re-
