IMAGING:
Admission Hip Film ([**1-5**]):  IMPRESSION: Proximal left femoral
fracture.

Admission CXR ([**1-5**]): IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Low lung volumes with right basilar atelectasis. Previously
identified right retrocardiac nodular density, not clearly
visualized in this study.

Gross Path on L Hip Fx: Clinical:  Fracture left hip.
The specimen is received fresh labeled with "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4464**]" and
"left femoral head" and consists of a femoral head measuring 6.5
x 4.5 x 3.8 cm.  The additional separate fragment of bone
measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The shape of the femoral head is
unremarkable, however, there is extensive eburnation across most
of the surface. There is mild, focal osteophytic growth on the
edge.  It is sectioned to reveal large area of hemorrhage
measuring up to 3 cm, and the inferior surface of the femoral
head is jagged and hemorrhagic.   The bone trabecula are firm
and no tumors or other mass lesions are noted on sectioning.
Representative sections are submitted in A-B following
decalcification.

CTA Chest (post-op) [**1-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Single PE visualized in the apical segment of the right lower
lobe.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Associated atelectasis. No
other areas of consolidation are visualized.
3. Mild/early CHF.

CT Abd/Pelvis ([**1-9**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Patient is status post ORIF of the left proximal femur. There
is marked streak artifact from this within the pelvis, however,
no definite hematomas are identified.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. The gallbladder appears full, and contains sludge. If there
is clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, evaluation with
ultrasound is recommended.

US liver/GB ([**1-10**]):
IMPRESSION: Gallbladder sludge and pericholecystic fluid. No
gallbladder wall edema or other evidence to suggest acute
cholecystitis. Given the presence of hypoalbuminemia, normal
LFTs, and the absence of a white count, the gallbladder sludge
and gallbladder distention likely reflect a fasting state.

CXR [**1-12**]:  IMPRESSION: Improvement of pulmonary edema. Unchanged
right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with h/o hypothyroidism, anemia,
osteoporosis, multiple falls including [**2-20**] and [**3-23**], [**5-23**] who
presented [**1-4**] s/p mechanical fall with subsequent L hip fx.
She was taken to OR [**1-6**] for L ORIF. Intraoperatively she
dropped her O2 sats from 100 to 90 and was noted to have an
elevated A-a gradient. Hip procedure went well without
complications. Post-operatively, the pt left ventilated on SIMV
and ortho requested transfer to MICU for further evaluation and
treatment. In the ICU, she was found to have a subsegmental PE
and BL pleural effusions.  She developed a fever to 101.9, and
was treated empirically for hospital-acquired PNA with
CTZ/flagyl (plan for 10 days). She was also started on heparin,
and was noted to have had a Hct drop of 10 points on [**1-9**], which
was stable after transfusion.  No obvious source was found and
her Hct was stable following. During this time ([**1-9**]), she was
also empirically started on Vancomycin for the fevers, but it
was d/c'd on [**1-13**]. No other etiology for the fevers was found,
including negative RUQ U/s and CT a/p. Once extubated, the
patient failed speech and swallow evaluation, but refused NGT
placement.  A PICC line was placed for temporary nutrition via
TPN.
.
1. PE: The patient was anticoagulated initially with heparin gtt
then switched to lovenox. Once a PEG was placed, the patient was
transitioned over to coumadin with lovenox bridge. Last INR was
2.1 on [**2174-2-2**], stopped lovenox, discharged on Coumadin 3mg PO
qd, please check INR in 2 days and adjust dose of coumadin as
needed. At time of discharge, her SaO2 ranged from 92-95 on RA.
.
2. ID: The patient was treated empirically with CTZ and Flagyl
for a nosocomial/aspiration PNA and remained afebrile while on
the floor. However, pt's WBC elevated so Vanco was added to
regimen for a 7 day course. A sputum cx from [**1-10**] grew sparse
yeast. The foley was changed and a urine sent for culture; the
initial sample was contaminated and grew yeast; the second urine
cx grew enterococcus resistant to Vanco 10,000-100,000 colonies.
A repeat urine was sent and the foley was removed; cx grew only
yeast. She remained afebrile, with a normal WBC, throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization. A pCXR on [**2173-1-31**] showed a
question of a new L medical base infiltrate; however, in absence
of fever and stable WBC, did not treat with abx, followed
clinically. There was a concern that the patient may have
experienced an aspiration event; however she did not worsen
clinically so no further treatment provided other than measures
to reduce aspiration risk.
.
3. L Hip fracture, s/p ORIF: The patient was followed by
Orthopedics and did well, cleared for WBAT and work with PT/OT;
