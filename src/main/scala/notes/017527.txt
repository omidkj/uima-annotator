Brief Hospital Course:
Heparin was begun after admission. On [**12-2**] he went to the
operating room where bilateral thoracoscopic Mazes with ligation
of the left atrial appendage was performed.  Marcaine infusion
pumps and bulb drains where placed bilaterally.
He remained stable and was extubated easily and transferred to
the floor on POD 1.He was atrially paced, Sotalol was resumed.
His underlying rhythm was sinus bradycardia, however, he
returned to AF on POD2.  His chest drains were removed on POD4.
AF persisted, Sotalol was discontinued and dofetilide was begun.
DCSCV was planned and anticoagulation was continued.  He
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm on [**12-9**].
He was prepared for discharge.  Dofetilide was continued as was
diuresis.  Arrangement were made for Coumadin monitoring as he
was on preoperatively. Medications, instruction and precautions
were discussed with him prior to discharge.
