Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**]
Chief Complaint:
AV graft placement needed for dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of left upper extremity graft for dialysis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12067**] is a 68 year-old woman with end stage renal disease
who has a failed kidney transplant. She had multiple procedures
on her upper
extremities and currently has a right sided PermaCath. There is
a subclavian stenosis on the right side and so this side was not
thought to be usable. Venogram on the left side  revealed 2 good
quality veins. However, these were up at almost the level of the
chest wall and given her previous grafts on the left side we
felt that a high left upper extremity graft would be her best
option. She understood the risks and benefits and wished to
proceed.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2172-6-2**] 16:17:18
Sinus rhythm.
Vertical axis
Consider right ventricular hypertrophy
Inferior T wave changes are probably due to ventricular
hypertrophy
rsr' in lead V1
Early R wave progression
QT interval prolonged for rate
Since previous tracing, axis more vertical, inferior T wave
abnormalities less
Clinical correlation is suggested

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2172-6-2**] 21:12:48
Sinus tachycardia
Possible right ventricular hypertrophy
Vertical axis
rsr' in lead V1
Since previous tracing, heart rate increased, QT interval
decreased, T wave
abnormalities more marked
Clinical correlation is suggested

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2172-6-4**] 07:33:36
Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
S1, Q3, T3 pattern
Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities
Findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is suggested
for possible in
part RV overload
Since previous tracing of [**2172-6-2**], further precordial leads ST-T
wave changes present.


AP CHEST FROM 11:09 P.M. [**6-2**]

HISTORY: End-stage renal disease and respiratory distress. Check
ET tube
placement.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 3:00 and 4:30 p.m. today:

With the chin down, the tip of the endotracheal tube is at the
upper margin of
the clavicles at least 5 cm from the carina, 2-3 cm above
optimal placement.
Consolidation in the infrahilar right lung has improved since
3:00 p.m.
indicating this is likely atelectasis. Severe cardiac silhouette
enlargement
is unchanged. Left lung is clear. Nasogastric tube passes into
the stomach
and out of view. The tips of a dual channel supraclavicular
right central
venous catheter project over the SVC and superior cavoatrial
junction
respectively. No pneumothorax.

FINAL REPORT


PROCEDURE: Single AP portable view of the chest.

REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for aspiration, 64-year-old woman with
ESRD with
respiratory distress.

Comparison is made with prior study performed the day before.

FINDINGS: There is retrocardiac left base opacity concerning for
aspirative
consolidation new from prior study. Stable small bilateral
pleural effusions.
Stable enlarged cardiomediastinal contour. A right subclavian
venous access
catheter tip remains in the right atrium. Right infrahilar
opacity is
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
Left retrocardiac consolidation consistent with an aspirative
process

Findings were discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the mom[**Name (NI) **] of the
interpretation
of the study.

HISTORY: Question aspiration _____ surgery yesterday, question
pneumonia.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

Compared with [**2172-6-4**], there has been some interval clearing at
the left lung
base, with improvement and only minimal residual retrocardiac
patchy density.
No CHF or other evidence of consolidation or effusion. Minimal
subsegmental
atelectasis at the right base. A right IJ central line is
present, tip
overlying uppermost right atrium.

FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: 64-year-old woman, status post left AV graft, now
with swelling
of the right forearm. Evaluate the right arm for DVT.

COMPARISON: Ultrasound from [**2169-4-4**].

UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color
Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right internal jugular,
subclavian, axillary,
basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins and the left subclavian
vein. Normal
flow, waveforms, compressibility, and augmentation are
demonstrated. No
intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the OR where she had Left AV upper arm
graft placed for HD access secondary to ESRD.  Patient
technically had fine placement of Left AV graft; however, during
procedure patient had respiratory compromise/airway edema and
was intubated.  Patient noted to have elevated troponinsX3 as
above s/p airway management.  Patient stayed overnight in PACU
with anesthesia monitoring patient.  Patient had facial swelling
and renal was initially consulted on [**6-2**] postop.  They
concurred with surgeon's evaluation that patient had become
hypercarbic and tachypnic during OR and thought the angioedema
was most likely to drug allergic reaction secondary to no
pulmonary edema on CXR.  The patient did vomit and aspirated in
PACU and developed retrocardiac infiltrates concerning for
aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was extubated on [**2172-6-3**].  The
patient was treated with Zosyn in hospital then Augmentin po x
6days postdischarge.  Patient was transferred to floor but noted
to be hypersomnolent and subsequently had low oxygen saturation
secondary to sus
