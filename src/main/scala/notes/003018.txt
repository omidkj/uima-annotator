DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypercapnia.

3. Status post pneumonectomy.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  PCO2 equal to 89 on an arterial blood gas
in the operating room.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37-year-old female
admitted for outpatient breast biopsy on the 24th when an
arterial blood gas checked at the end of her procedure showed
a pCO2 of 89.  The total arterial blood gas was 7.18, pCO2
89, pO2 173.  Patient was monitored under LMA.  Conscious
sedation, breathing at her own rate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Tuberculosis at the age of 16, she was treated with 4-5
drugs in [**Country 651**] for 6-9 months.
2. Status post a left pneumonectomy in [**2160**] for a chronically
scarred and infected left lung.
3. Pulmonary hypertension, baseline lung values after her
pneumonectomy included baseline arterial blood gas of 7.39,
57, 62, and spirometry of a FEV1 of 0.88 liters which is 32%
of predicted and a FVC 0.91 which is 26% of predicted.  The
patient has a baseline bicarb on her Chem-7 approximately
30-35.

Based on the elevated pCO2, patient was admitted for close
observation to the Intensive Care Unit.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol as needed.

ALLERGIES:  Tetracycline causes a rash.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol, immigrated from [**Country 651**]

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.6, heart rate 92, blood pressure 103/65, respiratory rate
16, oxygen saturation 98-100% on room air.  Physical
examination was remarkable for a thin Asian woman in no acute
distress.  Cardiac examination:  A 1/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border with a
physiologically split S2.  Lungs were clear on the right and
absent breath sounds on the left.  Remainder of examination
was normal.

RELEVANT LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative complete blood count
was normal.  Arterial blood gas at 3:30 pm:  7.18/89/173.  At
04:02 pm, arterial blood gas:  7.24/78/199.  Arterial blood
gas was done while the patient was breathing spontaneously.
Partial chemistries were all within normal limits.

Portable chest x-ray was unchanged from prior.

ASSESSMENT ON ADMIT:  Patient is status post a pneumonectomy
with baseline CO2 retention with a pCO2 approximately 50-55
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with an elevated pCO2 for
close observation of her mental status and respiratory
distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was monitored closely overnight in
the Intensive Care Unit with continuous pulse oximetry and
close monitoring by the nursing staff.  The patient did well
without any complaints.  She had no respiratory complaints or
desaturations or other problems.  [**Name (NI) **] further laboratories

In the morning, the patient had no complaints.  Was feeling
well and looked to be in her usual state of health.  The
baseline arterial blood gas was performed to establish a
baseline for further future reference.  This arterial blood
gas came back as pH 7.42, pCO2 54, pO2 69, that was done on
room air.

Patient was discharged in good condition on the 25th.  She is
to followup with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-5**] weeks, and

Prescriptions for Tylenol #3 for pain as needed, and will
continue on her albuterol.
