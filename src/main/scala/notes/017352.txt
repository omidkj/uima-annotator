Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Whole lung lavage x 1, intubation, left IJ, arterial line x 2,
femoral lines x 2

History of Present Illness:
27yoM with history of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,
dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea presenting with shortness
of breath.
.
The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in
[**2162**] when he presented with progressive dysnea with minimal
exertion. He was initially treated for antibiotics and
nebulizers for a presumed URI vs pneumonia, but had progressive
symptoms with hypoxia and underwent a CT chest that revealed
bilateral ground glass opacities. He subsequently underwent a
VATS wedge resection of the RLL on [**2162-3-19**] which showed
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Since his diagnosis, he has had
two whole lung lavages, the first at the time of diagnosis which
was complicated by hypoxia after left lung lavage. He next
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2162-12-13**] with worsening dyspnea on
exertion, and repeat CT chest showed recurrence of protein
alveolar proteinosis, more prominent in the right lung. He
underwent another right whole lung lavage and was weaned from 4L
NC to room air prior to discharge. Post-lavage, the patient was
noted to be hypoxic to the mid to high- 80's on room air with
ambulation and the patient was instructed to use home oxygen
with exertion and and at night. Of note, the patient was also
diagnosed with a lobar pneumonia in [**2163-12-13**] that was
treated with Azithromycin x5 days with improvement of symptoms.
He subsequently had increased productive cough and dyspnea on
exertion late [**2164-1-12**] that was treated with another course
of Azithromycin x5 days with improvement of symptoms.
.
The patient's current symptoms began last night when he began
experiencing increasing shortness of breath with a cough
productive of white, stringy sputum. He denies fevers, chills,
sick contacts, yellow or green sputum, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting. He presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center and was found to
have a normal white count. CTA showed extensive bilateral ground
glass opacities. He was hypoxic to the 70's**** and was placed
on BIPAP at the OSH with improvement of PO2 in the low 90s. He
was empirically started on Levofloxacin and diuresed with ******
with improvement of symptoms, and was weaned to nasal cannula.
He was made NPO in anticipation of a toatl lung washout at [**Hospital1 18**]
given the high suspicion of recurrent PAP and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for a whole lung lavage on Friday and Monday.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was comfortable breathing on
nasal cannula without shortness of breath at rest in bed

Imaging:
CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2162-12-30**], there
is little change.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Again,
scattered radiation related to the size of the patient makes it
difficult to properly evaluate the lungs. However, there is no
definite vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
Of incidental note is a right-sided aortic arch.

CXR: [**2164-3-25**]
The patient is intubated with the ET tube being at the level of
the clavicular heads, approximately 7.4 cm above the carina.
Heart size is enlarged. There is less prominence of the right
mediastinal silhouette which still reflects distended superior
vena cava as well as mediastinal deposition of the fat.  Right
lower lobe consolidation is redemonstrated, slightly improved
since the prior examination. There is, on the other hand,
progression of the left lower lobe opacity, that might be
concerning for interval development of infectious process as
well.

Left internal jugular line tip is at the level of the junction
of left
internal jugular vein with brachiocephalic vein. NG tube tip is
most likely in the stomach. Left chest tube is in place.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the ventricles,
basal cisterns, and crowding of the foramen magnum. This is
worrisome for a global hypoperfusion and infarction.
2. Opacification of the ethmoidal air cells, sphenoid sinuses,
and right
mastoid air cells.


Brief Hospital Course:
27yoM with history of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,
dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea presenting with shortness
of breath and white sputum, now admitted for lung lavage
complicated by hypoxia, PEA  arrest

# Increased ICP/Cerebral edema: Noted on EEG and recent CT scan,
herniation is imminent. Temporizing measures were performed with
hyperventilation, mannitol and hypertonic saline initially until
all of family arrived. Neurology consulted and patient had
minimal cerebral reflexes and his prognosis remained poor. On
the morning of [**3-25**] at 9:40 AM the patient expired.

Death Note:

Called to see patient for seizure and inability to ventilate
plus hypoxia. On exam the patient did not respond to verbal or
physical stimuli. Absent heart and breath sounds. Absent
peripheral pulses. Pupils are fixed and dilated. No corneal
reflexes. Patient pronounced dead at 0940. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] notified.
[**Last Name (LF) 6961**], [**Known firstname **] and [**Doctor First Name **] were notified via phone and arrived
within minutes. Both [**Doctor First Name **] wanted an autopsy. Medical examiner
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] declined examination.  Organ donation spoke to
patient's family and agreed to undergo organ donation.

# s/p PEA arrest:  Etiology either acidosis, hypoxia, or
pneumothorax. Down time is not exact, but appears to be anywhere
from 15-30 minutes. Pt was placed on arctic sun cooling protocol
and was rewarmed. Neurology and post arrest team followed
patient. Has been off sedation with no response. Initially with
increased myoclonic jerks and seizure activity and started on
Keppra and high doses of Versed. Ultimatley, EEG developed
flatlining pattern consistent with cerebral edema which is very
poor neurologic prognostic sign. Confirmed with CT head. Demise
as above.

PEA arrest events:
- Prior to procedure 95-100% 6 liters with c/o cough, general
anesthesia induced and his single lumen ETT moved to double
lumen, ETT procedure aborted due to difficulty ventilating the
left lung with ventilation only returning volumes of 30-55 cc
with TV of 600cc TV de
