Brief Hospital Course:
Patient had a PEG placed on [**5-29**] with no complications.  Tube
feeds were restarted.  Lovenox (therapeutic dose) was started as
a bridge to coumadin.  Patient briefly went into rapid afib

blockers.  A chest CT to follow up his pulmonary disease was
also done. This showed improvement of ground glass opacities and
pleual effusions with slightly worsening fibrosis.
