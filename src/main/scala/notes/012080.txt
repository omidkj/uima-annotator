two days of right facial twitching, one day of increased
drooling (noted at dinner time today), and worsening of normally
mild right facial droop and slurred speech while at her nursing
home. The nurse noted a concerned look on her face, though she
remained alert and aware of the situation. Her words were also
unclear. The nurse at the nursing facility called EMS.

.
EKG [**2181-12-7**]  8:23:34 PM
Probable atrial fibrillation
Indeterminate frontal QRS axis
Intraventricular conduction defect
Low R(V2-V4) probably due to right ventricular hypertrophy
Inferior T wave changes are nonspecific
Repolarization changes may be partly due to rhythm
Baseline artifact precludes accurate interpretation of rhythm
but suspect
accelerated idioventricular rhythm, cannot rule out"regular"
atrial
fibrillation
Since previous tracing of left anterior fascicular block
resolved
.
CXR:
Patient is post-median sternotomy. There is cardiomegaly,
unchanged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged, with
calcification of the aorta. There is persistent elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm. No consolidation or pulmonary edema in the
lungs. No definite pleural effusion.
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and cisterns are normal. There is encephalomalacia of
portions of the left frontal, parietal and temporal lobes,
consistent with prior infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation
is preserved. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic infarction in the left MCA distribution.

MRI:
Large chronic left middle cerebral artery territory stroke. No
enhancing mass lesions or other acute intracranial pathology
identified.

   ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):
...
[**Month (only) 404**]:
[**2181-1-2**] CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left thigh hematoma, involving the sartorius and rectus
femoris muscles.
.
2. Hazy appearance of the subcutaneous fat possibly also
representing a small hematoma along the left lower chest/upper
abdominal wall.
.
3. Anasarca.
.
[**2181-1-20**] CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Again seen is a soft tissue fluid collection adjacent to the
left hip, consistent with the hematoma noted on prior study.
Additionally, there is a new hematoma within the right rectus
muscle, measuring 7.7 x 6.2 cm, and a tiny focus of hemorrhage
within the left rectus muscle, both at the level of the sacrum.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right, unchanged
from prior study.
3. There is asymmetric enlargement of the left psoas muscle.
This is of uncertain etiology, though this is unchanged from
prior studies dating back to [**2181-12-19**].


Brief Hospital Course:
In Brief: 76 year old woman with MMP including old MCA stroke
presents with right simple partial seizure and respiratory
distress, extensive hospital course complicated by tracheostomy
tube, ventilator associated pneumonia and spontaneous bleeds in
light of anticoagulation for [**Month/Day/Year 1291**].
.
In the ED she was evaluated by Neurology and found to be having
multiple brief eposides of facial twitching that lasted about 30
seconds, but she was able to follow commands during this time
and her speech was more dysarthric than usual. Between episodes,
pt is alert, following commands,with R facial droop, still able
to close R eye, and with slightly dysarthric speech. Speech is
much more dysarthric during the events.
.
She was given ativan 2 mg IV and loaded with Dilantin 20mg./kg
on tele to watch for hypoptension and arrythmias. She was not
