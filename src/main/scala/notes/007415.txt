Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Leaky J-Tube
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Ventilator Management


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
78y/o M with history of bronchoalveolar carcinoma s/p rt upper
lobectomy in [**2-/2138**], aspiration pneumonia c/b L sided empyema
s/p thoracentesis and chronic respiratory failure s/p
tracheostomy transferred from OSH for J tube evaluation.
.
In [**2-/2138**], patient was diagnosed with bronchoalveolar carcinoma
and underwent a lobar resection. This hospitalization was
complicated by a prolonged hospitalization, prolonged chest
tube, and malnutrition. Given malnutrition and h/o esophageal
stricture, a J-tube was placed. Pt also has h/o partial
gastrectomy and Bilroth II procedure and thus J tube was
considered over G-tube. After this hospitalization, pt was
d/c'ed LTAC at [**Hospital1 **].
.
LTAC reported that J tube was leaky and patient subsequently
underwent 2 revisions on [**5-20**] and [**5-29**] by general surgery at
OSH. Per OSH surgeons, cause of leak was [**12-25**] poor wound healing
from malnutrition.
.
Recent health has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia which
led to chronic respiratory failure requiring trach, which was
completed 3 days ago. This PNA was also complicated by MRSA
empyema which was drained by pigtail catheter placed over past
weekend. Pigtail catheter fell out yesterday however repeat CT
showed interval improvement of pleural effusion. Patient was
started on imipenem empirically for aspiration pneumonia was due
to finish treatment on [**6-14**]. Additionally, patient was started
linezolid, today being day 4.
.
Patient was significant improving from ventilation stand point
and was due to be sent back to rehab however J-tube remained
leaky which prompted transfer for further evaluation.
.
On MICU, Patient was in no acute distress and had no complaints.
Patient however did not appear to be inattentive.

Imaging:
CT chest: [**6-13**]
FINDINGS: Thyroid is normal in appearance. There is no
supraclavicular,
mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. Scattered
nonenlarged nodes
are seen. The heart and pericardium are unremarkable with
physiologic pleural
fluid. Atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary vessels and
aortic arch
are noted. Left-sided PICC line terminates in the mid distal
SVC. Aortic and
mitral valvular calcifications are also noted.

Dense consolidative process is seen involving the basal portion
of the right
upper lobe as well as the entire right lower lobe in a similar
fashion as on
the prior with slight improved aeration in the right middle
lobe. Patient is
status post what appears to be partial right upper and right
lower
lobectomies. Aspirated secretions are seen in bronchus
intermedius and right
lower lobe bronchus as well as in the left main stem bronchus
concerning for
continued aspiration with a bolus of secretion seen immediately
superior to
the tracheostomy tube (601B:21). Scattered ground-glass and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacification is seen in the remaining lobes concerning for
milder aspiration
related changes versus infectious or inflammatory process. In
this setting of
bronchoalveolar carcinoma, this could also reflect foci of
malignant
involvement and followup to resolution should be performed.
Small left
pleural effusion is seen and improved from the prior study with
improved
aeration of the left lower lobe. Though the indication describes
a left-sided
empyema what appears to be a loculated air-fluid collection in
the prior study
in the right pleural space is improved on the current
examination resembling a
partially loculated right pleural effusion which is small and
simple in
appearance. Evaluation for empyema is limited by non-contrast
technique.
Paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema is noted.

Though this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation, limited
upper abdominal evaluation demonstrates numerous surgical clips
compatible
with history of gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction.
Multiple
left-sided rib fractures are seen along with diffuse osteopenia.


IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration with secretions within bronchus intermedius, right
lower lobe
bronchus and left main stem bronchus along with dense
opacification in the
right lower lobe and basal right upper lobe. Impending
aspiration of
additional bolus of secretions proximal to the tracheostomy
tube.
2. Ground-glass/tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the left upper, right
upper and
right middle lobes could be additional foci of aspiration versus
infectious or
inflammatory process. Given the history of bronchoalveolar
carcinoma, these
pulmonary opacifications should be followed up for resolution.
3. Though the indication describes left-sided empyema, it
appears the prior
empyema wa
