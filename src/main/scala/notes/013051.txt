Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 yo male patient presented [**2161-12-1**] with complaints of
[**11-29**] week history chest discomfort with shortness of breath,
nausea, and vomitting.  He reports sub-sternal chest pain that
awoke him from sleep on the morning of admission.  In the
emergency room he had some ST depressions on EKG with + enzymes.

In the cardiac cath lab he was found to have 3 VD with 80% LM,
80% LAD, 50% LCx, and 90% RCA.
He was at that time referred for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
On exam, this patient was found to have carotid bruits
bilaterally with carotid ultrasound showing  a 70-79% stenosis
on the left side.  A neurology consult was obtained stating,
after thorough exam, that the patient was thought to be safe for
surgery without further neurological examination.
He proceeded to the operating room on [**2161-12-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].
 He underwent a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the Diag,
and SVG to the PDA and PLB.  Total cardio-pulmonary bypass time
78 minutes and cross clamp time 49 minutes.  He proceeded to the
CSRU in a NSR with rate 74, MAP 85, CVP 16, on neo and propofol
drips.
He failed to weane in the immediate post-operative period but
was successfully weaned and extubated on the evening of post-op
day one.  He was initially confused with periods of lucidity.
On POD 3 he experienced atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone.  Becasue of his history of COPD adn asthma,
lopressor was used cautiously and hydralazine was used for HTN.
On this same day, his mediastinal chest tubes were discontinued.
On POD 4 amiodarone was changed to PO, NPH insulin was started
for blood glucose control, and he was transferred to the
inpatient floor for continued rehabilitation and recovery.
On POD 5 his remaining chest tubes and epicardial wires were
discontinued.  He continued in atrial fibrillation with ongoing
amiodarone and low-dose beta blockers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] was known to [**Last Name (un) 39324**] chronic renal insufficiency with a
pre-op creat of 1.9.  On POD 6, his creat was elevated to 2.6.
He was also noted to be 10 kg up from his pre-op weight.  His
lasix was thus discontinued and natracor was initiated for
diuresis.  On this same day he converted to a NSR.
On post-operative day 8, he lost his venous access and was sent
for PICC placement for continued natracor therapy.
On POD 9 a renal consult was obtained.  They recommended
continued natracor with lasix for increased diuresis.
(Creatinine 2.6.)  Continued to diuresis with both lasix and
natracor for 4 days with discontinuation of natracor on POD 12.
(Creatinine 2.8.)
On POD 13, renal signed-off as they felt situation was stable.
He continued to diurese with lasix; with creatinine stable at
2.7-2.9, and weight decreasing.
He had a burst of strial fibrillation on POD 15 and converted to
NSR following an IV amiodarone bolus and ongoing PO amiodarone.

He was followed by the physical therapy team throughout his
hospitalization and was thought not to be safe for home.  He was
recommended for rehabilitation placement.
On the day of dichharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] was stable with his
creatinine dropping (2.2) and his edema and weight lessening.
