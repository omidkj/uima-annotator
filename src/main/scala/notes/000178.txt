presents from [**Location (un) 620**] with LGIB.

Pt has a 15 year hx of alcohol abuse, and relapsed with alcohol
1 month ago.  3 days ago, pt developed black bloody stools with
4 large bloody bowel movements last night.  Pt had 3 more this
morning filling the toilet bowl w/ BRBB + black stool which
improved this morning. Pt has had some nausea, but no vomiting
or hematemesis.

At [**Name (NI) 31237**], pt had dark red blood on rectal exam. NG lavage was
negative but there was poor return of fluid. HCT 20 down from
her baseline of 31. She was started on pantroprazole, octreotide
and given 1 unit of blood prior to transfer. Vitals were stable
on transfer.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient reported feeling nauseous and
anxious, and was afraid of withdrawing from EtOH. She did have 1
more large bloody BM in the ED.  Her initial VS were 99.8 95

LIVER/GALLBLADDER US WITH DOPPLERS ([**2124-6-27**]):
1. Patent TIPS. No ascites.
2. Borderline splenomegaly.
3. Limited assessment of the liver, but it is coarsened in
echotexture
compatible with known cirrhosis.

EGD ([**2124-6-26**], prelim):
-Esophagus: 2 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower
third of the esophagus. The varices were not bleeding.
-Stomach: A marginal ulcer was seen on the jejunal side of the
gastro-jejunal anastamosis. The ulcer was 1cm in diameter. There
was some exudate that was washed off. There were a few pigmented
spots but no visible vessel or clot. There was some minimal
contact bleeding from the tissue at the edge of the ulcer, but
no active bleeding noted from the ulcer and no blood seen in the
stomach pouch or intestine.
-Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
-Other findings: Normal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy noted
consistent with known history
-IMPRESSION: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus. A
marginal ulcer was seen on the jejunal side of the
gastro-jejunal anastamosis. The ulcer was 1cm in diameter. There
was some exudate that was washed off. There were a few pigmented
spots but no visible vessel or clot. There was some minimal
contact bleeding from the tissue at the edge of the ulcer, but
no active bleeding noted from the ulcer and no blood seen in the
stomach pouch or intestine. Normal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
anatomy noted consistent with known history. Otherwise normal
EGD to third part of the duodenum
-RECOMMENDATIONS: Prilosec 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Check H. pylori antibody.
Take Carafate suspension 2 grams twice a day. The source of
bleeding was from the marginal ulcer. Given its endoscopic
appearance it is a low risk to re-bleed. Avoid alcohol and
smoking.
RUQ u/s [**6-27**]: 1. Patent TIPS. No ascites. 2. Borderline
splenomegaly. 3. Limited assessment of the liver, but it is
coarsened in echotexture compatible with known cirrhosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with h/o EtOH cirrhosis c/b portal HTN and bleeding
varices, s/p TIPS ([**2123**]) and h/o ischemic bowel s/p right
colectomy and ileostomy reversal ([**2120**]), who recently relapsed
with drinking who presented with upper GI bleed.

#GI BLEED: Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] was admitted to the MICU where she had an
emergent EGD for suspicion of upper GI bleed. EGD showed a 1cm
non-bleeding marginal ulcer at the site of the gastro-jejunal
anastomasis from her prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as the most
likely cause of her GI bleed. Given h/o portal hypertensive
gastropathy and variceal bleeds, she had RUQ abdominal
ultrasound which showed that TIPS was patent with no
ascites/splenomegaly. She received 4 units of blood total, and
her HCT bumped from 20 to 26 following transfusion. She had one
more episode of black stool and large BRBPR while in the MICU on
HD #2, no further episodes after this. She initially received
Octreotide on admission, this was DC'd once lower sus
