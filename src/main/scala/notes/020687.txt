Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Atropine / Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Positive stress test

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L heart catherization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85-yo man with history of CAD s/p MI and CABG
approx 10 years ago with unknown anatomy, PVD s/p right carotid
endarterectomy approx 2-3 years ago c/b intraoperative stroke
with residual left-sided weakness, who has been experiencing SOB
with exertion for the past 6 months. He experiences dyspnea with
activity including pushing himself in his wheelchair approx 50
yards or walking with assistance down the hallway while using a
walker. He also describes intermittent chest pain that is
usually not related to exertion. He had a TTE on [**2141-6-17**] that
showed a non-dilated LV with mild concentric LVH and EF 60%, and
mild MR, TR, and AI. By report from pt's primary cardiologist,
the patient had a recent Adenosine [**Year (4 digits) 1608**], during which he had SOB
and chest pressure at one minute of infusion and possible
anteroischemia on imaging, although the rest was stopped
prematurely. The pt was referred here for outpatient cardiac
catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, coronary angiography showed normal hemodynamics
and a right-dominant system with normal LMCA, 60-70% proximal
LAD and 70% diagonal, patent LCx with occluded small OM, 30%
mid-RCA, atretic LIMA-LAD, and serial 90% SVG-OM with thrombus
s/p PCI but unable to deliver stents, resulting in severe no
reflow refractory to drug therapy.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the pt feels well post-procedure without
complaints. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea. ROS is
otherwise completely negative.
.
On review of symptoms, he reports + prior CVA but denies any
prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Cath Report:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel native coronary disease. The LMCA had no
angiogrpahically
apparent obstructive CAD. The LAD had 60-70% proximal and 70%
diag
disease. The LCX was patent with a small OM. The RCA was patent
with a
30% mid vessel lesion.
2. Selective venous conduit angiography revealed and SVG to OM
with
serial 90% lesions with thrombus.
3. Selective conduit arteriography revealed an atretic LIMA to
LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension with SBP
of 183
mmHg.
3.  Unsuccessful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-OM graft with
three bare
metal stents - Vision (3.5x18mm) distal; Vision (3.5x18mm) mid
graft;
Vision (4x18mm) ostial.  Case complicated by slow/no reflow down
the
graft.   Despite administration of multiple vasodilators
downstream,
flow was never successfully restored. The patient left the cath
lab
hemodynamically stable with mild ([**1-29**]) chest pain (See PTCA
comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary disease.
2. Atretic LIMA to LAD.
3. Unsuccessful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-OM graft with three
bare
metal stents.  Case complicated by slow/no flow down the graft.
Despite
administration of multiple vasodilators flow was never
suceessfully
restored.
 .
TTE [**12-21**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the posterior
(inferolateral) wall. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened
(the noncoronary cusp is especially heavily calcified). There is
a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: posterior myocardial infarct



Brief Hospital Course:
85-yo man with CAD s/p MI and CABG [**43**] years ago with SVG-OM and
LIMA-LAD, PVD s/p right CEA c/b intra-op CVA with residual
left-sided weakness, who presents for close monitoring after
outpatient cardiac cath showed 90% serial thrombus in the SVG-OM
and unsuccessful attempt at PCI / stent placement, resulting in
0% residual with severe no reflow, concerning for distal
showering of thrombus to the microvasculature of the OM
distribution.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Pt has known CAD with h/o MI and is s/p CABG in
[**2123**] with SVG-OM and LIMA-LAD. He initially presented for
evaluation of DOE, and was found to have possible ischemia on a
recent Adenosine [**Last Name (LF) 1608**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was admitted for outpatient cardiac
catheterization. During the cath, attempt was made to intervene
on SVG-OM 90% serial thrombus, which resulted in 0% residual
with severe no reflow, which is concerning for distal showering
of thrombus to microvasculature. Post-procedure ECG concerning
for posterior MI, c/w LCx distribution and probable showering of
thrombus from SVG-OM. Pt asymtomatic  throughout. Treated with
medical management including ASA 325, Plavix 75, high-dose
statin, BB, and ACE-I.  Echocardiogram revealed LVEF 50%
secondary to hypokinesis of the posterior (inferolateral) wall.


The patient was continued on his home medications for his
chronic medical conditions.  He will follow up with his PCP and
primary cardiologist in the next few weeks.
