Pertinent Results:
Intra-op echo [**2159-1-22**]
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is markedly dilated upto the mid level. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
Midsystolic closure of the aortic valve leaflets is not seen
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 9250**].
POST-BYPASS:
preserved biventricular systolic function.LVEF 55%.The aortic
valve and the conduit are in place and functioning well. The
residual peak and mean gradients are 8 and 4mm of Hg
respectively.Minimal MR, TR and PI.
The thoracic aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation of
the ascending aortic aneurysm found incidentially on
echocardiogram.  He underwent preoperative workup that included
a CT scan and echocardiogram.  His medications were adjusted for
blood pressure management and episodes of atrial fibrillation
and junctional rhythm.
On [**2159-1-22**] he was brought to the Operating Room and underwent a
Bentall procedure with a [**Street Address(2) 86095**]. [**Male First Name (un) **] aortic valve
conduit.  See operative report for further details.  He received
vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.  He weaned from bypass
on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions and transferred to the
intensive care unit for post operative management.

In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedationand
pressors, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications.  On post operative day one he was started on
Coumadin for his mechanical valve and transferred to the floor.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication according to prootocol.  Physical Therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility. He was placed on continuous
O2 sat monitoring and found to be desaturating at nighttime, the
Sleep Medicine Service was consulted (see note). He had a CPAP
trial and did not desaturate.  They recommended he be discharged
home on oxygen, but not CPAP.  He will follow up with the sleep
clinic as an outpatient.  On postoperative day three he was
started on Heparin to bridge until his INR was therapuetic.  He
continued to have dysrhythmia and EP was consulted.  EP
diagnosed sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm v. atrial
fibrillation with junctional escape rhythm,  most likely due to
post-op inflammation/edema of the conduction system.  AV
conduction was found to be intact, thus a pacemaker was not
indicated.

Beta blocker was titrated carefully, and rhythm was mostly sinus
by time of discharge.  When the INR became therapeutic the
Heparin was stopped anfd the INR goal was 2.5-3.5.  The patient
was discharged home in good condition with VNA services on POD
8.

Arrangements were made for his primary care physician
(Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 66153**]) to manage his anticoagulation. Follow up
appointments, restrictions, precautions and medications were
discussed with him prior to discharge.
