Chief Complaint:
"Altered mental status."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 95432**] is a 75yo woman with h/o sacral decub with chronic
osteo, T2DM, RA, multiple UTIs with chronic foley, and
ulcerative colitis who was noted by her VNA to have altered
mental status and, therefore, sent to the ED. In the ED, initial
VS were Tmax 104, 101.5 88 109/71 16 92% RA. She was initiallty
unable to give a history but subsequently woke up after getting
settled in the ED.  Received tylenol 1gram and ibuprofen 800mg
rectally.  Urinalysis revealed pyuria with positive nitrites.
CXR was at her baseline.  CT pelvis was done to rule out
extension into her abdomen but only revealed a decub with
uderlying lytic lesion. She was given vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  Given that she was hypotensive to 80-90s, she was
admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Of note, she had a recent admission from [**2150-4-28**] to [**2150-5-25**] due
to inability to care for herself.  She was treated for worsening
unstageable sacral ulcer with chronic osteomyelitis diagnosed by
[**Month/Day/Year 500**] scan.  She also had chronic pyuria and bacteriuria.  She
had a [**Month/Day/Year 500**] biopsy on [**5-15**], which grew MRSA, VRE, and VSE.  She
was evaluated for flap placement by plastics but was not a
candidate.  She was followed by ID who recommended treating with
doxycycline after she refused PICC for long-term IV antibiotics.

[**2150-6-12**] CT Pelvis
IMPRESSION: Sacral decubitus ulcer with adjacent focal lucency
at the
posterior sacrococcygeal juction, new since prior study and
concerning for
osteomyelitis; no CT evidence for extension into the pelvis.

Renal U/S [**2150-6-19**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral renal cysts are essentially unchanged in size and
appearance
since [**2149-7-11**].

2. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

3. There is no evidence of pyelonephritis however a normal renal
ultrasound
cannot exclude pyelonephritis.


Brief Hospital Course:
--Urosepsis with chronic indwelling foley
-Ms. [**Known lastname 95432**] was admitted to the MICU for hypotension in the
setting of fever and altered mental status.
-Her urine and chronic sacral ulcer were considered as possible
sources of infection. Thus, she was initially treated with
Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Meropenem.
-Urine culture grew >100,000 Pseudomonas that was only
intermediately sensitive to [Cefepime, Ceftaz, and Meropenem]
and resistant to [Zosyn, Cipro, Tobra, and Gent].
-ID was following throughout her course and recommended changing
regimen to Daptomycin and Meropenem.
-The patient completed a 10 day course of suppressive
antibiotics in house through a PICC line consisting of meropenum
for the MDR pseudomonas in her urine.  Repeat urine cultures
were negative.
-the patient blood cultures were negative during this admission
-Ms [**Known lastname 95432**] repeatedly refused surgical consideration for a
supra-pubic catheter in house, and said she understood the risks
of doing so.  An outpatient consult was placed for this.
-the patient WBC was wnl, was afebrile and the patient felt well
on the day of discharge
-her stool was negative for c. difficile

--Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer c/b osteomyelitis
-CT scan grossly revealed findings suspicious for worsening
osteomyelitis(refuses MRI)
-it was recommended that the patient receive 6 weeks of
antibiotic therapy which she refused to do.  This would have
required a skilled nursing facility stay, which the patient
refused to do
-the risks of not completing a complete course of antibiotics
including recurrent infection, sepsis and death were explained
to the patient.  She understood the risk and continued to refuse
skilled nursing facility placement
-She was treated with wet-to-dry dressings as well as PRN
Oxycodone.
-The patient received in house daptomycin therapy for her MRSA
and she will require lifelong suppressive therapy with
doxycycline 100 po bid
-general surgery was also consulted for a debridement after
wound care had indicated that this might be beneficial for this
patient
-the patient refused bedside debridement from the general
surgery team even after and explanation by me that her
osteomyelitis would likely be a recurrent problem unless surgery
was considered.  She said she understood and still refused
.
--Altered mental status:
-This was most likely due to her underlying infection and high
fever, which resolved within hours of presentation after
receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. Her home narcotics and
benzos were initially held but later restarted with preservation
of mental status. She was alert and fully oriented by day 2 of
admission.
-psychiatry was consulted to be sure the patient had decision
making capacity and did not have a mood or personality d
