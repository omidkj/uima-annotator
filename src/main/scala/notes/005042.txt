Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5569**]
Chief Complaint:
Ascites leaking through umblical hernia repair site

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis X1


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o lady with cirrhosis thought to be secondary to
methotrexate, DM, rheumatoid arthritis, presents with increased
ascitic leak through the umlical hernia repair site.  She
underwent umblical hernia repeir on [**2146-9-20**].  Since then she
has had small leak throgh the umblical hernia repair site.
However in the last one week she has noticed increasing leak.
Today she started having very large volume 'gushing' through the
site.  She called her liver clinic who asked her to come to the
hospital.
.
In the ED, initial VS:  T 98, BP 160/38, HR 59, RR 59, RR 18
100% oxygen saturaion on ? RA.  Patient was written for 1L NS in
the ED charts however the verbal signout stated that she did not
recieve it.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is stable but still having
leak.  She denies any fever, chills, sweats, abdominal pain,
N/V, increased diarrhea (other than planned 3xdaily), cold, SOB,
chest pain, headache, change in vision/hearing, weakness,
numbness.  She has had chronic dry cough thought to be secondary
to ascites.  No history of bleeding.
.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, patient was hemodynamically stable
with mild hyponatremia.  She underwent IR guided tap on [**12-25**]
where 3.5L were removed and sent for culture (received Albumin
62.5 grams) On [**12-27**], another 1.5L of fluid was removed and pt
was given albumin 25 grams.  Pt was noted to be spontaneously
draining a large volume of peritoneal fluid on [**12-28**] and
recieved 50 grams of albumin.
.
Today, she is undergoing an echo to evaluate right heart
pressures as part of an evaluation for TIPs.  On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
10, she was reporting cough and bilateral rib pain related to
coughing.  She denied chest pain, SOB, abd pain, N/V but
reported intermittent reflux, HA, low back pain and general
lethargy.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o lady with cirrhosis thought to be secondary to
methotrexate, DM, rheumatoid arthritis, presented with ascitic
fluid (~1-2 L) leaking through umblical hernia repair site
initially but resolved [**1-1**] with diuretics. No evidence of SBP
and cultures taken from ostomy bag over leaking site showing
diptheroids were likely due to contaminants. Cell count from
ostomy bag on [**12-31**] was negative for SBP. Ascites/leak were
managed medically. TIPS was put on hold (patient not
encephalopathic, with normal RUQ ultrasound and ECHO but
elevated TBili, making TIPS procedure more risky). She developed
a cough with likely pneumonia seen on cxr. IV vanco and zosyn
were administered. In addition a cellulitis around the
periumbilical site was noted. This improved with diuresis and iv
antibiotics.

Other problems included development of hepatorenal syndrome. A
repeat Cardiac ECHO showed increased MR ([**1-14**]+ and higher PA
pressures) concerning for worsening fluid overload. She
developed worsening DOE/chronic cough on [**1-3**], felt to be
multifactorial (asthma, gerd, fluid overload).

On [**2147-1-18**], a liver donor from cardiac death became available.
She underwent liver transplant with two JP drains placed.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to operative note for
details. Induction immunosuppression was administered. Postop,
she was transferred to the SICU intubated. Postop liver duplex
demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature. There was some
turbulence and elevated velocity seen within the main portal
vein. A short-term interval followup ultrasound is recommended.
A small amount of perihepatic fluid seen just anterior to the
liver was noted. LFTs continued to improved.  Blood products
were adminitstered. Hematocrit stabilized.  CVVHD was continued
for volume overload until renal function improved with urine
output increasing to ~ 1-1.5 liters/day. She had a brief episode
of bradycardiaasystole when suctioned while on spontaneous
breathing trial. Extubation placed on hold until [**1-23**].  She was
extubated without event. Last CVVHD was done on [**1-26**].

Some bleeding was noted at the medial portion of the incision. A
few staples were removed and a wound vac placed, but this did
not hold suction therefore a dressing was applied.

On [**1-25**], she had a brief episode of afib treated with IV
amiodarone. Cardiology was consulted recommending amiodarone
which was started. She converted back to sinus rhythm. MI was
ruled out. An echo was done noting a wall motion abnormality
possibly related to an old infarct. Aspirin and metoprolol were
recommmended and initiated.

Diet was slowly advanced, but given poor intake, a feeding tube
was placed [**1-24**]. On xray, this was noted to be cur
