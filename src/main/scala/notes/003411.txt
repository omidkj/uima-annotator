Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13685**]
Chief Complaint:
right carotid artery stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-8-16**] - right carotid endovascular stent
[**2112-8-18**] - [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] Distal RCA


History of Present Illness:
67-year-old woman w/ history significant for HTN, HL, b/l
carotid artery stenosis c/b TIA in [**2110-6-26**]. She was noted to
have 70% R-sided CAS, and complete L-sided common carotid artery
occlusion with reversal of flow in the external carotid artery
and reconstitution of the ICA on the left side. She was watched
conservatively, but underwent right-sided carotid endarterectomy
with bovine pericardial patch on [**2111-7-15**] when stenosis
progressed from 70% to 95%. On the most recent duplex performed
in [**2112-7-28**], the right-sided carotid stenosis had progressed to
being estimated at 70-99%, and thus patient underwent placement
of a R carotid artery endovascular stent on [**2112-8-16**]; tolerated
the procedure well, but required neo in the PACU for low blood
pressure. On [**2112-8-17**], as she was lying in bed she had sudden
onset 10/10 chest pain in the substernal area which disappeared
after 5 minutes without any intervnetion. Did not have any
shortness of breath, nausea, voming, diaphoresis. EKG showed
non-specific ST changes otherwirse unchanged from prior EKG.
She had two more similar episodes of chest pain yesterday each
lasting about 5 minutes.  She had troponin leak to 0.13 but her
CK-MB reamined normal.
.
Due to concern for unstable angina, she was taken to the cath
lab today and found to have 1v CAD with diffuse 40% lesion in
mid RCA and 95% lesion in distal RCA.  She then had successful
PTCA/Stent of distal RCA using DES. Procedure was uncomplicated
procedure, LRA with TR band.  In the cath lab her A-Line was
registering 30-40 points lower than central pressure likely from
peripheral vascualr disease.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaohoresis. ankle edema,
palpitations, orthopnea or PND.
.

102.  Chronic cough.  Denies dysuria

Cardiac Cath: [**2112-8-18**]
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed one angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis.
The LMCA was normal. The LAD had minimal irregularity. lcx was a
very small vessel without significant disease. We did left and
right cusp shots to look for an anomalous LCX but none was
found. The RCA had diffuse 40% mid and focal 90% distal lesion.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics showed central aortic pressure
of 141/53
3) Successful PCI of the distal RCA with 3.0x16mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated to 3.5mm (see PTCA comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary disease
2. Successful PCI of the distal RCA with drug-eluting stent.
3. Continue aspirin indefinitely; plavix 75 mg daily for 12
months minimum.
4. Compared to central aortic pressure, the right radial
arterial line was unreliable; recommend weaning vasopressors and
removing arterial line once anticoagulation has worn off.
.
TTE: [**2112-8-18**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No pathologic valvular abnormalities.
.
CXR: [**2112-8-18**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are
mild bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities, partly obscuring
the left and right hemidiaphragmatic contour.  These areas of
parenchymal opacities could represent pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical context.  No relevant other change.  No
evidence of pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.  Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette.

At the time of observation at 10:08, the referring physician,

Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old woman w/ history significant for HTN, HL, b/l
carotid artery stenosis c/b TIA in [**2110-6-26**] s/p stent to right
carotids during this elective admission complained of severe
chest pain concerning for unstable angina.
.
# Unstable Angina: Patient was admitted electively and underwent
right carotid stent placement due to worsening restenosis of her
carotids. She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and
sent to PACU.  On post-operative day 1, she had an episode of
[**10-5**] chest pain that resolved after lying down.  There were no
associated EKG changes, but cardiac enzymes were sent which
showed elevation in troponins therefore cardiology was
consulted.  She had two similar episodes of chest pain each
lasting about 5 minutes and self resolving.  Her Ck-MD remained
stable however her troponins continued to rise.  Due to concern
for unstable angina she was taken to the cath lab w
