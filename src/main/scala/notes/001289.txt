History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with history of renal transplant, CAD, PVD, DM
presenting with marked fatigue, poor appetite, nonproductive
cough and generalized weakness/failure to thrive. He was
admitted to the MICU on [**2113-4-26**], see H/P from that date for
details. He was found to have profound anemia with HCT of 18.7
(baseline high 20s-30s), acute renal failure with creatinine of
5.5 (baseline [**1-29**]), new cerebellar lesion on CT head, and RLL
pneumonia. While in the ICU, he was treated with cefepime,
vancomycin and azithromycin for pneumonia in an immunosuppressed
patient. He developed acute shortness of breath after admission
and evaluation revealed pulmonary edema (though imaging
suggestive of noncardiogenic etiology), and was diuresed. LOS
fluid balance at transfer was approximately negative 800 cc. He
was transfused 3 units of blood, had negative stool guaiacs,
iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease and iron
deficiency, and had negative hemolysis labs (haptglobin 677). He
was started on IV iron supplementation for plan of 8 doses.
Hematocrit at transfer 24.5, and CT torso did not reveal
intra-abdominal source of blood loss. Renal transplant service
followed the patient and his acute renal failure was thought to
be due to dehydration/pre-renal azotemia with ATN. His
creatinine mildly improved after the blood transfusions and some
diuresis to 4.5 at transfer. His rapamycin level was elevated
and his doses were held with plan to restart once <8. Troponin
was elevated at 0.16-0.18, thought to be due to renal failure
and anemia. Lastly, neurology/stroke was consulted regarding the
cerebellar lesion seen on CT scan and his falls at home. His
neuro exam was nonfocal and the lesion was thought to be a
chronic infarct vs. metastases as opposed to an acute lesion.
.
Currently, the patient continues to complain of weakness/fatigue
and generalized feeling "unwell." He feels his breathing is
better, but not baseline. He complains of back pain, leg pain,
neck pain and a headache--all are chronic per him. He is
concerned about having to be transferred in the bed as opposed
to the chair because he cannot lay down comfortably.

TTE [**4-27**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic
function could not be assessed because of significan mitral
valve disease. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are three moderately-thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild non-rheumatic
mitral stenosis.
.
CT abdomen / chest / pelvis
1. Lungs show interlobular septal thickening and bilateral
perihilar alveolar
opacities, which given lack of interstitial abnormality on CT
from [**2113-2-27**], is most suggestive of non cardiogenic pulmonary edema
given normal heart
size and lack of pleural effusion.

2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

3. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.

4. Stable appearance of transplanted kidney within the left
lower quadrant.
No stone, hydronephrosis, or perinephric fluid collection.

5. Bladder wall thickening, which may be secondary to
under-distension;
however, recommend correlation with UA to exclude cystitis.

6. Generalized atrophy of the muscles, especially involving
bilateral
iliopsoas, which may account for patient's lower extremity
weakness.

7. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
branch vessels.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o male with h.o renal transplant in [**2104**], CAD, diastolic
dysfunction, PVD, DM, HTN, severe OA presented to the ED from
home with six weeks of productive cough, nausea, decreased po
intake, generalized weakness.
.
# Failure to thrive / poor PO intake
Poor PO intake / nausea / vomiting initially had a very long
differential, including med toxicity (sirolimus), uremia,
depression, diabetic gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease,
colonic mass, obstruction, and chronic mesenteric ischemia.
EGD, small bowel follow through, and gastric empyting study were
all attempted, but could not be performed given poor room air
saturation (for EGD) and back pain / not tolerating procedure
(when laying flat for SBFT and GE study).  Reglan 5 mg QID was
started emperically; after 3 days his diet improved, and all
nausea / vomiting ceased spontaenously.  Regarding depression,
patient was also started on citalopram and mirtazipine, which he
tolerated well.  The patient did report being sad after learning
about his future right AKA.
.
# Anemia secondary to chronic renal disease
Admission hct was 18.7.  This was considered [**1-28**] to renal
failure.  He was transfused 3 units PRBCs in the MICU.  Stools
were guaiac negative.  On the medical floor his HCT remained
stable, however he was transfused another unit of PRBCs to help
with his generalized weakness.  He received 8 days of IV iron
repletion as well, and was continued on PO iron repletion
thereafter.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/bacterial pnemonia
He was admitted with respiratory distress, secondary to acute on
chronic diastolic CHF.  He was diuresed with IV lasix and
received vancomycin/cefepime / flagyl initially and then
levofloxacin for his RLL infiltrate on CXR.  He diuresed well
and no longer requi
