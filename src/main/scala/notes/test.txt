Admission Date:  [**2173-12-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-12-9**]

Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
gentleman who was transferred from [**Location (un) 47317**] Hospital
with refractory hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension.  Since
back surgery in [**2173-2-5**], patient was reportedly not taking
care of himself and had rapidly gained 60 to 70 pounds.  He
had seen his primary care physician one week prior to
admission.  At that time he was felt to have clear lungs on
exam and received furosemide for edema.  Head CT for
confusion and discoordination was reportedly normal.  He was
admitted to [**Location (un) 47317**] Hospital on [**2173-11-30**],
after being brought in by his wife for progressive dyspnea,
edema, confusion and weight gain.  These symptoms were
approximately 2.5 weeks in duration with acute worsening on
the night of [**11-29**].

In the Caritas-[**Location (un) **] E.D. patient had a peripheral oxygen
saturation of 71% in room air and was treated with nebulizers
and oxygen by nasal cannula.  His peripheral oxygen
saturation was 93% on 3 to 4 liters oxygen by nasal cannula
with arterial blood gas of pH 7.28, PCO2 69, PO2 80.  Chest
x-ray showed massive cardiomegaly with some haziness in the
right base and no definite pulmonary edema.

Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit at
Caritas-[**Location (un) **].  He was given noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation, but regardless, required intubation on the night
of [**11-30**] for worsening respiratory failure.
Ventilation perfusion scan on [**12-1**] showed matched
ventilation perfusion deficit of the right lower lobe
consistent with effusion or elevated hemidiaphragm.  This was
read as intermediate probability for pulmonary embolism and
heparin was started on [**12-2**].  In addition, cardiac
enzymes were cycled and were negative.  Transthoracic echo
showed preserved left ventricular function with dilated and
hypokinetic right ventricle.  Lower extremity venous Dopplers
implied a hypervolemic state, but showed no thrombus.  A
pulmonary catheter was placed on [**12-3**].  This showed a
pulmonary artery pressure of 85/40, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 30, central venous pressure of 40.  Cardiac
output was 13.4.  Systemic vascular resistance 300 to 400.
The procedure was complicated by a small right neck hematoma.
Heparin was eventually discontinued for this reason and for
falling platelets.

Based on these numbers demonstrating high output heart
failure, cirrhosis with portal pulmonary hypertension was
suggested as a diagnosis.  In addition, patient had
refractory hypoxemia despite aggressive diuresis which was
successful and noted by lowering of creatinine from 2.4 to
1.8.  However, this caused no improvement in oxygenation
hemodynamics and BUN continued to rise.  A trial of
dobutamine was stopped for tachycardia with no hemodynamic
improvement.  IV nitroglycerin was started in an attempt to
dilate the pulmonary bed, but this had little effect on his
hemodynamics.

Due to worsening hypoxemia, ventilator settings were changed
to pressure control and patient was paralyzed on [**12-5**].
On [**12-6**] transthoracic echo with bubble study showed no
bubbles crossing the midline arguing against an intracardiac
shunt.  At this point patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Morbid obesity 355 pounds on
admission.  Tobacco abuse two packs per day, quit in [**2173-2-5**].  Alcohol abuse estimated at 20 drinks per day by
family.  Low back surgery in [**2173-2-5**] for work related
injury.  Umbilical herniorrhaphy.  Appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with one daughter and
one son.  [**Name (NI) **] worked in a wine warehouse, but was on
disability due to a back injury.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Question of heart attack in grandfather.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 120/70, pulmonary
pressure 70/30, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21,
central venous pressure 15, cardiac output 40.7, cardiac
index 5.49, stroke volume 210, systemic vascular resistance
300.  Obese, white male, sedated.  Temperature 35.5.  Pupils
equal and reactive.  Lungs sounds decreased throughout.
Heart sounds distant.  Extremities with chronic woody edema.
Abdomen obese, soft with decreased bowel sounds.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white cell count 7.6,
hematocrit 31, platelets 93.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.2,
chloride 94, carbon dioxide 35, BUN 9, creatinine 1.9, blood
glucose 251.  Phosphate 5.3, magnesium 1.7.  Arterial blood
gas pH 7.36, PCO2 68, PO2 50 on pressure control ventilation
with inspiration pressure of 20, positive end expiratory
pressure of 12.5, respiratory rate 14, tidal volume 700,
oxygen saturation 88% on FIO2 1.0 and 85% on FIO2 0.6.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 51 year old white male with pulmonary
hypertension, low systemic vascular resistance, profound
hypoxemia and essentially clear chest x-ray.  Acute hypoxia
in the setting of clear lungs is felt to be due either to
pulmonary vascular disease or intrapulmonary shunting; in
either case due to decompensation with estimated shunt
fraction of 28%, low systemic vascular resistance and high
output state, argue against pulmonary embolism.  Intracardiac
shunting seems unlikely as right sided filling pressures are
less than left sided filling pressures.  Therefore, patient
is felt to have an intrapulmonary shunt due to
hepatopulmonary syndrome or other causes of severe VQ
mismatching in the setting of acute on chronic pulmonary
hypertension.  Refractory hypoxemia is likely worsening
pulmonary hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was weaned off nitroglycerin in
an attempt to decrease shunt fraction.  Positive end
expiratory pressure was increased to 20.  These maneuvers
were initially successful in improving patient's PO2 to near
100; however, patient became progressively hypercarbic and it
was felt that high positive end expiratory pressure was
improving oxygenation, but the consequent necessity to
decrease inspiratory pressure was decreasing ventilation.
Esophageal balloonometry was performed which allowed
optimization of both inspiratory and end expiratory pressure
to attempt to maximize oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's low systemic vascular resistance was noted and
felt to be potentially due to cirrhosis of the liver, but
also possibly due to sepsis.  Patient was covered with
vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam to provide empiric
broad spectrum coverage for potential septicemia.  Both
hepatology and liver transplant services were consulted and
both felt that while hepatopulmonary syndrome or portal
pulmonary hypertension could be responsible for part of
patient's presentation, that patient was, in any case,
contraindicated for a liver transplant due to severe
pulmonary hypertension and morbid obesity.  Therefore, a
search for reversible causes other than hepatic was
undertaken.

Transesophageal echocardiogram with injection of agitated
saline bubbles showed no evidence of intracardiac or
intrapulmonary shunt.  Right pleural effusion was evaluated
with pleural ultrasound and felt to be small and not
interfering with hemodynamic parameters.  Patient was treated
with inhaled nitric oxide with initial marked improvement in
pulmonary blood pressure and oxygenation.  However, these
benefits began to decline within 24 to 48 hours and
oxygenation was only maintained with repeated recruitment
maneuvers and gradually elevating positive end expiratory
pressure to 25 cm of water.

The patient was loaded on digoxin for atrial fibrillation,
but this therapy was then ceased for long sinus pauses.  On
the evening of [**12-8**] and the morning of [**12-9**],
patient's oxygenation subacutely worsened to a peripheral
oxygen saturation of less than 85%.  Maximum ventilatory
support was unsuccessful in improving oxygenation.  Chest
x-ray showed new diffuse lung infiltrates and patient was
felt to have developed adult respiratory distress syndrome.
As patient's oxygenation worsened, his pulmonary hypertension
became more severe and it
