History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60973**] is a 48yoM with a history of alcoholism (previous
DT's), alcoholic cirrhosis (complicated by encephalopathy,
varices, portal gastropathy), biliary stenosis s/p numerous
ERCP/stents, ulcerative colitis who is being directly admitted
to [**Wardname 13487**] due lkikely hepatic encephalopathy.

He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU [**Date range (1) 51549**] with
coffee-ground emesis though his EGD at OSH revealed nonbleeding
varices and evidence of portal gastropathy. He underwent ERCP at
[**Hospital1 18**] because there was bleeding noted from a prior CBD stent,
which was retrieved and replaced.  A ampullary stricture was
noted and plans were made to readdress with sphinchterotomy in a
month. During this procedure, 5 cords of grade II esophageal
varices were banded.  He was rapidly discharged back to [**Hospital 7912**] due to stability of his hemodynamics and
hemoglobin.

Prior to the aforementioned episode, patient was admitted
[**2075-7-11**] to an OSH with hepatic encephalopathy complicated by
alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens requiring lorazepam gtt.
 Previous [**Hospital1 18**] notes suggest OSH admissions for encephalopathy
also occured in [**5-/2163**] and 6/[**2162**].

Today, patient came for ERCP because of biliary stricture and
dilated CBD previously stented 3-4 times. Found to be confused,
and thought to be encephalopathic. Unable to ascertain how much
medications patient was taking. Exam was notable for afebrile,
BP 90-100/50-60, swollen legs, and mildly distended abdomen.
Procedure held because of encephalopathy, and eventually will
likely return for procedure. Low suspicion for biliary
obstruction per GI.

Of note, there has been ongoing concern among providers re.
medication compliance, and patient has habit of not going to
appoinments.  We called the CVS in [**Location (un) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 90261**]) to
check medications.  They said patient has NOT filled his
rifaximin or lactulose since [**Month (only) **], while he has filled all of
his other medications as of [**Month (only) 462**]. He lives alone although
often has girlfriend [**Name (NI) 1785**] (HCP) by however has support from
his brother and mother.

ROS otherwise notable for alcohol use.  Patient says his last
drink was Friday, when he had 6 drinks.  Perhaps not most
reliable historian, but says he does not drink every day, but
every few days.  Denies recent drug use, new medications, or
medication changes.  Also for some coughing with brown sputum
production, although unclear how frequently. Also complains of
abdominal pain primarily in the middle of the abdomen. Patient
believes he is in the hospital because of his leg pain, [**12-30**]
chronic neuropathy.

ROS: per HPI, denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, shortness
of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

PERTINENT RESULTS:
CXR [**9-20**]
In comparison with study of [**8-2**], there are lower lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, though no evidence of
acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion. The Dobbhoff tube
has been removed

PERITONEAL FLUID CYTOLOGY [**9-21**]
Peritoneal fluid:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Mesothelial cells, histiocytes and inflammatory cells.

ABD U/S [**9-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Coarse and echogenic liver with multiple hypoechoic regions
scattered throughout the liver corresponding to areas of
hypodensity seen on today's noncontrast CT scan highly
concerning for a widespread neoplastic process.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI study is recommended for
further characterization of these lesions. Correlation with
alpha-fetoprotein levels might also prove useful.
2. Diffusely coarse and echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration and history of alcoholic cirrhosis.
3. Heterogeneous echogenic material within the main portal vein
raises possibility for nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis.
4. Moderate-to-large ascites.

CT ABD [**9-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous appearance of liver could be related to
malignancy,
infectious process or cirrhosis. Recommend ultrasound to better
evaluate if the patient cannot get a contrast-enhanced CT.
2. Marked ascites with no evidence of hemorrhage.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
4. Right middle lobe patchy ground-glass opacities, likely
infectious versus inflammatory.
5. Splenomegaly.
6. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

CT HEAD [**9-21**]
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or edema. Global atrophy, more
prominent in the frontal lobes bilaterally, likely related to
chronic alcohol abuse.

CXR [**9-23**]:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**9-22**], there is mild
increase in
opacification at the right base, consistent with the CT
diagnosis of right lower lung pneumonia.  Less prominent changes
are also seen at the left base.  This suggests that there may be
some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure adding to the
overall pattern.  There is a dense streak of atelectasis seen at
the left b
