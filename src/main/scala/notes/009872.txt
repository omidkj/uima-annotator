Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
 53M history of morbid obesity, achondroplasia, obstructive
sleep apnea, quadriplegia short stature, with a a history of
acute hypercarbic respiratory failure in [**2133**], [**2134**] requiring
tracheostomy, as well as several episodes of pnemonia, cames to
the ED with shortness of breath today.

Per ED report, he came in today having worsening SOB, trouble
breathing, but no cough or fever.
.
Per family report, patient has been not himself for the past few
days, occasionally confused, short of breath, and weak.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.1 HR 100 BP 199/104 RR 20 93% on
2L.
.
Came in with mild temp of 99.1, intially on nasal cannula, with
saturations in to low 90s, at which point he was switched to
NRB, and while in ED started getting increasingly somnolent,
tiring out. At this point ED got initial ABG was VBG, repeat
showed hypercarbia, with decreased O2sat. Given this, did a
quick bronchoscopy - was intubated via right nare size 7. while
in ED given Levo, Vanc, CTX - for CXR likely RML PNA, per ED
read.
.
Prior to transfer  Satting 99% on Vent - not hard to ventilate.
BP 140/90, Tachy to 110. Then, became hypotensive after
intubation while on propofol into 70s, he was also on high PEEP
(10) at that time. He had a right groin line put in, and was
started on Levo.
Prior to transfer, his vent settings wer TV 450, fI02 48% PEEP
10.
.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated, sedated. While
attempting to move him to the right side, he desatted, but
recovered when lying flat on his back. His initial vitals were
HR 86, BP 119/63, 97%. He was not on pressors, but was sedated.

[**2137-1-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with congestive
heart failure and concerning for concurrent infection in the
right upper and lower lobes. Lentiform opacity in the left base
could be further evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral
radiographs when the patient is able; it is suspected to
represent a fat pad but it is difficult to exclude a loculated
pleural effusion based only on this image.

Notable Studies:
[**2137-1-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**7-1**] through
[**1-12**]:
There is a large right pleural effusion layering posteriorly
obscuring much of the right lung, but there is a suggestion of
some improvement in consolidation today compared to [**1-10**].
The left upper lung, as a measure of pulmonary edema since it is
not obscured by pleural effusion shows some improvement.
Consolidation at the left base is still substantial, and the
heart is chronically very enlarged. No pneumothorax.
[**2137-1-14**] Bilateral LE Venous Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Limited
examination, but no evidence of DVT in right or left lower
extremity.
[**2137-1-15**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: As compared to [**2136-7-1**],
bilateral pleural effusions of overall small-to-moderate extent
have newly appeared. As a consequence, there are areas of
atelectasis at both lung bases, right more than left as well as
in the left lung apex. Unchanged triangular mid lobe nodule. No
evidence of empyema or abscess. Extensive respiratory motion
artifacts. Borderline diameter of the pulmonary
artery. No other mediastinal abnormalities. Degenerative bone
disease.

[**1-14**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: Limited examination, but no evidence of
DVT in right or left lower extremity

[**1-17**] Chest CT with contrast: IMPRESSION: As compared to [**2136-7-1**], bilateral pleural effusions of overall small-to-moderate
extent have newly appeared. As a consequence, there are areas of
atelectasis at both lung bases, right more than left as well as
in the left lung apex.

Unchanged triangular mid lobe nodule. No evidence of empyema or
abscess.

Extensive respiratory motion artifacts. Borderline diameter of

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 52 year old man with achondroplasia, morbid
obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary
hypertension and right heart failure, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension admitted with respiratory failure and MSSA
pneumonia.
.
#Respiratory Failure/Methicillin sensitive staph aureus
pneumonia/Fever/Pulmonary Hypertension/Right heart failure:
The patient was found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure
on presentation to the ED and was intubated via his right nare.
His CXR showed pneumonia and an intubated sputum culture grew
MSSA. He was treated with Vancomycin given his allergies to
cephalosporins and penicillins (including anaphylaxis) and
diuresed for volume overload in the setting of right heart
failure. He was extubated and improved clinically but had
persistent fevers which resolved over 3 days with a downtrending
fever curve each d
