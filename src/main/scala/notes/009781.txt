Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement [**2168-9-16**].


History of Present Illness:
81 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with multiple medical problems
including [**Name2 (NI) **] palsy, mild mental retardation, who was
admitted to [**Hospital 883**] Hospital in [**Month (only) 205**] and treated for urosepsis
and a possible infectious eneterococcal endocarditis.  She was
treated for these and was doing well at her group home until [**9-7**]
when she developed shortness of breath and tachypnea.
.
Of note, regarding her previous admission: she was admitted to
[**Hospital 883**] Hospital from [**2168-7-15**] to [**2168-7-31**] for a urosepsis and
infectious endocarditis. She presented hypotensive, T 100.1,
minimally interactive and somewhat ill-appearing, and was given
IV ceftriaxone 1gm in the ED.  She was empirically started on
vancomycin/ceftazidime and quickly defervesced (temp in [**Name (NI) **]
unclear in d/c summary, but may be 100.1).  Blood and urine
cultures were sent. Urine cultures grew pseudomonas and 2
klebsiella colonies, sensitive to ciprofloxacin. 2/2 blood
cultures on day of admission grew Enterococcus faecalis,
sensitive to ampicillin.  One subsequent blood culture had no
growth.  TTE was performed and showed tricuspid regurgitation
(2+) and mitral regurgitation (1+) with a small, mobile mass on
the TV c/w a torn cordae vs small vegetation. Because IV access
was difficult to obtain (picc failed, hickman placement failed),
the patient was started on oral ampicillin for enterococcal
infectious endocarditis, which was to be complete a 5 week
course of antibiotiocs (to [**2168-8-22**]), 500mg po qid. She also
completed 1 week of IV antibiotics (vanco?) while in house.
Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was to be continued until [**2168-7-31**] for
her UTI (a 14 day course).  She should have had f/up with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 233**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 102804**] (ID) at FH on [**8-24**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was afebrile but tachypneic and
tachycardic. T 99.0 HR 104 BP 148/67 RR 33 O2sat 96% on 2L.  ECG
showed atrial flutter/fibrillation, right bundle branch block,
and new inconsistent ST depression in V3.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg
was given (nursing record).  She was deemed to be in CHF based
on an elevated BNP ([**Numeric Identifier 16351**]) and elevated JVP (known TR).  She
improved with lasix and diuresis.  Her aflutter improved with
lopressor.

ECG Study Date of [**2168-9-7**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Right
bundle-branch
block. Possible left posterior hemiblock. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2167-7-29**] rapid atrial fibrillation is new.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-9-7**] 4:03 PM
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Mild respiratory motion somewhat limits the
evaluation.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There are bilateral Kerley B
lines and
perihilar haziness which represents mild CHF. Left lower lobe
atelectasis is noted. The lungs are otherwise clear without
evidence of consolidation,
effusion, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2168-9-8**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized (1.3 x
0.8 cm) vegetation on the anterior tricuspid leaflet. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Tricuspid valve vegetation. Mild symmetric LVH with
preserved systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with
preserved systolic function. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2163-7-22**], tricuspid vegetation, tricuspid and
mitral regurgitation are all new.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-9-14**]
IMPRESSION:
Heart is persistently enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity
appears engorged. Bilateral interstitial opacities likely
reflect interstitial edema. Increasing focus of airspac
