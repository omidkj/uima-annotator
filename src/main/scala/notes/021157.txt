Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo woman DNR/DNI w/ h/o diastolic dysfunction, severe pulm
htn,  recent AFIB, GIB [**2-15**] polyps and diverticulosis who was
recently here with hypotension in setting of c. diff colitis and
UTI returns within hours of discharge with BRBPR/guiac positive
stools, HCT drop of 6 points, hypotension and hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  Patient is in shock from either sepsis or
GI bleed, or both.

Attempts were initially made to volume rescucitate the patient
with IVFs and PRBCs.  GI was consulted and she was made NPO,
began PPI [**Hospital1 **], serial HCTs checks started, and IV flagyl given
for h/o c. difficile. (Also started on levo/ceftaz for likely
sepsis). Source was thought to be likely lower GI since NGL was
negative and most concerned about possible diverticulosis or
colitis (either C.Diff or ischemic).  Plan was to perform flex
sig when patient off bipap and more stable.  She required
pressors for hypotension and bipap for hypoxia/hpercarbia and
remained minimally responsive to stimulation.  The pulmonary
fellow discussed her case with her daughter and plan was to make
her comfortable and to no longer to pursue aggressive measures.
Patient expired at 3:20 pm and autopsy was declined. ME made
aware of case since expired within 24 hours of admission and
case was waived.
