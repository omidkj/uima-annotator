Admission Date:  [**2109-1-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2109-3-7**]


Service:Medicine
This is a continuation of previous discharge summary that was
started by the neurology team upon his readmission on
[**2109-1-11**].  The patient was transferred to the Medicine
service on [**2109-2-26**].  The present summary reflects the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course since transfer to the Medicine
service from the Neurology service on [**2109-2-26**].Pt was
transferred for acute renal failure.

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had episodes of shortness of
breath consistent with congestive heart failure.  The goal of
keeping systolic blood pressure above 150 to maintain
cerebral perfusion unfortunately resulted in myocardial
ischemia secondary to increased oxygen demand causing rise in
by cardiology who recommended medical management given the
patient's comorbidities, his ongoing urinary tract infection,
and acute renal failure.  It was thought that cardiac
catheterization for the management of the patient was
severely limited secondary to his poor general medical status
and high likelihood that his multivessel coronary artery
disease would not be amenable to what would be an otherwise
very high risk intervention.  The patient was continued on
Lopressorand nitrates and Hydralazine was started to decrease
oxygen demand and
reduce afterload respectively, again keeping in mind that his
systolic blood pressure had to be above 150.

2.  Renal - The patient's renal function continued to decline
throughout the course of his stay in the hospital.
Initially, it was thought that his acute renal failure was
secondary to his congestive heart failure leading to prerenal
azotemia.  However, his FENA was greater than 1% and it was
thought that his acute renal failure was intrinsic in nature.
The etiology of his renal failure was thought to be secondary
to cholesterol emboli as he was noted to have livedo of legs with
several purple toes consistent with this diagnosis. Theurine
sediment was failry bland.The patient was followed by the renal
team throughout the course of his stay in the hospital.  All
his medications were renally dosed.  The patient was
initially hydrated with intravenous fluids to perfuse his
kidneys, however, this exacerbated his congestive heart
failure and he needed diuresis with Lasix for respiratory
comfort.  The intravenous fluids were discontinued.  The
patient received free water boluses through his gastrostomy
tube in light of his hypernatremia which corrected.  At that
point, the free water boluses were discontinued.
The renal team did not feel the pt was a hemodialysis candidate
due to his comorbid disease and the high risks associated with
HD.
3.  Infectious disease - The patient's urine grew pseudomonas
aeruginosa which was pansensitive.  The patient was continued
on Levofloxacin for treatment of his urinary tract infection.
Additionally, the patient's chest x-ray showed evidence of
possible aspiration pneumonia.  In light of urinary tract
infection and aspiration pneumonia, the patient was treated
with Levofloxacin and Flagyl which were renally dosed.  The
patient remained afebrile throughout the course of his stay
in the hospital.

4.  Neurologic - The patient's neurological status remained
unchanged throughout the course of his stay in the hospital.
The patient continued to have right sided hemiparesis from
his left pontine stroke.  His head of bed was raised by five
degrees every day, at the same time making sure that he did
not develop any left sided weakness.  The patient did not
develop any left sided weakness during the course of his stay
in the hospital.  The patient's head of bed was raised to a
maximum of fifteen degrees.

5.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit decreased
throughout the course of his stay in the hospital. His stools
were guaiac positive.  It was thought that the patient's drop
in hematocrit was secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed.  The
patient was transfused one unit packed red blood cells on one
occasion.These changes were noted in setting of supratherapeutic
INR. The patient was continued on Coumadin for
anticoagulation.  The Coumadin had to be held several days
given high INR levels.  At the time of discharge, the
patient's INR was above 3.0 and his Coumadin was being held.
His primary care physician was to reevaluate his INR and
readjust Coumadin dosing.  The patient was ruled out for DIC
as evidenced by high fibrinogen level and normal D-dimer
level.Pt never had melena, c/o abdominal pain or hemodynamic
instability.
6. RUE edema noted on day prior to discharge. ?possible UE dvt
but pt on anticoagualtion. u/s done on day of discharge, results
pending at this time. Likely only able to suggeset trying to get
pt on left side more with right arm elevated if possible.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post left pontine stroke c/b expressive aphasia and
right hemiparesis. Basilar artery stenosis.
2.  Congestive heart failure wtih EF 35%.
3.  Acute renal failure likely due to cholesterol emboli
4. CAD with intermittent ischemia
5. GI bleed

gastrostomy tube q.o.d. HOLD until INR down to low 2 range. Goal
INR [**3-10**]. Consider decrease dose to 7.5 PO qd although pt was
stable on these higher doses earlier in admission.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Guarded.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  After several family meetings with
the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and family members, as well
as medicine and consult services, and case manager, it was
decided that the family will take the patient home with
Hospice care in light of poor prognosis and as per pt's wishes.
Case to be managed by his PCP- [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7474**] in [**Location (un) 12415**] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37466**]  fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37467**]. I discussed the case iwth Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7474**] on the day prior to discharge. Of note, pt's family has
wanted pt to be full code. They are still considering whether to
change this at the time of discharge. Issue to be discussed
further between pt's PCP and the [**Name9 (PRE) 37468**] program.
