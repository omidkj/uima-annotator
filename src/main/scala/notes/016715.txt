History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3866**] is a 39 F with widely metastatic melanoma first
diagnosed in [**11/2195**] after undergoing a biopsy of a nevus that
had changed in appearance and had become pruritic and prone to
bleeding. Pathology revealed nodular-type melanoma, invasive to
a depth of at least 4.6 mm, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level at least 4, extending
to the deep and lateral resection margins with ulceration
present at 8 mm. There was involvement of a sentinel lymph node
with extracapsular extension. On [**2195-11-23**], she underwent
pulmonary wedge resection of a metastatic nodule. In [**12/2195**],
she was started on a clinical trial of sorafenib. Her CT scan on
[**2196-10-17**] revealed enlargement of
several pulmonary masses and a right infrahilar azygoesophageal

mass. Additionally, she was found to have multiple brain
metastases measuring up to 2 cm. She underwent whole brain
radiation, which she completed on [**2196-12-23**]. On [**1-4**], she
started on daily Temodar but after 6 weeks of therapy she was
found to have widely progressive disease. She then elected to
undergo IL2 for her metastatic disease. Her last dose of IL2 was
yesterday ([**5-18**]) at 7 AM. Today is day 5 of cycle 1 of IL2. The
team elected to discontinue infusion because of hypoxia and
acute renal failure. The patient grew progressively more
tachypneic and hypoxic, prompting admission to the ICU. Upon
arrival at ICU, it was noted that her PO2 was 62% and the
patient's O2 sats were falling to 80's on nonrebreather. The
patient agreed to intubation, which proceded immediately.
.
ROS: denies sick contacts, admits to nonproductive cough x 2
weeks. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or headache, but
admits to nonbloody diarrhea.


Past Medical History:

Social History:

who is in good health.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-26**] 11:13 AM
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. There are numerous
intracranial metastases which are better demonstrated on the
[**2197-4-26**], MRI. Please refer to that report for description
of the metastatic disease. Please note that a non-contrast head
CT is insensitive to the detection of metastatic disease,
abscesses, and vascular anomalies.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Limited exam due to lack
of IV contrast. Numerous intracranial metastases as demonstrated
on the [**2197-4-26**], MRI.

There is asymmetry of the nasopharyngeal tissues with prominence
on the right. This is a nonspecific finding which could possibly
relate to the presence of soft tissue metastases. Please
correlate with direct visualization.
.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-26**] 11:14 AM
Comparison is made with prior MRI from [**2197-4-26**]. There is
opacification of left sphenoid and bilateral posterior ethmoid
air cells with aerosolized secretions and fluid level.
Secretions are also seen in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx.
The remaining sinuses are clear. There is asymmetric prominence
of the right nasopharynx with respect to the left, clinical
correlation is advised. Bilateral ostiomeatal complexes are
patent.
No bony dehiscense.

IMPRESSION:
Mild sinusitis as above.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST
A right axillary node measures 15 mm in short axis diameter and
appears new. Limited non-contrast evaluation of right hilar
lymphadenopathy demonstrates that the node designated as target
lesion #1 measures approximately 43 x 26 mm (previously 35 x 24
mm). Nodal lesion 6 measures approximately 48 x 32 mm
(previously 45 x 35 mm). Adjacent target lesions 2 and 3 cannot
be adequately measured on this non- contrast study but may have
also slightly increased in size compared to [**2197-4-6**]. Left
hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 1.8 cm in short axis diameter
are again noted. There is no evidence of pericardial or pleural
effusion.

There has been progression in size and number of multiple
diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases. A right middle lobe lung
nodule in series 2, image 33 measures 4.2 x 3.9 cm compared to
previous when it measured 3.7 x 3.5 cm. Parenchymal
consolidation at the lung bases likely represents atelectasis,
however, a superimposed infectious process cannot be completely
excluded.

Endotraheal tube terminates approximately 5cm above the carina.
Tip of NG tube is present within the stomach. Right central
venous catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Limited evaluation of the
abdomen without contrast does not adequately evaluate the
numerous liver and splenic metastatic lesions. The pancreas and
right adrenal gland appear unremarkable. A left adrenal lesion
designated lesion 5 measures 38 x 26 mm compared to prior when
it measured 36 x 28 mm. Non-contrast evaluation of the kidneys
again reveals a soft tissue mass near the mid pole of the right
kidney posteriorly, which does not demonstrate any gross change
in size. There is no evidence of free air. Multiple mesenteric
lymph nodes are again identified, some of which measure up to 15
mm and appear larger compared to [**2197-4-6**]. Non-contrast
evaluation of large and small bowel is unremarkable. Note is
made of diffuse anasarca.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid are
unremarkable. Moderate free fluid is present in the pelvis and
is new compared to [**Month (only) 958**]. A left external iliac lymph node
measures 1.8 cm in short axis diameter compared to [**Month (only) 958**] when it
measured 15 mm.

Multiple scattered subcutaneous soft tissue densities have
increased in size including a 10- mm one anteriorly (2: 75) and
11-mm periumbilical one (2: 89). A left breast nodule measures
18 x 17 mm, unchanged.

Osseous structures reveal increased sclerosis around the SI
joints bilaterally likely representing sacroileitis. A small
adjacent right sacral bone island is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited non-contrast evaluation demonstrates progression of
metastatic disease with increased pulmonary tumor burden and
increase in size of multiple lymph node groups as described.
Hepatic and splenic tumor burden not adequately evaluated. Left
adrenal and right renal soft tissue lesions as described.
2. New anasarca and free pelvic fluid.
