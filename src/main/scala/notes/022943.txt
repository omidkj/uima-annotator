Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-14**] Aortic valve replacement ([**Street Address(2) 11688**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Epic
valve), Bronchoscopy, Subtotal resection of right paratracheal
mass

History of Present Illness:
This gentleman has a past medical history of Lymphoblastic
lymphoma with radiation, high-dose chemotherapy and autologous
stem cell rescue in 3/[**2190**]. He has remained in remission since
that time. He also has a history of a heart murmur and underwent
his initial echocardiogram back in [**2187**] where he was found to
have aortic stenosis. He is followed with surveillance
echocardiograms and his most recent study was on [**2197-6-27**] after he
reported episodes of dyspnea. He was found to have severe
concentric LVH, his overall left ventricular systolic
dysfunction was normal and his EF was 55-60%. He had mild AR and
severe AS. His peak aortic valve gradient was 104 mmHg, mean
gradient was 59 mmHg and the aortic valve area was 0.57 cm2. He
had mild MR, and mild pulmonary HTN with PASP 34 + 5 mmHg
assuming his RV pressure was normal. In regards to symptoms his
wife began noticing her husband having shortness of breath about
one year ago. Initially they attributed it to his COPD and then
some weight gain. She reports the dyspnea on exertion has
progressively worsened over the last 6 months. Now is short of
breath with one flight of stairs. In the interim since first
evaluation with us on [**7-6**], he has had a bone marrow aspirate
done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and PET scanning by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Pertinent Results:
[**8-14**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine. A
well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 17
mmHg). Trace central aortic regurgitation is seen ( normal for
this prosthesis) Biventrciular function is normal. Aorta is
intact post decannulation. Other findings are unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-14**] he was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent a Aortic valve replacement,
Bronchoscopy, and subtotal resection of right paratracheal mass.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-operative day one he was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced intermittant self limitinbg atrial
fibrillation and flutter - lopressor was increased and remained
in NSR. Cleared stage V [**Hospital 23261**] rehab with physical therapy and
was discharged to home on POD# 5 w/ VNA.
