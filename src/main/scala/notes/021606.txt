Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST: [**2130-3-21**]

REASON FOR EXAM: Pre-op evaluation Bentall procedure, MVR.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest was acquired
without IV
contrast. 5, 1.25 mm collimation images, sagittal and coronal
reformations
were provided and reviewed.

FINDINGS: The ascending aorta measures 52 x 53 mm, is associated
with a very
dense calcification of the aortic valve. Minimal calcification
is in the
mitral annulus. There is mild cardiomegaly. Enlarged medistinal
lymph nodes
located throughout the mediastinum measure up to 12 mm in the
pretracheal
station. A conglomerate of lymph nodes in the left lower
paratracheal station
measures 15 mm. Precarinal lymph node measures 13 mm. Evaluation
of right
hilar lymphadenopathy is limited due to the lack of IV contrast.
The
subcarinal lymph nodes have small calcifications within. There
is no
pericardial effusion. Moderate right and small left layering
pleural
effusions are non-hemorrhagic. Multifocal areas of ground-glass
opacities in
both lungs are more extensive in the lingula, are associated
with small
peribronchial dense consolidation and a small area in the
posterior segment
left upper lobe and a larger area in the basal segments of the
left lower
lobe. There is minimal reticular abnormality in the periphery of
the upper
lobes bilaterally. Interstitial abnormality in the lower lobes
if present is
obscured by the pleural effusions.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. Of note
there is a very dense calcification in the proximal SMA.

There are no bone findings of malignancy. Old fractures are in
left fifth and
sixth ribs. There is an old fracture in the left clavicle.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal infectious process.

Dense aortic valve calcifications.

The dilated ascending aorta measures 52 x 53 mm.

Dense calcification of the proximal SMA.

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male who transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] Hopsital with known
aortic stenosis and CHF. Recent URI on Z-pack. admitted to the
CVICU for tacycardia. Rate control was achieved and Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
was transferred to the step down unit. Chest CT was done to
evaluate aortic anatomy and multifocal infectious process was
noted. He was discharged to home on 10day course of levaquin.
Pre-op cardiac work-up was completed-carotids-benign, dental
clearance and surgical consent obtained. Scheduled for
Bentall/?MVR on [**2130-4-4**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Will return on [**3-28**] to
have repeat follow CXR prior to surgery and anesthesia consent.
