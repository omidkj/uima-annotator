[**2184-5-15**] Radiologic Studies
CT C-SPINE: There is visualization of the skull base through T1.
There is no evidence of acute fracture. However, anterior
splaying of the intervertebral disc space at the C6-7 level is
concerning for ligamentous injury. There is no
spondylolisthesis. There is no paravertebral hematoma seen.

Multilevel degenerative changes are seen. There is mild
narrowing of the spinal canal due to posterior osteophytes at
the C5-6 level and also due to disc osteophyte complex at the
C7-T1 level. Uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet hypertrophy
cause severe narrowing of the right neural foramen at the C4-5
level. Uncovertebral hypertrophy causes moderate bilateral
neural foramen narrowing at the C5-6 level. Uncovertebral and
facet joint hypertrophy cause severe neural foraminal narrowing
at the C6-7 level.

CT HEAD: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Hypodensity in
subcortical and periventricular white matter in right
occipital/parietal region may represent chronic small vessel
ischemia. MR may be performed for more sensitive evaluation of
acute infarct if of clinical concern.

CTA head/neck: Bilateral partially calcified plaques at carotid
bifurcations, with at least 50% stenosis on the right. Left
vertebral artery dominant, with intermittent flow seen in
diminuitive right vertebral. Intracranial arteries patent; small
basilar with patent PComs bilaterally. 3D reformats pending.
Scattered rounded pulmonary opacities and atelectasis. Anterior
splaying of C5-6. ETT/NGT. Ethmoid mucosal thickening & fluid in
nasopharynx.

CT Torso:
1. Multifocal pulmonary opacities concerning for multifocal
pneumonia, although there is also likely a component of
aspiration. Atelectasis involving right upper and bilateral
lower lobes. ETT slightly low.
2. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology. Colonic
diverticula, without evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2184-5-16**] Radiologic Studies
MR/MRA brain:
1. A small subcentimeter focus of increased signal on the
diffusion-weighted image, which may represent a small acute
infarct versus T2 shine-through artifact. As this is not
definitely identifiable on other sequences, a followup study,
can be considered to assess stability of this finding and
confirming its nature.

2. Very small caliber of the distal vertebral and basilar
arteries, which is grossly unchanged since [**2184-5-15**]. Prominent
posterior communicating arteries, supplying the posterior
circulation. This appearance may relate to atherosclerotic
disease, as described previously.

MR C spine:
The axial GRE sequence is limited due to motion artifacts.
However, confirming the findings of the recent CT of the
cervical spine, there is widening of the disc space anteriorly
at the level of C6-C7 with disruption of the anterior
longitudinal ligament, anterior disc herniation with increased
signal within the disc, which can relate to edema. In addition,
there is also evidence of injury to the anterior longitudinal
ligament at the level of C5-6 with widening of the disc space
anteriorly with increased signal of the disc, representing
edema. There is also diffuse disc bulge with posterior central
disc extrusion with superior migration. Theposterior
longitudinal ligament is displaced anteriorly and has some
increased signal within which can relate to edema or injury.
There is effacement of the ventral thecal sac at this level,
with moderate- severe compression on the cord. There is
increased signal within the cord extending from the level of C4
to C7 from cord edema versus contusion. This linear focus of
increased signal noted posterior to the C5 body ([**4-1**]) can
represent small edpidural hematoma.

At C2-3, small central focal disc protrusion is noted.

At C3-4 moderate-sized central disc extrusion is noted causing
mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac.

At C4-5, there is posterior spondylotic ridge with uncovertebral
osteophyte causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal side
and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. At C4-5, there is also
increased signal in the disc, with anterior disc herniation and
possible injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament at this
level as well.

At C7-T1, the disc space is grossly unremarkable but not
adequately assessed due to artifacts on the axial sequences.

There is moderate amount of increased signal in the prevertebral
soft tissues, representing edema versus hemorrhagic contusion.

On the STIR sequence, there is also increased signal in the
interspinous and the posterior spinous soft tissue at the level
of C5 and C6, representing possible edema or injury to the
interspinous and supraspinous ligaments (series 5, image 10).
Patient is intubated, with increased signal from fluid in the
sphenoid and the maxillary sinuses.

In the left lobe of the thyroid, there are areas of increased
signal intensity seen on the sagittal T2 (series 5, image 10;
series 6, image 27), which represent cysts or adenoma, not
adequately assessed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially admitted to MICU for critical care
support.
Pt was evaluated by Ortho Spine service (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] and
underwent

[**2184-5-17**] 1. Fusion C4-C7.
        2. Anterior diskectomies at C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7.
        3. Anterior instrumentation C4-C7.
        4. Structural allograft.

[**2184-5-18**] 1. Total laminectomy of C4, 5, 6 and 7.
        2. Fusion C4-C7.
        3. Posterior instrumentation C4-7.
        4. Autograft.
<please see op report for details>

Given his neurologic deficit due to C5 spinal cord injury, he
underwent

[**2184-5-19**] 1. Tracheostomy. (#8 perfit, cuffed, non-fenestrated)
        2. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
        3. Placement of inferior vena cava filter. (Bard G2)

Pt was trasferred to Trauma Service/TSICU for postop care and
vent support. He continued on heparin 5000 units SC TID.
