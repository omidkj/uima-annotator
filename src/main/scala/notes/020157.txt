Chief Complaint:
severe anemia, supertherautic INR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R femoral central line

History of Present Illness:
53 yo f with PMH significant for CAD (LAD 60-70%) with AVR (St.
Jude's valve), for hx endocarditis, h/o mitral valve
endocarditis now with 4+ MR, PVD, Hepatitis C and a history of
GIB presents with 4 days of lethergy, SOB, and chest pain which
has been intermittant for many months. She was in her USOH until
a few weeks ago when per OMR notes, she was beginning to feel
fatigued, SOB, and chest pain. She r/o for an MI in [**Month (only) 1096**] and
had a stress with fixed defects. The pt was seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**12-24**] with the same complaints, lethergy, SOB and chest pain. At
that time she was guaiac negative. Her HCT on [**12-1**] was 35, [**12-24**]
was 24, and on admission was 17.
She denies taking any over the counter, prescription, or illicit
medications. She has not changed her diet. Denies melena, BRBPR,
hematemesis, or bleeding of any kind. She has been feeling
lightheaded. She has had nausea and anorexia. Her chest pain is
dull, left sided, and not associated with exertion. It is
relieved by rubbing. No changes in coumadin dose.
Today she went to clinic where she had her PT/INR and HCT
checked. She had been on lovenox over the weekend because her
Friday INR was high??. The monitor in clinic could not read her
HCT, indicating that it was low. In the ED she was 99.1, 128/60,
18, 99% RA. Her BP dropped to the 80's briefly but came up with
volume. Labs showed that she had a HCT of 17 nad INR of 8. She
was given PRBC 2units, 4 liters of NS, FFP 2 units, Vit K 2.5
SC, Protonix 40 IV, Hydrocort 100 IV, maalox, and anzemet. She
refused an NG lavage and did not want to speak with the GI fellw
saying that she would not want an endoscopy or colonoscopy. She
also refused a foley.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-12-27**] 7:49 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with chest pain, anemia, crackles on exam
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PNA
INDICATION: Chest pain, anemia and crackles on exam. Evaluate
for pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2145-11-22**].

UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post median sternotomy.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is upper zone vascular
redistribution and perihilar haze consistent with mild
congestive heart failure. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with h/o with CAD, AVR secondary to endocarditis,
Hepatitis C and a history of GIB admitted with severe anemia,
supertherapuritc INR, and chest pain.

1. Anemia: Pt has a history of recurrent GI bleeds of unclear
etiology.  She was guaiac positive during this admission,
although her stool remained brown.  She had a Hct of 17 and INR
of 8, but she had no evidence of RP bleed, ICH, etc.  She was
also ruled out for an MI.  She received a total of 5 units pRBC,
and her Hct subsequently remained stable.  Pt refused a gastric
lavage, and she required pursuasion to undergo any other
work-up.  She did, however, agree to capsule endoscopy.  The
results of this study were pending at the time of discharge.  Of
note, she had a very similar admission one year ago ([**12-23**])
during which she left AMA without intervention.  It was thought
that pt likely had GIB in setting of elevated INR, in addition
to having low grade hemolysis.  At time of discharge, Hct was
36, and she appeared hemodynamically stable.  She was provided
with home services, as well as follow-up within 2 weeks.  She is
to f/u with both PCP and GI.

2. Coagulopathy:  Pt has been taking coumadin for her AVR; also,
she had been taking lovenox in the days prior to admission.  It
was unclear why she was supratherapeutic with INR of 8, but pt
may have confused the coumadin dosing. She was reversed with FFP
and vit K with good effect.  Coumadin was restarted shortly
after admission, and she was bridged with a heparin drip while
waiting for INR levels to be therapeutic.  However, given that
she received multiple doses of vitamin K at admission, it was
difficult to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.  After
consulting with Dr. [**Name (NI) 437**], pt's cardiologist, felt that it was
acceptable to use lovenox for bridge therapy.  Both she and her
mother (with whom she lives) have used lovenox in the past, and
they were taught once again, prior to discharge.  Pt will be
followed up in the [**Hospital3 **].

3. Hypotension: Patient's normal baseline BP is in the 90's -
100's systolic. She was hypotensive to the 70s in th
