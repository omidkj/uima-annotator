Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath

AVR with 19 mm CE magna pericardial valve [**2191-8-16**]
Cardiac Catherization [**2191-8-11**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88 year old woman with a history of HTN and
severe aortic stenosis who presents with increasing SOB. Over
the past few months she has become increasingly SOB to the point
where she gets SOB walking from one room to another and from
talking. She denies chest pain, cough, lightheadedness, and
recent syncope. She denies leg edema, orthopnea, and PND. She
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath to further evaluate her for
aortic valve replacement. At the outside hospital her EKG showed
LVH. Her first set of enzymes was negative and her BNP was
elevated.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
88 year old woman pre-op for AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate ? effusion
TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST ON _____.

Two views of the chest are compared with last study. The
pulmonary artery line has been removed since then. Sternal
sutures and artificial aortic valve are seen in place. There is
trace of fluid in the right costophrenic angle and approximately
2-300 cc of fluid at the left base. Old left healed rib fracture
again noted. Heart size remains stable. Lungs are otherwise
clear with no evidence of failure.

CONCLUSION: Small bilateral effusions left greater than right.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is
top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septal, inferoseptal
and
anteroseptal walls. All other walls are moderately hyopinetic.
LVEF~20%. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis
of the apical
free wall of the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.5-0.7cm2 by
Continuity Equataion). [**Doctor Last Name **] (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. [**Doctor Last Name **] (2+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. [**Doctor Last Name **] [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is on an epinephrine infusion at 0.04 ucg/kg/min
LV systolic function is marginally improved in the setting of
inotropes. The
is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. There
is a trace perivalvular leak(AI). MR [**First Name (Titles) 19947**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] in
quantity. The study
is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
