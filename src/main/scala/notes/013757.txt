ring)


History of Present Illness:
47 year old gentleman with a history of mitral valve prolapse
with mitral regurgitation who has been followed by serial
echocardiograms. Over the past year, his echocardiograms have
shown progressive dilation of the left ventricular end systolic
dimensions which is now at 44mm. Given the progression of his
MVP/mitral regurgitation, he has been referred for surgical
repair.

Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are elongated. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail. The mitral regurgitation
vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2169-1-31**] at 820am.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine. Biventricular systolic function
is unchanged. Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position.
Leaflets move well and the annuloplasty ring appears well
seated. Trivial central mitral regurgitation present. Mean
gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg. Aorta appears
intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent mitral valve repair.
See operative report for further details.  He received cefazolin
for perioperative antibiotics.  Postoperatively he was
transferred to the intensive care unit for management.  In first
twenty-four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
He was transfered to the floor on post operative day one for the
remainder of his stay.  Physical therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility.  He did have a brief episode of atrial
fibrillation which converted to SR with amiodarone.  He remained
in sinus rhythm.  He continued to do well and was ready for
discharge home on post operative day five.
