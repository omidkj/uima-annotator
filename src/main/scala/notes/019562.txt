Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2140-9-6**] and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled
with a PCA. On HD#4 ([**2140-9-9**]) he returned to the operating
room for a scheduled L3-S1 decompression with PSIF as part of a
staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative
note for further details. The second surgery was also without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25. He was transfused
PRBCs and transfered to the SICU for observation.
In the SICU he was confused and this was thought to be due to
anaesthesia.  He subsequently became more awake and alert over
the following three days.  A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter
placed at the time of the posterior surgery remained in [**Known lastname **]
until postop day#1 from the second procedure when it was
removed. He was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet
was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral
pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on
POD#3 from the second procedure. He was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise
unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile
with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and
tolerating a regular diet.
