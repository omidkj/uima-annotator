CATH
1. Severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. All three bypass grafts occluded.
Carotid Series + Venous Duplex
1. Findings consistent with 40%-59% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery secondary to atherosclerotic plaque.
2. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.
3. Nonvisualization and query occlusion of the right vertebral
artery.
4. Patent left greater saphenous vein with dimensions provided
above.
*******************
ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is very
mildly depressed with focal basal inferior and infero-lateral
thinning and akinesis The remaining LV segments appear
hyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Moderate inferior and inferolateral partially reversible
perfusion
defect. Mild global hypokinesis that is worse in the region of
the patient's perfusion defects. EF 45%
