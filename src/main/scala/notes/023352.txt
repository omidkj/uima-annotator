Common bile duct dilatation, admitted for ERCP

History of Present Illness:
HPI:
85 y/o man with history of CVA, essential tremor, compression
fractures, hyperlipidemia, recurrent falls, previous CDiff who
presented to [**Hospital3 **] from rehab [**2182-6-15**] with generalized
weakness, nausea and abdominal pain. Per his rehab facility, he
vomited a large amount of bilious emesis the day prior to
presentation also and was becoming progressively more confused.
He also endorses recent decreased appetite. At [**Hospital3 **], RUQ ultrasound showed CBD dilation and gallbladder
sludge in setting of elevated LFTs.
(Dbili 2.2) and leukocytosis (WBC 21). The patient was
reportedly persistently nauseous, vomiting although afebrile and
was started on Cipro/Flagyl for presumed acalculous
cholecystitis. He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP. Incidentally, in the setting of tachypnea and tachycardia,
he was found to have PE on CT abdomen and pelvis at [**Hospital3 **] and started on heparin gtt. He was initially admitted
to the General Surgery Service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39402**] and ERCP contact[**Name (NI) **]
for urgent cholangiogram and ?extraction of stones. As ERCP was
not available at [**Hospital3 **], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
The patient had recently been admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**]
(unsure dates) for fall with vertebral fractures and
post-operatively was treated with Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone
for pneumonia. He developed C.diff colitis that required
treatment with Flagyl (started [**6-10**]). He had completed all of
these antibiotics courses although felt the Flagyl made him
nauseous.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was resting comfortably
in bed although remained tachypneic, confused. Denied any
symptoms, though, including chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea. He received one liter normal saline
bolus for persistent tachycardia into HR130s and 400mg
Ciprofloxacin and 500mg Flagyl as he was due.


Past Medical History:
- Recent admission for vertebral compression fractures, gluteal
hematomas, epidural hematoma, rib fractures s/p fall down 14
stair steps ([**2182-4-12**])
- Cerebellar pontine stroke: In [**2175**], on Coumadin
therapeutically to prevent progression. Also ?prior CVA with
inconclusive bubble study for atrial septal defect vs. PFO.
Residual gait instability.
- Essential tremor: With gait and eating interference. Has been
treated with propranolol and primidone by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 88986**].
Orthostatic component to tremor?
- Seborrheic dermatitis

colectomy

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old man with a PMHx s/f CVA, recent c
diff infection at rehab, PE, and acalculous cholecystitis who
presented as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for an ERCP. His major
issues during the hospitalization included acalculous
cholecystitis, sepsis, respiratory distress, acute kidney
injury, delerium, and PE.

# Acalculous Cholecystitis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented with
ALT/AST of 215/289, LDH of 339, alk phos of 726, and a
tbili/dbili/indbili of 3.8/3.5/0.3 suggesting an obstructive
biliary tree. ERCP was performed on [**2182-6-16**] and a stent was
placed. No major pus or biliary drainage was observed during the
procedure. At the time of ERCP, it was thought that Mirrizi's
syndrome was the etiology of his biliary obstruction, and the GI
team recommended a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. (Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was not a candidate for cholecystectomy due to his elevated INR
of 2.2). On [**2182-6-18**], a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was
placed under CT guidance. On [**2182-6-19**], his LFTs had downtrended
to ALT/AST of 89/149, LDH of 293, alk phos of  594, and a tbili
of 3.0.

# Sepsis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially was admitted with a WBC of 26.8,
tachypnea to 24, and tachycardia to 95 consistent with sepsis
with a suspected biliary source. A septic workup was performed
including Urine Culture, Blood Culture, sputum culture, and
culture of gallbladder secretions. Zosyn was begun empirically
due to suspected biliary source. From [**6-15**] to [**6-20**] WBC declined
from 26.8 to 13.1 and Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained afebrile. On the day of
transfer, Blood/Sputum/gallbladder cultures were no growth to
date. On day of transfer urine culture was reported to grow
Enterococcus 10-100,000 cfu with sensitivities below:
AMPICILLIN------------  =>32 R
LINEZOLID-------------     2 S
NITROFURANTOIN--------   128 R
TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R
VANCOMYCIN------------  =>32 R
  Enterococcus was consistent with VRE. However, due to Mr.
[**Known lastname 88987**] clinical improvement, the decision was made not to treat
with linezolid. Furthermore, due to the low colony forming unit
count for Mr. [**Known lastname 88987**] VRE, it was thought to be unlikely to
contribute to his sepsis. It is likely that Mr. [**Known lastname 88987**] bladder
is colonized and not infected with VRE. Note that WBC increased
from 11.8 to 13.1 on day of transfer. The ICU team felt however,
that his overall clinical improvement on zosyn spoke against the
need for Linezolid therapy.

# Respiratory distress: Initially, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tachypnic to
25-30 with an ABG of 7.42/31/99/16 on RA consistent with a
metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was also electively intubated for his ERCP procedure and
remained intubated post-operatively due to his tenuous
condition; he was extubated approximately 24 hours later when it
was deter
