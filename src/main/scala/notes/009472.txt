Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
severe COPD, severe tracheobronchial malacia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Sigmoid segement colectomy w/ end colostomy
Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 75 year old female with
an extensive history of recurrent bouts of COPD.  She presented
to [**Hospital6 6640**] [**2186-7-31**] with severe
shortness
of breath.  She has been receiving high dose steroids with
minimal response.  In [**2184-5-30**] patient was intubated for an
extended period of time following hip surgery.  Bronchoscopy at
OSH showed normal subglottic region, no upper airway obstruction
but showed diffuse tracheobronchitis with floppy airways.
Transluminal surface area dropped off greater than 50 percent
with simple expiratory maneuvers and nearly 90 percent with a
forced maneuver without cough.  Patient has been maintained on
inhalers.  Patient reports wheezing, cough, dyspnea on exertion,
increased sputum production that has not improved despite
increasing doses of steroids.  She denies, fevers, chills,
nausea, vomitting, orthopnea, PND, and hemoptysis.  Review of
systems was otherwise negative.

MI (remote) s/p PTCA; no recent stress test or cardiac cath in
years
Angina
H/o panic attacks
S/p Bilateral Carotid Endarterectomy
S/p Left carotid to subclavian bypass
S/p Cholecystectomy
S/p Hip surgery

Social History:
Former smoker x 40 pack years, quit 20 years ago.
No EtOH, other illicits. Lives alone.


Family History:

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2186-8-14**]
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
--------
ECG [**2186-8-7**]: Sinus tachycardia at 133 bpm with atrial premature
beat and ventricular premature beat. Findings are as outlined on
previous tracing of [**2186-8-5**] and are without significant change
except that sinus tachycardia rate is faster and ventricular
ectopy is seen. Baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.
.
ECG [**2186-8-8**]: Sinus rhythm at 99 bpm. Atrial premature beats.
Anterior T wave changes suggest myocardial ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Non-specific T wave flattening in the
limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-8-7**] the
anterior T wave inversions are new.
.
ECG [**2186-8-9**]: Sinus tachycardia at 101 bpm. Atrial premature
beats.
Poor R wave progression. Biphasic T wave in lead V4 and T wave
inversion in leads V5-V6 suggests myocardial ischemia. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2186-8-8**] the T wave changes in leads
V2-V3 are absent.
.
ECG [**2186-8-10**]: Sinus rhythm at 79 bpm. Nl axis and
intervals. TWI in V2 and biphasic T waves in V3-V6 more
pronounced compared to [**2186-8-9**], more similar to ECG from [**2186-8-8**].
TTE (Complete) Done [**2186-8-10**]
--------
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
hypokinesis. The other segments appear to contract well,
although due to suboptimal image quality, another very focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be ruled out. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is
borderline hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with low-normal free wall function. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated and
hypertrophied right ventricle with borderline systolic function.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-8-4**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with acute perforated sigmoid
diverticulitis with a
significant amount of free intraperitoneal air and small fluid
collections in
the lower pelvis.

2. Dilated CBD up to 1 cm, not significantly changed from ERCP
of [**2183-12-31**].

3. Probable exophytic simple cyst arising from interpolar region
of the right
kidney.

CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND Study Date of [**2186-8-4**]
IMPRESSION:
