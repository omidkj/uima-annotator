HF, several falls and recent [**Hospital1 18**] admissions [**Date range (1) 77733**] after
fall with left humerus fx and on [**4-4**] for decreased
appetite and increased fatigue thought to be due to diastolic
heart failure. During his most recent admission cardiology was
consulted and the recommended event montor to eval for arhythmia
as a possible cause of falls, but pt refused. They also
recommended holding off on coumadin for treatement of Afib, and
using only aspirin given multiple falls. Per report, patient was
more lethargic at his NH today and was responsive only to
painful stimuli, he was found to by bradycardic to the 40s and
hypotensive  with SBPs in the 80s. He received atropine 1 mg in
the field with increase in his HR to 60s and was brought to the
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 96.8 HR:55 BP:90/38 RR:18
O2Sat:100% on NRB. Patient received 9 L of NS with UOP of about
100 cc and no response in his BP. He then developed abdominal
distention and underwent a CT abdomen, which revealed evidence
of volume overload. CXR showed a resolving right-sided pleural
effusion. He had 1 episode of bradycardia to the 30s and
received atropine 0.5 mg.  He was admitted for further

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y.o. male with h/o syncope with falls, afib,

recent humerus fx is s/p pna with known large right pleural
effusion,
presents with lethargy and weakness found to be bradycardic and
hypotensive
.
# Bradycardia: Unclear etiology as not on BB, CCB or digoxin.
Unclear if patient's bradycardia and hypotension were trully
related. Was in slow atrial fibrillation on admission.. Likely
age-related sclerotic conduction system disease. Evaluated by EP
per family wishes, no role for ICD.

# Hypotension: No focal infectious etiology.  Perhaps volume
depletion secondary to diarrhea.

# ARF: Likely pre-renal in etiology given recent diarrhea versus
ATN given hypotension.
Resolved.

# Diarrhea: Unclear etiology.  He had loose stools on his last
admission as well that were attributed to narcotic withdrawl and
antibiotics and chronic stool softner use. Of note, he was also
on amoxicillin at the nursing home for unclear reasons.

.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient has received 9 L IVF. No LE edema, but
does have pleural effusion and abdominal edema.
Patient restarted on home lasix day prior to d/c, satting well
on RA on d/c.
.
# Pleural effusion: He has had a loculated pleural effusion in
setting of recent pna, possible parapneuomnic effusion vs
transudate from right heart failure. No fevers, no elevtaed WBC
to suggest active infection.
-Patient continued on home diuresis.
.
# Afib: actually in slow afib. not anticoagulated secondary to
patients wishes.
- continue ASA
.
# h/o Humerus fx:  tylenol PRN
.
# FEN: regular heart healthy diet, nectar thickened liquids
.
# ACCESS: PIVs
.
# PPX: SC heparin, fall precautions, aspiration precautions
.
# Code Status: DNR/DNI, no CVL, no invasive procedures, however
patient's son did want evaluation by EP for question of
pacemaker placement.
