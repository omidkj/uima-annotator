Service: PLASTIC

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 26411**]
Chief Complaint:
Left knee question osteomyelitis, left knee osteoarthritis.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left knee proximal tibia open biopsy.
2. Left knee antibiotic spacer.
3. Transfer of free anterolateral thigh flap from the right
    thigh to the left knee with microvascular anastomosis.
4. Split-thickness skin grafting of right thigh donor site.
5. Partial closure of left knee arthrotomy.


History of Present Illness:
43 year old male with a complex orthopedic history. In [**8-/2156**] he
suffered a complex proximal tibia fracture requiring multiple
surgical procedures. On [**2156-9-13**] he had an ORIF with external
fixator and then a split thickness skin graft. The external
fixator was removed in [**10-2**]. The pt continued to have pain and
a CT scan noted a nonunion along the medial side of the tibial
plateau fracture and pt underwent repair in [**2157-6-26**] with ORIF
with iliac crest bone graft, removal of deep hardware and
placement of a medial proximal tibial locking plate applied to
the medial tibia over the nonunion site with a total of 8
locking screws. Due to continued complaints of pain, in [**Month (only) 958**] of
[**2157**], he underwent surgical lysis of adhesions with a medial and
lateral meniscectomy. This surgical intervention did not help
and patient continued to have pain localized to the left leg,
both medially and laterally in the region of the plate so he
underwent hardware removal on [**2158-6-23**]. An intraop tissue sample
was sent from the L. tibia which grew rare coag negative staph.
At this time, ID got involved and recommended no antibiotics and
watchful waiting.

Patient continued to be followed in both ID and [**Date Range **] clinics
regularly. On [**2159-1-1**], pt underwent a bone scan that showed mild
uptake in the L. knee. He then had a follow up tagged WBC scan
that showed focal uptake of tracer in the lateral aspect of the
proximal left tibia in region of previous MDP uptake -
consistent with osteomyelitis. He was seen back in [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2159-3-14**] at which time they discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**],
orthopedics, and agreed for repeat tagged WBC scan in upcoming
months and to monitor his inflammatory markers. The pt followed
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**] on [**2159-8-29**] for his ongoing chronic knee pain
at which time operative options were discussed. Patient decided
on total knee replacement due to his unbearable knee pain.  ID
recommended that tissue be sent from the OR and if there was
growth of CoNS, he would be treated aggressively with 6-8 weeks
of IV abx and likely oral regimen following.

The patient came in [**2159-10-22**] and was admitted to the plastics
surgery service for aLeft knee proximal tibia open biopsy, Left
knee antibiotic spacer,Transfer of free anterolateral thigh flap
from the right thigh to the left knee with microvascular
anastomosis, Split-thickness skin grafting of right thigh donor
site, and partial closure of left knee arthrotomy.

Past Medical History:

Previous Surgeries:

Pt reports a history of approx 15 operations on L leg including:
LLE External Fixation, release compartment syndrome
Open reduction, internal fixation left proximal tibial nonunion
with iliac crest bone graft [**2157-7-6**]

meniscectomy [**3-4**]
Removal of hardware [**2158-6-23**]


Social History:
+ETOH
denies Tobacco/Street drugs
***Has had ongoing issues with narcotics and pain management
since the accident in [**2155**].  [**Hospital1 18**] made many attempts to wean
him off of pain meds but patient unable to do so.  He was
referred to Pain Clinic [**2158-3-14**].  He was eventually referred
to pain clinic closer to where he lives.  Of note, the patient
has had a history of narcotic contract violations in the past at
Integrated Pain Clinic in [**Location (un) 5450**], [**Location (un) 3844**].  He was
terminated from their clinic on [**2159-2-23**].  He did
receive opioid medications on [**2159-9-17**], from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on
[**2159-10-22**] and had a 1. Left knee proximal tibia open biopsy, 2.
Left knee antibiotic spacer, 3. Transfer of free anterolateral
thigh flap from the right thigh to the left knee with
microvascular anastomosis, 4. Split-thickness skin grafting of
right thigh donor site, 5. Partial closure of left knee
arthrotomy.  The patient tolerated the procedures well.  He was
extubated successfully and taken to the recovery room.  He was
subsequently taken to the floor in stable condition.

Neuro: Immediately post-operatively, the patient was maintained
on Dilaudid PCA.  As soon as he could tolerate POs the following
meds were added along with the dilaudid PCA: Tylenol 1000mg
every 6 hours ATC, oxycontin 50 mg po Q8h, neurontin 1200 mg
TID.  On [**2159-10-24**] the patient was still complaining of pain so a
Pain consult was called and they increased his Oxycontin from
50mg to 60mg Q8h and they also added a Ketamine IV infusion.  On
