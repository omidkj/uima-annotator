Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial monitoring line.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old male with hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, and recent right MCA stroke s/p trach and peg who
presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening shorness of breath for
one day. The patient was noted to be short of breath on the
morning of presentation and this worsened throughout the day.
Per report he was noted this afternoon to have acute onset of
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response this
afternoon. In this setting he was noted to have irregular
respirations with periords of apnea. ABG drawn at that time was
notable for a respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia 7.58/32/55 on
FiO2 50%. CXR per report showed a consolidation and was given
vancomycin and zosyn. He was also given lasix 40 mg IV x 2 and
nitroglycerin paste without significant improvement. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 100.6 P: 140 BP: 135/88 R: 18 O2
sat 100% on trach mask. Prior to arrival he had received 40 mg
IV lasix as well as nitroglycerin. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with ST depression
in V3. CXR showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
bibasilar opacities and mild congestion. He was placed on
positive pressure ventilation with improvement of his
respiratory status. He was admitted to the MICU for further
management.

On arrival to the floor he is somnolent but responds to simple
commands. Unable to clearly respond to questions. Unable to
obtain review of systems. Breathing comfortably on assit
control.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Systolic CHF (EF 25%)
s/p CVA in [**3-6**] s/p trach and peg
Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin

Social History:
Currently living at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Retired. Used to be an
electrical engineer. No history of smoking or alcohol abuse.

Chest x-ray [**2130-5-2**]:
1. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar
opacities which likely represent atelectasis, but infection is
not excluded.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.

ECHO [**2130-5-3**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV with severe global
hypokinesis. Focal hypokinesis of the RV apex. Mild aortic and
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-3-1**], the
LV is more dilated. The other findings are similar.

Chest x-ray [**2130-5-4**]:
Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Lung volumes are larger
compared to the previous study, and positional differences limit
comparison. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are probably
unchanged allowing for these factors. Persistent left
retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 year old male with hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, and recent right MCA stroke status-post
tracheostomy and PEG-tube who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
worsening shorness of breath for one day and CXR consistent with
CHF.

#. Shortness of breath: Differential diagnosis includes systolic
congestive heart failure versus infection.  Currently afebrile
with mildly elevated WBC and no significant increase in tracheal
secretions.  Chest x-ray shows evidence of congestion with large
left sided effusion and small right sided effusion.  Low
suspicion at this time for cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes
did not suggest acute infarct. PE appears less likely given
therapeutic INR.  BNP [**Numeric Identifier 45281**]. He was placed on a lasix drip for
negative fluid balance with improved oxygentation. He is being
discharge on standing PO lasix (20mg TID) which may be adjusted
by his physicians. In addition, he was started on Digoxin for
systolic heart failure and his dose of Metoprolol does reduced.
He was also continued on a course of vancomycin and zosyn and
will continue an additional five days of vancomycin for possible
pneumonia.

Atrial Fibrillation:  His heart rate was generally 70-100
although he has periods of rapid ventricular response.  During
the first day with episodes of RVR to 180??????s, he was started on
an esmolol gtt which was then weaned off without complications.
Given he was started on Digoxin, his dose of Metoprolol was
decreased to 75mg PO TID. His Coumadin was initially held due to
supratherapeutic INR but was restarted at discharge.

Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  As above; EF 25% again on
this admission.  Evidence of congestive failure on exam.  CXR on
[**2130-5-4**] showed marked improvement from initial CXR in regards to
fluid removal on diuresis.

Urinary Tract Infection:  UA from emergency room with evidence
of infection, however culture did not show infection.

Hypertension:  Blood pressures were low dur
