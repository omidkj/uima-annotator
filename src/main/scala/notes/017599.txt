Imaging
- CT abd/pelvis [**12-27**]: 1. No definite evidence for active
extravasation in the region of the known colovaginal fistula. 2.
Saccular infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3 cm in
diameter is stable in size. 3. Extensive diverticulosis without
evidence for diverticulitis. 4. Atrophic kidneys with multiple
cysts bilaterally consistent with history of end-stage renal
disease.

-Echo [**12-29**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature
of the regurgitant jet, its severity [**Known firstname **] be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). An echodensity associated with
the anterior mitral leaflet, on its atrial aspect is seen, most
likely representing an acoustic artifact, but a vegetation
cannot be excluded with certainty. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2101-2-24**], the findings are similar.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic
examination is recommended. If clinically suggested, the absence
of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude
endocarditis.
.
Echo [**1-2**]: Thickened mitral leaflets with moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation, but no discrete vegetation. Mild aortic
regurgitation without discrete vegetation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
.
US AV graft [**1-2**]:
IMPRESSION: No fluid collection or evidence of abscess is seen
at the site of the patient's left arm AV fistula.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
rectro-vag fistula who presented to the ER with likely GI
bleeding of diverticular source admitted to the MICU for GI
bleed, hypotension and respiratory failure.
.
# GI bleed: The patient presented to the ER with bright red
blood per vagina mixed with feces while going to the bathroom.
The patient has had h/o vaginal bleeding previously, but never
to this extent. She also has a long history of urosepsis [**2-22**]
stool output from vagina from a known rectal vaginal fistula.
CTA did not demonstrate active bleeding. No further BRBPR during
her admission. Gyn, GI and Surgery were consulted in the ER and
followed while in the MICU. The likely source of the bleeding
was deemed to be from a diverticular bleed that was near the
fistular opening. GI did not pursue colonoscopy at this time
given patient's tenuous status. GYN stated the potential for
fistula repair via a sub-total colectomy followed by exision of
the fistula, should the patient stabilize clinically. Patient
had no further bleeding after first night of admission and
hematocrit was stable, but was critically ill throughout her
stay so no surgical intervention or workup of the fistula was
pursued.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: In the ER she received 1.7L of
fluid for hypotension and shortly thereafter the patient
developed acute pulmonary edema and tachypnea. She received
Bipap, nitro SL, and nitro gtt with no improvement. Her BP
dropped to 80's/40's and she was intubated. She was sent to the
MICU for management of her respiratory failure. Thoughts for her
hypoxic respiratory failure included infection, hypervolemia,
CHF exacerbation. Less likely TRALI or ARDS following blood
transfusion since per ED report pt had received fluids prior to
intubation. She remained intubated and sedated until she was
terminally extubated at the decision of her family given her
critical illness and lack of improvement.
.
# Septic Shock: On [**12-29**], pt had positive blood cultures that was
+ for [**Female First Name (un) **] with Urine cx showing E.Coli.  Source of blood
infection unclear, thought to be ascending urinary tract,
vaginal infection given fistula or AV fistula source. No
evidence of infection in AV fistula or any lines per transplant
surgery. The patient was started on Micafungin. A TTE was
performed which showed an echodensity and they could not rule
out a vegetation. A TEE did not demonstrate any evidence of
vegetation and AV graft showed no evidence of infection.
Transplant surgery did not think the graft looked infected
either. The patient was given Vanc/Cefepime/flagyl for
broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, then started on micafungin
when [**Female First Name (un) **] grew in the bloodstream.  OB/GYN and ID felt
candidemia [**Known firstname **] be secondary to source from fistula, and blood
cultures cleared after she was started on micafungin. However,
patient remained on double pressors and CVVH during MICU stay.
Stress dose steroids were also tried one day prior to death.
.
# Rectovaginal fistula: The patient has a known diagnosis of
rectovaginal fistula diagnosed in [**2096**]. Surgery, GI, and gyn
consulted. No indication to repair while patient septic and
intubated.
.
# CRF: Given hypotension, Pt did not undergo her usual
Tues/Thurs/Sat HD and instead underwent CVVH for K,H+ clearance.
When initially started on this on [**12-28**], she became hypothermic
to 92 degrees and it was stopped. It was restarted
