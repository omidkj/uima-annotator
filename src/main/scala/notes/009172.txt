Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old gentleman
who is known to our service from his admission in late
[**Month (only) 1096**] and early [**Month (only) 404**] with diabetic dermopathy, Child
class C cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
chronic renal failure, gastroparesis, and type 1 diabetes
mellitus with recently malfunctioning insulin pump.

The patient was admitted on [**2176-1-13**] and transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit in diabetic ketoacidosis;
likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(ascitic fluid with 1600 white blood cells and 93%
polymorphonuclear leukocytes on [**2176-1-14**]).  He has
also had hepatic encephalopathy.

He is currently receiving ceftriaxone for empiric treatment
of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (culture negative) as
well as vancomycin for an alpha-streptococcal bacteremia
noted on culture on [**2176-1-13**].

His course has also been complicated by pancytopenia (nadir
white blood cell count of 2, hematocrit of 22.8, and a
platelet count of 70 on [**1-15**]) for which Hematology has
been consulted.  He is status post transfusion of 2 units of
packed red blood cells with a resultant increase in his
hematocrit to 30.5.

Currently, Mr. [**Known lastname 19672**] notes the sensation of increased
abdominal girth and pain at the site of his previous
thoracentesis.  He is breathing well, and he has decreased
weeping from his lower extremity bullae.  He has been off an
insulin drip since [**2176-1-14**] with resolved
hyperglycemia and anion gap.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 97.3, heart rate was 88, blood
pressure was 106/74, and respiratory rate was 18.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae
were anicteric.  The oral mucosa were moist.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Heart was regular in
rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur over the right upper
sternal border.  The abdomen was tense and moderately
distended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Tender in the right lower
quadrant at the site of previous paracentesis.  Umbilical
hernia unchanged.  Extremity examination revealed 1-cm
bilateral pitting edema to the waist.  Sterile/dry dressings
over the shins bilaterally.  Neurologic examination revealed
alert and appropriately interactive; attentive to questions.
No asterixis.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count 2.4, hematocrit was 30.5, and
platelets were 73.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.1,
chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 18, blood urea nitrogen was
73, creatinine was 1.6, and blood glucose was 57, and anion
gap was 10.  Calcium was 8.2, phosphate was 3.9, and
magnesium was 2.1.  Vancomycin level was 16.2.  Cryoglobulin
was pending.  Rheumatic factor was negative.  Blood cultures
from [**1-15**] no growth to date from 4/4 bottles; [**1-14**]
no growth to date from 4/4 bottles.  Nasal swab culture from
[**1-15**] was pending.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus was pending.  Blood culture from [**1-13**] grew 2/2
bottles of alpha hemolytic streptococcus.  Ascites fluid
revealed negative culture, negative acid-fast bacillus,
negative fungal culture.  Urine culture from [**1-14**] was
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient continued to
receive empiric treatment for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis with ceftriaxone.  His vancomycin was
discontinued; per Infectious Disease consultation
recommendations as the ceftriaxone was felt to be adequate
coverage for the alpha-streptococcal bacteremia.

The Infectious Disease Service also recommended increasing
the dose of ceftriaxone to 2 g intravenously once per day;
completion of a two weeks total of ceftriaxone, and
discontinuation of the patient's metronidazole.  It was
recommended that the speciation of the alpha-streptococcal be
followed, as the presence of S. Sanguis would indicate
recurrence of an infection with this organism and could
represent endovascular infection.  In this case, the
Infectious Disease Service recommended a transesophageal
echocardiogram evaluate for the presence of endocarditis.

In the case of a different type of alpha-streptococcus, the
Infectious Disease Service recommended that the patient
receive an outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate for a colonic
lesion or source of bacteremia.

At the time of discharge, the speciation of the streptococcus
had yet to be determined.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient's symptoms and
physical examination indicated worsening ascites.

On [**1-16**], the patient was converted from intravenous
furosemide to oral furosemide at a dose of 40 mg p.o. once
per day.

On the afternoon of [**1-17**], a therapeutic paracentesis was
attempted.  This procedure was unsuccessful because the
needles in the thoracentesis tray were insufficiently long to
access the patient's peritoneal fluid despite multiple
attempts and angles.  The patient was subsequently scheduled
for an ultrasound-guided therapeutic paracentesis, and 3
liters of fluid were removed from his peritoneum.

On [**1-18**], the patient's dose of furosemide was increased
to 80 mg p.o. once per day.  This was the dose on which the
patient was discharged.

3.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  At the time of transfer out of the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient had well controlled
blood sugars.

The patient's endocrinologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] followed the
patient during this admission, and the patient's insulin
regimen was adjusted according to Dr.[**Name (NI) 16259**]
recommendations.

As of [**1-16**], the patient was on a regimen of 34 units of
NPH insulin at breakfast and dinner as well as 10 units of
Humalog at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

On [**1-18**], this regimen was changed to 32 units of NPH
insulin at breakfast and dinner with the same doses of
Humalog.  The patient was discharged on this regimen of NPH
and Humalog insulin.

4.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient notably had recent and
recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.  He was continued on
lactulose titrated to four to five stools per day.

The patient maintained a nonfluctuating level of
consciousness and good attention throughout the remainder of
his admission after transfer from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  He did not manifest asterixis on examination.

5.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  As aforementioned, the patient had
pancytopenia.  The Hematology Service was consulted.  In
their impression, the patient's pancytopenia was chronic in
nature and could entirely be explained by hypersplenism.
