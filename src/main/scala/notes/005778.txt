Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intra-aortic balloon pump placement
Intubation/extubation
Ventricular septal defect closure device placement

History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with hx of HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease
(diagnosed 4-5 years ago) presents with fatigue/weakness and
ongoing chest pain.  The history is provided by her daughter and
husband.  The chest pain started about 2 days ago, described as
across the chest and thought to be attributable to reflux.  The
pain improved with Maalox after the first occurrence.  However,
it recurred over the next 2 days until the day of admission,
unclear if it was precipitated by any particular activity.  No
shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea/vomiting, claudication
symptoms.  The AM of admission, she did not want to get out of
bed and felt extremely weak.  She was oriented, but speaking
with understandable words, but did not make any sense.  Her
weakness was not localized to a side of the body or the face.
Her husband was unable to get her up, so he called their
daughter, who went to the house and was concerned enough about
her to call 911.
.
Of note, she does have a history of falls, thought to be
vasovagal in origin, but taken off her amlodipine recently for
concern of hypotension.  She is independent of ADLs at baseline
and has never been hospitalized.  She has undergone work-up for
her Parkinson's disease and per her daughter, she has had
increasing dementia over the past few months.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.3, 118, 80/65, 16 and 96% on
4L.  She was noted to have STEMI in inferior leads and STE in
V4R when posterior leads were placed.  She received ASA in the
ambulance en route, integrilin bolus, Plavix 600mg, and heparin.
 Her BP dropped to 68/48 and she was given a total of 2L bolus
of NS.  She was then sent to the Cath lab for emergent
intervention.
.
She arrived to the Cath lab with systolic BPs down to the 60s,
resuscitated with IVF initially, then started on dopamine, with
resulting SBPs to 80s.  She was quite somnolent and there was
concern for her abiilty to protect her airway.  Anesthesia
intubated her and a IABP was placed given persistent
hypotension.  Only other intervention during cath was a POBA of
the RCA (prox 70% stenosis, now 40%). The patient's clinical
status did not improve and a TEE showed a likely VSD, so a
LV-gram was done, showing a large VSD.  No closure was done at
this point, with plans to return for percutaneous closure.
.
.
Review of systems could not be performed on patient due to
intubation/sedation.  Per daughter, she denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
