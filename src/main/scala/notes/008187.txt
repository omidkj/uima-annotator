                      ADDENDUM

CODE STATUS:  FULL CODE.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was not discharged on [**2157-3-11**].  This was due to the fact that after his PEG placement,
his hematocrit dropped to 24 from 28.  He received 2 U, and
then his hematocrit went back down again to 26.  He received
two more units of blood, and his hematocrit went up to 33,
then 34, and then remained stable at 34.  Essentially the
patient's discharge was delayed by what likely seemed to be a
GIB.  GI was consulted. An EGD was planned, but because his hct's
stabilized and there was no further acute bleeding this was
deferred. Outpatient EGD was recommended. Otherwise his condition
remained stable.  He is leaving with guaiac positive brown stool.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enteric coated Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., Heparin 5000 U subcue b.i.d., Artane 2 mg p.o. q.d.,
Prevacid 30 mg PGT q.d., Nystatin topical powder b.i.d.
p.r.n., Sinemet 10/100 one tab PGT t.i.d.,

p.o. q.d. x 2 more days, through [**4-7**], Flagyl 500 mg
per gastric tube q.d. x 2 days, through [**4-7**], this is
to complete his treatment for sepsis and pneumonia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Sepsis and pneumonia.
2.  Advanced Parkinson's disease.
3.  Bladder cancer status post VCG.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Status post PEG tube placement.
7.  Acute renal failure which has resolved.  He seems to be
at his baseline BUN and creatinine of 19 and 1.4 which leaves
him at a level of chronic renal insufficiency.  The patient's
creatinine on arrival was 3.0.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to keep his central
line and intravenous on discharge as he has a difficult time
obtaining intravenous access.  The rehabilitation facility,
which is the [**Hospital6 310**], is free to pull
his line after 24-48 hours if they determine that the central
line is not needed.
