Service:  MICU

HOSPITAL SUMMARY:  The patient was initially admitted to the
hospital on [**2186-2-7**] for hypothermia, hypotension, and
sepsis protocol.  The patient was brought to the hospital by
her son because she had had a slurring of her speech which
had resolved by the time she arrived at the hospital.

In the hospital the patient was fluid resuscitated initially,
and her blood pressure improved.  However, she became
hypotensive again and required intermittent pressors for
blood pressure support.  The patient had an echocardiogram
which revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with RV
dysfunction.  In the setting of fluid resuscitation, she
developed bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient had a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis on
[**2186-2-8**] which was complicated by a pneumothorax requiring
a right anterior chest tube.  She had a bronchoscopy which
showed a large amount of mucus plugs.  She was diuresed under
the guidance of a Swan Ganz catheter, and she underwent a
trial of vasodilators with nitric oxide and Viagra for
pulmonary hypertension.  However, she did not respond, and
she was felt not to be a candidate for ............ therapy.


She was extubated on [**2186-2-10**], transferred out of the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2186-2-11**] in stable
condition.  She was on the floor until [**2186-2-13**] when she
was found to be hypoxic, hypotensive, and tachycardiac.
Chest x-ray was done at that time which showed left lung
collapse secondary to mucus plugging.

The patient initially on hospital admission was "Do Not
Resuscitate"/"Do Not Intubate," but her family had reversed
her code status.  At the time of worsening medical
deterioration on [**2186-2-13**], discussions were held with the
family about her code status and whether or not they would
want her to be rebronched, and the patient and the family
decided on [**2186-2-14**] that they did not want any further
intervention, so the patient was not bronched.

The hypotension at that time responded to fluid boluses.
However, on [**2186-2-14**] at 9 p.m. the patient became
unresponsive, her heart rate decreased to the 40s, and she
had no blood pressure.  The patient had fixed and dilated
pupils, no breath sounds, no pulse, no heart sounds.  Time of
death was 8:54 p.m.  Her sons were notified.
