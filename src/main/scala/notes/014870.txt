Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2102-4-4**]: CHEST PA AND LATERAL: Compared to the study from
[**2102-4-1**]. There is improved aeration of the right lung.
Improvement is seen in the subcutaneous emphysema over the right
neck. There is interval removal of the right IJ line. The heart
size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. A small
right effusion is noted.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:  LT MAIN STEM TUMOR.
DIAGNOSIS:
Left mainstem mass, biopsy:
Granulation tissue with respiratory mucosal lining, squamous
metaplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation

ECHO: [**2102-3-10**]
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for evaulation of TBM. A rigid bronch was done
which showed Y stent w/ obstructing granulation tissue of LMSB.
Y stent was removed and granulation tissue was mechanically
cleared. There was significant TBM (80-90% of proximal left and
right main stem seen after Y stent removal. Thick copious
secretions were removed and pt was started on IVAB for post
obstructive PNA. Became increasingly more hypoxic requiring
transfer to ICU for management.
Became septic w/ decreased mental status requiring transfer to
ICU for pressor support. Psych was called to eval mutliple psych
meds which were tapered to increase level of alertness and to
eval for suggestions re: post op management when unable to take
po meds. Level of alertness improved w/ management of PNA w/ ABx
and alteration of psych medications. Head CT was done d/t
decreased mental status and was unremarkable for acute event.
Baseline HCt 24-26- did rec transfusions of PRBC to maintain
baseline. Weaned of pressors w/ stable hemodynamics.
Once PNA resolved and pt afebrile he was taken to the OR for a
rigid bronch to have y stent removed on [**2102-3-21**] in preparation
for tracheobroncheoplasty on [**2102-3-24**]. Pt remained intubated after
stent removal as a precaution.
He underwent a tracheobroncheoplasty on [**2102-3-24**].
Managed in the ICU post op -intubated for airway secretion
management, bronched on POD#1 for minimal secretions and open
trachea and bronchus s/p plasty. Found to have laryngeal
edema-placed on steriods. Cont'd w/ serial bronch's for secteion
management. Extubated on POD#3 ([**2102-3-27**]). Throughout [**Hospital **]
hospital course he was followed daily by psych for pharmacologic
management. Remained in ICU post extubation until mental status
near baseline and pt could protect his airway.
transferred to surgical floor for continued psych, surgical and
rehab management.
At the time of discharge, pt was pain free, [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet,
ambulatory and per his outpt psych team, at his psychiatric
baseline.
Pt was escorted home by his community mental health nurse [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66553**].
