Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1242**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  weakness, fatigue

Reason for MICU transfer:  persistent hypotension, symptomatic
anemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ placed [**5-28**]
Right midline removed [**5-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 17759**] is a 61F with complex past medical history including
diabetes, status post renal transplant x3, status post pancreas
transplant, currently on peritoneal dialysis who presents with 2
days of severe weakness and fatigue. She was recently admitted
with hypotension, bacteremia,E coli sepsis and discharged on 14
day course of meropenem, of which she has five days left. She
reports cough x 1 day without sputum production. She reports one
episode of chest discomfort yesterday at rest with associated
lightheadedness and nausea but no vomiting. She is also
concerned about progressive increase in incoordination of hands
bilaterally over the past ~month such that she is unable to hold
a spoon to feed herself. She does admit to decreased oral intake
over the past few days as a result of this.  She denies fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (prior to
admission).

Upon admission to the ED, initial VS were 98 80 80/39 18 100%
4l. Blood pressure did drop temporarily to 70/30. She was given
1 L IV fluid with inadequate response. Given that patient is
ESRD on dialysis, discussed with nephrology who advised against
excessive fluid resuscitation as this has led to rapid
decompensated CHF in the past. A central line was placed, and
the patient was then started on Norepinephrine with adequate
response. Her CK MB and troponins were elevated at 48 and 2.56
respectively. Her EKG was not significantly changed from her
baseline. She was evaluated by cardiology who did not feel this
was reflective of ACS. Work up in ED also revealed anemia with
HCT of 22, down from 30 on recent discharge. In ED exam was also
notable for non-tender abdomen and brown stool guaiac negative.
She was typed and crossed for two units of blood and was started
on her first unit in the ED. During the infusion she experienced
some transient chest discomfort with no other symptoms, not felt
to represent transfusion reaction. Given recent admission for
sepsis, cultures were sent, CXR done, and patient broadened with
Vancomycin, already given meropenem at rehabilitation. Given
chronic low-dose steroids, she was given stress dose steroids
with MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125 mg IV x 1.

On arrival to the MICU, patient complained of some chest
discomfort and dyspnea during blood transfusion, w/o
palpitations, diaphoresis. She still c/o feeling extremely
fatigued and weak.

CXR [**2182-5-28**]
No significant interval change since [**5-19**] noting left basilar
opacity due to combination of pleural effusion with underlying
atelectasis and
possible consolidation.

CXR [**5-31**]
 Increasing left greater than right pleural effusions, represent

residua of improved congestive heart failure.

ECHO [**5-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed
(ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive severe
inferior, posterior, and lateral wall hypokinesis/akinesis; the
