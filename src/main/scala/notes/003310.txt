[**2180-12-2**] EKG:  Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Modest
non-specific ST-T wave changes. Poor R wave progression - cannot
rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2180-7-20**] no significant diagnostic change.

[**2180-12-2**] Ankle/tib/fib films: horizontally oriented fracture
through medial malleolus. Associated obliquely oriented fracture
through the anterior corner of the tibia. Obliquely oriented
fracture through the distal fibula with slight posterior
angulation of the distal fracture fragment. Disruption of the
ankle mortise with slight lateral subluxation of the distal
tibia.

[**2180-12-5**] CTA chest: Multiple small, nonocclusive pulmary emboli in
the subsegmental branches of the left lung. Emphysematous
changes. Several small, ill-defined nodular pulmonary opacities,
nonspecific in
appearance; followup in several months could be obtained to
ensure resolution.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with history of COPD presents with left
tib/fib fracture and COPD exacerbation, subsequently found to
have multiple pulmonary embolisms.

1) Left Ankle Tib/Fib Fracture: When patient came to the ED, her
x-ray noted fractures through tibula, fibula and medial
malleolus. She was admitted to the ortho service and medically
cleared for surgical repair. However, overnight she had MS
changes (discussed below)and adamantly refused surgery
recommended the next morning. Several days later, the patient
consented to surgery, and underwent an ORIF without
complications. She was fitted for a bivalve cast and cleared for
rehab. She will follow-up with orthopedics in 2 weeks following
discharge
.
2) Mental Status Changes: After the patient's admission to the
ortho service, she was noted to be agitated and tremulous, and,
according to the staff, appeared to be having auditory
hallucinations. The patient refused surgery the AM after
admission. Psychiatry service was called to assess capacity. She
was found to be in a confusional state and to lack capacity to
make a decision. They recommended waiting until the delirium
cleared to proceed with the therapy. Because of the patient's
reported EtOH abuse and elevated CIWA scores, she was placed on
a CIWA protocol. Prn benzos (other than CIWA protocol) and
morphine were d/c'd. The patient was given a 1:1 sitter for
safety. Patient was ordered for Haldol prn. Imipramine was
briefly discontinued, to be replaced by nortriptyline (due to
its lack of anti-cholinergic side effects), however, the patient
became upset about the change and was returned to her original
medication. Over the next days, the patient's mental status
improved. She consented to the surgery, and was treated with
tramadol and morphine for pain relief. After the operation, her
mental status was mostly at baseline, except for a few reports
of increased agitation and nervousness, usually correlated to
larger doses of morphine.
.
3) Pulmonary: Patient has a long standing history of COPD is on
constant home 02 2L n/c and is treated with nebs. Upon
admission, she was noted to be 87% on RA and up to 98% on 2L.
Lung exam revealed rhonchi and expiratory wheezes. The patient
did not have a fever or observed cough. While on the ortho
service, the patient had episodes of dropping O2 sat to 76 and
80 on RA when nasal cannula was partially or fully removed by
patient while delirius. When nasal cannula was repositioned,
SpO2 recovered. Later, the patient became progressively
tachypneic and had worsening hypoxia with ABG 7.42/45/56 on 2L
of room air. Chest XR was negative for infiltrate or pleural
effusions. Chest CT revealed bilateral non-obstructive thrombi
of unclear age. The patient was begun on heparin gtt for PE,
which was later switched to coumadin and lovenox after her
surgery. She is currently on coumadin with a lovenox bridge; she
will need to continue lovenox until she is therapeutic on
coumadin (INR [**1-5**]) for 48 hrs. Next INR check is due [**2180-12-12**].
She was also felt to have a COPD exacerbation and was started on
solumedrol, subsequently transitioned to a prednisone taper.
Discussion with her PCP suggested that she had not been taking
prednisone daily prior to admission, as originally thought.
Albuterol/atrovent nebulizer treatments and advair were
continued throughout her hospital stay. At time of discharge,
her oxygen saturation was stable  94% on 2L nasal cannula.
.
4) Hypertension: Over the course of her hospital stay, the
patient's home dose of Lisinopril was increased and a B1
selective BB was added. Good control was achieved (120-130's
systolic)on this regimen. Patient was also placed on a low salt
diet.
.
5) Anemia: Over the first several days of her admission, the
patient's hematocrit dropped significantly from baseline. She
was transfused with 2 units of blood and her hematocrit
stabilized in the low 30s.
.
6) Hyperglycemia. Patient has no known history of DM. Her high
sugars throughout her hospital stay were most likely secondary
to steriod use. Patient was placed on a SSI.
