History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with past medical history of alcoholic
cirrhosis complicated by ascites and variceal bleeding, duodenal
ulcer, pancreatic mass, hepatic metastases, CAD, afib on
coumadin who started his clinical decompesation in [**2180-3-26**] with
inguinal hernia. He presented in [**2180-7-27**] with lower
extremity edema and ascites which was attributed to his liver
failure vs chronic systolic heart failure.
.
He had screening EGD done on [**2180-11-7**] which showed nonbleeding
esophageal varices.  He presented to [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2180-11-8**]
where he had MRCP that showed cirrhosis, splenomegaly,
pancreatic mass and hepatic metastases. A plan was formed to
further evaluate this condition. Labs were drawn and were most
notable for a HCT of 41, Ca19-9 of 461.
.
He had large volume paracentesis of 8L done on [**2180-11-10**].  He
presented to OSH this morning after having episode of
hematemesis and BRBPR.  He was noted to have SBP of 77, HCT 20
and INR 2.3 (of note has been off coumadin for past 10 days).
His BUN/CR was 50/1.3.  He was given 3 units of PrBC with bump
in his HCT to 27.  He continued to be hypotensive requiring
norepi gtt.  He underwent endoscopy which showed gastric varices
vs GEJ varix with clot in upper stomach which could be
dislodged. He was continued on octreotide and protonix gtt and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports feeling better. GI scoped him
as he continued to have BRBPR x 3 with increase in levo gtt.
.

# CT abd/pelvis
1. No evidence of an actively extravasating GI bleed.
2. Pancreatic tail lesion with multiple hepatic lesions,
concerning for a
primary pancreatic malignancy, possibly a neuroendocrine tumor,
with hepatic
metastases. No evidence of portal or splenic vein thrombosis.
The tumor
appears well defined and peripherally enhancing which is
uncommonly seen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
3. Cirrhotic liver and large amount of simple ascites; at the
time of this
study, a diagnostic paracentesis has been already performed.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

# Tagged RBC scan
No evidence of active GI bleeding during 90 minutes of imaging.

RUQ US IMPRESSION: Multiple hepatic lesions which are visualized
on ultrasound and are amenable for ultrasound-guided liver
biopsy. Findings were discussed with referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on [**2180-11-14**] with nurse practitioner, [**Doctor Last Name 636**]
Ghanem, and an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy has been scheduled
for [**2180-11-15**].

Hepatic biopsy Path:
1.  Adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated,
morphologically suggestive of a pancreaticobiliary primary; see
note.
2.  Scant adjacent non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma with
advanced fibrosis and rare nodule formation (confirmed by
trichrome stain), moderate cholestasis and rare associated
neutrophils; see note.
3.  Iron stain is negative for significant iron deposition.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 with decompensated cirrhosis and metastatic cancer presents
with episode of hematemesis and BRBPR.

# GIB:  The patient initially went to OSH for hematemesis and
BRBPR.  The patient was hypotensive and required phenylepherine
while in the unit.  An EGD was done in the MICU and no active
source of bleeding was noted.  There were grade 1 varices found
in the lower third of esophagus, which were not bleeding, and
with no stigmata of recent bleed.  A Dileufoy's lesion was seen
in the stomach that was also not actively bleeding, but 2 clips
were still successfully placed.  Both CTA and tagged RBC scan
were negative for any bleeding source, Colonoscopy showed
external hemorrhoids, and portal enteropathy, non bleeding AVMs.
The patient was treated with Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and ceftriaxone for
SBP ppx. In total, he was transfused 7U PRBC, 2 FFP, and one
unit platelets. Patient was transferred to hepatorenal service
with improved hemodynamics and with stable crit, he had no
further GIBs.

# Cirrhosis - Presumably alcoholic.  Radiography and SAAG were
consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patient had
paracentesis which removed 15L of fluid, was negative for SBP so
Ceftriaxone reduce from 2mg to 1mg daily for ppx against GNR
sepsis in setting of GIB. Hepatic biopsy was performed which
showed adenocarcinoma. Patient was seen by palliative care
services and will go home with VNA and plan for outpatient home
hospice care in the near future. He will see outpatient
Palliative care with Atrius.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  The patient was on beta blockers and
digoxin for rate his atrial fibrillation
