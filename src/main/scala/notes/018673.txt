Hypertension. Left ventricular function. Mitral valve disease.
Murmur. Myocardial infarction. Shortness of breath. Valvular
heart disease.
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2172-6-5**] at 08:41
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007AW5-:
Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.1 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% to 60% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Complex (mobile)
atheroma in the
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. Complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
for the
patient.

Conclusions:
Prebypass:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm),
mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Given degree
of descending
disease an epiaortic scan was performed. There are simple
atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There is a single complex (mobile) atheroma 0.5
cm on the
posterior surface of the prox ascending aorta on epiaortic scan.
There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm),
mobile atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. Aortic canullation and cross
clamping were
guided by the epiaortic scan
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 7. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. (3+) was
evoked with
provacative maneuvers (fluid, elevated BP, Trendelenberg) Vena
contracta
measured as 0.6 cm.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

Postbypass (on Phenylphrine ggt):
1. Preserved biventricular systolic function
2. There is a ring prosthesis in the mitral position. MR is now
trace/mild
eccentric valvular MR.
3. Study otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**6-1**] and pre-op workup completed with cardiology
consult obtained. Carotid US was negative and plavix washout
continued for a few days.Extubated on [**6-2**]. Heparin continued
while enzymes peaked. Diuresis for CHF also done prior to CABG x
3/MV repair/aortic endarterectomy on [**6-5**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on a titrated
porpofol drip. Extubated that evening and reintubated within 30
minutes for respiratory distress/ hypoxia. Dobutamine drip
continued for low cardiac output. Amiodarone loaded for
recurrent A fib with DC cardioversion to sinus brady on POD #2.
Heparin also restarted. Dermatology consult done for evaluation
of warts on hands and feet. He may follow up with derm. as an
outpt. Extubated again on [**6-9**], but reintubated again the next
morning for hypoxic resp. failure with bilat. infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy done [**6-10**] for bloody mucus plugs right lung. CT
chest showed CHF, infiltrates, and ? PNA vs. pneumonitis. Vanco
and zosyn started. He failed to wean from vent and underwent
trach and PEG on [**6-16**].  He continued to diurese and wean from
vent slowly. He had intermittent AF and was comadinized.  He
developed diarrhea and was found to be c. diff
