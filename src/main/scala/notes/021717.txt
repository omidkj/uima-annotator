History of Present Illness:
Patient came to the ER with three days of right upper quadrant

Musculoskeletal: Knees swollen and warm bilaterally with

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-5-15**] Abdominal CT - Thickened gallbladder wall with
stranding, without evidence of gallstones, however, concerning
for acute cholecystitis. This was posted to the ED dashboard on
the afternoon of the study.

[**2125-5-15**] Abdominal Ultrasound - There is a small area of
increased echogenicity in the gallbladder, which is not
shadowing and may represent sludge, polyp, or much less likely
gallstone. The gallbladder wall is 4 mm but not striated. There
was no tenderness when scanning over the gallbladder. The common
bile duct was normal measuring 3.2 mm. There is normal
hepatopetal flow in the portal vein.

[**2125-5-22**] Central Line placement - In comparison with the study of
[**5-20**], there has been placement of a left subclavian line that
extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of
pneumothorax. There appears to be some increasing prominence of
the pulmonary markings, suggesting elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2125-5-15**] and started on broad
spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin/levo/flagyl administered in
the ER. He had a percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube placed on [**5-16**] after elective intubation for respiratory
distress. He underwent an [**Month/Year (2) **] which revealed a compacted
ampullary stone, likely cholangitis and possible CBD stone; a
biliary stent was placed.

He had post procedure hypotension and SIRS with progressive low
grade fever, elevated WBC and a pressor requirement and he
remained intubated. He spiked to 101.5 and was pan cultured on
[**5-18**]. Sputum from that date ultimately grew MRSA.

Neuro: The patient was initially sedated with fentanyl and
propofol as needed.  [**6-1**]: APS consult, started ketamine infusion
for acute gout flare.  PO Dilaudid started and fentanyl patch
started [**6-7**].  Fentanyl drip stopped [**6-10**].  For pain control, the
patient continued on a fentanyl patch, tylenol liquid and PO
dilaudid.

Cardiovascular: initially started on cardizem on arrival to ICU
but this was changed to levophed for hypotension.  The levophed
was titrated to a goal MAP >60.  Throughout his stay in the ICU,
his blood pressure and heart rate were treated intermittently
with neo, levo, lopressor, and IVF boluses.  Midodrine started
[**6-12**].  He was eventually weaned off all pressors on [**6-19**].  He
continued on metoprolol digoxin 0.125mg PO daily for rate
control.  A heparin drip was started on [**6-18**] for anticoagulation
for atrial fibrillation with a goal PTT of 60-80 until
therapeutic on coumadin.  Coumadin was started on [**6-19**] at low
doses with an INR goal of [**3-4**].  Lovenox was started on day of
discharge as a bridge to a therapeutic INR.

Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated on [**5-16**] for respiratory
distress.  He underwent a tracheostomy on [**5-28**].  The patient
continued on the ventilator and was weaned to a trach collar on
[**6-11**].  Pulmonary toilet continued with intermittent ventilator
support as needed.

GI: [**5-18**] dobbhoff feeding tube placed and enteral nutrition
started.  Nutren Renal full strength with beneprotein 40gm/day,
banana flakes 3 packets per day tube feedings continued at goal
rate of 40ml/hr.

GU: Foley catheter placed on admission.  A sore on the meatus
was noted.  Urology was consulted and recommended changing
position of the foley daily, changing the foley every six weeks
and appyling bacitracin ointment daily. [**6-7**]: Foley changed

FEN: The patient was initially started on IV lasix for fluid
overload and was dosed prn.  CVVH started on [**5-29**] for fluid
overload. It continued for a goal of 50-100ml/hr and eventually
stopped [**6-8**].  Lasix
