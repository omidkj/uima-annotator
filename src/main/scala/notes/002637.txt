Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, suicidal ideation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from ER physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nursing staff at [**Location (un) 22092**] on the [**Doctor Last Name **] as patient unable to provide history. Per
report, this is a 78F with PMH of DMII, COPD on 2L home O2, HTN,
depression and anxiety presenting with altered mental status and
suicidal ideation. Per nursing staff patient has been
progressively more confused over the past two months, with
particular worsening over the past two weeks. Patient is
re-directable, but oriented only to self and has periods of
confusion where she believes her husband is still alive. On the
day of admission she became acutely agitated, throwing herself
on the ground and stating that she was going to jump out the
window or hang herself because she was being kept against her
will. At that time she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. Nursing
staff denies recent fevers or change in respiratory status; by
report, urinalysis and CXR were negative for infection over the
past week.

ROS: Unable to be obtained as patient refuses to answer
questions. Pertinent positives as noted above.

REPORTS:
PA/LAT [**2189-1-22**]:
1. Moderate right pleural effusion and multifocal faint
opacities, could
represent infectious process.
2. Unchanged post-surgical changes in the right upper lobe.
Correlation with surgical history is recommended.

[**2189-1-23**] [**2189-1-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and mildly hypokinetic right
ventricle. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe
pulmonary hypertension. Preserved left ventricular global
systolic function. Elevated estimated filling pressures.

RUQ U/S [**2189-1-23**]:
Direct son[**Name (NI) 493**] examinations were performed on the four
abdominal
quadrants. There is a small pocket of ascites in the right lower
quadrant,
measuring approximately 3.8 x 2.6 cm (AP x TRV). A trace amount
of fluid is noted in the deep pelvis. Limited views of the
kidneys demonstrate no
evidence of hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: Small pocket of ascites in the right lower quadrant.


[**2189-1-24**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion, with partial collapse
of right
lower lobe, and hyperdense material within the atelectic lobe.
Concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia. Comparison with
outside hospital studies and correlation with clinical and
surgical history would be helpful.
3. Several left-sided pulmonary nodules and mild left hilar
lymphadenopathy. Although probably infectious or inflammatory,
chest CT follow-up is recommended in three months given the
history of malignancy.
4. Several rounded soft tissue lesions in the posterior
subcutaneous tissues. These lesions typically represent
sebaceous cysts. However, in the clinical context of breast
cancer, direct physical examination or son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation is
recommended to rule out malignancy.
5. Hypodense areas in the liver and spleen, incompletely
evaluated in the
current study. Metastatic disease is an important differential
consideration, although benign lesions are common in the liver
and spleen. Recommend follow-up with MRI or multiphasic CT for
further assessment.

CT HEAD [**2189-1-24**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
major vascular territorial infarct. There is no shift of
normally midline
structures. The slightly prominent ventricles and sulci are
likely secondary to mild global atrophy. Moderate
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is
compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease
