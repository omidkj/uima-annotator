Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2121-7-28**] cardiac catheterization
[**2121-8-4**] AVR(25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine) /CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
OM, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
Pt with known CAD s/p stent in [**2115**] to LAD and known RCA
occlusion and aortic stenosis (ao valve area has varied when
measured from ~0.7-~1.2 per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and p/w worsening chest
pain on exertion. Yesterday he had severe chest pain and
diaphoresis, possibly also lightheadedness, after walking a
short distance at a "cards club". This resolved with rest. Today
he had similar symptoms after walking outside to get the
newspaper, the symptoms resolved with rest but he decided to
come to the ED because prior to the past few days he could
easily tolerate such a short walk. Prior to the past several
months he has been able to exercise on a bike for ~30 minutes
but recently (past month) he has been able to go only 10 min and
then he gets chest pain. Usually his pain resolves with rest but
he sometimes also takes nitroglycerin. In the past 3 weeks he
has taken nitroglycerin ~7 times which is significantly more
than he usually needs. Pt is not on [**Last Name (STitle) 4532**] at home.
.
Pt has h/o several caths in the past in addition to the stent to
LAD in [**2115**], pt had [**2116**] cath which showed mild disease to LAD
and circ and total occlusion of RCA and in [**2120**] had 30% prox
occlusion of LAD and 60% occlusion of the circ with same RCA
occlusion.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of cough,
does c/o occasional bloody stools. S/he denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
.
In ED vitals were T96.3 66 113/59 97% on RA. got ASA 325, CXR
unremarkable. ED attng spoke with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], started on
heparin gtt.

Pertinent Results:
Carotid ultrasound [**2121-7-29**]:
 Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid
arteries.

Panorex [**2121-7-29**]:
One Panorex view. Attenuation artifact partly obscure the
central portion of the image. Visualized cortical margins appear
intact. Bony mineralization appears normal. The patient is
nearly edentulous. Three implants are present in place of
incisors.

[**Month/Day/Year 102089**] chest CT [**2121-7-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild fusiform dilatation, noncalcified ascending thoracic
aorta distal to heavily calcified aortic valve and annulus, may
involve the orifice of the extremely heavily calcified left
coronary artery. Mild fusiform dilatation proximal descending
thoracic aorta. No evidence of dissection or ulcerated plaque.
2. 12mm left upper lobe lesion should be reexamined in 6 months
on suspicion of bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
2. Heavy mitral annulus calcification and dystrophic
calcification of the
mitral valve leaflets and/or cordopapillary elements.
3. Mild generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality and
probable small
airways obstruction.
4. Moderate-to-severe disc degeneration thoracic spine.

Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is good (LVEF >40%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mitral stenosis cannot
be excluded. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-8-8**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased. Left
ventricular systolic function may be similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Pt presented c an NSTEMI c/peak troponins of 0.55.
Pt's pain was initially controlled with a nitroglycerin drip,
however he did become hypotensive to the 80s. Nitroglycerin drip
was turned off on hospital day two and chest pain did not recur.
Of note, pt's chest pain is right sided and does not radiate. Pt
was taken for cath on hospital day 3 and found to have severe
aortic stenosis and 3 vessel disease so no stents were placed
and CT surgery was consulted. Pt had been started on [**Month/Day/Year 4532**] and
this was discontinued while awaiting CABG/AVR. Pt's home aspirin
was increased to 325, lipitor was increased to 80, atenolol was
switched to metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] which resulted in HR in the 60s.
Pt was continued on an ace inhibitor.
.
# PUMP: Pt w/severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] ~1cm2, mean gradient
46, peak gradient 79). Pt will get AVR.

Pt was not hypertensive during this admission. His BP was
initially controlled with metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and his home acei,
quinapril 20. His SBP dropped to the 80s occasionally and so his
quinapril was reduced to 10 daily.
.
# RHYTHM:
Pt in sinus rhythm, monitored on telemetry. Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
for HR in the 60s.
.
#LUNG MASS: 12mm lung mass found in LUL. Thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] consulted
and will not do biopsy intraop. Pt will f/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in late [**Month (only) **].
.
# DEPRESSION: prozac continued
.
# GERD: Home aciphex switched to protonix 40 [**3-3**] aciphex not on
formulary.
**if pt discharged on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] want to d/c proton pump
inhibitor and start ranitidine instead as some pts on PPI and
[**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] metabolize their [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] too fast.**
