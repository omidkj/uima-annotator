CT abdomen/pelvis:IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study without oral or intravenous contrast.
Sensitivity for
detecting abscess or bowel ischemia is markedly diminished.
2. Umbilical hernia is seen containing non-obstructed bowel
loops.
3. Multiple bilateral non-obstructing renal stones without
evidence of
hydronephrosis.
4. Cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Ascites.
6. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
,
TTE:The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**9-29**]:IMPRESSION:
Likely slight increase in right pleural effusion compared to
[**2127-9-26**] with
difficult comparison to [**2127-9-27**] because of differences in
position. Persistent
CHF and left lower lobe atelectasis.
.
RUQ US:
IMPRESSION: Very limited examination secondary to patient
cooperation.
Patent hepatic veins and IVC. To-and-fro flow within the main
portal vein may
indicate underlying hepatic congestion or an underlying primary
hepatic
process.
 ,
CT head;FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, recent
infarction,
hydrocephalus or edema. There is an old lacune in the extreme
capsule on the
left. There is cerebral atrophy and small vessel ischemic
change. The
