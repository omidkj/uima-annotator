History of Present Illness:
35 year old female h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and

improved. She came to hospital yesterday because pain was
unchanged and relative suggested that she go to a doctor. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]P
had been treating her with Advil and muscle relaxants. She
thought the neck pain was related to sleeping in a bad position

being treated for a brain tumor. The pain was [**6-5**] at its worst
and is currently [**3-5**]. When the pain is at its worst, she also
notices right weakness with writing as well as slight slurring
of
"s" while speaking. Patient was sent home yesterday after
C-spine
MRI was read as negative and was called back in today when final
MRI read showed question of cerebellar mass.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There has been recent right
occipital craniotomy and resection of the previously described
right cerebellar mass lesion. Hemorrhage is seen within the
resection bed.  There is hypodensity of the surrounding
cerebellar parenchyma consistent with edema as previously
described.  The fourth ventricle appears slightly larger in
axial plane compared to the preoperative study of [**8-22**].
There is postoperative pneumocephalus.  There is a small amount
of hyperdensity along the right tentorium, also consistent with
postoperative blood at this locale.  The lateral and third
ventricles are not significantly changed from the preoperative
study.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the cerebral
hemispheres is preserved.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.  There are postoperative changes of
the calvarium, and staples at the posterior scalp.
.
IMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes of the posterior fossa, with
a small amount of hemorrhage in the resection bed and possibly a
small amount associated with the tentorium.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was taken to the OR on [**2134-8-27**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26803**] for
sub-occipital craniotomy and removal of cerebellar tumor.  Final
pathology pending at time of discharge and will be followed up
in Brain tumor clinic.  MRI head performed after the procedure
showed full resection of tumor per Neurosurgery read, final read
pending at discharge and should be checked in follow up.  Pt.
tolerated the procedure with no complications, pain controlled
post-op with Tylenol #3, which she was discharged with.  She was
also discharged on Valium for muscle spasm and a soft collar for
comfort.  Pt. seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] of Neuro-oncology, who
recommended LP after discharge to eval for leptomeningeal spread
prior to consideration of XRT -> pt was asked to call after
discharge to set up an appointment for this.  She was covered
with IV Decadron in house and discharged on 6 mg PO TID per Dr. [**Name (NI) 23016**] recs, she will titrate this off in follow up.  Pt.
had a CT Chest, Abd, and Pelvis for staging prior to d/c, read
of this was pending at time of discharge and should be followed
up in f/o in Brain tumor clinic on [**9-6**].
