2.  Chronic low back pain.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  J-tube placement.
2.  Porta-Cath placement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2194-11-17**], where he went to the Operating Room and had an
esophagogastrectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection.
Postoperatively, the patient had a mild episode of
hypotension which was attributed to the epidural catheter.
The patient was doing well until he became febrile on
[**2194-11-20**].  On [**11-21**], some wound drainage was
seen from the abdominal incision.  A CT scan was obtained
after several days of monitoring the drainage and the scan
revealed a wound dehiscence.

The patient went to the Operating Room on [**11-25**], for
debridement of fascia and a buttress repair of the wound
dehiscence.  Postoperatively, the patient had hypotension and
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

On [**11-29**], the patient had an episode of tachycardias in
to the 160s. Copious amounts of green drainage was seen from
the right chest tube.  Another chest tube was placed which
revealed also copious amounts of drainage.  The patient was
placed on multiple pressors and was intubated.

On [**11-30**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
again for esophageal diversion of his split fistula.
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained and he was
placed on Imipenem, Vancomycin, Fluconazole, Levofloxacin,
for multiple organisms.  He was started on total parenteral
nutrition.

On [**12-2**], the patient grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum.  Gradually, in the
Intensive Care Unit his pressors were weaned.  Tube feeds
were started on [**12-5**].  A follow-up chest CT scan was
obtained which revealed a small right fluid collection which
was significantly improved from the prior.

Tube feeds were advanced to goal and the TPN was discontinued
[**12-8**].  On [**12-8**] also, all antibiotics were
discontinued except for Vancomycin which was kept for MRSA.
The patient had a CT scan guided procedure of a fluid
collection by Interventional Radiology on [**12-13**].

After multiple attempts of extubation and weaning, the
patient was finally extubated on [**12-18**].  On [**12-19**],
all of the chest tubes were removed due to minimal amounts of
drainage.  On [**12-21**], the patient was transferred to the
Floor.

On the Floor, the patient did well, had no complaints.  Tube
feeds were at goal.  The patient was afebrile.

cell count significantly decreased from higher values
obtained during the admission.
