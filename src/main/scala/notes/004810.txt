Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 57533**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
COLONOSCOPY

History of Present Illness:
80yo female with history of diverticulosis, CAD, hypertension,
diabetes, asthma, and recent found fungating 5cm mass in cecum
s/p removal during colonoscopy with no history of surgeries who
presents with bright red/maroon bleeding that started at 11pm.
Patient was in her usual state of health, watching televison
when she had urge to use bathroom and saw BRBPR.  Had repeat
urge and had BRBPR second time and came to ED.
.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: BP 170/80.  Patient was triggered
for active bleeding and felt lightheaded on arrival.
Approximately 700cc-1L of BRBPR lost while in ED.  Given 1U PRBC
with second unit hung.  Platelets were ordered and are ready.
She was ordered for 2 additional units of PRBC, but they had not
been given in ED.  Surgery was consulted and will follow
patient.  IR consulted and is coming in to see patient on
arrival to MICU. GI also consulted and felt there was nothing to
be done from their standpoint secondary to active bleeding.
While in ED, bleeding has slowed down. She had bilateral 16
gauge IVs placed as well as one additional 18 gauge IV.  On
sign-out to MICU HR was 80, BP 116/63, though patient is on
metoprolol.  HCT was 34.6 on arrival.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS T 98.6, BP 109/60, HR 71,
RR 14, 100% on RA.  Patient reported feeling well.  Reported
sudden onset BRBPR slightly after 11pm last night without
abdominal pain, n/v.  [**Doctor First Name **] CP/SOB.  Denies f/c.  Reports
feeling slightly lightheaded on arrival, now improved.  Had 2nd
Unit PRBCs running.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
.
[**5-26**] CT ABD/PELVIS
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:
Bibasilar areas of dependent atelectasis are noted. Otherwise,
imaged lung
bases are clear. There is no pleural effusion. The heart is
normal in size
without pericardial effusion. Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia is
noted.
The liver is homogeneous in attenuation. No focal hepatic lesion
is
identified. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic
biliary
ductal dilatation. The hepatic vasculature is patent. The
gallbladder is
incompletely distended. There is no gallbladder wall edema or
pericholecystic
fluid collection to suggest acute inflammation. There are no
calcified
gallstones within its lumen. The spleen is unremarkable. The
pancreas
enhances homogeneously without ductal dilatation or
peripancreatic fluid
collection. Adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys enhance and
excrete contrast
symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis . A 6-mm left
mid ureteral
stone is unchanged in position without evidence of associated
hydroureteronephrosis. There is a 1.2 x 1 enhancing lesion
arising from the
upper pole of the left kidney (4a:44). Small bowel loops are
unremarkable.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. A small
fat-containing umbilical
hernia is noted.
CT OF THE PELVIS:
Areas of active contrast extravasation are seen at the level of
the cecum.
Increased amount of contrast is seen layering at the site of
extravasation on
delayed phase imaging. No additional area of active contrast
extravasation is
noted. Foley catheter is in place. Small locule of gas in the
bladder is
likely related to Foley placement. The rectum and sigmoid colon
are
unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid within the
pelvis. No
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are seen.

CTA: Intraabdominal aorta and its branches are notable for
extensive
calcified atherosclerotic disease without associated aneurysmal
changes. The
celiac axis appears patent. There is moderate narrowing at its
origin, likely
related to calcified atherosclerotic disease. A replaced right
hepatic artery
originating from the SMA is noted. The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.
Single renal
arteries bilaterally are also patent.
IMPRESSION:
1. Area of active contrast extravasation at the level of the
cecum,
concerning for active bleeding.
2. A 1.2 x 1 cm left renal enhancing lesion is compatible with
RCC. If surgery
is not considered, follow up examination in six months is
recommended to
assess for interval change.
2. Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.
3. A 6-mm left ureteral stone, unchanged in position since
[**2123-5-11**] exam
without associated hydroureteronephrosis.

[**5-27**] COLONOSCOPY
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions Several smal polyps under 5mm were noted
throughout the colon. None were removed in the setting of her
recent GI bleed. Medium non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids were
noted.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with mixed
openings were seen in the sigmoid colon. Diverticulosis appeared
to be of moderate severity. A single non-bleeding 4 cm ulcer was
found in the cecum consistent with her prior polypectomy site.
Several clips were applied with successful hemostasis.  Three
endoclips were successfully applied to the cecum for the purpose
of hemostasis.
Impression: Cecal ulcer was noted at the prior EMR site. There
were no stigmata of bleeding.  There is no visible residual
adenomatous tissue. Several clips were applied to th
