Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
45 yo male Type II DM complicated by neuropathy, HTN,
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome complicated by stroke in
[**2139**], chronic R foot osteomyelitis w/ recent debridement who has
had 4d of fatigue, and increasing lower extremity edema. The
patient has not taken his home medications for the past four
days. The patient also complains of nonproductive cough.  The
patient endorses orthopnea. The patient denies fever, chills,
chest pain or chest pressure.

Upon arrival to the emergency department, initial vitals were:
97.8 80 196/82 18 100%.  The patient had crackles throughout
lungs, an elevated JVD and + S4, with significant lower
extremity edema.  Labs were significant for UA w/out infection,
lactate 1.1, WBC 6.4  Hct 33.2, plt 196, Na 141, K 3.4, Cl 101,
CO2 27, BUN 16, Cr 0.9, glucose 222. BNP 4235. CXR demonstrated
likely multifocal pneumonia with superimposed mild pulmonary
edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. While in the
emergency department, the patient acutely decompensated with
desaturation reportedly to 56% on 2L NC and SBPs in 170s.  The
patient was placed on a non-rebreather and improved to 98%.  The
patient had a CXR that showed much worsening pulmonary edema.
Presumed to be flash pulmonary edema, the patient received 40mg
IV lasix and nitro drip started (SBP 170s at the time). Also
received morphine.  The patient was started on 750mg
levofloxacin.  The cardiology service was consulted in the ED,
and the patient was transferred to the CCU.

Vitals on transfer were  BiPAP  HR 82  160/80  100% RR 18.  Upon
arrival to the CCU: initial vitals were 90 171/82 95% on 50%
aerosol mask

IMAGING:
CXR [**2155-4-24**]: Multifocal pneumonia with superimposed mild
pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2155-4-24**]: Compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in
severity of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, with newly
appeared
consolidations in the retrocardiac lung areas that are likely
atelectatic in nature.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
.
LE DOPPLER:  No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.
.
CXR [**2155-4-25**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
mild decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing
parenchymal opacities.  The heart continues to be large.  There
is ongoing blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the
presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No other changes.  Mild bilateral basal atelectasis.
.
CXR [**2155-4-26**]: There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right, which have increased since the previous study.
There is decrease in the pulmonary interstitial prominence since
the previous study.  There is unchanged cardiomegaly.  There are
no pneumothoraces.
.
ECHO [**2155-4-29**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-2-13**],
the findings are similar.
