Chief Complaint:
pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation/mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
79 yo M w/PMHx sx for atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
Alzheimer's dementia, and congestive heart failure who presents
as a transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital. Patient initially
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital early yesterday morning with
fevers and chest congestion starting the night prior. On the
morning of admission, he was noted to be shaky on his feet, and
had a fever to 101, and his wife called his PCP who advised that
he be brought to the hospital. [**Name (NI) **] wife states that she
was sick with URI symptoms and suspects that she may have
infected him. Patient did receive his flu shot this year. She
states that he did not complain of nausea/vomiting/chest
pain/diarrhea/dysuria.

He was initially admitted to the medicine floor at [**Hospital1 1474**] with
a diagnosis of viral pneumonia based on a positive influenza
DFA. At the time he was noted to be in AF with RVR. Over the
course of the day, however, he became more febrile and
hypotensive, with hypoxia to the 80s-90s and became more
obtunded on exam. He was then sent to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER where he
was intubated and a central line was placed. He was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was given 2 more liters of
IVF and started on levophed.

Imaging:
CXR [**2-5**]:
Tip of the new left supraclavicular central venous line projects
over the upper SVC. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
Dense consolidation in the left lower lobe accompanied by a
small left pleural effusion is stable. There is new
opacification at the right lung base which could represent
another region of atelectasis or aspiration. ET tube in standard
placement. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC. No
pneumothorax.

TTE [**2-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The basal
inferior and septal segments have relatively preserved
contractility. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitaiton. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No prior echo for comparison.

CT Head [**2-11**]:
There is no evidence of mass, mass effect or large acute
territorial infarct, however, acute/subacute ischemic changes
cannot be completely excluded, MRI is recommended if clinically
warranted.

In the brain parenchyma, there are multiple areas with low
density in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with
microvascular ischemic changes. Dense arteriosclerotic
calcifications noted in both carotid siphons as well as in the
left vertebral artery as described above.

Mucosal thickening is identified in the maxillary sinuses with
mucous retention cysts, there is also mucosal thickening in the
sphenoidal, ethmoidal and left mastoid air cells as described
above.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2-12**]:
1. Moderately large left retroperitoneal hematoma expanding the
left psoas and quadratus lumborum.
2. No evidence of bowel obstruction. Sigmoid diverticulosis
without definitive evidence of acute diverticulitis.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Left greater than right bibasilar pleural effusions.
5. Copious stool within rectum.
6. Hypoattenuating segment II liver lesion likely represents a
cyst.

CXR [**2-14**]:
Left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation is persistent.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and probable small right
pleural effusion are unchanged. Cardiomediastinum is within
normal limits. NG tube tip is in the stomach. New faint
ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe could be due to
aspiration given the clinical history.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7518**] is a 79 yo M w/PMHx sx for CHF and dementia
admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of viral
pneumonia secondary to influenza.

#. Respiratory failure.  [**1-30**] viral pneumonia.
Patient supported with mechanical ventilation and treated with
tamiflu for influenza.  Although he was initially treated with
antibiotics for possible bacterial superinfection, he was
transitioned to nafcillin for bronchial washings positive for
MSSA.  He was successfully extubated [**2-10**], and his tamiflu was
stopped after 5 days.  During his course in the ICU, he
developed new leukocytosis in the setting of having NG tube
placed.  He was started on vancomycin/cipro/zosyn to cover
possible aspiration pneumonia or hospital aquired pneumonia.
Course completed [**2151-2-25**].  He is stable on RA at the time of
transfer.

#. Septic shock. Felt to be due to viral pneumonia with
associated fever, bandemia, tachycardia, hypotension.
Patient was supported with aggressive hydration and levophed
during his initial course in the ICU.  His septic physiology
resolved over time.

#. Demand ischemia.
Patient with elevated troponin, with lateral <[**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions on EKG. Patient had AF with RVR initially in the
setting of fever and respiratory distress.
Medically treated with ASA, statin, and beta blockade.  Evidence
of demand ischemia resolved with improved control of heart rate.

#. Atrial fibrillation.
Beta blockade for rate control.  Initially on coumadin, which
was held when his INR became elevated to 7.  Once INR dropped,
he was anticoagulated with heparin gtt.  His heparin was held on
[**2-12**], when a retroperitoneal bleed was identified on CT Abdomen
and pelvis ordered because of concern for obstruction (there was
no evidence of obstruction on CT).  His anticoagulation was
still on hold at the time he was transferred out of the ICU.  On
the general medical floor he was started on full dose aspirin.
No plan at this time to restart coumadin, given his
retroperitoneal bleed.

#. Retroperitoneal bleed:
Found on imaging done for concern of possible obstruction.  Of
note, patient had had elevated INR to 7.5 early in his course.
He was transfused with RBCs and anticoagulation.  Hct responded
appropriately to transfusion and was stable thereafter in Hct
32-34 range.

#. Altered Mental Status - myoclonus and delerium:
Patient was noted to have myoclonal jerking after
