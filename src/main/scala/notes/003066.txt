Chief Complaint:
tibial plateau fracture, [**First Name3 (LF) 8813**] stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-5-23**]
1. [**Month/Day/Year **] valve replacement with a 23-mm Biocor Epic tissue
    valve.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x2:  Left internal
    mammary artery graft to left anterior descending;
    reverse saphenous vein graft to diagonal branch.


History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman with a medical history of A-fib on coumadin
and sotalol and [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] stenosis. She was told by a doctor
(presumably her cardiologist or cardiac surgeon) that she needed
to have her [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve replaced. She
was told this two months ago and because she is scared of the
surgery has not scheduled a date for the surgery. She was
walking and stepped on her left foot oddly, this caused her to
stumble and fall on her left knee. Her daugher who lives with
her was able to help her up and bring her to the ED at [**Hospital 39437**]. She is unable to walk across the room without getting
short of breath. She does not get shortness of breath at rest,
but consistently becomes short of breath with minimal exertion.
She is now being referred to cardiac surgery for evaluation of
an [**Hospital 8813**] vavle repelacment.

CT L Lower ext [**2160-5-18**]:
FINDINGS: There is a comminuted slightly depressed fracture of
the left
tibial plateau which involves the articular surface. The largest
fracture
fragment involves the medial tibial plateau with 4 mm lateral
displacement of the distal tibia. A large anterior fracture
fragment arising from the lateral tibial plateau also
demonstrates slight displacement. Finally, there is a comminuted
fracture of the lateral aspect of the proximal fibula. There is
no evidence of femoral or patellar fracture. Bones are
demineralized. There is a large lipohemarthrosis in the
suprapatellar region and a small [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.  There is soft
tissue edema. There is atrophy of the muscles, particularly the
semimembranosis. The remainder of the soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted tibial and fibular fractures as above.

TTE [**2160-5-19**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>65%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve leaflets (?#) are moderately
thickened. There is severe [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**2-17**]+) [**Month/Day (2) 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and normal
regional excellent global systolic function. Severe [**Month/Day (2) 8813**] valve
stenosis. At least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.


Cardiac cath [**2160-5-20**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this left-dominant system
demonstrated 1 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had
80%
mid-vessel stenosis and there was 70% stenosis at the origin of
a large
diagonal.  The LCx had no significant disease.  The RCA had 50%
mid-vessel stenosis in a non-dominant vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures.

Intra-op TEE [**2160-5-23**]
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
[**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Calcium chunks were also seen on
the atrial aspect of the P2 scallop of anterior mitral leaflelt
probably leading to increased transmitral gradient and mod
mitral stenosis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on this
patient before surgical incision.
