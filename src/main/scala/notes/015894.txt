HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 19484**] is a pleasant, 74
year-old woman with multiple medical problems, presenting
from an outside hospital with a one week history of 8 out of
10 right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea and vomiting,
diarrhea. At an outside hospital, the patient was noted
briefly to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate in
the 130s to 150s. At the outside hospital, the patient was
also noticed to have guaiac positive, black, tarry stools,
hematocrit of 37 and mildly elevated LFTs with Total
bilirubin of 4.2.  INR at outside hospital was 4.02.  She was
given 10 mg of Vitamin K subcutaneously.  On initial
presentation, she denied any reports of chest pain, shortness
of breath or back pain.  Her belly was soft. She has passed
flatus.  Temperature at outside hospital was 99.1, 100.9 by
EMS.  Per report of the patient, she has been febrile to 101
for the past 2 days prior to the initial presentation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for history of pulmonary
embolism, end stage renal disease, congestive heart failure,
diabetes, hypertension and hypothyroidism.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial presentation, she was in
mild painful distress. Vital signs at [**Hospital1 190**] were 98.5, heart rate 99, blood pressure
79/44, respiratory rate 17, oxygen saturation 94% on room
air.  Belly was mildly distended with right upper quadrant
tenderness.  1 to 2 cm palpable liver edge and hypoactive
bowel sounds.  Rectal examination was stool positive guaiac
and black and tarry, with no gross blood visualized.  Bedside
ultrasound showed a positive gallbladder distention with no
wall thickening and the common bile duct was not visualized.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2115-8-1**] for laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus open with
initial diagnosis of cholangitis/cholelithiasis.  Procedure
was uncomplicated. The patient was extubated in stable
condition to the PACU.  Intraoperatively, a nodular liver was
visualized.  Gallbladder specimen was sent for pathology.

Physical examination on initial presentation revealed vital
signs with temperature of 98.5, heart rate 99, blood pressure
97/50, respiratory rate of 17 and oxygen saturation 94%.  The
patient was in painful distress.  The pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
movements intact.  Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes,
rhonchi or rales.  Cardiovascular rate was in sinus rhythm
without murmurs, rubs or gallops, normal S1 and S2.  Belly
was mildly distended with right upper quadrant tenderness.
Hypoactive bowel sounds and a 1 to 2 cm palpable liver edge.
There was no CVA tenderness. It was noted that the patient
had 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema with some venous
stasis changes.  There was no calf tenderness and [**Last Name (un) 5813**]
sign was negative.  Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were intact.
Motor was [**3-28**] throughout and sensation was grossly intact to
light touch.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC dated [**2115-7-30**] revealed a
white count of 19.2, hematocrit of 31.9, CBC [**2115-7-31**] white count was 28.9; hematocrit of 31.5.  CBC on
[**2115-8-5**] revealed a white count of 10.2, hematocrit
of 30.5. CBC on [**8-15**] revealed a white count of 7.2,
hematocrit 27.9.  Final pathology results of the gallbladder
revealed acute and chronic cholecystitis with no calculi.
Liver needle biopsy showing chronic active cholangitis and
cholestasis.  Tri-chrome stain mild increase of portal
fibrosis; iron stain moderate iron deposition and Kupffer
cells.  Hepatic features consistent with large bile duct
obstruction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, Ms. [**Known lastname 19484**] was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2115-7-30**]
from an outside hospital complaining of 8 out of 10 right
upper quadrant pain.  She is admitted for observation.
Ultrasound showed gallbladder distention, no wall thickening.
The common bile duct is not visualized.  The patient was
taken to the operating room on [**2115-8-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**]
and the surgical team for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The
procedure was uncomplicated with minimal blood loss.
Specimen was sent for pathology.  Report listed above.  The
patient was extubated in stable condition to the PACU for
monitoring. The patient was hypotensive with systolic
pressures in the 70s.  Postoperatively, the patient was alert
and oriented x3, moving all extremities.  Speech is clear and
coherent.  Her systolic pressures ranged from the 60s to
100s.  Her left arm with fistula had a positive bruit and a
positive thrill.  Left hand was warm, well perfused, however,
occasionally she reported coolness and purpleness in her
fingers.  She is neurovascularly intact distally. The patient
had a brief period of atrial fibrillation.  She was observed
in the Intensive Care Unit.  Cardiology was consulted and the
patient was treated with intravenous Lopressor 2.5 mg.  On
postoperative day number 3, the patient received 1 unit of
packed red blood cells.  She was started on Coumadin and
heparin.  On [**2115-8-7**], she was taken to
hemodialysis.  She was comfortable, eating breakfast and
watching TV.  Her blood pressure continued to be low with
systolics in the 70s and 80s.  The patient initially had some
respiratory difficulty postoperatively requiring Bi-PAP but
had improved by postoperative day number 3 and had been
relatively stable since. At that time, the patient appeared
to have been fluid over loaded despite her hypotension and
presumed intravascular volume depletion.  Overall, by
postoperative day number 3, she had much improved and denied
any pain.

On postoperative day number 4, the patient was tilt negative.
The use of an alpha agonist p.o. was discussed and the use of
a concurrent beta blocker was discussed. There was concern
for blunting potential responses to her hypotension.  This
was discussed with the cardiology fellow who stated that the
team would review the patient again with the rest of the
cardiology team.  The patient tolerated solid foods.  With
regards to Ms. [**Known lastname 19484**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19598**] atrial fibrillation, she was
fairly asymptomatic. Rhythm control was attempted with
Amiodarone per cardiology's recommendation 600 mg p.o. q. day
x3 weeks. She was to be sent home on a Kingdom Heart
monitoring for her bradycardia.  She also had several 3
second pauses throughout the night. Given the conversion
pauses since starting Amiodarone, one of 3.3 seconds and the
other of 4.1 seconds, cardiology recommended discontinuing
the use of the Amiodarone and convert back to rate control,
Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day and to cut back on the patient's
Valsartan dose, which was eventually discontinued.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy worked with the
patient.  On [**2115-8-12**], the patient was taken to
echocardiography which showed mild left atrial dilatation,
mild right ventricular hypokinesis, 1+ mitral regurgitation
and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 65%.
Chest x-ray on that date showed bilateral moderate pleural
effusion.  Her Midodrine dose was increased to 7.5 three
times a day. Endocrine and [**Hospital **] clinic were consulted for
management of patient's hypothyroidism, Levothyroxine dose
and blood sugars.

On [**2115-8-10**], house officer was called to see the
patient for somnolence, low blood pressure, tinnitus, mild
confusion, fatigue and blurry vision.  These side effects
were seen to be consistent with the side effects of Neurontin
which was discontinued at that time.  On [**2115-8-12**],
the patient was comfortable, denied headaches, ataxia or any
other further visual changes now off of the Dilantin. She was
able to perform finger to nose and had no disdiadochokinesia.
Thyroid function tests were checked. A TSH was elevated.
This was discussed with endocrine who recommended increasing
her Levothyroxine dose.  This was increased to 200 mcg q.
day.  Blood sugars on [**8-1
