Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-24**] attempt at central line

radiology

History of Present Illness:
69F with Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets, recently started C1
chemotherapy (cisplatin/Taxol?) at [**Company 2860**] last week, presents with
fatigue, nausea and vomiting. She has had nausea and vomiting
since the weekend.  Compazine was attempted without relief. This
has caused her to reduce her PO intake and to feel dehydrated.
She denies diarrhea, has only mild nausea.  She states that any
PO intake other than apple sauce causes nausea, and that she
vomits most food up within 30 minutes, although not
consistently.  She continues to have 1 soft BM/day.  She denies
change in her stool or urine consistency, color, or frequency.
She complains of thirst.
.
Her family reports decreased leg strength such that they must
carry her around the home.  She states that she has been unable
to stand or walk for the last few days, although she is not
entirely clear the duration of this problem.  She has noticed
that her left eyelid is drooping, again for several days.  She
and her family are concerned about recurrent vasogenic cerebral
edema, as the patient is tapering off steroids and these
symptoms are similar to her prior presentation in [**2198-1-4**].

.
In the ED, initial vitals were stable (specifics unknown).  She
was given 1L NS and dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 (@ 1515).
.
On the floor, she complains of thirst and of mild nausea.  She
has had no emesis since arriving at the hospital.  She also
states that she has trouble seeing out of her left eye at times
and has occasional diplopia.  Family is not available at the
time of the interview, and the patient appears slightly confused
although oriented x3.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**]:
T 97.0  BP 124/61  P 68 R 16. Mental status examination shows of
alertness, orientation, but unable to provide her full history
and difficulty accounting for recent events. On cranial nerve
examination, eye movements are restricted to the left. There is
complex nystagmus with conjugate eye movements. Pupils are equal
and reactive. Face is symmetric, except the right palpebral
fissure is slightly larger. No dysarthria. On motor examination,
there is trace weakness of left knee extension. She has moderate
arm ataxia with FNF. Light touch is perceived well throughout.
Reflexes are brisk but symmetric, except left ankle jerk is
hypoactive. She need two person assist, and walks with ataxic
gait in addition to baseline hemiparetic gait. On general
examination, the oropharynx is clear, air movements are
decreased on the right, the heart is regular, the legs are
without edema or tenderness.

Imaging:
EEG ([**3-20**]):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of multifocal epileptic discharges more prominent in the
right posterior quadrant. These findings are indicative of
multiple areas of cortical irritability with potential
epileptogenicity particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
In addition, background is diffusely slow indicative of a mild
to moderate diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. No
electrographic seizures are present. Note is made of borderline
tachycardia throughout the recording.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F with Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets, recently completed C1
chemotherapy (cisplatin/Taxol?), presents with fatigue, nausea
and vomiting.
.
# NSCLC stage IV with brain mets complicated non-convulsive
seizure activity: Recently completed C1 chemotherapy at [**Company 2860**],
likely with cisplatin/paclitaxel.  CT head shows stable
hemorrhagic brain mets, no ICH, midline shift, or infarct. EEG
during this hospitalization showed seizure activity.  Started on
dexamethasone, and given lacosamide/keepra/phosphenytoin for
seizure control. Her seizure activity continued. Family meeting
was held and it was decided that patient should be DNR/DNI. The
only further option for seizure control would be valium drip,
which would require intubation. Given her poor prognosis, she
was made CMO and transferred to the floor where she expired.
.
#Septic shock with group A strep bacteriemia and urine growing
ecoli in the setting of neutropenia: Source of bacteriemia
possibly infiltrated IV in R antecubital fossa/ cellulitis.
Ultrasound of site demonstrated superficial thrombophlebitis of
the right cephalic vein and severe edema in the antecubital
fossa and medial forearm, corresponding to known cellulitis.
Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime upon transfer to
the intensive care u
