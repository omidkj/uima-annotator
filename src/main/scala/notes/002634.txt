half blood and half sputum.  Initially, the chest x-ray may

appearance.  The patient denied any chest pain but did feel
that he had increased pulsations in the neck over the last
few days.

radiation therapy for his anal cancer.  He also complains of

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of an inner ear cancer.  Father
had diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and brother
has alcohol abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient was
afebrile at 98.4, blood pressure 106/72, respiratory rate 28,
pulse 120.  Initially on presentation, he was only saturating
at 83% in room air.  After giving him three liters nasal
cannula, he saturated to 92%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination -  He had moist mucous membranes.  Jugular
venous pressure to the angle of the jaw.  His skin had woody
lymphedema, left leg greater than the right with positive
scrotal edema.  He has no Kaposi lesions.  Respiratory- He
had good air entry bilaterally but he had bilateral fine
crackles at the bases and some bronchial breath sounds at the
right upper lobe.  Cardiovascular examination - harsh III/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the base and left sternal border.
The abdomen has positive bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended, no organomegaly.  His extremities showed
nonpitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8,7, platelet count
157,000.  Electrolytes were essentially unremarkable.
Neutrophils 75%.

CT of the chest on [**2109-10-8**], showed multiple pulmonary
nodules, associated ground glass opacities, new lung nodules
at the bases compared to [**2109-7-30**], minor scarring at the
right apex.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was put on respiratory
precautions for his increasing shortness of breath with
hemoptysis.  He was ruled out for tuberculosis and multiple
induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage from his
bronchoscopy sent for cytology and bacterial and fungal viral
infection.  Essentially, his bronchoalveolar lavage had
negative cytology for malignant cells.  His cryptococcal
antigen was negative.  Three sets of acid fast bacilli and
cultures were negative.  Coccidiodes was still pending to
date.  His still antigen is negative.  His sputum culture
only grew sparse growth of yeast.  Fungal cultures were
negative.  Legionella was negative.  PCP was tested for and
was negative.  Nocardia negative.  Urine culture times two
negative.  Blood cultures and fungal cultures no growth to
date.

The patient obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram which
showed an ejection fraction of 50% and akinesis of the apex
and paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum.  He
had some right ventricular hypertrophy with mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation and at least some mild pulmonary hypertension.

Because all his laboratories were essentially negative for an
infectious disease workup, the patient was scheduled for a
VATS procedure and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram while
under general anesthesia.  The patient went for the VATS
procedure on [**2109-10-16**], and failed extubation with pCO2 in the
90s.  The patient was reintubated and transferred from te
Post Anesthesia Care Unit to the SICU on Neo-Synephrine and
pressure support of [**11-9**].  The Neo-Synephrine was
discontinued after twelve hours and the patient was
successfully extubated.  His last arterial blood gas on
[**2109-10-18**], was pH 7.35/57/85.  The patient's VATS had
demonstrated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  The
Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial dilatation, 2+
aortic regurgitation, no mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation and no pericardial effusion, and a prosthetic
mitral valve.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] spoke with the patient about his diagnosis of
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the lung.  It was
agreed with the patient that he would be discharged with
Hospice care and no further intervention was to be pursued.

The patient was discontinued on all his antiretroviral
treatments and was only continued on pain control management
anxiety control medications and his antidepressant medication
as well as supplemental oxygen.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is DNR/DNI.
