Studies:
Head CT [**4-9**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarction. Please note that if ischemia is of
significant clinical concern evaluation with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted imaging is suggested as this is a more
sensitive means of evaluation.
2. Aerosolized secretions and mucosal thickening of the sphenoid
sinus could indicate acute sinusitis in the appropriate context.
Opacification of a few right-sided mastoid air cells.
.
CXR [**4-9**]:
1. Lines and tubes appear well positioned as described above.
2. Left lower lobe and mid lung opacities likely representing
effusion and
atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process cannot be
entirely
excluded.
.
CXR [**4-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
Persistent complete opacification of the left hemithorax
consistent with a combination of left lung collapse and known
left pleural effusion.
