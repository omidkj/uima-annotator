Pertinent Results:
[**2176-8-13**] PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %). 4. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. 5. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 6. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The valve behaves as a functional bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 8. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine,
AV pacing, sinus rhythm with long PR interval, preserved
biventricular systolic function, no new regional wall motion
abnormalities, trace AR, mild MR, aortic contour remains normal
post decanulation.
[**2176-8-15**] Echo: The left ventricular cavity is small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is small.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve
is not well seen. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). The epicardial surface of the heart is poorly
visualized. A consolidated pericardial effusion (? thrombus)
cannot be excluded on the basis of this study. Both ventricles
appear small, but this study cannot distinguish between
extrinsic compression and underfilling.
[**2176-8-15**] Abd x-ray: Multiple air-filled non-distended loops of
small bowel with a small quantity of air in the colon is most
consistent with a post-operative ileus.
[**2176-8-18**] KUB:Gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are present
with multiple air-fluid levels, consistent with an ileus
pattern. Note is made of a left effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**8-10**] with chest pain. He received
medical management and had negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG
changes. Underwent a cardiac cath on [**8-12**] which showed severe
coronary artery disease. Underwent usual pre-operative work-up
and was brought to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-13**].
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips. Later that evening he
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers
and diuretics and diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later this
day he was transferred to the step-down floor and began
increasing his activity level. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing
wires removed per protocol. On post-op day two he developed
nausea and vomiting. An nasogastric tube was placed and KUB
done. X-ray showed multiple air-filled non-distended loops of
small bowel with a small quantity of air in the colon,
consistent with a post-operative ileus.  Aggressive bowel
regimen was instated and he was made NPO.  With time he moved
his bowels and his radiographs improved.  His nasogastric tube
was removed and trialed on clears, which he tolerated without
incident.  His diet was advanced as his radiographs and symptoms
improved. He was having multiple loose bowel movements at the
time of discharge and he was tolerating a full oral diet.
Finger sticks were 80-153 and he was advised to follow up with
PCP for blood sugar management given his elevated A1C after
discharge from rehab. By post-operative day 6 he was ready for
discharge to [**Hospital 392**] Rehab.
