Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with stent placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12412**] is a 77 year-old man with a history of coronary
artery disease who initially presented with chest pain, now with
continued chest and back pain post cardiac catheterization.
.
Patient reports initial episode of chest pain on [**1-4**], just
after eating breakfast.  Described as pressure with some
stabbing, mild associated back pain but without jaw or arm
radiation or SOB/diapheresis.  He took two aspirin and within 30
minutes the pain had subsided.  At 6pm, just after dinner, the
patient had recurrence of chest pain, similar in quality though
more severe and with radiation to his back and bilateral arms.
This pain did not remit so he presented to an OSH for
evaluation.
.
At the OSH, initial troponin I was 0.65 with a CK of 86.  An ECG
showed questinoable ST-elevations in V2-V3. He was started on
heparin gtt, nitro gtt, given plavix 800mg x1, Lipitor 80mg x1,
Metoprolol 5mg IV x1, aspirin 325 and then transferred here for
further evaluation.  During his time at the OSH he did become
chest pain fre.
.
After arriving at [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were stable with BPs ranging
98-134 systolic with HRs in the 60s.  He reported having chest
pain and nitro and heparin gtts were continued.
.
On the morning following admission, he was taken to the cath lab
at which time LMCA and diag stents were placed.  During the
procedure he continued to have back pain and an aortogram was
performed showing no dissection.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or
palpitations, He does report some LE edema.  Of note, he reports
that the pain he had surrounding his prior angioplasty was more
back pain than chest pain.

.
ECG [**2134-1-5**]: Sinus rhythm. P-R interval prolongation. Left axis
deviation. Low limb lead voltage. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2134-1-5**]: 1. LMCA plus 2 vessel coronary
artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension with elevated right sided
filling
pressures.
3. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LMCA.
4. Placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal Diagonal.
.
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
No thoracic aortic dissection identified but study is not
adequate to exclude dissection (other imaging modalities such as
TEE, CMR or CT are recommended for that purpose, if clinically
indicated). Suboptimal views of the ascending aorta and aortic
arch obtained.
.
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal
septum. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
probable mid to distal anterior hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**2134-1-6**]: Sinus rhythm
Lateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific but cannot exclude
ischemia
Since previous tracing of [**2134-1-5**], no significant change
.
ECG [**2134-1-7**]: Baseline artifact
Sinus rhythm; Anterolateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific
but cannot exclude ischemia ; Since previous tracing of
[**2134-1-6**], further precordial lead T wave abnormalities now
present

Brief Hospital Course:
1. ST ELEVATION MI
Mr. [**Known lastname 12412**] presented to the CCU after having a ST-Elevation MI
and was found to have a left main coronary artery lesion on
cardiac cath, a 90% diagonal stenosis and a 50-60% stenosed
right coronary artery.  He had a drug-eluting stent placed to
his LMCA and a bare metal stent to the Diagonal.  His cardiac
enzymes peaked that evening with a CK of 378, CKMB of 29, MBI of
7.7 and a troponin of 0.97 and then trended down.  During the
catheterization, the patient was having severe back pain.  An
aortogram was done to assess for an aortic dissection and was
negative for dissection.  He had an emergent echo to assess for
pericardial tamponade which was negative.  After the cath he was
put on a nitroglycerin drip for symptom releif.  The was weaned
off the night of admission and his chest and back pain resolved.
 He was given aspirin, plavix, lipitor and metoprolol.  He was
given integrillin for 18 hours post-stenting.  He was started on
a low-dose ACE inhibitor on [**2134-1-8**].  He had one recurrence of
chest pain the morning of [**2134-1-7**].  This resolved with
sublingual NTG and there were no ECG changes.  He was discharged
chest pain free on aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg, metoprolol and
lisinopril.  He should have a repeat cardiac catheterization in
2 months for a relook and the cardiac cath lab here will contact
him for this.  He was told to continue his Plavix and not stop
it for any procedure.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] as his
cardiologist.

2. BACK PAIN
The patient's back pain was felt to be an anginal equivalent.
