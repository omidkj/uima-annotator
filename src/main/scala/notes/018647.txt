HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year old female
patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, coronary artery disease status post non-Q wave
myocardial infarction in [**2192-7-11**], chronic renal
tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, and chest computerized
tomography scan.  The patient was initially admitted to the
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital status post a fall.  The patient was found
to have a left pneumothorax and during the hospital course
developed a right lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient was
treated with antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
rehabilitation where she had acute respiratory decompensation
requiring intubation.  The patient was extubated within 24 to
48 hours of readmission to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, however, the
patient failed this extubation and the remainder of the
hospital course included an additional two episodes of failed
extubation for a total of three failed extubations.  It was
felt that these failed extubations were likely secondary to
right lower lobe pneumonia versus right lower lobe collapse.
Of note, bronchoscopy obtained two weeks prior to transfer
revealed pus in the right lower lobe positive for
Stenotriphomonas.  The patient's treatment for the
Stenotriphomonas included Cefepime, Levaquin, Ceptaz
according to the physician at [**Hospital3 105**].  Other
significant hospital course includes the patient being found
to have sputum that was positive for Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and stool that was positive for
Clostridium difficile.

11. Quinapril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12. Clonidine 2 puffs q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 60 pack year history of
tobacco use.  Denies any alcohol use.  The patient stopped
smoking five years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, pulse 83,
blood pressure 146/82, oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters of
nasal cannula.  Generally, the patient was intubated in no
apparent distress, alert and oriented.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination reveals him to be normocephalic,
atraumatic with pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
There is presence of orogastric tube and endotracheal tube in
place.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally except for sparse coarse breath
sounds at the right base.  Heart was irregular without any
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, obese, nontender
and nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
examination reveals there was 3+ pitting edema of the left
lower extremity and 1% nonpitting edema of the right lower
extremity.  Neurological, the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.5, hematocrit 27.0,
platelets 317, PT 13.4, PTT 34.3, INR 1.1, calcium 7.7,
albumin 2.3, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 4.1, sodium 138,
potassium 5.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 69,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 85.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 79 year old female patient
status post intubation secondary to pneumonia.  She has had
failed extubation times three at an outside hospital admitted
for tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
and a chest computerized tomography scan.

1.  Pulmonary - The patient is status post intubation
secondary to pneumonia.  The patient received a tracheostomy
the morning of [**8-24**].  There were no complications.
The patient is scheduled for a noncontrast chest computerized
tomography scan which is not performed at the time of
dictation but will be performed prior to discharge.  Addendum
will be dictated with the results of computerized tomography
scan.  The patient will also receive a bronchoscopy to
evaluate the right lower lobe pneumonia/pus previously found
on previous bronchoscopy.  The patient has had increased
secretions while in this hospital and it was felt that
bronchoscopy would be beneficial to this patient.  There was
also bronchoscopy done at the time of dictation and cultures
will probably be pending at the time of discharge.  The
patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was stable
during this hospital stay controlled with Albuterol and
Atrovent metered dose inhalers.

2.  Infectious disease - History of pneumonia and Clostridium
difficile positive.  The patient was placed on contact
precautions for Clostridium difficile as well as history of
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient
will be continued on Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. for the
Clostridium difficile and pneumonia coverage was covered with
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day.  An Infectious Disease
consult was obtained to evaluate for the necessity of
Cefepime.  It was felt that with Stenotrophomonas, the
patient would benefit from Bactrim for more specific
coverage.  Although outside hospital states that the
Stenotrophomonas was sensitive to Levofloxacin and Cefepime
it is felt that Bactrim is better activity against this
microbiology and in the future if not contraindicated would
recommend switching antibiotics to Bactrim.  It was also felt
that the patient did not need to be on Cefepime for double
coverage given no evidence of Pseudomonas with current
cultures.  The patient was just kept on Levofloxacin 250 mg
p.o. b.i.d.

3.  Gastrointestinal - The patient had a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed at 2:30 PM on [**8-24**].  There were no complications post procedure and tube
feeds began 24 hours after placement.

4.  Cardiac - History of coronary artery disease with
nonspecific myocardial infarction.  The patient was continued
on chronic medications including Labetalol, Flagyl, Quinapril
and Atorvastatin.  The patient was found to be in atrial
flutter which apparently was known at the outside hospital.

5.  Renal - Patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency, the patient showed no evidence of an elevated
creatinine while at this hospital.  Chest computerized
tomography scan obtained is no contrast and should not affect
the renal function.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable at the time of
discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient will be discharged back to
Vancouver/[**Hospital3 105**] for further rehabilitation after
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, tracheostomy, chest
computerized tomography scan and bronchoscopy performed at
this hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with recurrent
failed extubation attempts.
2. Placement of percutaneous trachesostomy
3. Stenotrophomonas Pneumonia
