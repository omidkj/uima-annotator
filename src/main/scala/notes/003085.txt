History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old female who woke up the morning of [**2187-4-19**]
with severe periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
She vomitted 7 times, and reports no blood.  Her pain became
epigastric in nature but did not radiate, stayed in midline of
her abdomen.  She reports normal bowel movements, no diarrhea
and no RUQ pain.  She had been in her USOH before this time and
denies any other concerns.  She presented to [**Hospital3 **]
that day, and her vitals there were significant for low-grade
temp (100.4), blood pressure was stable in the 120s-140s, and
persistently tachycardic in the 120s.  Her ALT was 380, AST 514,
T bili 1.1, Alk phos 242, amylase 2960, lipase 3990, and she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] ICU with a presumed diagnosis of gallstone
pancreatitis.

While there, she initial received not enough IVF per their
notes, and her creatinine increased from 1.6 on admit to 2.9
this AM.  She received 2L NS bolus and her UOP remained low
(15-30 cc/hr).  Her LFTs decreased, amylase decreased, calcium
was very low at 6.0.  Her creatinine increased to 2.6 this
afternoon.  Her imaging studies demonstrated diffusely enlarged
pancreas c/w pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, ascites.  MRCP showed
pancreatitis, normal bile and pancreatic ducts, diffusely
swollen and edematous pancreas, peripancreatic soft tissue
stranding, no pseudocyst or abscess.  Her gallbladder was
distended.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. Diverticulitis
3. ETOH Abuse

Social History:
Used to drink alcohol heavily until [**2174**].  Smoked [**1-12**] cigs/day,
quit years ago.  Lives in [**Location 2624**] with her daughter and
son-in-law.  Does not work.  Came here from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**] 5 years
ago.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
100.5  141/80  127  31  95% 2L
Gen: awake, alert, oriented, interactive, NAD
HEENT:  anicteric, MM very dry
Neck: supple
Lungs: decreased breath sounds with scattered bibasilar crackles
CV: tachycardic, reg, no m/r/g
Abd: distended, tympanic, no bowel sounds, TTP over epigastrium
without rebound
Ext: no edema, 2+ distal pulses, feet warm


Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2187-4-23**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. IVC appears collapsed and
underfilled. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
CT Abd [**2187-4-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated small bowel to 3.1 cm consistent with ileus, although
early small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
2. Heterogeneous-appearing pancreas with significant amount of
stranding consistent with severe pancreatitis. Comment on
necrosis cannot be made without IV contrast, but the appearance
is highly supicious.
3. Ascites.
4. Subcutaneous soft tissue nodule in the posterior tissues of
uncertain clinical significance.
.
CT Abd with IV contrast [**2187-4-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Severe pancreatitis with marked inflammatory change
about the pancreas and into the mesentery. This follow-up CT
with contrast confirms the prior impression that most of the
pancreas is replaced by a necrotic fluid collection. Other than
increased ascites, the appearance is likely little changed.
.
[**2187-5-1**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION: Interval stable appearance of severe pancreatitis
with replacement of the neck and body of the pancreas with an
inflammatory phlegmon. No residual enhancement of normal
pancreas tissue is identified in these regions. Pancreatic and
head tissue do enhance. Persistent ileus.
