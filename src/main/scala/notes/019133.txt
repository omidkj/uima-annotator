Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 54-year-old female with no
known CAD presents to outside facility with complaints of two
hours of substernal chest pain.  Prior to this, she had
approximately two weeks of chest pain that was intermittent
usually associated with coughing.  On the morning of
admission, her pain became constant and that is why she came
to the emergency department.  Initially, she was
hemodynamically stable and in atrial fibrillation with a
blood pressure of 124/75 and heart rate in the 90s.  She had
0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads III and aVF with [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in leads I and aVL.  She was given sublingual
nitroglycerin x1 with a drop in her systolic blood pressures
to the 60s and development of a narrow complex.  Heart block
with an escape rhythm of 30 to 35.  The patient became
hypoxic with mental status changes, and she was intubated.

The patient was placed on dopamine and Levophed.  She headed
straight to the cardiac catheterization lab, where she was
found to have 100 percent proximal RCA lesion with left to
right collaterals, 50 percent proximal D1 lesion, 50 percent
LAD, 100 percent left circumflex lesion with retrograde
filling.  A Cypher stent was placed to her RCA; 4 plus MR was
noted with ejection fraction of 30 percent.  Pressures
included right atrium 16, pulmonary artery 49/26, and wedge
25.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer 11 years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATION:  Prempro.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.3 degrees, heart rate
100, blood pressure 124/70, 100 percent oxygen saturation on
SMV 12, 550, FiO2 70 percent intubated, sedated.  Heart:
Tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2.  A 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the apex.  Lungs:  Coarse bilaterally with
expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen:  With normoactive bowel sounds,
soft, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Cold, mild
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neuro:  Sedated.
Lines, left IJ introducer with 3 plus oozing.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the outside hospital, white count 10.5,
hematocrit 40.5, INR 1.0, potassium 3.8, and creatinine 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 54-year-old female with history of lung
cancer from outside hospital status post cardiac
catheterization for ST-elevation and inferior MI.

Myocardial infarction.  The patient was placed on Plavix,
aspirin, nystatin, and Integrilin for 18 hours
postcatheterization.  In addition, she was started on beta-
blocker and ACE inhibitor.

Severe MR.  The patient will likely need mitral valve
replacement in the future.  She will follow up in 6 weeks'
time.  She was maintained on ACE inhibitor for afterload
reduction.  An echocardiogram showed an EF of 25 percent with
severe hypokinesis inferolaterally and moderate hypokinesis
laterally.  The patient will have an echo in four weeks.

Hypothermia on admission to the floor.  This resolved with a
warming blanket.

Questionable seizure during cardiac cath lab.  The patient
was placed on an Ativan drip overnight.

Respiratory failure.  The patient was weaned off of the
ventilator without difficulty.

High right-sided filling pressures.  The patient was diuresed
gently with low-dose Lasix.

Ventricular tachycardiaThe patient had one episode of ventricular
tachycardia in the setting of dobutamine and within less than 24
hours of her myocardial infarction.  There were no more episodes
noted on telemetry during her hospitalization.

Anemia.  The patient had a drop in her
hematocrit during her hospitalization.  She was transfused
two units of packed red blood cells.  There were no signs of
bleeding.

The patient was full code.

CHF.  The patient had a low ejection fraction.  She was
maintained on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker, and placed on a
low-salt diet and diuresed lightly with furosemide.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home
with services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Inferior myocardial infarction.

Severe mitral regurgitation.

Low ejection fraction of 25 percent.

Congestive heart failure.

Post myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia.

History of lung cancer.

Anemia

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  Followup with PCP within seven to ten
days.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; appointment is set up for
