RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is slightly
distended with some gallbladder wall edema. Mobile sludge is
seen within the lumen of the gallbladder. No shadowing stones
are identified. The liver parenchyma appears unremarkable. There
is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilation. The hepatic veins, hepatic arteries and portal veins
are patent, with flow in appropriate directions, and normal
waveforms. The right kidney appears unremarkable. There is no
evidence of ascites.
.
IMPRESSION: Slightly distended gallbladder with gallbladder wall
edema could be consistent with acalculous cholecystitis.
Recommend correlation with HIDA scan if clinical concern exists.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 57923**] is a 65-year-old gentleman who
was admitted for stem cell transplant and developed overwhelming
sepsis 2 weeks into his hospital stay and ultimately passed away
with multi-organ failure.
.
1. Heme/Onc:
He has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma which has been
recurrent/refractory following his autologous stem cell
transplant and is being admitted today for his non-myeloablative
allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor with
Cytoxan/Fludarabine conditioning regimen. He was started on a
cytoxan/fludarabine conditioning regimen, which he tolerated
quite well.  Prior to starting he had a pMIBI for some
concerning finding on screening echo, which showed some fixed
inferoapical scars, nothing reversible.  He was able to proceed
with transpalnt.  On [**3-28**] he received his sister's stem cells (a
nun and never been pregnant), and tolerated this well.  He was
treated with methotrexate after the transplant of cells.  He was
started on continuous CSA as [**Doctor Last Name **] as empiric antibiotics per
protocol.  He was started also on GCSF on day 5 of transplant.
.
2. Sepsis:
On [**2186-4-5**], day 8 post-transplant, the pt was noted to be
hypotensive. He got out of bed to go to the restroom and after
exiting the restroom was noted to have a fall that was witnessed
by his nurse. He later recalled feeling light-headed while
standing up just before falling. After a few moments of
unresponsiveness, he regained alertness although was noted to
have sbp in the 70's to 80's. He was afebrile at that time, it
was thought that he may be vasovagal, although he was sent to
the MICU for closer monitoring. By the time he arrived at the
MICU, his bp remained persistently low despite fluids, he was
noted to be febrile and was found to have elevated lacate. He
was treated per sepsis protocol, given multiple liters of IV NS,
given stress dose steroids, started on levophed. He was started
empirically on very broad spectrum abx coverage including fungal
coverage given his immunosuppressed state. He was given blood
for low hct in the setting of septic shock. An arterial bp line
was attempted in the femoral artery but was unsuccessful. His bp
remained tenuous even with the support. An a-line was placed by
anesthesia the following morning. He was intubated by anesthesia
as well for shortness of breath in the setting of CHF with
massive IVF infusion. He required increasing level of pressor
suppport and was on high doses of three pressors.
    Over the following several days, the pt developed
progressively worsening multiple organ dysfunction. Renal
failure, coagulopathy reflected by elevated INR, metabolic
acidosis became worse. The pt was requiring maximal doses of 3
pressors, levophed, dopamine, and phenylephrine to maintain map
around 60. Broad spectrum abx coverage was continued, vital
signs were supported. Ultrasound guided cholecystotomy was
performed to drain a suspected source of infection. Blood
cultures were found to be positive for E. coli and viridans
strep, which were sensitive to the antibiotics which he was on.
   On [**4-8**] in the evening the pt became progressively unstable,
the pt developed rapid tachycardia at 160 bpm. The ECGs were
faxed to EP fellow on call. The rhythm was noted to be reverting
from atrial flutter to atrial tachycardia, and atrial
fibrillation. Amiodarone was infused IV with the plan to
cardiovert, although the pt spontaneously returned to NSR at
roughly 130 bpm. Amio was continued as a drip. Given the
downward trend in the course, a discussion was held with the
family regarding pt's critical condition.
     The following morning, on [**4-9**], the pt was found to be on an
irreversible course toward passing away. His bp was dropping
below life sustaining levels despite maximal pressor support,
liver tests indicated hepatocellular damage likely from
hypoperfusion, acidemia was becoming more severe. Discussions
were held with the family by multiple physicians including the
oncologist. The pt was made CMO and was extubated at around
10am. Shortly thereafter, he was found to have ceased
spontaneously respiratory effort and was without a pulse and he
was pronounc
