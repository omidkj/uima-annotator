2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2193-5-11**] demonstrated: L atrium
dilation. Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30-35%). RV moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. No AS or AR. Moderate to severe (3+) MR, Moderate
to severe [3+] TR. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] Small pericardial effusion with no signs of
tamponade.

[**2193-5-16**]   Cardiology ECHO
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta and
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion, most
prominent near the inferior wall. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Mild left atrial appendage spontaneous echo contrast
with depressed ejection velocities. No left atrial/appendage
thrombus seen. Hypokinetic LV with moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 YOF with Afib on coumadin, systolic CHF with EF 30%, HTN, who
presented with palpatations and found to be in Afib with RVR,
and heart failure, treated in the CCU with dopamine drip for
hypotension/bradycardia likely associated to IV diltiazem +
other nodal agents. TEE and DCCV planned for [**5-16**].
.
Mrs [**Known lastname 99458**] had episode of hypotension secondary to low cardiac
output in the setting of bradycardia as the result of multiple
nodal agents for RVR control (received 40 IV dilt + 20 PO dilt +
home metoprolol + 240 verapamil CR).  She had a repeat ECHO
showed small pericardial effusion, EF stable (EF 30-35%) with 3+
MR, 3+ TR.  She was transiently maintained on dopamine,
amiodarone, atropine, calcium gluconate.  Antihypertensives were
held.  She was continued on amiodarone and started on metoprolol
for her atrial fibrillation.  She was diuresised aggressively
and was placed on standing lasix for her heart failure.  She
underwent DCCV after TEE, after which she was in sinus rhythm.
After the cardioversion, she was discharged in stable condition
with significant modification in her medications.  She will
follow up with her PCP and cardiologist.
