Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 32912**]
Chief Complaint:
2cm cyst in body of pancreas with history of recurrent
pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Robotic-assisted minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and
splenectomy with intraoperative ultrasound.

splenic artery, and placement of intra-abdominal drain.
3. Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and drainage of
left upper quadrant intra-abdominal fluid collection.


History of Present Illness:
38 y/o female with a history of multiple episodes
of pancreatitis and a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas
who
comes to the office for surgical evaluation. In short, her first
episode of pancreatitis was in [**2130-2-28**], when she presented
with epigastric pain radiating to the back. She was
hospitalized,
and CT of the abdomen showed a ~2 cm cystic mass in the body of
the pancreas, and evidence of pancreatitis in the pancreatic
tail. She was discharged and was doing well until [**2131-7-29**],
when
she again presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back.
Work-up during her second hospitization was notable for
triglyceride of 830, lipase of 782, and normal LFTs; MRCP showed
no significant interval change in the pancreatic cystic mass,
atrophy of the pancreatic tail, no biliary dilatation, no
gallstones, no choledocholithiasis. Her pancreatitis was
attributed to elevated triglycerides, and she was put on
gemfibrazil. On [**2131-9-7**], she was seen outpatient in the
HPB Surgery Clinic. It was recommended that she undergo fine
needle aspiration of the cystic mass with endoscopic ultrasound.
Since then, she's had another episode of pancreatitis, and GI
performed FNA of the cyst, which was acellular with CEA of
43ng/Ml and amylase of 109,200. After being seen in surgery
clinic twice by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation, it was felt
that she likely had a mucinous cystic neoplasm and that it was
likely the cause of her recurrent pancreatitis. The patient was
advised on her options, including imaging surveillance, no
surgery, repeat endoscopic ultrasound to test the cyst fluid
CEA, and surgical
excision.  The patient desired to proceed with surgical
management, and the plan was made with the patient to perform a
robotic assisted distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 y/o female with a history of multiple episodes
of pancreatitis and a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas
who, after being seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], decided to go
forward with surgical management of her pancreatic cyst.  On
[**2131-10-10**] the patient underwent a robotic-assisted minimally
invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with
intraoperative ultrasound with no intraoperative complications.
After a brief stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor
NPO, on IV fluids with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid PCA for
pain control.  During the first night after surgery, she became
tachycardic, for which she received two 500cc LR boluses, and
then a 1L LR bolus, and a hematocrit was checked that came back
at 27.6, with a repeat hematocrit 4 hours later being 24.3.
Given her persistent tachycardia and falling hematocrit, she was
transfused one unit of blood and received a CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis on the morning of [**2131-10-11**] that showed the
presence of hematoma adjacent to the divided pancreas without
evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma related to the inferior
epigastric artery.  After discussion of the risks and benefits
of surgery with the patient, and 2 telephone attempts to contact
her significant other, she was taken to the operating room for
urgent exploratory laparotomy.  On operation, she was found to
be bleeding from the edge of her intact splenic artery staple
line, and underwent oversewing and repair of the splenic artery
with placement of an intra-abdominal drain.  On the evening
following her re-operation, she acutely desaturated in to the
85% range and became tachycardic into the 140's, prompting a CTA
of the chest that revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but
did show a multifocal pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU
and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn, where she remained for 2
days receiving antibiotics another one unit of packed RBC's. She
was transferred back to the floor, where she continued
antibiotics and was started on a clear liquid diet while
awaiting return of bowel function. On [**10-18**] her creatinine bumped
to 1.4 from a baseline of 0.4, so her Vanc and Zosyn were
stopped given she had received a 7 day course of antibiotics and
was now experiencing acute kidney injury. She also became
increasingly distended and had 3 episodes of bilious emesis, so
an NG tube was placed to suction with an immediate return of 1.5
liters of bilious gastric fluid. It was felt that her renal
failure was likely pre-renal azotemia and not a manifestation of
bowel ischemia, and she was aggressively rehydrated and a renal
consult was placed, who agreed that she was likely dehydrated
and pre-renal due to rapid fluid shifts and fluid losses in the
setting of a small bowel obstruction.  A CT abdomen/pelvis was
performed that showed a high grade small bowel obstruction in
the LUQ in the area of the surgical bed, but given that she was
only one week post-op it was felt that conservative management
with NG tube and IV fluids would be the best course for the time
being, and she was also started on TPN for nutrition.
Unfortunately, after 3 days of NG tube suction she developed
coffee-ground output with intermittent episodes of bright red
bloody output from her NG tube despite being on a PPI twice
daily, became tachycardic, and her hematocrit began to fall
despite receiving 1 unit of packed RBC's, with a nadir of 18.0
on [**10-24**]. At this point she was again transferred to the ICU,
where she was transfused a total of 3 more units of packed
RBC's.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] also failed to resume bowel function with
consistently high NG tube outputs, and in combination with her
new upper GI bleed it was now felt that she would need to be
taken back to the OR for an EGD and exploratory laparotomy in
the setting of a background concern for bowel ischemia. On
operation and EGD she was found to have a non-bleeding ulcer, a
retroperitoneal abscess in the left upper quadrant over which
the proximal jejunum was densely
adherent causing the proximal small-bowel obstruction, and
viable non-ischemic bowel. After surgery she returned to the
ICU, where she developed an anemia post-operatively on [**2131-10-26**]
and was transfused with two units of ABO compatible pRBCS. Her
pre-transfusion vital signs were: T=98 F, RR=30 on 2 L O2,
HR=123, and BP=148/88. Without premedication, she was transfused
with two complete units of pRBCs between 10:05 and 12:05AM on
[**2131-10-26**]. At 15:35, her O2 sat dropped to 91% on 2L O2 and her
oxygen was increased to 4L. A chest x-ray showed worsened
interval pulmonary edema with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
At about 20:00, her O2 sat dropped to 92% and her O2 was
increased to 6L with d
