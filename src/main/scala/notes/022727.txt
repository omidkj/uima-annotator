Chief Complaint:
Chest burning and dyspnea on exertion

[**4-12**] Aortic Valve Replacement (23mm CE Magna Tissue Valve),
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA w/

History of Present Illness:
77 year old patient with severe aortic stenosis who has been
asymptomatic until he presented today to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16643**]
office at [**Company 191**] ([**Hospital Ward Name 23**]) with complaints of chest pain and
dyspnea, primarily with exertion.
.
Patient reports worsening chest burning and SOB with exertion
starting about 2-3 weeks ago.  Now also occuring at rest. His
chest burning "feels like acid" but is not relieved by tums. It
can last 3-4 minutes up to 30 minutes, resolves with rest and
deep breaths, and does not radiate. It is not associated with
nausea or diaphoresis. He says it is only associated with
shortness of breath when he exerts himself. He has not had
lightheadedness, visual changes, palpitations. He notes that
over the last 6 months or so he has had decreased energy,
normally he is very active. He has a chronic cough productive of
white to yellow sputum that is unchanged from baseline. No
fevers, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, abdominal pain.
.
EKG in clinic (unavailable) per report had minor ST depressions
c/w prior.  Pt was directly admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 for cath with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

Neck: Supple with JVP, not elevated.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. crescendo SEM radiating to carotids. No
thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

on right in all fields.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-3**] Cath: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Severe
aortic stenosis. 3. Mild global left ventricular contractile
dysfunction. 4. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. 5. Mild
pulmonary arterial hypertension. 6. Mild systemic arterial
systolic hypertension.
[**4-4**] Chest CT: 1. Extensive calcifications of the [**Month/Year (2) 5236**] as
described involving the most proximal anterior part of the
ascending [**Month/Year (2) 5236**]. Heavy aortic valve calcifications,
hemodynamically significant. 2. Extensive atherosclerosis of the
coronary arteries. 3. Emphysema, predominantly affecting the
upper lungs. 4. Bronchial wall thickening consistent with
bronchitis. Focal area of impaction of lingular bronchi, most
likely due to secretions. Followup with chest CT in three to six
months is recommended to exclude the possibility of endoluminal
neoplasm. 5. New small pericardial effusion. 6. Increased but
low in density left hepatic lobe lesion. This lesion as well as
the bilateral adrenal neoplasm stable in size, might be
evaluated with MR of the abdomen. 7. Aortic stent. 8. Stable
enlargement of left thyroid with a low-density 2.5 x 1.8 cm
lesion. This finding giving its long-term stability is most
likely benign but evaluation with thyroid ultrasound would be
recommended for the possibility of malignancy.
[**4-4**] CNIS: Less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally. This is a baseline examination at the
[**Hospital1 18**].
[**4-8**] Thyroid U/S: Large left lower lobe thyroid nodule which
would be amenable for biopsy.
[**4-9**] Abd MRI: 1. Several liver cysts, the largest of which is in
segment II of the left lobe of liver with no concerning
features. 2. Bilateral adrenal adenomas incompletely assessed on
MRI in view of susceptibility from the aortic graft. 3. Gastric
cardia soft tissue mass unchanged from previous CT allowing for
difference in technique.
[**4-12**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending [**Month/Day (2) 5236**] is very heavily calcified. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Month/Day (2) 5236**]. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: NSR with phenylephrine infusing. A prosthetic aortic
valve is well-seated and functioning. No AI, no leak. Mean
residual gradient = 10. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**]. Good
biventricular systolic fxn.
[**4-17**] Liver U/S: Mildly distended gallbladder with sludge.
Gallbladder wall thickness at the upper limits of normal and not
significantly changed when compared with the study from [**2133**]. If
there is a clinical concern for cholecystitis, a nuclear HIDA
scan can be obtained for further evaluation to assess for cystic
duct obstruction.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-4-21**] 8:17 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: increase in left pleural effussion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with with left plueral effussion / would like PA
and LAt to better asses
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
increase in left pleural effussion
TWO-VIEW CHEST [**2137-4-21**]

COMPARISON: [**2137-4-19**].

INDICATION: Left pleural effusion.

Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are not
substantially changed allowing for positional and technical
differences of the examinations. Heart is upper limits of normal
in size. Areas of atelectasis are present adjacent to the
effusions, left greater than right. Note is made of prior median
sternotomy and aortic valvular replacement.

IMPRESSION: Moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
