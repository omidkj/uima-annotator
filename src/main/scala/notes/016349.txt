CHIEF COMPLAINT: GI bleeding, AF c RVR, respiratory distress

MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES: CVL [**2129-1-7**]; PICC [**2129-1-9**],
[**2129-1-17**]; Paracentesis [**2129-1-13**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-
old male with a past medical history notable for coronary
artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing chronic
angina, Hep-C viral infection without infection of chronic
liver disease, gastrointestinal bleed with ulceration
complicated by perforation in [**2106**], hypertension, recent
urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days, and background
history of both emphysema and probable pulmonary fibrosis / IPF.
The patient was in his usual state of health until approximately
24 hours prior to admission at 11 a.m. on [**1-6**], when he
reported passing bright red blood in his stool.  He was initially
triaged from MCI [**Location (un) 912**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room, and
following initial evaluation there was subsequently transferred
to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with a
concern for possible small bowel obstruction, as well as ongoing
evidence of GI bleed.

On presentation to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was noted to be hemodynamically stable with triage
vital signs showing a blood pressure of 148/80, a heart rate
of 92, a temperature of 97.1 orally, and a respiratory rate
of 16, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.  Initial
labs were notable for a hematocrit of 37.  He was seen by
both Gastroenterology and Surgery, and a CT scan of his
abdomen was obtained.  This revealed a long segment of
colitis extending from the hepatic flexure to the
rectosigmoid junction, consistent with infectious or
inflammatory colitis.  The visualized portions of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**],
SMA, and celiac arteries were observed to be patent.  Incidental
note was made of fibrosis in bilateral lower lobes of his
lungs.  There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Based on his
presentation, he was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, IV
proton pump inhibition, and Dilaudid for abdominal pain, and
subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing
chronic angina
2. Hep-C viral infection without infection of chronic
liver disease
3. PUD / gastrointestinal bleed with perforation in [**2106**]
4. Hypertension
5. Recent urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days
6. Long term smoking c/b both emphysema and probable pulmonary
fibrosis / IPF.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His social history is notable for the fact
that he had been incarcerated for many years, most recently
over the last several years at MCI [**Location (un) 912**].  His healthcare
proxy was identified to be [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], his sister,
currently residing in [**Name (NI) 21318**], telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80521**].  He is a former heavy smoker, but had not smoked
cigarettes for approximately 15 years.  He also had a history
of intravenous drug abuse, specifically morphine and heroin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His family history was notable for coronary
artery disease, but he had no history of inflammatory bowel
disease, or pulmonary disease.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  At the time of his admission to the
medical ICU, the following medication history was obtained:
1. Albuterol metered dose inhaler 1-2 puffs every 6 hours
    as needed.
2. Ipratropium metered dose inhaler 1-2 puffs every 8 hours
    as needed.
3. Aspirin 325 mg tablets 1 by mouth daily.
4. Enalapril 5 mg 1 by mouth daily.
5. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg 1 by mouth daily.
6. Omeprazole 25 mg 1 by mouth daily.
7. Propranolol 20 mg by mouth twice daily.
8. Hytrin 2 mg by mouth once daily.
9. Simvastatin 20 mg by mouth once daily.

ALLERGIES:  The patient was noted to have an allergy to sulfa
drugs which reportedly caused seizures. Of note, the patient was
able to tolerate lasix without complication.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
to the ICU revealed vital signs as noted above. He was noted
to be a rather frail man with poor dentition, but in no
apparent respiratory distress.  He did complain of mild pain
in his left lower quadrant.  His neck veins were flat and he
had no evidence of lymphadenopathy.  Examination of his chest
revealed fine crackles at both bases.  His cardiac exam was
notable for a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and
S2.  His abdomen was soft but diffusely tender to palpation,
particularly in the left lower quadrant.  He had no evidence
of guarding or rebound.  He had no peripheral edema,
clubbing, or evidence of deep venous thrombosis. he was alert and
oriented x3 and his neurological examination was normal in
detail.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory examination at the time of
admission was notable for a sodium of 136, potassium of 3.7,
chloride of 104, bicarb of 21, BUN of 16, and creatinine of
0.9, with a glucose of 131.  His alkaline phosphatase was
mildly elevated at 126, the remainder of his LFTs were within
normal limits.  His CBC revealed a white count of 13,000, and
a hematocrit of 37% which dropped over the course of the next
24 hours to 33, and then nadir'd at 29%.  Platelets were 256
on admission and coags were normal.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted with a diagnosis of a GI bleed.  In consultation
with GI and Surgery, this was managed conservatively with
antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and further examination for
possible C. difficile infection or ongoing bowel ischemia, which
was felt to be less likely.  He did not require
transfusion and did not require colonoscopy or further
invasive procedures to evaluate the course of his bleed,
which resolved spontaneously.

The patient was stabilized in the medical ICU over the first
24 hours of his hospitalization.  He was transitioned out to
the medical floor on [**1-8**].  On the evening of [**1-9**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response complicated by both the respiratory distress
and hypertension, and was transferred back to the medical
intensive care unit on [**1-9**].  His AF was eventually
brought under control through initiation of Diltiazem first via
drip, then via p.o. administration with a dose of 90 mg every 6
hours.

His subsequent course over the next several days was marked by
progressive respiratory distress, despite aggressive attempts at
fluid removal with Lasix.  He was also febrile, and underwent an
extensive infectious workup.  The results of this included
identification of both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in his
sputum, as well as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in
his sputum.  He was managed with antibiotic therapy, rate
control, and diuresis.  An echocardiogram revealed normal left
ventricular cardiac function, mild mitral regurgitation and
mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures. Paracentesis on
[**1-13**] was negative for any evidence of infection; his
ascites was likely due to a combination of fluid overload in the
setting of progressive right heart failure and underlying liver
disease from hepatic congestion and HCV.

Given rising oxygen requirement over the course of [**1-9**]-26, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.  This was
remarkable for evidence of not only emphysema and COPD, but
also interstitial lung disease.  On further questioning, the
patient reported that he did carry a diagnosis of pulmonary
fibrosis, but it was unclear what further workup had been
obtained in the management of this disorder over the prior
several years.

The patient developed further respiratory impairment, and after
discussing the risks and benefits of steroid therapy in the
setting of his GI bleed and ongoing infection with consulting
services and with the patient, the decision was made to initiate
steroid therapy to treat a component of accelerated
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  Despite this, the
patient developed progres
