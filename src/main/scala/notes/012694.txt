83yo woman with history of HTN, dyslipidemia, COPD and
breast CA s/p mastectomy presented with acute mental status

overt CHF is seen at the present time. There is patchy density
at the bases which could represent
atelectasis/pneumonia/aspiration. There are no large pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] intially. Mental status thought to be
related to polypharmacy and toxic-metabolic state with a tox
screen positive for TCA's. In addition, UTI plays a roll as well
as PNA and NSTEMI. Neurology consult confirmed this and pt
briefly on tegretol for 5 days and then stopped b/c it was
deemed pt did not have seizure. UTI and S. pneumonia PNA treated
with 7 days of levoquin. While in the unit, pt had NSTEMI, cards
consulted and decided to plan cath once stable. Medically
managed with [**Hospital Unit Name **], BB, ACE I, heparin gtt and enzymes trended
downward during unit stay. Hypoxia was thought to be [**3-13**]
pulmonary edema adn pt was intially intubated, then extubated
but failed [**3-13**] laryngeal edema treated with racemic epi, heliox
and solumedrol, then reintubated rested on AC ventilation, given
steroids, and then extubated [**1-21**] prior to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] to await to decision to cath.

1) Encephalopathy: Multifactorial, clearing. Infection,
toxic-metabolic are all part of picture. Pts mental status was
oriented x 3 while on the floor. Pt was given haldol PO once for
agitation but did not need it for any further episodes. Cont ot
monitor MS and consider seroqel for aggitation/sleep.

2) UTI, pneumonia: compelted 7 day course of abx. Currently
afebrile. With elevated WBC ct but no fever or other symptoms,
will send UA. urine cx, stool cx and sputumm cx if prod cough.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] to f/u results in rehab. If spikes, would consider
longer txt of levoquin or consider ventilator associated PNA if
worses.

3) NSTEMI: Pt was maintaned on herpain gtt x 5 days. Cards input
was to cont [**Last Name (STitle) **]/BB/captopril titrated upward. Family and pt
decision to not do cardiac cath at this time. Heparin gtt d/c'd
and CK's trending downward. Pt pain free. EKG showed no further
changes after intial event. Will need titration of cardiac meds
as outpt while in rehab. Monitor cardiac status. Readdress
further eval in future.

4) Hypoxia/respiratory failure: From fluid overload and PNA.
EF=30%. Lasix 40 mg qd given once on trasnfer to flor with good
effect. Pt maintained on RTC nebs/IH and racemic epi. AFter 36
hrs on floor oxygenation improved with [**Month (only) **] in supplimental
oxygen to 2 L with 98-100% sats. Pt reports shortness of breath
however improving hypoxia. CXr rechecked on [**1-23**] which showed
interval improvement. Would cont racemic epi, nebs and IH while
laryngeal edema improves. No evidence for PNA now but would keep
in mind over next few weeks if pt has fever. Maintain on 20 mg
lasix qd, fludi restrictionn, daily wts, and check for sxs of
vol overload.

5)Renal Failure, prerenal in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: now at baseline, monitor Cr.

6)Anemia: [**3-13**] to chronic disease, stool guaic negative. [**Name (NI) 60084**] pt
remained in house overnight, one unit blood was transfused after
consent was obtained. Small dose lasix given after transfusion.
Hct increased appropriately.

7)Nutrional consulted for aspriation risk with pt who has
laryngeal edeam and thy reccomended ground mechanical diet with
thin liquids with a staw.

8)Maintain on prevacid.

9)Diarrhea: On day prior to discharge, pt 's WBC ct remained
elevated, afebrile and began haivng foul smelling diarrhea.
Given recent course of abx and hospitalizaiton for >1 week,
emperically began treatment for C Diff. C dif studies were sent
and were negative. Flagyl 500 mg Po tid x 7 days started. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] to f/u culture results.

9)Code: FULL, HCP is son

Pt was d/c to [**Hospital 550**] rehab in good condition. Afebrile, improving
hypoxia.
