Pertinent Results:
[**11-28**] CTA Head
There is a large intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left
basal ganglia, involving the left frontal, parietal, and
temporal lobes that is unchanged compared to the examination
from one hour earlier on the same day. Please refer to the
report from that day for further detail. Again, there is
considerable mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and
associated rightward midline shift. There is effacement of the
suprasellar cistern. There is mild uncal herniation present as
well. Artifact is noted of the right middle cerebral artery
aneurysmal clip. The patient is status post right frontal
temporary craniotomy.
CTA portion of this examination was technically unsuccessful
secondary to poor bolus administration.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of large intraparenchymal
hematoma within the left frontal, parietal, and temporal regions
compared to the CT examination from [**2192-11-28**]. CTA examination
technically unsuccessful.

[**11-28**] CXR:
An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip 3.4 cm above the
carina. A nasogastric tube courses inferiorly beyond the limits
of the examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
normal limits. There are bilateral patchy opacities likely
secondary to low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.

[**11-28**] Head CT:
 There is a large intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left
basal ganglia involving the left frontal, parietal, and temporal
lobes. This measures 5.2 x 3.5 cm. There is extension into the
left lateral ventricle. There is considerable mass effect upon
the left lateral ventricle, resulting in 6-mm rightward shift of
the midline structures. There is mass effect on the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and the effacement of the
suprasellar cistern. Again noted is a right middle cerebral
artery aneurysm clip. The patient is status post right frontal
and temporal craniotomy.

[**11-29**] Head CT:
1) Interval right lateral ventricular drain placement; the tip
appears to reside at the junction of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and the
splenium, potentially out of the ventricle. Correlate with CSF
drainage. No interval progression of hydrocephalus. Findings
discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2398**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7635**] after the study.
2) Essentially stable appearance of the hematoma evacuation bed
with persisting effacement of the left lateral ventricle and
stable mild rightward shift of normally midline structures

[**12-4**] CXR:
Increased density at the right base, which may represent subtle
consolidation. Tubes and lines as described. The endotracheal
tube is somewhat low.

[**12-4**] EEG:
This was an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of left
hemisphere slowing as well as bifrontal slowing, suggestive of
subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere and deep midline
structures. The slow and disorganized background with
generalized bursts
of slowing suggest a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Generalized beta
activity seen was most likely a medication effect from
benzodiazepines,
barbituates or other sedatives. No epileptiform discharges were
seen.


[**12-12**] CXR:
The tip of the endotracheal tube is about 3 cm above the carina.
The tip of the right subclavian line is at the cavoatrial
junction. The tip of the NG tube is below the diaphragm. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Stable mild
cardiomegaly is present. There are no pleural effusions. The
lungs are clear.

[**12-15**] Head CT:
 The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy and
craniectomy. Expansion of the brain outward is unchanged in
extent. There is a similar pattern of diffuse hypodensity
involving the left frontal lobe and deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter structures
consistent with swelling and infarction. However, centrally,
there is reduced degree of hyperdensity, consistent with ongoing
resorption of a hematoma. A right lateral ventricular catheter
has been removed since the prior study. There is persistent, but
less effacement of the left lateral ventricle compared to
before. The right lateral ventricle is minimally enlarged, with
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] measuring up to 7 mm in diameter, which is not
significantly changed. The body of the right lateral ventricle
is, however, slightly increased in size from 5-11 mm. The left
lateral ventricle remains compressed. Hypodensity along the
prior catheter tract is identified, without evidence of
hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
 The patient is a 46 year old female was admitted
to the [**Hospital1 69**] ER. She was
admitted tonight for sudden onset of confusion,
hemiparesis and collapse. The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 1444**] ER for evaluation. A CAT scan
was performed and revealed a large 5 x 5 x 5 cm left temporal
parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with incipient
herniation. The patient was taken emergently to the operating
room for emergent decompression.
She underwent a left hemicraniectomy and placement of external
ventricular drain.
Her postoperative  CT scan of the brain was stable with
postoperative changes noted.
She remains intubated as of today [**2192-12-2**]. She extensor postures
on the right> left upper extreme ties - her eyes are open at
times Right>left most [**12-28**] periorbital swelling on the left from
surgery (expected) but she does not track or follow commands at
present.  Her drain height was raised daily from 10 to 15 and
now to 20 cm H20 today on [**2192-12-2**]. On [**12-3**], she remained intubated
and there was no real progression.  On [**12-4**], we started to weane
for mannitol and the Decadron weane started.  Her hematocrit
remained unchanged and her drain was clamped.  On [**12-5**], she went
for a CT scan that did not show any change from her previous
scan on [**2192-12-3**].  The ICP drain came out, but she remained
intubated as she failed a RSBI.  On [**12-6**], her ciprofloxacin and
decadron was stopped.  The SICU team also started Epogen for her
low hematocrit.  Trauma surgery was consulted for trach and peg
evaluation which they agreed to.  On [**12-7**], there were no major
moves t
