Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old woman with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction at age 35 and six vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2108**] who presented with new onset of chest pressure
associated with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation
and nausea starting at around 10 AM on the day of admission.
The pain started at breakfast and it radiated to her throat
and left arm.  It was 7 out of 10 in onset and progressed to
10 out of 10 about one hour later.  She took one sublingual
nitroglycerin without significant improvement.  She called
her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] who told her to call 911.  She
was brought in by Emergency Medical Services and she felt
better after being given oxygen and two baby Aspirin (the
patient had taken her baby Aspirin 81 mg in the morning
before the episode).  Of note, the patient also fell during
the episode secondary to her left leg weakness.  In the
Emergency Room she was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with heartrate of 170, blood pressure 148/78,
oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters.  She was given one dose of
25 mg intravenous Diltiazem and her rhythm went back into
sinus.  She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction at age 35, status post six vessel
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2108**].  Aortic stenosis.
Echocardiogram in [**2115-7-6**] showed moderately severe aortic
stenosis with significant progression since [**2114-8-5**],
aortic valve increased from 3 to 4.1 and gradient from 36 to
69.  The aortic valve area estimated to be .7 cm.  Recent
admission to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital three weeks ago or syncopal
episode, etiology thought to be vasovagal in the setting of
moderately severe aortic stenosis.  Rheumatoid arthritis in
the past three years on chronic Prednisone and Methotrexate.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, status post right carotid endarterectomy
in [**2112**].  Status post episode of pneumonia.  Status post from
outside hospital, exercise stress test in [**2113-7-6**].
Heartrate maximum at 123, stopped secondary to shortness of
breath, no chest pain or anginal symptoms.  No significant
electrocardiogram changes.  Perfusion scan is normal.  Normal
wall motion, normal ejection fraction.  Echocardiogram in
[**2115-7-6**] showed left atrial dilatation.  Concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy, aortic valve peak gradient 69.6,
mean of 31.9, aortic valve area estimated to be .7 cm, 2 to
3+ mitral regurgitation.  PA pressure increased to 45 mm
mercury.  Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated to be
60%.  No wall motion abnormality.  Left ventricular size and
function were normal.  Right ventricular size and function
were normal.

ALLERGIES:  Motrin and Aspirin causing bleeding.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Baby Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.;
Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.d.; Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Methotrexate
7.5 mg q. Saturday; Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.d.; Atacand 16 mg
p.o. q.d.; Folgard 1 p.o. q.d.; Fosamax 70 mg q. Sunday;
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Vitamin E; multiple vitamin; Atrovent
2 puffs t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No cigarettes for 45 years.  Had a history
of 60 pack year history.  Social alcohol, has not been
drinking for two years.  Lives alone.  Never married and had
no children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at age 67, father died at age
72, brother died at age 62 all secondary to heart disease,
sister at age 71 with heart problems.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Syncopal episode three weeks ago,
admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, etiology thought to be
vasovagal in the setting of moderate severe aortic stenosis.
Has been feeling tired in the past one to two weeks.  Three
pillow orthopnea in the past year.  Increased from two pillow
orthopnea, had been feeling increasingly weak in the past
year, with decreased activity. Positive for claudication and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed the patient to be afebrile, temperature 97.3, blood
pressure 116/72, heartrate 76, respirations 22, oxygen
saturation 96% on room air.  In general, pleasant elderly
lady, lying in bed in no acute distress.  Head and neck
examination anicteric, sclera, jugulovenous pressure not
elevated.  Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiovascular, regular
rate and rhythm, IV/VI systolic ejection murmur, loudest at
the left upper sternal border, radiating through the
precordium and bilateral carotids can be heard.  Lungs, clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nondistended,
nontender.  Bruit can be heard at bilateral renal artery,
(questionable radiating murmur from the aortic stenosis).
Extremities, no edema, good distal pulses, bilateral bruits
can be heard at the femoral artery sites (questionable
radiating murmur from aortic stenosis).

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
hemoglobin 13.7, hematocrit 33.3, platelets 368, 85%
neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes and 3 eosinophils.
MCV 80, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate
21, BUN 37, creatinine 1.3, glucose 103.  PT 12.6, PTT 26.6,
INR 1.0.  Chest x-ray, slight prominence of pulmonary
vasculature and upper zone with distribution suggestive of
congestive heart failure, no effusions or infiltrates.
Electrocardiograms on admission showed atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter, rhythm at a rate of 152, normal
axis, Q waves in III and AVF, questionable left ventricular
hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given sublingual
nitroglycerin and Diltiazem in the Emergency Room.  Her
atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was terminated with
one dose of intravenous Diltiazem.  She has remained chest
pain free in the Emergency Room.  She was started on
Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and Lovenox for acute
coronary syndrome.  She was worked up with seronegative
cardiac enzymes.  She has remained in sinus rhythm on
telemetry while she was on the floor.  She had a repeated
echocardiogram which showed mildly dilated left atrium and
normal left ventricle with ejection fraction of about 55%.
The right ventricle is normal.  She had moderate aortic
stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation,
no effusion was seen on the examination.  She also had an
magnetic resonance imaging scan, magnetic resonance
angiography of her brain given her history of right carotid
endarterectomy and syncopal episode three weeks ago which
showed mild narrowing of the left carotid artery at the
bifurcation, small irregularity at the right carotid artery
bifurcation.  There was also found chronic microvascular
ischemia changes.  No major vascular territory infarction.
She went for diagnostic catheterization on [**4-7**], to
evaluate her coronary artery bypass graft paths and aortic
stenosis which showed right dominant situation disease with
proximal aneurysm with severe native three vessel deep
coronary artery disease, left main coronary artery was
diffusely diseased with 80% distal narrowing.  The left
anterior descending was aneurysmal dilated at its ostium and
was staying diffusely diseased throughout its course with
stenosis up to 90% and finally it occluded in the mid vessel.
The left circumflex was diffusely diseased with a 90% ostial
lesion.  The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased and
subtotally occluded to 99% throughout its course.  The graft
angiograph demonstrated a treated left internal mammary
artery which was totally occluded in the mid vessel,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery was
widely patent and filled moderately sized posterior
descending artery and PLV branches as well as diffusely
diseased distal right coronary artery via retrograde flow.
Saphenous vein graft to D1 with jump graft to obtuse marginal
2 was widely patent, though seemed to fill left anterior
descending, left circumflex and left main coronary artery via
