History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25996**] is a 54M who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] overnight on [**2128-9-25**]
w/4d of increasing confusion. [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother reported he was seen
by PCP 2d prior to admission for new cough and sore throat and
was given a z-pack (bronchitis vs COPD flare).  The following
day he reportedly was found unconsious after hitting his head on
a table and his roommate sent him to [**Hospital3 **].  There, he
was found to have RLL PNA, ARF w/Cr 2.0 from 0.8, hyperkalemia
to 6.9 without EKG changes. Etoh level negative, but tricyclics,
benzos, opiates +.  He received levafloxacin, but then left AMA
(no kayexelate given). Roommate and mother thought he was still
very confused at home and he also complained of suprapubic pain
and diarrhea, they and convinced him to come to [**Hospital1 18**] (where he
is seen in the liver center by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
.
Of note, he last saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] about 3 weeks ago. At that time
he was considered to be sufficiently stable as to be under
consideration for HCV eradication therapy with interferon,
ribavirin and a protease inhibitor. He did report some BRBPR but
no hematemesis, melena, abd pain or distension; grade I
esophageal varices on EGD in [**2128-7-7**]. He had a palpable
nontender liver and no ascites, no asterixis. His mental health
counselor reported to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] that he was clean, no alcohol or
drug use. However, acording to family, the patient  has been
drinking cough syrup and using pills: non-prescription
oxycontin, valium and depakote as well as a "koolaid concoction"
that roommate suspects is methadone bc it "smells like
bubblegum." No alcohol use witnessed heroin use was also
suspected.
.
When he arrived in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**9-25**] he was found to be confused
and lethargic with asterixis and icteric sclera. Belly was soft
mildly distended with diffuse pain on palpation. Lungs had
crackles and wheezes throughout. VS were T 98.8 HR 97 BP 126/74
RR 16 O2 98/RA. He had WBC 14.1 with a left shift.  AST was 1358
and ALT 527.  He was given 1 dose levaquin, 500 cc NS bolus and
nebs. RUQ US showed nephrolithiasis without obstruction, no
ascites, no concerning liver parenchymal changes and a patent
portal vein. Could not assess kidneys [**3-10**] patient's lack of
cooperation. CXR showed "increased interstitial edema-like
pattern, volume overload (noncardiogenic edema) favored,
although atypical infection may result in a similar appearance."
 Right hemidiaphragm was elevated compared to prior in [**Month (only) 116**].
Head CT showed unchanged left thalamic lacunar infarct.
.
On the floor, the patient was hydrated and put on CIWA [**Doctor Last Name **] 8
to 23.  He was given ativan 0.5 mg IV x 2 and 3 doses of
diazepam 2.5 mg, 3 doses of lactulose, and his rifaximan.
.
The afternoon of [**9-26**], the patient was noted to be more
tachypneic, breathing 24-28 resp per minute, satting 98% on RA,
and he was not oriented.  He was minimally able to follow
commands and appeared diaphoretic and tachycardic.  ABG was
performed on 2 L nc 7.55/23/59/21.  Given his nongap respiratory
alkalosis, Toxicology was called, who did not think he had
aspirin toxicity.  MICU was called for eval given tachypnea.

1. Hepatitis C (Genotype 1) c/b Cirrhosis
2. Cirrhosis (Alcohol and HCV)
3. COPD (believes he was diagnosed approximately in [**2126**])
4. s/p Right Shoulder Surgery (patient unsure of exact cause)
