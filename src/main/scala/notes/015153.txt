Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3063**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis on regular MWF schedule

History of Present Illness:
36 year old man with a history of DM I with ESRD on HD (M,W,F)
and recurrent gastroparesis who presents with hematemisis and
abd pain x 7 hours.  He describes the pain as severe, constant,
and epigastric.  Pain does not radiate to back.  The pain is
associated with nausea and vomiting, consistent with prior
episodes of gastroparesis.  The vomit started out clear this
morning, but became dark in color as the day went on.  The
patient denies known trigger for symptoms.  No recent fevers,
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, pain with
urination or polyuria.  No blurry vision.  No heart burn, rising
sensation in his chest, or globus sensation.  He has been taking
all of his medications regularly.  The patient took his lantus
this morning, but did not use his sliding scale during the day
secondary to nausea.  He presented to the ED for multiple
episodes of hematemesis.
.
In the ED, initial VS:  96.0 123 216/126 97% RA.  The patient
was given ativan, zofran, and morphine for pain and nausea.  CXR
did not show evidence of pneumomediastinum or acute process.
There was concern for multifocal pneumonia, and the patient
received a dose of vancomycin and zosyn.  Laboratory testing
revealed a glucose of 314 with an anion gap metabolic acidosis
of 26.  He was started on an insulin drip of 5 units/hour.  For
his blood pressure, the patient received 5mg IV labetalol.  BP
prior to transfer 166/103.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient continues to complain of
mild nausea.  He otherwise feels well.  No chest pain, blurry
vision, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia.

CXR
FINDINGS:
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  A left
axillary vascular stent is again noted.  The cardiac,
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Lungs are clear.  No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No
pneumomediastinum is identified.  Speckled densities within the
right upper quadrant of the abdomen likely reflects ingested
contents within the colon.
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Specifically, no
pneumomediastinum
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
36 year old man with a history of DM I complicated by severe
gastroparesis and ESRD on HD admitted with acute abdominal pain,
nausea, and hematemesis.

Acute Issues:
#  DKA:  Patient admitted with glucose near 400 with anion gap
of 26.  DKA likely caused by gastroparesis and non-use of
novolog on the day of admission.  No evidence of infection on
history or exam.  He was started on an insulin drip and his gap
closed quickly.  The patient was transitioned to his home
insulin regimen.

#Abdominal pain:  Patient admitted with 7 hours of sharp
epigastric, non-radiating pain.  As pain is similar to previous
presentations, it was likely caused by known severe
gastroparesis.  Pain may have been worsened by DKA.  Nausea and
abdominal pain resolved in the ED with ativan, zofran, and
reglan.  He was continued on home omeprazole to cover for peptic
ulcer disease or gastritis.  LFTs, alk phos, lipase normal.

#Hematemesis. Hematemesis likely due to [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from
continued vomiting.  Hct 45.7 ->35.4 during first day of
hospital stay. Likely combination of Hematemesis and
hemodilution secondary to IVF. H/H stable after that point alone
with resolution of hematemesis. Of note, recent EGD in [**11/2186**]
in the setting of hematemesis was normal. At that time, it was
felt that patient likely had a small [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear that had
resolved.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Likely due to a combination of
diabetic ketoacidosis, starvation ketoacidosis from lack of PO
intake, and uremia.  Gap closed with strict control of
hyperglycemia.

# Hypertensive Urgency with orthostasis:  While patient says he
routinely goes into hypertensive urgency with exacerbations of
gastroparesis, his hypertensive urgency did not resolve with
resolution of nausea and vomiting.  No headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath or vision changes.  The patient was
continued on his home clonidine patch.  Lisinopril was increased
to 10mg daily and Labetalol 200mg TID was added for better BP
control.  Patient had orthostatic hypotension of up 40mmHg
difference from lying down to sitting likely secondary to
autonomic dysfunction.  His blood pressure medications were
titrated using pressures while patient is in a sitting position.
He was continued on home dialysis.

Chronic Issues:
# ESRD on HD:  Chronic, on HD MWF.  The patient is currently on
the dual pancreatic/kidney transplant list.  He was continued on
sevelamer and nephrocaps.  He was continued on regularly
scheduled hemodialysis.

Transitional Issues:
# Please measure blood pressure with patient in sitting position
in the future. Blood
