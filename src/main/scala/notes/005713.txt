History of Present Illness:
This is a 35 y/o male without signif PMH who p/w fever, chills,
and progressive myalgias x 15 days. His symptoms were a/w
dizziness, palpitations, nausea, body aches, and back pain. He
also had night sweats and poor appetite. He was seen at [**Hospital 11507**] Clinic, where he was told he had the flu and given
tylenol and instructed to take in good fluids, which he did. His
symptoms persisted, and 4 days later he was evaluated at
[**Hospital 8**] hospital, where he was again told he had the flu.
Finally a friend referred him to her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], whom he met
on Wednesday. Blood and urine tests were performed and he was
given cipro, which he took on Wed and Thurs. He represented to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday where he was told he had a urinary
infection. His antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin. On
Friday night, after taking amox, he developed a new cough,
pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath. He went to the
bathroom, had diarrhea x1, and also vomited x 1 (? hemoptysis,
brown-red). These symptoms were new from his previous
fevers/chills/myalgias picture. He was again seen at his PCP's
office today, where temp was 103.2, and by report he looked
unwell. Complained of CP, and was referred to the ED.
.
In ED: 99.5 115 133/55 22 97%RA. Exam showed bilateral basilar
crackles with diaporesis. Possible pericardial rub. No abdominal
tednerness. No pulsus. Labs were significant for CK 1000 MB 10.3
Trop 0.62. WBC count 22.0. LFTs mildly elevated. Laxtate 1.5.
EKG showed sinus tachy with very minimal ST depressions in
V4-V6. Cards was consulted and felt presentation was most c/w
viral myocarditis. Cards fellow performed echo, which showed
probable mild hypokinesis of the apex and distal anterior wall
and mild mitral regurgitation. Blood cultures were drawn and her
received vanc and levo for possible PNA. Pt also received ASA x
1 and lipitor. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] was consulted for vegetation on the
aortic valve and valvular replacement secondary to endocarditis.
Blood Cx came back positive for Staph coag neg. He was scheduled
for the OR [**11-16**]. During the overnight period prior to surgery,
Mr.[**Known lastname 13119**] [**Last Name (Titles) 68039**] with acute pulmonary edema. He was
intubated and emergently taken to the OR for an AVR.

Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 15 %).
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
aortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Endocarditic lesions
are noted on both cusps and in the aortic root. Both cusps are
completely destroyed.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Phenylephrine and
Epinephrine
1. A mechanical Valve is well seated in the Aortic position.
Leaflets open well, trace washing jets are noted. No significant
AI. Peak Gradient about 15 mm of Hg.
2. LV function is slightly improved. RV function is unchanged.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   35 year old man with s/p AVR (endocarditis)
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate pleural effusions and atelectasis

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after aortic valve
replacement.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed in
comparison to multiple
prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2130-11-11**].

The post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable. The replaced aortic
valve is in
expected position. There is no significant short interval change
in bibasilar
atelectasis and small pleural effusion. No evidence of failure
is present on
the current radiograph. There is no pneumothorax or apical
hematoma.
