IMAGING
-------
Chest X-ray on admission:
IMPRESSION: Mild increase in interstitial markings which could
reflect
worsening fibrosis or superimposed pulmonary interstitial edema.
Please
correlate clinically.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male w/ h/o of advanced idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis presenting with fever, cough and increased O2
requirement.

ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Dyspnea: Patient had worsening of chronic dyspnea, which was
most likely secondary to infection, either viral or bacterial
superinfection after viral infection.  Viral studies are so far
negative, and are thus far pending.  Worsening of patient's
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is also a possibility, and repeat
CT scan may be useful as an outpatient.  Given patient's tenuous
baseline respiratory status and ICU admission, coverage for
hospital acquired pneumonia was deemed reasonable,, and he is
often in pulmonary rehabilitation and at support groups with
chronically ill individuals, giving him significant exposure to
resistant organisms and patient was initiated on vancomycin,
levofloxacin and cefepime.  Patient was narrowed to
levofloxacin, after patient improved and culture data remained
negative
At this point, since we are 48 hours out without culture
positivity, antibiotic regimen can be narrowed to seven day
course of levofloxacin.  Blood cultures and viral swab are
currently pending.  Patient's pirfenidone, a study drug, was
held on admission, and patient will follow up with his
pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], after discharge to determine if he
should continue this medication.  He will also follow up with
his primary care provider.

TRANSITION OF CARE:
# Follow-up: patient will follow up with his primary care
provider and pulmonologist upon discharge.  He has pending blood
cultures and nasopharyngeal viral swab data which will need to
be followed up.
