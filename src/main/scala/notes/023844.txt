Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
subacute decline in memory and gait with early morning vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-4-15**] VP shunt placement
[**2117-4-23**] Angiogram with onyx embolization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 75 yo W with h/o 2 prior strokes with subtle
residual L hemiparesis, cerebellar AVM, HTN, HL who presents
with
subacute decline involving memory, gait with frequent falls,
vomiting.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] is aided by her husband and 2 [**Name2 (NI) 61443**] in relating
the history.
The patient had been falling for 1-2 years, but the frequency
has
increased to once per week. She typically falls when trying to
move (ie initiating movement, turning, standing, etc) not while
standing still. 2 episodes have been associated with loss of
consciousness before the fall, once while walking upstairs about
8 months ago, and another about 1 year ago. The episode on the
stairs was preceeded by lightheadedness, otherwise she gets no
warning or indication she is going to fall. She reports that she
loses her balance and falls. Today at 4am, she fell trying to
get
out of bed to use bathroom, and hit her LifeLine button. Her
husband reported she was asymptomatic and seemed normal, so went
back to sleep. This morning, the patient's [**Name2 (NI) **] checked on
her and was very concerned about what she describes as
"weakness"
and "off balance" preventing her from walking on her own at all.
She was also vomiting several times, so the [**Name2 (NI) **] called 911,
as she worried she could not get her to doctor's office safely.

In addition to falls, the patient has had nausea and vomiting
worsening over past 1 month. The patient reports this began last
summer but worse over past 1 month; her [**Name2 (NI) 61443**] have only
heard
about it x 1 month so cannot be sure. The vomiting is sometimes
preceeded by nausea and sometimes occurs without warning, but is
not projectile and she can usually get to the bathroom. The
patient thinks it usually occurs in the early mornings, but the
[**Name2 (NI) 61443**] have witnessed it at all times of day. It is not
associated with eating. She has vomited up her AM meds many
times, so family is concerned she has not absorbed them for
several weeks.

THe patient's family also report memory decline, for which they
saw a neurologist at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33578**] 1 [**Last Name (un) **] ago. She is
confused at times, forgetting more details and events on
day-to-day basis. She underwent cognitive testing. The family
also reports decreased social interaction; the patient used to
be
outgoing and social, but is now withdrawn in social situations.
They wonder if this is associated with her concussions, as the
timing does correlate. The concussions occurred with 2 of her
falls, 1 about 1.5 years ago, and the second about 8 months ago.
She does have a family history of dementia in her brother and
mother.
In addition, family reports increased need for sleep, and
increased tremor. [**Name (NI) **] husband reports she has slept about
10 hours per night every since the stroke 15 years ago, but her
daughters think this has increased to 12-14 hours now.

The patient presented first to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] ED, where CT and CTA were
done. The patient had prior imaging at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] (CTs in past and MRI
1
month ago) and by reports, it seems that an area in the
cerebellum had enlarged since prior scan, and had some
hyperintensity concerning for SAH. The patient was transferred
for neurosurgical evaluation.
However, on repeat CT and neurosurg evalution, it was felt that
the hyperintensity in the cerebellum did not represent acute
blood. Neurosurgery thought it represented a vessel involved in
the AVM. Radiology thought it was part of a mass vs. AVM, but
agreed it was not acute blood. THe head CT is concerning for
effacement of the 4th ventricle. Neurosurgery was consutled
