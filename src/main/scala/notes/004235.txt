[**2125-8-10**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


CT CHEST [**2125-8-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, new compared
to [**2125-5-22**].
2. Right [**Doctor Last Name **] lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
3. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema superimposed over diffuse
emphysema.
4. Large solitary left paratracheal lymph node.
5. No evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis.
6. Extensive vascular calcifications including coronary arteries
and great
vessels (arteries), aorta, iliac arteries, common femoral
arteries. Minimal
arterial flow diffusely through out lower extremities.
8. Atrophy of the left leg.
9. Focal aneurysmal dilation of right common femoral artery
where in-situ
saphenous bypass arises.

CT CHEST [**2125-9-6**]
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Since the prior CT, there has been
placement of a
right posterior pleural pigtail catheter which terminates in the
major fissure
at the base of the right lung. There is a moderate pneumothorax
including a
basal component and smaller component along the anterior
junction line and the
pleural catheter courses through the largest air pocket. The
fluid component
is also moderate in size and is mostly unloculated, but the
attenuation of the
adjacent pleura is increased which can be seen in empyema. This
becomes a
further possibility as there is a large airspace consolidation
in the right
lower lobe consistent with pneumonia

On the left, there is a moderate partially loculated pleural
effusion which is
relatively unchanged with the prior, with associated
atelectasis. There is
severe emphysema of both lungs and severe anasarca of the soft
tissues.

There is no pericardial effusion. Multiple enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes,
largest 22-mm left paratracheal (2:23), are very slightly
enlarged and likely
reactive. There are severe coronary artery calcifications and
severe aortic
valvular calcifications. An NG tube is located in the stomach.
The patient
is not intubated. Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC.

Study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no
abnormality is
noted except for high attenuation of a medullary pyramid in the
right upper
renal pole. No suspicious lesions are identified in the bones.

In the bones, there are multiple anterior wedge deformities of
T6, T7, T8, T9,
and L1, all stable from [**2125-8-27**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right hydropneumothorax with large right lower lobe
pneumonia.
The pleural effusion may be empyema.
2. Stable partially loculated moderate left pleural effusion
with underlying
atelectasis.
3. Stable enlarged mediastinal adenopathy, which may be
reactive.
4. Severe anasarca.
5. Severe coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY [**2125-10-18**]

This study was performed in conjunction with speech pathology
department.
Continuous fluoroscopic observation was provided during
administration of
pudding and nectar-thick consistencies. During initial
nectar-thick
administration in a more recumbent position, there was marked
premature
spillover and frank aspiration, which remained silent. Cough
reflex was
inadequate in clearing the aspirated material. Subsequent
delivery of pudding
and nectar-thick consistency redemonstrated prolonged transit
times of the
oral phase and decreased epiglottic deflection. A
mild-to-moderate residue
was also again noted within the valleculae and piriform sinuses.
While no
laryngeal penetration or aspiration was identified during
swallow, there
appeared to be at least episodes of laryngeal penetration after
swallow from
leftover residue within the piriform sinus. Patient's O2
saturations were
noted to transiently decrease during these episodes.

IMPRESSION:

Episodes of laryngeal penetration and aspiration as described
above.

Technically suboptimal study.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-8-10**],
right ventricular cavity size is smaller and the severity of
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and tricuspid
regurgitation are reduced. Aortic regurgitation and mitral
regurgitation are not appreciated on the current study, but the
image quality is suboptimal and may not reflect a true change.
