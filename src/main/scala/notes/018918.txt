History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24078**] is a 56-year old male with a history of pulmonary
sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents
from home with one day of chills, myalgias, cough productive of
yellow sputum tinged with blood and right sided chest pain. Of
note he was previously diagnosed with community acquired
pneumonia in [**Month (only) 956**] and treated with azithromycin with
complete resolution of symptoms. He was feeling well until one
day prior to presentation when these symptoms developed
suddenly. The pain is primarily in the right side of his chest
and worsens with deep inspiration. He is unable to take a deep
breath secondary to pain. His breathing is worse when lying flat
or on his left side. He has had myalgias and chills but has not
taken his temperature at home. He has had mild nausea but no
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. He has had
blood tinged sputum for one day. He has been taking normal PO
intake and had normal urine output without dysuria. He denies
lower extremity edema. He denies any recent travel or sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has not been on recent steroids or other
immunosuppresants. He is not a smoker. All other review of
systems negative.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.7 P: 116 BP: 73/45 R: 16 O2
sat: 88% on RA. He had a chest CT with contrast which showed no
pulmonary embolism but showed a severe right middle and right
lower lobe pneumonia. He received 5 liters of normal saline. His
blood pressure ranged from the 70s to 90s systolic and he
subsequently had a right sided sepsis catheter placed and was
started on levophed which was soon stopped. He received
levofloxacin, vancomycin, aspirin 325 mg and morphine 4 mg IV x
1, tylenol 1000 mg PO x 1. He had an EKG which showed sinus
tachycardia, normal axis, normal intervals, isolated 1 mm STE in
lead III which resolved on subsequent EKGs. He was admitted to
the MICU for further management.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2185-5-15**] PORTABLE CXR -Findings consistent with right lower lobe
atelectasis.Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Document
resolution upon treatment to exclude an underlying obstructive
process.
.
[**2185-5-15**] CTA:
1. Severe right middle lobe pneumonia with involvement of
portions of the
right lower lobe, right upper lobe and lingula. No evidence of
aortic
dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Unchanged sequelae of known underlying sarcoidosis.
3. Unchanged non-obstructive left renal calculi.
.
[**2185-5-19**] CHEST XRAY, PA AND LATERAL: Since [**5-18**],
consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes is improved.
Moderate-to-severe left mid and upper pulmonary edema is
unchanged. Left-sided pleural effusion is slightly increased
from [**2185-5-17**]. Atelectatsis in the right lower lobe is
stable. The right central line has been removed. The remainder
of the exam is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving pneumonia in the right middle and lower lobes.
2. Persistent moderate edema, despite decreased central venous
pressure.
3. Slight increase in left side pleural effusion.
