initially presenting to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2150-12-24**] with nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms started on [**2150-12-23**] with onset
of violent nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. + fevers, chills,
diaphoresis. + abdominal pain, diffuse, constant with throbbing.
stool non-bloody, no foul odor, not like c.diff stool in past.
stool soft and loose, not watery. also felt lightheaded and lost
balance and fell onto his back on a clothing rack - did not lose
consciousness. no new foods, no sick contacts. ROS + for SOB

pillows, no cough day or night. no cp. admits to muscle and
joint aches for several months in shoulders, knees, elbows,
hands. has pain in back on transfer to floor. blood sugars
250-350 at home. At OSH His initialy labs were notable for
glucose 467, INR 1.51, lactate 5.9. U/A showed hematuria but no
pyuria, negative ketones. He was found to be in DKA, treated
with insulin gtt. The patient's abdominal was markedly
distended, but KUB was normal. Blood cultures grew GPCs in
clusters, later speciated as Staph aureus (culture from

STUDIES:
[**2150-12-26**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm with ventricular pacing, probably biventricular.
Since the previous tracing of [**2148-1-20**] the rate is faster

[**2150-12-26**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
evidence of a left pectoral pacemaker with unchanged course of
the leads. Sternal wires after sternotomy. The patient now has a
nasogastric tube with normal course and a right internal jugular
vein catheter. This catheter projects with its tip over the
upper SVC. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, there is
no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
As compared to the previous exam, the lung volumes are decreased
and there is a mild increase in diameter of the pulmonary
vasculature, potentially
indicative of mild fluid overload.
No pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia.

[**2150-12-27**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. New wall thickening of the cecum and possibly terminal ileum,
likely infectious or inflammatory. Ischemia and typhlitis are
considered less likely, given patient history.
2. Mild ascites and small pleural effusions. No evidence of
abscess or drainable fluid collections.
3. Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and varices.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Foley balloon inflated in prostatic urethra. Please deflate
and advance into the urinary bladder.

[**2150-12-28**] Abd XRAY:
There is borderline diameter of the cecum and the transverse
colon, unchanged to the CT examination from yesterday. However,
no distention is visible. In the left lateral decubitus view,
several smaller colonic air-fluid levels become evident.
No free air, single calcified gallstone.

[**2150-12-28**] LLE U/S:
No DVT in the left lower extremity.

[**2150-12-29**] CXR:
Right
