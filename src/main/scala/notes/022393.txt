Anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patinet is an 86 year old male with a history of advanced
dementia, CAD w/ prior PCI, CHF, CKI (baseline cratinine ~1.3)
COPD, CAF (not on coumadin due to GI bleed), bipolar disorder
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-21**] with abnormal lab
results. He was found to have a hematocrit of 17, WBC of 23. He
was admitted to their ICU for further care.
.
He recieved a total of 9 units of pRBC, but if he had elements
of hemodynamic instaiblity. On the day of transfer hehis hct was
29.8. The patient underwent an EGD which showed a a "huge deep
ulcer" in the distal duodenal bulb with evidence of recent
bleding, but no active bleed. It was injected with 2ml of
epinephrine, but the patient continued to have a falling hct.
General surgy was consulted, who fent that given the patients
multiple comorbidities, embolization for the GDA would be most
appropriate.
.
Other significant elements of his hospitalization include
ongoing chronic AF with a bradicardic response for which
cardiology was consulted. His BB was decreased and his digoxin
was discontinued in the setting of ARF on presentation to 1.9
(now down to baseline of 1.3) with IVF. Additionally, the
patinet was treated empirically for c.diff with PO vancomycin,
despite having 2 stool cultures which were negative. His WBC
fell to 11.4 during his hospitalization. He is now transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further manegment.
.
The patient is currently AAOx1. He denies any abdominal pain,
nausea/vomtiing, fevers/chills, and endorses being hundry. No
complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.

      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

CHEST, AP: The lungs are slightly hyperexpanded. Mild vascular
congestion,
interstitial edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than
right, are slightly improved. Mild bibasilar atelectasis
persists. The
cardiac silhouette is normal. No free intraperitoneal air is
visualized,
although portable radiograph is not in full upright position.

IMPRESSION: Slightly improved edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute blood loss anemia/duodenal ulcer bleed: The cause of his
GI bleed was found to be a deep duodenal ulcer, discovered at
[**Hospital3 **].  Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] his HCT was stable in
the low-mid 20s.  GI, surgery, and IR were consulted.  It was
felt that endoscopy would not be helpful in terms of
intervention.  Surgery did not feel he was a good candidate for
surgery given his multiple comorbidities.  IR felt that
embolization could be pursued if his bleeding resumed.  He was
maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI with good effect and improvement in his
Hct.  No further interventions were performed.  H. pylori was
negative.  His ASA/Plavix were held in house.
- should continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI indefinitely.
- will need GI follow up
- baseline Hct at discharge 27-28
- still had guaiac positive stool at discharge
.
CAD, native: Per report he had underwent stenting many years
ago.  His ASA/plavix were held prior to transfer here.  These
were held in house, his metoprolol and statin were continued.
Going forward, may consider restarting aspirin after resolution
of his ulcer and outpatient assessment.
- aspirin/plavix held.  can consider restarting if duodenal
ulcer heals and is cleard by GI.  risk/benefits should be
discussed with sister.
.
HTN, benign: His metoprolol was continued at lower dose.
Amlodipine was continued.
- metoprolol decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] am/pm, 25mg in the
afternoon
.
Atrial Fibrillation: Stable in house with episodes of
bradycardia to 40-50s.  His digoxin had been held at [**Hospital1 **].
His metoprolol was decreased in house.  Further titration will
be necessary.  He is not an anticoagulation candidate.
- digoxin held, metoprolol adjusted per below
.
Encephalopathy: Likely delirium from GI bleed and UTI.
Supportive care was provided.  His depakote was continued and
increased to 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
UTI: E. coli in urine with encephalopathy.  He was treated with
ceftriaxone x3 days, and discharged on cefpodoxime to complete 5
day course through [**2160-4-3**]
.
CKD: Stable during admission.
.
COPD: started on flovent, spiriva, albuterol prn
.
Baseline was pleasant, lucid/awake, and talkative.  Only
occasionally oriented to place, person.  no focal neurologic
deficits.  has mild cough.
.
DNR/DNI during admission, discussed with sister who is his
primary contact.
