Service:  Cardiology

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 24927**] is a 64-year-old
male who was admitted to the Cardiology Service on [**5-27**]
with an episode of chest pain.  His workup revealed that he
had severe reversible perfusion defects in his lateral and
inferolateral walls on perfusion studies.  They also found
that he had an ejection fraction of 46%.  The patient
complains of symptoms of neck pain radiating to the chest and
back for the last four months.  His pain is associated with
significant gas and would last approximately one to five
minutes.  It would come on with meals, exertion, rest, and
more recently he has woken him from sleep.  His pain would
also resolve with resting, burping, and passing flatus.  He
typically has diaphoresis with his pain but rarely becomes
nauseated.  He has not had any vomiting.  He reports that his
pain has become more frequent occurring anywhere from one to
five times per day.   Of note, he also sleeps on two pillows
at night but denies having any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Renal cell carcinoma, now status post left nephrectomy.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  ? Hyperlipidemia.

He denies having any history of diabetes or hypertension,
prior myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Past surgical history was notable
only for an appendectomy and a hernia repair.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
has smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day for the last 40
years.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin.
2.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination his pulse was 59, his blood pressure was 146/83,
he was saturating 96% on room air.  His neck was without
jugular venous distention.  There was no bruits.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation.  His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was
soft and nontender with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed he had 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On laboratory
studies, his baseline blood urea nitrogen 23 and creatinine
was 1.4.  His white blood cell count on admission was 8. His
hematocrit was 40.  His INR was 1.3, and his liver function
tests were normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and had a cardiac catheterization.  He was started on
intravenous nitroglycerin which appeared to have been
continued up until the time of operation.

Following his catheterization, his renal function was stable
with no resultant increase in his creatinine.  Preoperatively
he was started on Lipitor.  Prior to his operation, he had an
episode of chest pain while in the hospital.  For this
reason, he was started on intravenous heparin, and his
intravenous nitroglycerin was continued.  While he was
waiting for his operation he also had three to four episodes
of polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia at the
rate of 150 to 180.  This was while he was experiencing chest
pain.  He was loaded with magnesium, and his nitroglycerin
was titrated.

On [**2129-6-1**], the patient was taken to the operating room
where he had a coronary artery bypass graft times two.
Vessels grafted were left internal mammary artery to diagonal
and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 54 minutes.  Cross-clamp time
was 29 minutes.  The patient's procedure itself was
unremarkable.  He was taken intubated to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit on a nitroglycerin and propofol drips.

Later that evening, he was extubated, and the following
morning his chest tube was discontinued.  He was transferred
to the hospital floor.  There, he had a temperature of 101.2
on the evening of the first postoperative day.  A sputum
sample was sent that grew both oropharyngeal flora and
gram-negative rods suggesting hemophilus influenza.  He was
started on oral Levaquin.

During his postoperative recovery, on day two, he had an
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation to 190 beats per minute.
During this time he was mentating correctly and sustained his
blood pressure.  This broke spontaneously after approximately
two minutes with no intervention.  He was loaded with both
calcium and magnesium for marginally low levels and given an
extra dose of Lopressor.  The next day his Lopressor was
subsequently increased.  He had no further episodes of atrial
fibrillation for the remainder of his hospitalization.

By the fourth postoperative day, the patient was eating,
ambulating, and voiding.  He was afebrile and felt well
enough to be discharged home.  In addition, the Physical
Therapy staff ambulated with him and felt that he was safe to
be discharged.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On [**2129-6-5**] the patient was discharged
to home in the care of his family.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  In stable condition.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   He was instructed to follow up with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], in two weeks and with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient was discharged to
home on the following medications)
1.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (times seven days).
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. (times seven days).
7.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. (times seven days).
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease; now status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two.
2.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
3.  Nonsustained rapid atrial fibrillation.
