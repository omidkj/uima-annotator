Brief Hospital Course:
On POD 1, the patient was started on subcutaneous heparin and
gotten out of bed, patient was started on sips to help with
irration from the NGT. On POD 2 the NGT was removed and the
patients diet was advanced to clears. On POD 3 the patients diet
was advanced to regular, and the CVC was removed. On POD 4 he
was transfused 2 more units of PRBC's for continued low Hct, to
which he responded appropiately. Cr from the JP drain was
checked and found to be 1.2. POD 5 the patient was switched to
PO medications and SLIV. On POD 5,6 the patient underwent
extensive urostomy care training in preparation for discharge.
.
On POD 7 at 10:40 while the patient was ambulating in the
hallway he experience, "dizziness, with chest pressure and SOB"
and stopped ambulating leaning against a wall. The patient was
helped back to his bed by nursing staff. Nursing [**Name6 (MD) **] paged MD.
Upon arrival the patient was diaphoretic, with a HR in the 90
sinus rhythm. BP was in the high 80s to 90s systolic, with 4L of
O2. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilat, no carotid bruits
were heard, no new heart murmurs. DP pulses were 2+ bilat.
Patient was alert and responsive. Patient was put on oxygen, IV
fluids were restarted, and EKG was ordered, labs were sent.
.
While he was walking with PT he had acute SOB, diaphoresis,
pre-synope, and chest pressure. EKGs showed ST depressions in
the lateral leads and ST elevation in Avf that resolved after 30
min. The patient wsa noted to be hypotensive to 90s (baseline
140s-150s), tachycardic (high 90s/low 100s) and hypoxic 90-95%
on 4 L (previously no O2 requirement). Code STEMI was called,
the patient was started on hep gtt and IVF and then transferred
to the cath lab where he was found to have clean coronaries.
Aspirin 325 mg was given.
.
Pt was continued on heparin drip for to ? PE which was restarted
6 hours post cath. He had bil LE US that as per team report was
negative w/ the plan for VQ scan today given that he has hx of
CKD w/ elevated creatine and recent dye load from cath lab. He
was feeling well with stable VS. He then walked to the bathroom
with the nurse and on his way back he felt diaphoretic and
lightheaded. He then became unresponsive, pulseless, CPR was
started and a code blue was called. After ~ 1 min of CPR he
became responsive, initial trace was bradycardic with wide
complex beats (4-5 beats). On tele, pt looked to have junctional
rhythm then asystole. EKG- showed sinus in the 90s w multifocal
PVCs and PACs. Repeated EKG showed sinus with occ PAC in the
80s. He states to feel well, except for mild chest discomfort
from chest compressions. This was a similar episode from prior
day when he was working with PT yesterday. He felt as if he was
going to ??????pass out??????. This has never happened before prior to
yesterday. He had received metoprolol post op to maintain his HR
< 100 as per urology. This was stopped on [**7-2**] and he was
switched to his home dose of captorpil. He received this on
[**7-3**].

The patient underwent a radical cystectomy ileal conduit urinary
diversion, intraoperative repair of left inguinal hernia
with mesh on [**2188-6-27**]. The procedure was complicated by
significant blood loss (~2300mL) and the patient was transfused
3
units of PRBCs during the procedure. The patient did well in the
post operative period. On POD 1 the patient was started on
subcutaneous heparin and gotten out of bed, patient was started
on sips to help with irration from the NGT. On POD 2 the NGT was
removed and the patients diet was advanced to clears. On POD 3
the patients diet was advanced to regular, and the CVC was
removed. On POD 4 he was transfused 2 more units of PRBC's for
continued low Hct, to which he responded appropiately. Cr from
the JP drain was checked and found to be 1.2. POD 5 the patient
was switched to PO medications and SLIV. On POD 5,6 the patient
underwent extensive urostomy care training in preparation for
discharge.

On POD 7 at 10:40 while the patient was ambulating in the
hallway
he experience, "dizziness, with chest pressure and SOB" and
stopped ambulating leaning against a wall. The patient was
helped
arrival the patient was diaphoretic, with a HR in the 90 sinus
rhythm. BP was in the high 80s to 90s systolic. Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilat, no carotid bruits were heard, no new
heart
murmurs. DP pulses were 2+ bilat. Patient was alert and
responsive. Patient was put on oxygen, IV fluids were restarted,
and EKG was ordered, labs were drawn including chemistries,
coags, cbc, type and cross, troponin. Serial EKG were collected.
The patient had ST depressions in leads V4, V5 and T wave
changes. Aspirin 325 mg was given. The patient continued to have
some chest pressure, that was diminishing in intensity. His SOB
was improving with oxygen and rest. He denied any visual
changes,
or pain elsewhere. At this point medicine and cardiology
services
were consulted. Heparin was started and IV fluids were bolused.
Cardiology initated STEMI code. Patient was taken to cath lab.

On [**7-5**], patient had a troponin bump, and had a CTA which showed
multiple lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Echo showed a dilated and hypokinetic RV consistent with a
medium-large PE. Venous duplex showed DVT of BL posterior tibial
veins, of which the left may be chronic. Could not be started on
Lovenox because of high Cr (had gotten contrast twice for cath
and CTA).

On [**7-6**], patient had a
- F/u final LENI: thrombosis of bilateral posterior tibial
veins, left may be chronic.
- Talk to Urology re: Lovenox -> wait until Cr settles out
(contrast x2 for cath and CTA)
- Pm Hct drop: will get hemolysis labs, fibrinogen, coags, retic
with am labs -> having some hematuria in Foley and urostomy bag
but no clots
[**7-6**]
- Got a PICC
- F/u cath report
- Needs ICU consent
- Urology: NTD, monitor for clots if + and obstructive, call
urology
- Transfused 2 units overnight after having melena (200cc) and
gross hematuria -> decreased to PTT goal 50-60, rechecking labs
at 10am: hct 29. HDS
- 1700 Labs: PTT 66.9 --> changed gtt to 850, Hct 27 --> 26
continues to be HD
- GI consulted: NGL recommended against, think it's the
anastamotic site
- f/u HIT ab
- ?RML and LUL opacity on CXR -> f/u CT read (resolved on
today's CXR) -- on review of CT looks like pleural plaques
[**7-7**]:
- Okay to be out of bed with assist and close monitoring - PT
consult in
- + orthostatics: lying down 13
