Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was seen in the emergency department on [**2138-6-23**]. On
examination she was determined to have a high grade small bowel
obstruction associated with incarcerated ventral hernia. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis confirmed small bowel obstruction. She
was taken to the OR emergently for exploratory laparotomy and
repair of incarcerated hernia. She tolerated the procedure well,
see op report for details. She was extubated and taken to the
SICU for further recovery. She remained in SICU until POD#5. She
was then transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9.
.
Respiratory: After extubation she remained on NC oxygen at 3L.
She was weaned to O2 @ 1L, which she also wears at home as
needed. Breath sounds remained coarse throughout. She recieved
chest PT and nebulizer treatments daily. CXR revealed on
evidence of consolidation or atelectasis.
.
Cardiovascular: Hypertensive post-op. Required Lopressor &
Hydralazine IV and orally in ICU and [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9. Weaned to home meds
at time of discharge.
.
Neuro: Developed confusion in intensive care unit POD#[**5-15**]. Neuro
consult obtained. IV narcotics were discontinued. She was
treated for a sodium level of 150. Her mental status improved
when sodium normalized to 145. Family members indicated she had
experienced confusion on previous admissions. She returned to
[**Location 213**] baseline mental status at time of discharge.
.
GU/Renal: Foley catheter post-op. Aggressively diuresed post-op
in the SICU with Lasix. Creatinine frequently remained elevated
above 1.5. Foley was later discontinued and she voided without
difficulty. Renal service was consulted regarding chronic lasix
use, low urine output, and elevated creatinine. It was advised
that she remain off of lasix at discharge, to be resumed at a
later time in outpatient follow up. Her creatinine of 1.8 was
considered within an expected range for her since her onset of
chronic renal insufficiency. Saline boluses were stopped, and
she remained euvolemic. She was discharged with a follow up
appointment with the renal clinic.
.
GI/Abdomen: Remained soft with midline abdominal incision intact
with staples. POD#7 developed bloody ooze on distal portion of
incision. Sutures added between staples and surgicell packing
placed with fair effect. Oozing stopped, surgicell removed prior
to discharge.
.
Nutrition: remained NPO in early post-op period. Diet was
advanced without difficulty, tolerated a diabetic diet at time
of discharge.
.
Musculoskeletal: Physical therapy consulted for evaluation,
strengthening and conditioning. Continued to progress well and
was able to ambulate 100 feet on room air with a walker at time
of discharge.
.
Ms [**Known lastname **] was discharged home on POD# in stable condition with
all appropriate follow up appointments & prescriptions.
