Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and difficulty breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79F with history of hypertension, osteoporosis and 3+ Mitral
valve regurgitation who presented to [**Company 191**] today with 1 week of
productive cough at home (husband sick with similar illness), no
fevers but lots of green sputum. One week ago the patient went
to her PCP for her yearly physical and was completely well.  At
[**Company 191**] today and was found to be hypoxic to 84% on RA and CXR
showed a left sided pleural effusion.  She was also noted to be
tachycardic with an irregular rhythm and EKG showed afib (no
prior history) so the patient was instructed to go to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 80 128/79 20 94% 6L.   Then
tachy into 150s, EKG showed Afib w/ RVR.  Labs notable WBC of 9
but 32% bands, sodium 130, creatinine of 1.9 and Lactate 3.4.
U/A was negative. Patient was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin
and 2.7L IVF.  After the fluids, the patient became more hypoxic
to 85% and appeared to flash. Gave 20 IV lasix, 20 IV dilt, then
on a dilt drip, on bipap.  RR came down from 44 to 28-32.  Bipap
[**7-9**].  Patient is full code.

On arrival to the MICU,  patient reports she feels somewhat
better.  She was taken off of bipap and put on a NRB but became
more tachypneic so was put back on bipap.  Bedside ultrasound
showed small pleural fluid on the left side.


Past Medical History:
Osteoporosis
Mitral valve prolapse with 3+ MR.  Moderate secondary pulmonary
hypertension.
S/P TAH for leiomyoma [**2108**].
Cyst on back removed in [**2103**].
S/P tonsillectomy.
Episode of shingles.
Breast fibroadenoma left, [**2137**].


Social History:
She is a retired Professor of writing at [**State 17405**], [**Location (un) 86**]. She does not smoke.  Moderate alcohol
consumption, no more than two glasses of wine.  Lives with her
husband. 20 pack years smoking history. Quit smoking 40 years
ago.


Family History:
Father died of congestive heart failure in his 70's.  Mother
died of congestive heart failure at age 88.  She is married with
three stepchildren and four grandchildren.

RELEVANT IMAGING:
[**2152-3-28**] CXR (on admission): Left lower lobe atelectasis and left
pleural effusion; given the possible history of smoking, an
obstructive neoplasm at the left hilum causing left lower lobe
atelectasis and effusion cannot be excluded on this radiograph
and is best further evaluated with a chest CT.

[**2152-4-8**] CXR (on discharge): There is background COPD with
diffuse parenchymal scarring. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is enlarged, though partially obscured on the left by a
moderate-sized pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or
consolidation. There is also a small right pleural effusion,
with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Compared with [**2152-4-6**], 15:38, the left-sided effusion is larger.
Otherwise, I doubt significant change. Patchy opacities
throughout both lungs may represent parenchymal scarring due to
background COPD, but the possibility of a superimposed patchy
interstitial process cannot be entirely excluded. (The
appearance is similar to a film dated [**2152-3-31**], at which time it
was thought to represent extensive multifocal pneumonia.)

[**2152-3-31**] CT CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Extensive multifocal pneumonia, worse in the left lower lobe.
3. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic mild-to-moderate pleural effusions,
predominantly subpulmonic.
4. Bilateral reactive hilar adenopathy.
5. Mild dilatation of the aortic root.

[**2152-3-30**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic
function. Moderate to severe anterior mitral valve leaflet
prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-11-15**],
the left ventricular systolic function is now hyperdynamic
(previously normal). The severity of mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation appear to have decreased somewhat,
although the overall image quality is worse on the current
study. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta are now
dilated.

[**2152-4-3**] [**Month/Day/Year **] WITH SALINE: No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old previously healthy woman with a
history of controlled hypertension and 3+ mitral valve
regurgitation who was admitted to the hospital for multifocal
pneumonia and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response to the 150s, requiring a stay in the
medical intensive care unit before transfer to the medical
floor.
