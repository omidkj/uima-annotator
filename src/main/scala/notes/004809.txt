CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
gentleman with history of coronary artery disease status post
MI in [**2152**] with CABG, unknown coronary anatomy, CHF with an
ejection fraction of less than 20%, history of non sustained
ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia, status post AICD and
pacemaker placement, chronic atrial fibrillation who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 27946**] Hospital on [**2166-1-16**] with
calculus cholecystitis with presumed cholangitis with E. coli
bacteremia.  His course was complicated by sepsis and acute
renal failure with a creatinine of 5.5 and hypoglycemia.  The
patient was fluid resuscitated and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation.  Here
patient had worsening nutritional status, was unable to
tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] total parenteral nutrition was begun.  This
resulted in gross total body overload with the patient being
25 lbs above his dry body weight.  He became progressively
edematous and responsive to diuretics.  He became hypotensive
at one point, experienced dizziness and experienced a rise in
creatinine.  The patient also had a mild bout of hypoxia in
which he was satting 90% on room air but this responded well
with supplemental oxygen.  He was later considered poor
surgical risk secondary to CHF.  A percutaneous draining tube
was placed at an outside hospital for percutaneous drainage
of his biliary system which initially had good result but
then was dislodged and was not replaced.  A follow-up
ultrasound was recorded and showed a contracted gallbladder
with sludge.  He was treated with antibiotics and remained
afebrile along with a stable white count.  He was transferred
to the CCU for an artery line with support for diuresis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for weight gain, fatigue,
jaundice, denies any chest pain, mild shortness of breath,
mild orthopnea, positive for dyspnea on exertion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease status post
MI in [**2152**], CABG at outside hospital. This was done at
U-Mass.  2) Hypertension.  3) Status post pacemaker for non
sustained VT and bradycardia.  4) Chronic renal
insufficiency, creatinine 1.5.  5) Congestive heart failure
with ejection fraction less than 20%, marked amount of severe
TR, trace AI.  6)  Acalculous cholecystitis.  7) History of
C. diff colitis.  8) Increased INR.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer, Ampicillin 2 gm IV q 8 hours,
Protonix 40 mg IV bid, Niferex 150 mg po bid, Flagyl 500 mg
IV qid, Magnesium Oxide 400 mg po bid, Levaquin 250 mg IV q
d, Dilaudid prn, Lactulose, Tylenol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for tobacco, denies any alcohol
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.7, blood pressure
92/55, pulse 70, respiratory rate 18, satting 96% on room
air.  Weight 172 lbs.  In general, he is jaundiced,
chronically ill appearing.  HEENT: Sclera icteric,
extraocular movements intact, pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, mucus membranes moist.  Poor dentition.
Neck, JVD up to the level of the jaw.  Chest, no spider
angiomas, positive for vascular venous congestion over
anterior chest wall, decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  He
also had left mild basilar crackles.  Cardiovascular,
irregular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, positive S3.  He
has a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border.  Abdomen was soft and positive for tenderness
in right upper quadrant greater than the other.  He had
positive guarding and mild rebound.  He also had mild ascites
and positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.  Extremities, bilateral pitting
edema, 4+ upper and lower extremity edema.  There is
ecchymosis around his upper arms.  EKG shows ventricular
paced, rate of 70.  There is question of PVCs vs normal
conduction left bundle branch block morphology.  Chest x-ray
on [**1-19**] revealed CHF, multifocal, patchy bony opacity,
especially in right perihilar region and bilateral bases and
a small left and right pleural effusion.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 38.7, white count 8.6, platelet
count 193,000, MCV 91, calcium 8.8, albumin 2.7, phosphorus
.9, magnesium 2.4, PT 20.6, PTT 2.4, INR 1.9, sodium 131,
potassium 4.1, chloride 91, CO2 23, BUN 60, creatinine 2.2,
glucose 69, ALT 10, AST 78, alkaline phosphatase 138, total
bilirubin 12.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  A right IJ course was placed and a
pulmonary artery catheter was inserted.  Following capillary
wedge pressure was 35 and cardiac index was 1.2.  Dobutamine
drip was started for inotropic support.  Renal dose Dopamine
was also added to augment renal perfusion.  Lasix and Diuril
were started for aggressive diuresis.  All the above failed
to significantly diurese the patient as the patient still
remained positive at this point.  His pacer rate was
increased to 100 beats per minute, also to increase the renal
perfusion in hopes of diuresis.  Milrinone was later added
which also failed the goal of diuresing the patient.  During
the course of this hospital stay the patient's blood
pressures fell and eventually his dose of Dopamine was
increased to a level at which it was acting as a pressor.  In
attempt to further improve the patient's cardiac output,
cardioversion was attempted to convert the patient into
sinus.  This was complicated by monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia which resolved with multiple defibrillation via
ICD and Lidocaine.  He was then started on a Procainamide
drip.  After failing all modes of therapy, the patient
decided to make the patient comfort measures only.  He was
started on a Morphine drip and his other medications were
discontinued.  He passed away peacefully on [**2166-2-5**].

2.  Infectious Disease:  He was started on Levaquin,
Ampicillin and Flagyl.  Because the patient had no signs of
infection, the Ampicillin was eventually discontinued.  When
he was made comfort measures only, all his antibiotics were
discontinued.

3.  Renal:  Creatinine steadily worsened despite aggressive
inotropic support and attempts at diuresing the patient.

4.  GI:  Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no
gallbladder distention, no ductal dilatation and evidence
consistent with passive hepatic congestion from CHF.  GI
consult was obtained and they felt that it was too risky to
perform an ERCP given the serious and stable state of the
patient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Chronic renal failure.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post pacemaker ICD for SVT.
6.  Bradycardia.
7.  Acalculous cholecystitis.
