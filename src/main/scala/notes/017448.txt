HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
male with a history of aortic valve replacement for infected
endocarditis on [**2124-2-4**], thought to be secondary to
lower extremity osteomyelitis, likely Streptococcus
organism.  He was admitted on [**2124-11-22**] to the
Podiatry Service for  left foot ulceration.  During the
stay on Podiatry Service he developed moderate to severe
cardiovalvular leak/dehiscence.  The patient also has
diabetes whose course is complicated by end stage renal
disease on hemodialysis and has been followed by the Renal
Service here at [**Hospital6 256**] since
[**2124-11-22**], getting dialysis Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays.  Renal notes have noted a I/VI systolic murmur and
clear lungs over the hospital course, however, bibasilar
crackles have developed and a systolic murmur was noted to
have increase on [**11-28**] and a S3 was heard as well on
that date.  An echocardiogram was recommended, this
echocardiogram on [**2124-11-30**] which was a transthoracic
echocardiogram and showed left ventricular hypertrophy with
an ejection fraction of 55% with moderate dilated aortic
root, question of a partial dehiscence with 3 to 4+ aortic
insufficiency ? abscess, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.  A follow up transesophageal
echocardiogram was performed on [**12-1**].  This showed
partial dehiscence and echolucent cavity 2.4 times 3 cm.
which is felt to be very suspicious for an abscess or an
intravalvular fibrosing hematoma.  The patient had blood
cultures drawn on [**11-30**], two sets which have shown no
growth to date as of [**12-1**].  He has also had swabs that
were done from his left foot wound, one swab grew rare
coagulase positive Staphylococcus, rare coagulase negative
Staphylococcus and rare diphtheroids.  Another one from
[**11-21**] grew rare Methicillin-sensitive resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, again out of the left foot.  The
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Cardiac Care Unit Service on the evening of [**12-1**]
secondary to his worsening echocardiogram and worsening lung
and cardiac examination.  The patient denied shortness of
breath or any chest pain, feeling rundown fatigued or any
fevers, chills or rigors.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for aortic valve replacement
mentioned [**2124-2-2**], diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension.  He also has had the osteomyelitis complicated
by left transmetatarsal amputation.  He also has chronic
venous stasis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is on disability.  He quit smoking in
[**2089**].  He does not drink.  He does not use drugs.  He has a
family history of coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications on transfer from the Podiatry
Service to the GCU Service included Metoclopramide, Synthroid
25 mcg q.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Nephrocaps, sliding scale
insulin, Levaquin 250 q.o.d., Flagyl 50 q.d. and Protonix and
Aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on [**12-1**]
revealed temperature 99.1, blood pressure 102/70, 94% on 3
liters nasal cannula pulsed at 3 liters 90 q. shift, lying,
nasal cannula.  Jugulovenous distension slightly increased to
9 cm, roughly 4 to 5 cm above the angle of Luie.  He has
crackles roughly two-thirds the way up bilaterally.  Chest
shows a normal median sternotomy scar.  Skin shows evidence
of a lower extremity venous stasis changes.  His heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, S3
is appreciated.  There is no S4 appreciated.  There is an
early systolic II/VI murmur and a diastolic rumble II/VI.
His carotids are palpable [**2-3**].  There are no bruits
bilaterally.  He has bilateral edema, roughly 1 to 2+ and he
has vacuum dressing on his left lower extremity.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram on [**2124-11-22**],
sinus at 89, leftward axis at roughly 50 degrees, PR 16, QTC
478, QRS 156, right bundle branch block with left anterior
fascicular block with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
Echocardiogram as mentioned above.  Laboratory data on
[**12-1**], white count 8.2, hematocrit 29.8, hemoglobin 9.4,
MCV 89, platelet count 372, INR 1.3 on [**11-24**].  PTT was
26.  Urinalysis on [**11-22**], 8 white blood cells, a few
bacteria, 2 red blood cells.  Chem-7 on [**12-1**], sodium
134, potassium 5.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 24, BUN 58,
creatinine .5, glucose 91, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 4.5,
calcium 8 all predialysis, but will repeat.  Blood cultures,
two sets on [**11-30**] showed no growth to date, another set
is being drawn on [**12-1**].  Swab of the left foot on
[**11-23**], coagulase positive Staphylococcus rare, coagulase
negative Staphylococcus rare, diphtheroids rare.  Urine
culture, no growth to date on [**11-22**].  On [**11-21**],
wound Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus
rare, left foot.

The patient is a 60 year old male with
osteomyelitis, status post debridement and left
transmetatarsal amputation who has a history of endocarditis,
chronic aortic valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve on
[**2124-2-2**], also he has diabetes complicated by
hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, now has a
perivalvular leak, presence of abscess on a transesophageal
echocardiogram, left with the assumption that this is
endocarditis likely coming from the foot wound in terms of
possible source that has lead to the vascular infection.

HOSPITAL COURSE/PLAN:  1.  Failure - The patient is anuric,
will consult Renal Team, AMC if we can pick up some more
volume via dialysis.
2.  Adding ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction as blood
pressure tolerates.
3.  Addressing the infectious issues of the endocarditis, we
will dose the patient's Vancomycin.  Check Vancomycin level
and dose the patient's Vancomycin bilevel for a level of 15
and give the patient a dose of Gentamicin 80 intravenously
times one.  Then we will dose the Gentamicin after dialysis.
4.  The patient is already end stage renal disease and
anuric, the Gentamicin is modified in terms of renal
toxicity.
5.  Check daily electrocardiograms, following Prolene suture.
6.  Place the patient on Telemetry.
7.  Continue Aspirin and Lipitor.
8.  Cardiothoracic Surgery is following our patient and is
going to follow him closely regarding the timing of surgery.
Ideally we are trying to have the patient transfer back to
[**Hospital1 2177**] for evaluation and treatment by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] who performed
the initial aortic valve replacement.
9.  We are ultimately going to continue Levo and Flagyl for
broad coverage, however, at the current time it is obvious
that that is the source, most concerning is for
Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
10. Per the diabetes, we are going to continue the patient on
a sliding scale, tight glucose control if his sugars are very
high we will continue the drip.  At this point, the patient
is hemodynamically stable, not requiring any pressure
support. If it does become an issue, check Cortisol, to make
sure the patient is not insufficient.
11. Transfer the patient to the TCU here for monitoring and
attempts to transfer him to [**Hospital1 2177**] electively for evaluation for
possible aortic valve replacement.
