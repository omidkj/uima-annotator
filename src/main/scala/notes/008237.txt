Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, flash pulmonary edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac Catheterization- No intervention


History of Present Illness:
70 year old with hypertension initially presenting with
acute-onset SOB [**2-4**], tranferred from NWH and [**Location (un) 620**] for acute
pulmonary edema in setting of ? new LBBB, ? CK elevation. In
brief, patient had, at 10 AM, acute-onset SOB last night while
laying flat attempting to sleep. Of note, over past few months,
patient has had difficulty sleeping, but does not attribute this
to shortness of breath or cough, no orthopnea, PND, or LE edema,
though has gained > 30 lbs over ? months - ? years. In setting
of SOB, no associated fevers, chills, cough, sputum, chest pain,
palpitations, pleuritic chest pain, LE edema or calf tenderness.
Never had this SOB in past; reports no exertional chest pain or
dyspnea. Also, no recent dietary indiscretion or medication
changes/non-compliance. Had echocardiogram in distant past, with
"normal results," but admits to "heart murmur" since birth. No
history of clotting abnormalities. At [**Hospital3 **], her O2
saturation was 95% NRB, RR 32, BP 165/79 HR 98, given lasix 60
mg IV (-100 cc), morphine 2 mg IV, baby ASA, [**Name2 (NI) 63084**] 1" for
acute pulmonary edema, with O2 requirement down to 4 L 91%.
Given ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV for UTI. Also ? CK elevation (? at
2 AM) prompting eventual transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**], where
afebrile, HR 106, BP 133/67; chest x-ray consistent with
pulmonary edema, BNP 335, CK 71, Tn < 0.01 (unclear when these
were drawn). Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

HEENT: OP clear, MM dry, EOMI, anincteric
Neck: Supple, full ROM. JVP < clavicle, no HJR
Chest: Wet rales [**2-18**] way up bilaterally, + inspiratory wheeze on
R
Cor: Regular rate and rhythm, harsh III/VI systolic murmur at
RUSB => carotids, no augmentation with Valsalva
Abd: Soft, NT ND + BS
Extr: No edema, 2+ DP
Neuro: CN II-XII intact, motor/sensory grossly intact

Imaging
EKG [**2-5**]: AF at 89, LBBB with 2' ST/T wave changes, none > 5 mm
or concordant, no Q waves
EKG [**2184**] (old): NSR at 96, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST/T wave
changes, no evidence of LVH, +PAC +PVC, no Q waves

CXR: pulmonary edema (OSH)

CATH:
1. Normal coronary arteries
2. Severe aortic stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.7cm2
3. Severely elevated left heart filling pressure.
4. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated normal coronary arteries. The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and
RCA were all patent without any angiographically apparent flow
limiting disease. The vessels were also noted to be tortuous.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated moderately elevated right and severely elevated
left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15mmHg, LVEDP 35mmHg). There
was severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension. There was no mitral stenosis
appreciated. The calculated cardiac output by the Fick method
was 4.2
L/min with a cardiac index of 2.2.
3. The mean transaortic pressure gradient was 26mmHg measured
with a
double lumen pigtail catheter. The aortic valve area calculated
by the
Gorlin formula was 0.7 cm2.

Carotid non-invasive studies [**2191-2-9**] negative


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1) CARDIOVASCULAR: Initially transferred for flash pulmonary
edema, that was thought possibly secondary to tight aortic
stenosis + mitral regurgitation. Echocardiogram demonstrated
results as above: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], LV moderately dilated, LV
systolic function depressed, resting mid-distal anteroseptal
hypokinesis. 1+ AR, 3+ MR, moderate AS, small effusion w/o
tamponade. Cardiac catheterization as above. Lasix was continued
as home PO lasix and [**Last Name (un) **]. Chest x-ray with cardiomegaly. ECG was
NSR at 96 with normal axis, intervals, no ST/T wave changes,
with multiple multifocal PACs. Telemetry with one episode to
120s, with pause x 6 seconds x 1 in setting of beta-blockade,
which was decreased. ASA, statin was continued. She was seen by
cardiac surgery, who recommended pre-op eval (Carotids
non-invasive negative) for MVR, AVR, which will be scheduled for
next week. She will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65483**] (of CT surgery).

2) Renal/FEN: Creatinine of baseline of 1.0 => 1.4, which
remained at that level throughout. This will need to be followed
as outpatient. Lasix and [**Last Name (un) **] were continued at home dose.

3) ID: She was diagnosed and treated with bactrim x 3 days for
UTI. WBC was increased on discharge, but she was without
symptoms of infection and remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

5) Endo: TSH 2.9, with continuation of synthroid and MVI.

6) Prophy: PPI, SQ heparin, colace
