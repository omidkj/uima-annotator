History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 31624**] is a 63 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for esophageal cancer s/p resection with a recent admission from
[**Date range (1) 78207**] for PE s/p IVC filter placement with hospital course
complicated by hypovolemic/septic shock, UGIB from anastamosis
site, Candidemia, lacunar infarcts, NSTEMI, AF with RVR, CoNS
bacteremia now admitted to the MICU for fever and a hematocrit
drop.  With regard to the patient's recent hospitalization, he
was initially admitted on [**12-7**] with dyspnea found to have
mulitple segmental and subsegmental PEs in the superior segment
of the RUL and RML. He was subsequently transferred to MICU
[**Location (un) **] for hypotension in the setting of large volume UGIB,
which on EGD was found to be due to a large bleeding ulcer at
the site of prior anastamosis that was clipped, and he
ultimately was transfused 17 units PRBCs with a discharge hct of
37.  He was also found during admission to have fungemia
speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans treated with micafungin, ambisome,
and then flucanzole with a course that completed on [**1-9**], as
well as CoNS bacteremia treaed with vancomycin for 14 days
(completed on [**1-8**]).  During this hospitalization, his course
was also complicated by ARF, NSTEMI with a TnT peak 3.17, MB
peak 97, and AF with RVR treated wtih metoprolol and amiodarone.
 With regard to PE management, the patient had an IVC filter
placed and was discharged without systemic anticoagulation.
Today, the patient was noted to be febrile to 103 for which he
received levofloxacin, and a 12 point hct drop over from 10 days
prior, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 99.6 84 124/64 18 98%RA.  The
patient was noted to have a hct of 22 and was guaiac positive,
and received 1 unit PRBC transfusion.  He also had a CTAP that
demonstrated bibasilar opacities (L>R) without intraabdominal
fluid collections or bowel obstruction. The patient received
pip/tazo and was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints. Denies CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, palpitations.
.
ROS: As above, otherwise negative.

EGD:
Well healing ulcer anterior to gastro-jejunostomy site in
conduit without high risk features. No blood in stomach. Given
no source of subacute hematocrit drop recommend NG placement and
rapid prep for colonoscopy with anesthesia present in AM prior
to discussion regarding anticoagulation.
.
.
Colonoscopy:
No clear lesion or source of bleeding identified. Diverticula.
No blood in colon. Due to stool in colon small lesions may have
been missed. Please remain in ICU and discussion regarding
anticoagulation with primary team.
.
.
Blood, urine, and fungal cultures all NGTD.
.
.
ECHO: [**1-18**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
valve abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
