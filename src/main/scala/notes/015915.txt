Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital as a same day admission
and brought to the Operating Room on [**2169-2-24**] where  he underwent
mitral valve repair with a resection of the middle scallop of
the posterior leaflet and a mitral valve annuloplasty with a
32-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] saddle ring as well as coronary artery bypass
grafting x4. See operative note for full details.

 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. On POD 3 night he went into rapid atrial
fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm approximately 8
hours later with IV Lopressor and IV Amiodarone bolus. Oral
Lopressor was increased for better rate control. The patient was
evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.

He had nocturnal atrial fibrillation on two other occasions and
was therefor begun on Coumadin. At discharge on POD 6 he was in
in rate controlled atrial fibrillation, was ambulating freely,
the wounds were healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA services
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Coumadin will be regulated by his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
