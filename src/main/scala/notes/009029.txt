CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG in
[**2157**] with a saphenous vein graft to PDA SVG to LAD and to the
RCA, CHF with ejection fraction of approximately 45% in [**2160**].
The patient presents from an outside hospital with chest pain
here for therapy.  The patient was in the usual state of
health approximately two weeks ago.  The patient has noted
progressive dyspnea on exertion, increasing orthopnea and
progressive paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient has
had shortness of breath times three days, progressing to
hospital admission at [**Hospital6 2910**] on
[**2162-8-12**].  The shortness of breath resolved over the next
six days with aggressive diuresis.  The patient was also in
new onset atrial fibrillation.  The patient was started on
anticoagulation with Amiodarone.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**8-19**]. The patient developed severe chest pain and shortness of
breath.  EKG taken at that time revealed left bundle branch
block with atrial fibrillation in the 150s.  The patient was
given IV Lopressor, Lasix, and Cardizem drip.  Enzymes
revealed CK of 263, MB 24, troponin 20.3.  Echocardiogram
revealed inferior posterior and septal hypokinesis with
ejection fraction of 30%, 2+ to 3+ MR and 1+ AR and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for wound cutting and brachytherapy.

Cardiac catheterization revealed hemodynamics in the right
atrium of 12, right ventricle 65/3, PA pressure of 62/31,
wedge of 35.  Angiography revealed moderate disease, left
main 100% native LAD, left circumflex and moderate disease
100% proximal RCA, PDA restenosis in stent, 80% in stent
restenosis in the RPDA, unable to perform brachytherapy, but
had successful wound cutting.  The patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for CHF and MI management.

The patient drinks alcohol occasionally and is able to walk
and ambulate on his own.

FAMILY HISTORY:  History is significant for coronary artery
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  Temperature 97.0, heart rate 95 and irregular.
Blood pressure 137/84, respiratory rate 36, 96% on 10 liters
face mask.  GENERAL:  The patient appears tachypneic, but is
a pleasant male, alert and awake.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Mucous membranes dry.
Oropharynx clear.  NECK:  Jugulovenous distention at 8 cm at
30 degrees, supple with no carotid bruits.  LUNGS:  Crackles,
left greater than right approximately [**12-17**] of the way up in
the bases.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 irregular rate, no S3,
S4, 3/6 systolic murmur loudest at the apex radiating to the
axilla.  No rubs or gallops.  Abdominal examination revealed
bowel sounds present.  Umbilical hernia present, which is
reducible, soft, nontender, nondistended, no guarding,
tenderness, or rebound.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis
or edema, warm and Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  GROIN:  There was a small hematoma with minimal
oozing in the right groin.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count 6.7 hematocrit 26.1, platelet count 156,000,
sodium 141, potassium 5.0, chloride 103, CO2 23, BUN 70,
creatinine 3.6, glucose 175, Digoxin 1.1.  CK from the
outside hospital revealed 263 with MB fraction at 24 and
troponin at 20.  Upon arrival to the hospital the CK was 183,
with MB fraction of 14 and a troponin of 43.

EKG on admission revealed atrial fibrillation with normal QRS
axis, left bundle branch block, flipped T waves in V3 through
V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on aspirin
and started on Plavix and Integrilin for 18 hours post
catheterization.  He was also started on Lipitor for the
coronary arteries.  He continued on Amiodarone and Coumadin
for the atrial fibrillation.  Regarding the cardiac pump, he
was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and Zaroxolyn, but
required doses of Lasix up to 200 mg with only a
mild-to-moderate response.  In addition to Lasix and
Zaroxolyn therapy, .................... as added and the
patient diuresed well, meeting daily fluid balance goals.
The pulmonary examination markedly improved over the hospital
course requiring less supplemental oxygen and he was left on
a standing dose of Lasix 20 mg PO, which will be titrated as
needed to maintain the fluid balance.

Echocardiogram performed after the cardiac catheterization
revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, moderately dilated
right atrium, diametric left ventricular hypertrophy, basal
inferior and inferolateral akinesis with mild aortic
regurgitation and severe mitral regurgitation.  The patient
will continue on his current medications.  The patient will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

#2.  RENAL:  The patient was initially admitted with a
creatinine elevated compared to the baseline creatinine.  It
was initially thought that the rise in the creatinine was due
to acute tubular necrosis.  Mucomyst 500 b.i.d. was given for
two doses after the cardiac catheterization.  The creatinine
levels continued to rise to a peak of 4.2.  The Renal Service
was consulted and agreed with the diagnosis of
contrast-induced nephropathy.  A renal ultrasound was checked
to rule out hydronephrosis, which came back negative.  Urine
sediment was examined, which revealed white blood cells, but
negative for eosinophils.  The creatinine started to
downtrend from his peak.  At the time of dictation, the
creatinine was 3.1.  MRA of the kidneys was performed to rule
out baseline renal artery stenosis.  The MRA showed moderate
left renal artery stenosis with an accessory renal artery on
the left side with high graft stenosis.  The right renal
artery had low-grade stenosis, also concomitant findings
during the MRA revealed large cyst in the pancreas, also with
renal cortical thinning in the kidneys.  The renal artery
stenosis will be further evaluated at the later date.

#3.  ANEMIA:  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit of
26.1 upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells with minimal
response in the hematocrit.  He was then given an additional
two units of packed red blood cells with an adequate bump in
the creatinine and required no further transfusion.

#4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient continued to have elevated blood
sugars throughout the admission.  The patient was started on
oral hypoglycemic, Glyburide 2.5 mg PO q.d. for better
optimal blood sugar control.

#5.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 46**]
Rehabilitation with appropriate follow up with his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide 2.5 mg PO q.d.
2.  Furosemide 20 mg PO b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Metoprolol 25 mg PO b.i.d.
5.  Warfarin 2 mg PO q.h.s.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg PO q.d.
