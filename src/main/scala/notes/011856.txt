Patient was last seen well seen well on [**2189-3-29**] at 3AM after
going to sleep well at 8pm the preceding day. At that time he
complained of
"itching" in his right arm and put some wlcohol on it and went
back to sleep (patient sleeps in another room given sporadic
"gasping" during sleep which likely represents undiagnosed OSA).
He denied any weakness or sensory disturbance at that time and
wife spoke to himm and speech was normal. He then went back to
bed. At 0500 AM (wife very sure of the time as she remembers
clearly looking at the clock) she heard a loud bang and found
her husband had fallen on teh stairs on a landing at the bottom
of 6 steps. There was blood on the stairs noted after EMS left.
At that point, his eyes were open and he was not responding but
appeared uncomfortable. Wife tried to help him up but his right
side was rigid and he was not moving his right side. She also
noticed that he was profusely sweating an dhe was not pale or
cold and was not grasping at his cchest. He was not following
commands and he seemed to have roving eye movements going from
side to side and was not able to fix on a point ot at his wife's
face.
He has a history of TIA and is on dabbigatran for his AF. His
last
dose was on [**2189-3-28**] at around 5 PM. He has not missed any doses.
Per report (I arrivved to relieve a colleague at 07:15) on
presentation he was globally aphasic with a dense right
hemiparesis.
At baseline he is fully functional and very active
per family members. Of note, patient had been well yesterday
although wife [**Name (NI) 76616**] patient felt transiently light-headed 2
days ago while in a store after shopping for 8 hours which did
not recur denied CP and drove himself home.

patient as intubated and ventilated.

Imaging studies:

MRI brain

[**2189-3-30**]:

IMPRESSION:  Subacute infarction involving predominantly the
left frontal
lobe, with extension into the left putamen, globus pallidus,
caudate, as well as the parietal and occipital lobes.
Hemorrhage within the left globus pallidus.

ECHO:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Left atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect or PFO is
seen by 2D or color Doppler and after saline bubble injection.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVE~35-40%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened with no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolus (other than atrial
fibrillation) identified.
