CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right thigh wound.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 70-year-old female, with
known peripheral vascular disease and is status post multiple
vascular surgeries, presents to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] office with a
right knee-thigh pain since [**2142-11-10**], and acute
right thigh drainage today, bloody in character. Outside work-
up included knee films which were negative, intra-articular
cortisone injection without improvement to the knee, an MRI
of the spine which demonstrated disk disease. Patient was to
get an epidural injection, but this was not done secondary to
her current symptoms. Patient denies fevers, chills, sweats.
She denies glucose changes. She was seen by her primary care
physician and started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg on [**2142-12-28**]. There had been no changes in the right knee pain. She
is now admitted for post incision and drainage in the office
for IV antibiotics and wound care.

[**2127**], removal of the fem-fem bypass with vein patch
angioplasty to the PFA in [**2128**], a redo common femoral BK [**Doctor Last Name **]
with 8-mm PTFE in [**2139-11-15**], also a thrombectomy of the
common femoral artery at the same time, a left temporal
biopsy in [**2141-3-16**] which was negative, a jump graft of
right fem [**Doctor Last Name **] to BK [**Doctor Last Name **] with PTFE, and endarterectomy of the
popliteal artery in [**2142-2-13**].

SOCIALLY:  The patient lives with her husband. She ambulates
with a cane. She denies smoking or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  VITAL SIGNS: 138/70, 68, 16, O2 sat 96% in
room air. HEENT EXAM: There is no JVD, a left carotid bruit,
carotids are palpable 2 plus bilaterally. Lungs are clear to
auscultation. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without
murmur, gallop or rub. Abdominal exam is soft, nontender,
bowel sounds x4. There are no bruits or masses. Peripheral
vascular exam: The right thigh is with a 2x2 opening with
surrounding erythema and warmth to palpation. Pulse exam
shows on the right radial artery palpable 1 plus, femoral 2
plus, DP and PT palpable at 2 plus. On the left, the radial,
femoral, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial are all palpable at
2 plus. NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: Patient is oriented x3, nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. She was placed on bed rest. Wound cultures were
obtained. Routine labs were obtained. Antibiotics of
vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl were instituted. Blood
cultures and urine cultures were obtained. For diabetes, we
continued her current regime. Hemoglobin A1C was obtained. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained. A urinalysis was done to rule
out a UTI. The patient was continued on her antihypertensive
medications. Electrocardiogram was checked initially with no
acute changes. Coumadinization was held in anticipation for
potential further surgical intervention versus diagnostic
procedure. Initial swab grew oxacillin resistant staph, coag-
positive, heavy growth. Sensitivities to Bactrim were
requested, and this was sensitive to vancomycin, Bactrim,
tetracycline and gentamicin. The anaerobe cultures were no
growth. Blood cultures: Initial cultures grew [**1-17**] Staph coag-
positive, oxacillin resistant. The patient's repeated blood
cultures x3 were no growth and finalized. The patient had
urine cultures. She required several samplings until we
obtained an adequate urine for culture which was no growth.

On hospital day #2, patient complained of chest discomfort.
She was alert. Vital signs were stable. EKG during chest pain
showed no acute changes. There was some mild ST depression in
III, AVF, V1 and V2, as compared with the EKG on [**2142-3-18**]. Nitroglycerin relieved the symptoms within 3 minutes. A
repeat EKG was without change.

[**Last Name (un) **] followed the patient during her hospitalization for
diabetic management. Her hemoglobin A1C was 7.9. Infectious
disease was consulted for recommendations for appropriate
antibiotic therapy and length of therapy. Patient was
continued on current therapy. A vascular lab ultrasound
secondary to carotid disease and no follow-up in 2 years.
This showed a moderate plaque in the right internal carotid
artery and the left, the right being greater with narrowing
of the right of 40-59%, and on the left 60-69%. There was
normal left vertebral antegrade flow, and the right vertebral
was occluded. Patient had an MR of the lumbar spine obtained.
There were no abnormal signals within the vertebral bodies.
There was some loss of signal in L3-L4, L4-5, L5 and S1.
Intervertebral disk indicates some degenerative changes with
minimal loss of height in 3 and 4, with no significant
bulging of the disk. Significant disease was noted in L5 and
S1 with intervertebral disk loss and focal right base
protrusion and herniation into the spinal canal causing
displacement and compression of the S1 nerve root sleeve.
There was mild compression of the thecal sac at this level.
There was no abnormal signal within the disk to suggest
diskitis. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal.
There is no evidence for abscess, or other fluid collections.
The patient's aortobifemoral graft was identified.

The patient had an MRA of the aorta and pelvic vessels and
the right leg vessels. The abdominal aorta was unchanged in
appearance. Renal arteries: Right there were 2, on the left
it was singular and were patent. The celiac and superior
mesenteric were patent. Aortobifemoral bypass was widely
patent throughout, originating from the distal infrarenal
aorta proximally and midway between the origin of the renal
arteries and the native bifurcation. The graft shows no
narrowing into its anastomosis with the common femoral
arteries bilaterally, where there are clip artifacts. There
are no collaterals to suggest high-grade stenosis. The native
distal aorta to graft origin remains patent with some
irregularity. There was irregularly, as well, within the
bilateral common iliacs which remain patent until the level
of the bifurcation. No internal iliac arteries could be
identified. On the right lower extremity, there is a
pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral just beyond the
insertion to the right aortobifemoral artery graft which has
increased in size. It now measures 13-mm in diameter and 60-
mm in length. Previously, it was a 9x16. The profunda on the
right is patent. The right fem above-knee popliteal graft
shows mild narrowing proximally just distal to the
pseudoaneurysm, and it returns to normal caliber within the
proximal thigh. It is widely patent to the distal thigh where
the jump graft originates. Jump graft from the fem above-knee
popliteal graft to below-knee popliteal graft is completely
thrombosed. Throughout its entire extent, there is extensive
enhancement surrounding the occluded graft which occluded
distally at its anatomosis to below-the-knee popliteal and
medially at its origin which extends i
