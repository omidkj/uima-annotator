HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is an 87-year-old woman
found down by her daughter at home last seen well 24 hours
prior. Patient had bilateral movement of her extremities at
the scene, blood on her face. Found face down on the floor
apparently moving all extremities equally at the scene, but
intubated for airway protection. Was taken to [**Hospital6 3426**] where head CT showed a small subdural hematoma on
the right. Patient was given Ativan 2 mg and then loaded with
IV Dilantin.

Past medical history of hypertension, asthma, ankle fracture
in [**2198-12-15**].

On exam, her temperature was 98.9, heart rate 77, BP 131-
181/60-111. Patient was vented. She was intubated and
sedated. HEENT: She had racoon eyes. Neck: She was in a C.
collar. Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm. Pulmonary: Breath
sounds clear throughout. Abdomen: Soft, nontender,
nondistended. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologically: Sedated, not alert. Pupils: 2 mm and briskly
reactive. She has positive corneals, positive gag. Face is
symmetric. Minimal withdraw to noxious stimulation in all
four extremities.

Head CT shows right frontoparietal subdural 9 mm at its
maximum thickness along the surface of the right frontal
area. No midline shift and no mass effect.

Patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurologic
observation. Blood pressure was kept less than 140, and she
was q.1h. neuro checks. INR less than 1.3. In speaking with
the family on [**2199-4-23**], it was the family's wish that the
patient become made DNR/DNI.

On [**4-24**], the patient was extubated, and successfully and
verbally following commands. Platelet count was low at 81,
and she was transfused with platelets. Patient was evaluated
by cardiology for her Afib. They recommended rate control, a
surface echocardiogram, keeping her electrolytes within
normal limits, keeping her heart rate in the 60 range.

EEG was done, which just showed encephalopathy. The patient
had repeat head CT which was stable.

On [**2199-4-25**], she was transferred to the step-down unit.
She remained awake, alert, following commands, and moving all
extremities. On [**2199-4-26**], the patient had episode of
nonsustained V-tach. Patient ruled out for a MI. Cardiology
was notified. She continued to have some episodes of
respiratory distress requiring some Lasix for CHF and also
increasing heart rate with episodes of rapid Afib.

Cardiology was reconsulted, and her Lopressor was increased.
She was loaded with digoxin. She was seen by cardiology for
possible cardioversion if rate control was not obtained. She
remained neurologically opening her eyes briefly, following
commands intermittently, verbalizing her name. Patient was
seen by speech and swallow for possible PEG, although patient
did not respond well to swallow testing. They did feel that
with a couple of more days, before mental status improves,
she may be able to generate a swallow without aspiration.
Currently, she is at high aspiration risk and requires a
feeding tube in place.

Her vital signs have remained stable. She has been afebrile.
She did have an induced sputum sent on [**2199-4-24**] that
showed gram-negative rods. Although she has an allergy to
penicillin, sensitivities on the sputum were performed.
Currently, Bactrim sensitivity is still pending. The
patient's vital signs have remained stable, and she is
currently afebrile, and she was transferred to the medical
service on [**2199-4-29**].
