Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 yom with history of CAD s/p CABG x 5 in [**2144**], UGIB,
Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 20%), hx of VT s/p PPM/ICD in [**2144**],
Afib on Coumadin, Hyperlipidemia who presents from home with
weakness x 10 days. Patient reports feeling increasing weakness
over this time, +dry cough as well. He denies any worsening SOB
but does report some worsening orthopnea and PND. He sleeps with
two pillows at baseline and this has not increased over this
time frame. He denies any worsening DOE or pedal edema. He
weighs himself every 2 days and has not noted any increase in
weight. Last wednesday he, reports 2 episodes of ICD firing when
he was getting out of the bathtub. He denies any syncope, fall,
chest pain, N/V or diaphoresis during this event. He denies any
recent fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain, N/V, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, dysuria or hematuria. Patient
reports +anuria over the past week, states he has not urintated
in 7 days. He took double his dose of lasix over the weekend
given his anuria but did not have any urine output.
.
Of note, patient has been in the hospital twice over the past
two months. He was hospitalized from [**8-24**] - [**8-27**] for a CHF
exacerbation. He presented to the hospital with SOB and found to
have a lactate of 13.7. Sepsis was a concern but not infectious
source was found. CXR was done and showed +pulmonary edema, he
was diuresed over the course of his hospitalization and his
lactate trended down to normal. LFT were also noted to be
elevated with peak AST of 2094 and peak ALT 711 with Tbili peak
of 5.2 and INR of 4.7. This was thought to be [**1-1**] congestive
hepatopathy. Lorazepam, clonazepam, simvastatin, midodrine, and
zolpidem were also discontinued at that time out of concern for
causing hepatic damage. He was again hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 31933**] for ICD firing. On the morning of [**9-15**] he went into
afib with RVR and a CODE BLUE was called, he was intubated and
shocked and started on amiodarone. He was extubated successfully
and went home on Amiodarone as well as low dose digoxin.
.
Per the wife, patient visited his podiatrist on friday and a
small pocket of fluid was opened which was thought to be
non-infectious, however, Cipro 750mg daily was started. Wife
also reports decreased UOP over the weekend and +SOB on friday
so Lasix was increased from 40mg to 60mg with no increase in UOP
noted.
.
In the ED, initial VS: Temp 96.5, HR 117 afib, BP 86/53, RR 28,
99% 2L NC. He was given Levoflox 750mg IV x 1, Flagyl 500mg IV x
1, Vanco was ordered but not given. He received 1.5L IVF. EP was
consulted and interrogated his pacer. He was noted to have afib
with RVR on friday, no episodes of Vtach.

Echo:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF<20%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen (reasonable-quality
study). No intracardiac or significant transpulmonary shunting
seen. Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with moderate global
systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Liver US:

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study from obscuration of marked gastric distention.
Incomplete
assessment of the gallbladder.
2. Moderate amount of ascites.
3. Unchanged diffusely echogenic liver, may be from fatty
deposition or
congestive hepatopathy, however more advanced liver disease such
as cirrhosis
or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
4. Abnormal periodicity of the hepatopetal portal venous flow,
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
