Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter, [**2165-4-1**]

History of Present Illness:
48F with hx. of invasive melanoma (7mm breslow depth) diagnosed
on biopsy of left buttock lesion on [**2165-1-25**]. Subsequently she had
wide excision with rotation flap on [**2165-2-7**]. On [**2165-3-22**] she had
left inguinal lymphadenectomy by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 519**]. While inpatient she
was
on prophylactic heparin, venodyne boots, and ambulated, and she
was discharged on [**2165-3-26**].
At home she noticed shortness of breath with climbing stairs,
and
this morning she had worsening shortness of breath. She was seen
at an OSH for this and a CT scan showed bilateral PE's. She was
given a bolus of 5000u heparin and started on heparin drip at
1400u/hr.
Upon presentation to our service, she no longer has shortness of
breath and is saturating in high 90s on room air. Her only
complaint is pleuritic sub-xiphoid pain with deep inspiration.
She denies any pain in her calfs, feet, denies any skin changes
in her lower extremities. Denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diziness, headache, cough, or hemoptysis.


Past Medical History:

Depression
Cholecystectomy
Abdominoplasty
Left gluteal melanoma excision w/ flap rotation


Social History:
no tobacco, occassional alcohol


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the floor and started on a heparin
drip.  As stated in the HPI, she was mostly asymptomatic at the
time of admission, breathing without difficulty and her oxygen
saturations in the mid-to-high 90s on room air.

She also had a lower extremity duplex to rule out DVT which
returned negative.

Her heparin drip was titrated and bridging to coumadin was
started on HD 2.  The heparin drip was therapeutic with a PTT in
the 60s by the end of HD 2 into HD 3.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed sharp
pleuritic pain on deep inspiration starting on HD 4 which
worsened over the course of the evening and into HD 5 with the
addition of concomitant dyspnea.  She continued to have normal
oxygen saturations but her worsening clinical status prompted a
CTA which showed the subsegmental PEs had now become a right
lobar PE.

She was promptly transferred to the surgical intensive care unit
where an echocardiogram was performed to rule out right heart
strain and was negative and a head CT was performed to rule out
metastatic disease in the head/embolic processes; it was
negative.  Her respiratory status worsened and she required
oxygen support of [**1-24**] L nasal cannula to maintain saturations in
the mid 90s.

Vascular surgery and a hem/onc consults were obtained due to
continued worsening of her PE while on anticoagulation, she was
taken to the OR by the vascular surgery team and had an IVC
filter placed.

Post-operatively, she returned to the ICU on a heparin drip
before being switched over to argatroban in the possibility that
she was HIT positive (her platelet count was 327 on admission,
slowly trending downwards to 158 on HD 6 prior to being switched
to argatroban).   The HIT panel returned positive as well as a
serotonin release assay.

The argatroban gtt continued to be titrated post-operatively.
She spiked a fever on HD 7/POD 1 and was pan-cultured and had
another low grade temperature the following day.  All cultures
returned negative.  CXR showed gradual improvement in terms of
aeration and her symptoms improved where she was ambulating,
tolerating regular diet, no longer dyspneic and she no longer
required oxygen, once again with oxygen saturations in the high
90s on room air.

She was transferred back to the floor on HD 8 where the
argatroban drip was continued.  Starting on HD 9 a bridge to
coumadin was resumed.  She was therapeutic on HD 16 with an INR
of 4.1 on the argatroban drip.  The argatroban drip was
discontinuation with discussion with the Hem/Onc service on HD
17, day of discharge, when patient's INR was 4.7.  In total, the
patient received the following dosing of coumadin (with
associated INRs in brackets) while on argatroban:
7
.
5
(
2.4)-->5(2.9)-->5(2.9)-->7.5(3.4)-->10(3.9)-->10(4.2)-->10(4.7).


Of note, from a cardiovascular perspective, the patient was
tachycardic on admission.  This was initially attributed to the
pulmonary embolisms and was not treated.  She continued to be
tachycardic at the tail end of her hospitalization, after her
pulmonary symptoms had resolved and she was therapeutic on her
anticoagulation regimen.  She was started on low dose (12.5 mg
[**Hospital1 **]) metoprolol on HD 15.  On day of discharge, she was no
longer tachycardic with HR in the 90s and BP in her baseline
systolic 100s-110s.  She was monitored on telemetry throughout.

Of note, the patient noted persistent heavy menstrual bleeding
on [**2165-4-6**] which she reported had started the day of her
original surgery on [**2165-3-22**].  This persisted over the weekend and
a Ob/Gyn consult was obtained.  They recommended ruling out
acute sources of bleeding with a pelvic, transvaginal ultrasound
which should only fibroids in the uterus with the rest of the
study normal.  A TSH, HCG and prolactin level were checked and
normal.  After conversation with the Ob/Gyn service, she opted
to not undergo further treatment or diagnostic workup at this
time and has been scheduled to follow up with the Ob/Gyn service
in [**Month (only) 116**].

Heme: Her hematocrit was monitored throughout her
hospitalization and was stable in the 30-35 range.  The last
five days of her hospitalization were as follows
35.5->31.0->31.0->28.7->28.0.   She was asymptomatic and
reported decreased menstrual bleeding at this time.  Her heart
rate and blood pressure were unchanged from prior baselines
(systolic BP as noted above in 100s-110s range, consistent with
rest of hospitalization).  She exhibited no signs of bleeding
otherwise.  She was instructed to follow-up her Hct in addition
to her INR with her PCP appointment on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**], [**2165-4-15**].

Other aspects of her hospitalization were unremarkable.  Her
pain was well controlled on oral pain medication, she tolerated
a regular diet without difficulty, she voided normally and
without need of a foley catheter and she ambulated frequently
throughout her hospitalization with the exception of her short
stay in the ICU.
