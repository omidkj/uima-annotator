History of Present Illness:
70 yo F DM2, CAD s/p MI [**2117-8-6**] managed medically, newly dx CHF
EF EF 40%, pacemaker in '[**15**], OSA on CPAP, presented for elective
cath, developed acute CHF, intubated and transerred to CCU.
    Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**], On [**2117-8-6**] after
sudden onset of severe chest pressure and SOB. Found to have
NSTEMI with CPK of 323 and troponin of 2.19. Decision was made
to pursue a course of medical therapy. Pt presented to [**Hospital1 **] in
acute CHF, with newly dx CHF EF 40% on Echo, infarct to the apex
and inferior wall demonstrated on persantine stress test. Pt was
discharged on medical regimen. A couple of weeks later, the pt
developed increased general weakness and DOE, became acutely SOB
while on the way to her clinic appointment with her
cardiologist. At this point, the plan for medical therapy was
reevaluated and the patient was referred for cardiac cath.
    During the cardiac cath procedure, the pt became SOB and
hypotensive. The BP went from 110's/30's to 70's/30's. HR
remained 90-110. A swan was placed. Sats dropped from 90% to
77%, the pt was in apparent progressive respiratory distress.
She vomited, question of aspiration. She was intubated in the
recovery room, given several doses of IV lasix, started on
dopamine, and admitted to CCU.
Of note, the pt was pretreated for dye allergy with solumedrol,
benadryl, pepcid.
   She was initially hypoxemic, 7.28/41/56, PEEP was at 10 FIO2
100.
PEEP up to 18, PO2 to 456, titrated PEEP down to 10,m FIO2 to
0.4 over the next 8 hours.
.
Initial hemodynamics on 10 dopa at 1200:
BP 118/40  PA 45/30  PCWP 30  CVP 18  CO/CI 5.3/2.05  SVR 800
BP 77/52   PA 38/23  PCWP NR  CVP 16  CO/CI 8.0/3.09  SVR 410
at midnight.
Dopa was titrated up from 6 to 12, BP increased. Pressors
changed to levo since SVR low.

[**9-21**] Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA was
patent without significant stenoses. The LAD showed no
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting stenoses. The LCX showed no significant
stenoses.
The RCA showed a 100% occlusion in its proximal segment with
evidence of
right to right and left to right collaterals.
 2. Right-sided and left sided hemodynamic studies were deferred
due to
pulmonary edema.
 3. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site was

performed with an Angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Right femoral Angioseal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
70 yo F DM2, CAD s/p MI [**2117-8-6**] managed medically, newly dx CHF
EF 40%, pacemaker in '[**15**], OSA on CPAP, presented for elective
cath, developed acute CHF and hypotension requiring dopamine and
intubation x 1 day, now resolved. Pt is currently stable for d/c
to rehab, pending stable BP this morning.

1. CAD: Pt initially presented for elective catheterization
given medicallly managed CAD and new onset SOB. The pt's cardiac
catheterization revealed 100 % occluded RCA and no limitations
of LCX or LAD. No intervention was performed. The pt was
continued on home ASA and statin throughout hospitalization. BB
and ACE were held given pt's hypotension.

2. Acute CHF: Pt developed acute dyspnea and frothing at thge
mouth during cardiac catheterization. This was felt to be likely
secondary to volume overload from prer-hydration. Pt was kept on
lasix 40 mg qd. Echo demonstrated severely depressed LV function
at 25-30 % with inferior and inferio-lateral walls appearing
hypokinetic. The patient was intubated and provided with
wentilatory support until volume overload/hypoxemia was
controlled.

3. Hypotension. The pt was found to be hypotension following
cath. The pt was febrile on admission to CCU. She had had an
elevated wbc since admission. Given this, the pt's hypotension
was felt to have both the cardiogenic component as above as well
as a septic component. The pt was on levophed while in the CCU
and was weaned off. The pt was treated with levofloxacin and is
to complete a ten day course on d/c.

4. ARF: The patient had a cr as high as 1.8. This was felt to be
likely prerenal from hypotension. The creatinine has resolved
for d/c.
.
5. DM2: The pt was controlled on an ISS or drip throughout her
admission. She was placed on her home NPH for the final two days
of her admit.
.
8. hypothyroid: Pt was on home levoxyl throughout admit.
.
9. F/E/N: Pt's lytes repleted throughout admit. She is to be
d/c'd on cardiac healthy diet.

10. Proph: hepain subq and protonix throughout admit

11. Dispo: Pt to be d/c'd to [**Hospital **] rehab today.
