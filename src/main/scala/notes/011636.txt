History of Present Illness:
63yoM with h/o metastatic non-small cell lung cancer s/p
chemotherapy, radiation referred to ED by primary oncologist
([**Doctor Last Name **]) due to evidence of spinal cord metastases on OSH MRI. Pt
has had progressive R-sided back and hip pain x2-3 weeks which
wraps around his waist and radiates to R thigh.  Describes pain
as a combination of deep pain that he can't reach with
accompanying numbness as well that comes and goes. It is usually
worse in the morning, and the patient states that at times the
pain is so severe that he can't even stand up to poor a cup of
coffee.  Improves with PO morphine--some days he takes as many
as 45 mg and other days nothing. Has also noticed R thigh
numbness. Denies LE weakness. Denies loss of bowel/bladder
continence but does note "weaker" urine stream.
.
Saw his oncologist for follow up on Tuesday, had MRI (through
OSH) on Wednesday with report sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
called pt at home today due to MRI findings of metastatic
disease to the spine and cord compression, referred to ED for
neurosurg/rad onc eval.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.9 P 95 BP 105/68 RR 18 O2 sat:
95%.
Pt seen by ortho spine who saw no need for urgent intervention.
Pt was given 10 mg IV dexamethosone. On transfer, VS were T 98.3
BP 116/78  RR 20 P 89
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's vital signs were  T 98.1 HR 79
127/75 P 86 95% RA.  Pt reports mild pain and numbness over his
back and right thigh.  Is otherwise comfortable and well.
Endorses cough which has been longstanding and reports that it
is worse when he lays flat.  Otherwise, denies SOB, chest pain,
weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness.  States that
other than this pain limiting him, he would otherwise be
extremely active.

CT T spine/ L spine (PRELIM)
Preop planning study. Outside L-spine MR is more informative
regarding status of spinal cord and nerve roots. However, this
study was not done with contrast, and L-spine MR with contrast
at [**Hospital1 18**] is indicated.
SPINE:
New since [**11/2148**]: 2.9 cm AP x 2.8 cm TV x 2.6 cm SI L3
lytic/soft tissue
metastasis with cotrtical breakthrough into inferior endplate
and spinal
canal. Compression of R ventral/lateral thecal sac (traversing
L4 ventral
nerve root) with complete obliteration of R subarticular recess
and neural
foramen (exiting L3 nerve root).Diffuse disc bulges, lig flavum
thickening, and facet hypertrophy throughout L-spine with
mod-severe canal stenoses.
T10 bone island.
CHEST:
Moderate emphysema and LUL soft tissue mass, at least 8.6 cm AP
x 5 cm TV x 7cm SI, with spiculations, dystrophic
calcifications, and broad based pleural tag. This encases and
compresses LUL bronchovascular structures.
LLL varicoid bronchiectasis suggests recurrent aspiration or
inflammation.
ABDOMEN:
Mildly fatty liver.
7-mm R renal interpolar nonobstructing stone.
Atherosclerosis with 2.1- cm infrarenal ectasia.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
63 year old man w/ known metastatic stage 4 non-small cell lung
cancer w/ known new L3 mass w/ cord compression.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# L3 Cord compression:  Patient presented with progressive back
and hip pain. He was referred to the hospital after OSH MRI was
found to be concerning for spinal cord compression.  Sensory
exam findings and pain were consistent with L3 lesion but there
was minimal evidence of neurological compromise on exam. As
above he received dexamethasone 10 mg IV in ED. He was evaluated
by orthospine who did not feel there was a need for emergent
surgical intervention at this time especially given the
patient's preference to avoid surgical intervention.  He was
evaluated by rad onc and underwent  planning for outpatient
radiation therapy which will begin on Monday [**2149-4-21**].  The
patient was transitioned to oral dexamethasone 4mg tablet by
mouth every 8hrs. He will follow-up with his primary oncologist.
 The patient was given instructions to return to the ED should
symptoms worsen.

STABLE ISSUES
# Stage IV Small cell lung cancer: Last imaging in [**11-28**]
demonstrated progressive intra-thoracic disease and increased in
nodal burden.  The pt declined treatment at that time and did
not wish to undergo repeat imaging.  He will follow up with his
oncology team regarding further treatment.

# Pain control: Patient's pain was initially managed with NSAIDs
and IV morphine prn. Prior to discharge he was transitioned to
his home oral regimen with the addition of MS contin 15 mg [**Hospital1 **].

# Anxiety/sleep: Patient was continued on his home ativan PRN.

# COPD: Patient is not taking albuterol or flovent at home. He
as started on  duonebs prn.

# Goals of care: Patient was clear that he does not want
aggressive treatments.  Says he values his quality of life more
than anything else and would prefer radiation if it enabled him
to continue using his legs. He enjoys driving his car and
hunting and maintaining these activities is of high priority for
the remainder of his life.
