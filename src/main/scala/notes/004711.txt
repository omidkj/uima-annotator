Per discussion with the daughter patient had been in normally
state of health until today.  The patient had awoken at 3am with
a HA, dizziness, and fatigue.  She then called her daughter at

daughter then went to her mother's house.  She noted her to be
"acting differently".  In the afternoon she was noted to have
episodes of shaking, eyes were glazed over, and she would groan.
 She did not eat anything throughout the day so they brought her
to the ED for fluids. At the outside hospital they noted her to
be bradycardic.  External pacer placed and she was transferred

.
CXR [**10-17**]: Right lung opacity of unclear etiology. Comparison
with prior films is recommended if they can be made available,
as a similar opacity was reported in [**2170-8-21**],but those images
are not available on pacs. Accordingly the opacity may be
chronic, and it would be important to either show long-term
stability, establish the etiology, perhaps by CT, or follow-up
to ensure resolution after treatment.
.
CXR [**10-19**]:
A left-sided pacemaker is present, the tip overlying on right
ventricle. The aorta is tortuous. No CHF, focal infiltrate or
effusion is identified. There is relatively speculated opacity
in the right infrahilar region. Further evaluation by CT scan is
recommended to exclude an underlying pulmonary nodule. The lungs
are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ HTN p/w complete heart block.  S/p VDD pacemaker
placement.

# Cardiac
Rhythm:  Patient presented to outside hospital in complete heart
block with rate of 20's, BP stable.  She was transported
directly to the CCU and a temporary pacing wire was placed.  She
tolerated this procedure well without complications.  Her heart
rate was paced in the 80s.  Her BP was stable.  TSH was wnl.
Lyme serologies were negative.  She went for permanent pacemaker
on [**2171-10-18**]. HR was in the 50s-90s. Post-procedure CXR
demonstrated proper lead placement. She was restarted on her
B-blocker and HCTZ.  He was given Keflex 500 TID x 5 days for
prophylaxis. She should f/u in the Device clinic in one week.
She was given the number of the cardiology clinic and asked to
follow up there within 4 weeks.
.
# HTN- Her BP meds were initially held.  After her permanent
pacemaker was placed, she was put back on B-blocker and
thiazide.  BP was controlled.
.
# Pulmonary opacity - CXR incidentally noted an infrahilar,
nodular opacity.  After discussing this finding with the patient
and her daugher, I learned that this has been known since for at
least several months by both the patient and her primary care
physician.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] was informed that the patient does not want work
up for this nodular opacity due to the fact that she would
decline treatment anyway.  CT scan was recommended to the
patient as an outpatient to further evaluate this opacity.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Her creatinine was baseline on
admission.  Her medications were renally dosed.
.
# FEN- cardiac diet
.
# PPx- Heparin sc, bowel regimen
.
#Code: Patient was full code during this admission
