Physical Exam:
PE: Tm 98.3 rectal; ; 132/74 HR  80; 100  on BIPAP  (16/6cm)
Gen: morbidly obese AAM lying flat in no distress, answers
questions a
HEENT: mmm
CV: distant heart sounds; rrr
Lungs: cta anteriorly
Abd: obese; + BS , no tenderness to palpation
Ext: massive LE edema with venous stasis changes and scaling
over R shin
Neuro: slow speech; answers simple questions; follows commands;
non focal exam


Pertinent Results:
CxR : Due to patient habitus, study severely limited in
evaluating for pneumonia.  Right basilar opacity appears likely
to represent the right heart border.  Failure to visualize the
left diaphragm is likely related to patient habitus and film
exposure.
.
[**6-3**] CXR: The PICC line overlies proximal SVC probably impinging
on its lateral wall with a recoil at its tip the tracheostomy
tube is 5 cm above the carina. Cardiomegaly and bilateral
pulmonary opacities unchanged since prior film of [**2185-6-2**].
No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The inferior wall and
the basal portion of the LV are visualized; no wall motion
abnormality is seen. The distal half of the LV is not well seen.

3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-5-3**],
there has been no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 39 yo M w/ Prader Willi, diabetes, and CRI who
presented with questionable episode of hypoxia and AMS at his
rehab facility. ABG c severe hypercarbia.

Resp distress: The patient was brought to the ICU for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  It is unclear if there was a
precipitating event.  He was given doses of morphine for
abdominal pain that may have tipped him over; but per family
reports he has been having a downward course over the last few
months.  He was intubated on the evening of admission for
respiratory failure w/ evidence of respiratory acidosis.  He was
aggressively diuresed in the hopes that this would help to wean
him off the vent.  He continued to have good RSBI's and pass
breathing trials but ABG's continued to show PCO2's in the 60's.
 It was decided to proceed with a trach and thoracics was
consulted. Tracheostomy was completed without complications, and
he was maintained on PS 20/10 w/ Fi02 40% w/ intermittent PS
[**1-8**]. On discharge, pt was undergoing sprints of decreased
pressure support.  He would use PS 12 c PEEP 10 for upto 5 hours
at a time.  He should gradually be given less PS as his
respiratory muscular function improves.

Elevated LFTs - The patient complained of abdominal pain (per
family) a few days prior to admission.  On admission, his
abdomen was non-tender and had a benign exam.  Based on his
elevated LFT's, he likely passed a stone.  His enzymes trended
down to normal during his first week of admission.  RUQ u/s
showed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis or biliary ductal
dilatation.  He was originally started on vanc/unasyn for
?cholangitis but this was d/c'ed on [**5-21**].  The patient remained
afebrile during the course of the admission until [**5-30**].  His
fevers at that time was attributed to VAP, and this will be
discussed in more detail below.  His LFTs returned to [**Location 213**]
before discharge.

Fevers - Pt had temperature elevation to 102 during his hospital
course. Sputum from [**5-30**] grew MRSA, and he has had a hx of MRSA
bacteremia. Blood cx from same date w/ coag - staph from A line;
surveillance cultures NTGD.  He was treated with ceftazidime and
vancomycin for presumptive VAP and will plan to treat for 12
days (to end [**6-10**]). He remained afebrile after starting
antibiotic therapy, and his WBC trended toward normal.

Acute on chronic renal failure - resolving quickly after
hydration.

Anemia: Unclear etiology of anemia; Chronic kidney disease
seemed unlikely given normal creatinine and EPO stopped here.
Should follow up with his PCP to address his anemia.

Insulin Dependent Diabetes: The patient was treated with lantus
and an ISS which was adjusted as needed.  He should have his
lantus dose adjusted over the next several days depending on his
sliding scale need.

Hypothyroidism: The patient had a TSH 33 and his levothyroxine
was increased from 75 to 100mcg.  Repeat TSH level later in the
hospital course was 14 which suggested a response to the change
in dosing.  Will need continued follow-up as an outpatient.

During tracheotomy, surgeons, noted to have black, nodular
thyroid.  Endocrine was consulted who advised that this was
nonspecific finding - he should have a follow up with
endocrinology to better understand this finding and to manage
his thyroxine dose.

FEN: The patient was started on TF's after intubation.  There
was discussion of placing a PEG at the time of trach placement
but surgery felt that they would have to do an open PEG with was
more extensive and had an increased morbitidy associated
