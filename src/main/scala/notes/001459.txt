Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with Afib on coumadin, CHF (EF 55-60 [**2192**]), CVA, CAD (MI
[**2182**]), HTN and asthma initially admitted to medical floors with
mental status changes and dyspnea.  became somnolent on [**8-5**],
found to have respiratory acidosis, presumed CO2 narcosis,
transferred to CCU for bipap on [**8-6**].
.
Patient with known diastolic CHF and history of CAD/MI is
presenting with dyspnea, a 30lb weight gain, satting 97% on RA.
CXR and physical exam shows mild pulmonary edema suggestive of
fluid overload, likely due to CHF exacerbation. Ruled out for
ACS with 2 sets of trops. ECG unchanged from baseline. Patient
does not appear to be infected- no productive cough or signs of
consolidation on exam, CXR did not show evidence of
consolidation.  Pt was aggressively diuresed, developed
contraction alkalosis and on [**8-5**] became somnolent.  Abg at this
time revealed hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Echo was
performed which showed aortic stenosis, mild MR, 3+ TR, and
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  She was transferred to the CCU
on [**8-6**]  for Bipap and after 3 hrs self d/ced bipap mask,
somnolence resolved.  O2 sats were normal on RA.  However, pt
became increasingly agitated overnight and by morning of [**8-7**] O2
saturations dipped into 80s and SBP went into 190s.  Concern for
flash pulmonary edema, but CXR looked unchanged from baselines.
Blood pressures improved on nitro gtt, and bipap was restarted.
Pt's O2 saturations initially improved on BIPAP but after
several hours she became hypoxic again.  Pt was being prepared
for intubation, pt's next of [**Doctor First Name **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] the decision was
made to make pt [**Name (NI) 835**].  She continued to deteriorate and next of
[**Doctor First Name **] made decision to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].  She was given ativan and IV
morphine and expired at 16:02 on [**2195-8-7**].
