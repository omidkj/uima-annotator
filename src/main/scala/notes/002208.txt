History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17766**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with past medical history
significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and
BPH.
The patient noticed "bloody diarrhea" and "spurting" BRBPR which
started yesturday. Patient presented to the OSH and was noted to
have HCT 21. Unclear baseline HCT given limited records at this
time. Patient also complaining of extreme weakness x 1 week. He
denies any associated abdominal pains, nausea, emesis or fevers.
Recent poor appetite and 20 lb. weight loss x 2 months also
reported. At OSH he o had presumed acute renal failure with Cr
in 2.6 range, and elevated potassium to 6.3. He was given
combination of low dose IV Insulin, Ca gluconate, bicarbonate
and IV dextrose for this hyperkalemia at OSH and repeat labs
here at [**Hospital1 18**] ED showed potassium down to 5.1. EKG at OSH
showing atrial fibrillation with rate 90s and ST depressions in
V5-V6.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 17766**] has history of known atrial fibrillation and states
he was taking Coumadin in the past but in recent months he has
been taking 325mg daily aspirin instead. He explains that this
change to ASA was due to hematuria from "benign bladder lesions"
a few months ago. He has also been taking [**3-11**] 400mg ibuprofen
tablets daily for pain over his right heel from a deep skin
ulcer. He denies ever having any prior GI bleeds in the past. No
prior colonoscopies per patient. Denies any prior MIs or PEs.
.
Per reports from OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] ED he has not had any dizziness
or significant hypotension despite his atrial fibrillation and
acute anemia from GI losses.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: T 96.4F, RR 18-20, O2
Saturation 96% NRB 10L, BP 127/60. CXR showed mild fluid over
bases ( R>L). Labs in ED notable for a HCT of 24.4, Cr 2.4
(assumed ARF but unknown baseline). Troponin elevated to .64 and
CK 504, CK MB 65. Patient denies any chest pains, shortness of
breath or palpitations.
In ED he was given 2L NS IVFs and 1 Unit PRBC (also got 1 Unit
PRBCs en route from [**Hospital3 **]). NG lavage was negative in ED and
rectal exam grossly guaiac positive. GI saw patient in ED and
advised IV PPI, PRBCs and IVFs with plan for colonoscopy in [**12-8**]
days as long as patient remains stable.
.
On arrival to ICU, patient appeared pallid and weak but was in
no acute distress. Fully alert and oriented but history of
specific medication doses challenging. He continued to deny CP,
SOB, dizziness or abdominal pain but did endorse feeling
extremely fatigued

[**2188-3-14**]: PORTABLE TTE:
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Increased PCWP.
[**2188-3-14**] EKG:
Probable sinus rhythm with frequent atrial ectopy. The Q-T
interval is
prolonged. Low voltage in the limb leads. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
Compared to the previous tracing Q-T interval prolongation and
ST-T wave
changes are new.
[**2188-3-14**] CHEST X-RAY:
IMPRESSION: Suggestion of a moderately large right pleural
effusion,
including a subpulmonic effusion. A right lateral decubitus view
may be
helpful in further characterization.
[**2188-3-14**] RENAL U.S.:
IMPRESSION:
1. Unremarkable renal ultrasound with no evidence of
hydronephrosis.
2. Right-sided pleural effusion.
[**2188-3-17**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation. Low limb lead QRS voltage is non-specific.
Diffuse
ST-T wave abnormalities are no-specific but cannot exclude
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing of the same date no significant change.
[**2188-3-17**]  MESENTERIC ARTERIOGRAM :
IMPRESSION: Selective arteriogram of the inferior mesenteric
artery demonstrating active extravasation of contrast material
from a distal branch within the
