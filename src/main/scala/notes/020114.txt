Admission Date:  [**2105-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-1-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2063-4-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 42-year-old white
male who was struck by a car with significant front end
damage.  He was reported to have been thrown approximately 20
feet and was found face down at the scene.  It was unknown
whether the patient had loss of consciousness, but he states
he does not remember the accident.  He was hemodynamically
stable in the field and transported to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Closure of a left flank wound and
left femur fracture repair.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 96.5 F.
He was hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 66 and a
blood pressure of 130/palp.  Respirations 20.  Saturating at
98% on room air.  He was alert in no acute distress with a
GCS of 15.  He had a stellate laceration on his scalp.
Trachea is midline.  Lungs were clear with equal breath
sounds bilaterally.  Heart was regular.  Abdomen was
distended with moderate diffuse tenderness, no guarding.
Rectal was heme positive with normal tone.  Extremities
showed bilateral lower extremity tib fib deformities with
road rash on the right hip and thigh.  He had palpable pulses
distally bilaterally.  His pelvis was nontender and stable.
The back showed no deformities.  The neck did have midline
tenderness.  Neuro exam:  He was alert.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  He had [**5-17**] motor strength of the bilateral upper and
lower extremities.  Although he was complaining of tingling
of both hands, there was no objective sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a hematocrit
of 37.8.  N normal chemistries and normal coags.  Negative
tox screen.

Chest x-ray and pelvis films were without abnormality.

CT Scan of the head showed intracranial bleed, shift or mass
effect.

CT Scan of the C spine showed several significant fractures.
There was an lateral occipital subluxation of approximately 3
to 4 mm.  There is a hangman's site fracture of
C2 and C3.  There was massive fracture distraction injury at
C6 and C7 with approximately 30 degree rotation of C6 on C7.

CT Scan of the chest showed bilateral apical contusions and
bilateral rib fractures.

CT Scan of the abdomen showed fluid in the left pericolic
gutter as well as mesenteric stranding and a small amount of
pelvis fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken from the Trauma
Resuscitation Bay to the Operating Room where he underwent an
exploratory laparotomy which revealed mesenteric hematoma and
omental bleeding.  This is repaired and he is taken to the
Surgical ICU for further resuscitation.  Of note, the patient
was performed on a hard backboard, although just prior to
initiation of anesthesia, the demonstrated weakness in his
lower extremities bilaterally.

Once he reached the Trauma ICU, resuscitation continued.  He
went to the Operating Room on [**12-23**] the day following his
admission for repair of his bilateral tib fib fractures and a
right lateral compartment fasciotomy for elevated compartment
pressures.  He also underwent on [**12-23**] an anterior discectomy
and partial corpectomy at C6-C7 with fusion and
instrumentation.  He returned to the Operating room on [**12-25**]
for posterior C6-C7 laminectomy with grafting. Of note, on
[**12-23**] he also had placement of a halo for immobilization of
his C2 hangman's fracture.

The rest of the hospital course will be described by system.

1.  NEURO:  The patient underwent early stabilization both
anteriorly and posteriorly of his cervical spine fractures.
As noted, he had a halo placed for his C2 fracture.  The halo
should remain for a two month time period.  His initial CT
Scan of his head showed no intraparenchymal or intracranial
process.  Four vessel carotid and vertebral angiogram on
[**12-22**] showed no abnormality.  His current neurovascular
status has been stable since after his initial exploratory
laparotomy for bleeding.  He has flexor strength of his upper
extremities, but no movement of his lower extremities
bilaterally.  The extensor strength in the upper extremities
has improved somewhat since his initial operation.

Of note, he also had a question of L4 fracture on his initial
CT Scan of his spine.  This was felt to be degenerative.  He
also has spinous processes fractures of T6 and 7 which were
not felt to be significant.  [**Known firstname **] has received sedation on
an as needed basis with Morphine and Ativan, however he is
alert, able to answer questions and express his needs without
difficulty at this time.  He was maintained on Solu-Medrol
intermittent intravenous dosing for the first three days of
his hospital stay.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has no history of cardiac disease.
Had no evidence of cardiovascular injury with his trauma and
has had no active issues with his heart throughout his ICU
stay.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  Has been ventilator dependent since his
arrival.  He was initially intubated with an oral tracheal
tube.  This is changed over to a percutaneous tracheostomy on
[**2106-1-7**] with an #8 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex trach.  This was done at the
bedside without complications.  He also has developed a right
lower lobe pneumonia which has cleared on recent x-rays.
Sputum cultures were significant only for Methicillin
sensitive staphylococcus aureus, however there is a high
suspicion of gram negative co-infection and he has been on
appropriate antibiotic coverage.  This will be described in
the section of ID.

He has required significant respiratory support thought to be
secondary to not having an intercostal contribution to
inspiratory phase.  We have been able to wean his pressure
support and his PEEP over the last few days.  His current
ventilator settings are pressure support ventilation of 10
with a PEEP of 13, 50% fio2.  His tidal volumes are
approximately 650 by a rate of 18.  We will continue to wean
the PEEP over the next couple of days in anticipation of his
transfer to [**Last Name (un) 40599**].

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  After undergoing the initial
exploratory laparotomy for mesenteric bleeding, we had
maintained [**Known firstname **] initially on TPN and then on tube feeds.  He
has not tolerated gastric tube feeds and has had a
postpyloric placed and replaced a couple of times.  He
tolerate postpyloric tube feeds without difficulty.  Current
formula is Peptamen with a goal of 110 cc per hour.

For a bowel regimen related to his spinal cord injury, he is
on Reglan 10 mg IV q. six and Dulcolax 10 p.r. q.d. with good
effect.  When these medications are stopped, he does have
trouble with gastric and intestinal ability.

4.  GENITOURINARY: [**Known firstname **] was initially maintained with a
Foley which has been changed over to q. six to eight straight
catheter.  He has had no evidence of urinary tract infection
throughout his hospital stay and has not had any spontaneous
voiding since the Foley was removed.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  After his initial resuscitation, [**Known firstname **]
hematocrit has been in the upper 20 range without need for
transfusion in the last several weeks.  For DVT prophylaxis,
he was initially maintained on pneumatic boots, however a
temporary IVC filter was placed on [**12-28**] and then removed on
[**1-8**].  He was initially not thought to be a candidate for
subcutaneous heparin or Lovenox due to the question of an
epidural hematoma along his cervical spinal cord, however in
consultation with the Ortho Spine Service, he was started on
subcutaneous heparin the week of [**1-4**] and then changed over
to Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous q. 12 hours on [**1-8**].  He has
had bilateral lower extremity duplex studies on [**11-12**]
and [**1-5**] and they were all negative for deep venous
thrombosis.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Through his hospital course, [**Known firstname **]
has had sputum cultures that grew Methicillin sensitive
staphylococcus aureus most recently on [**1-5**].  He has h
