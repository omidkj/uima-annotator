Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77 y/o female transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Last Name (un) 5869**] [**2118-3-31**] with suspected
urosepsis. The patient was originally admitted to an OSH where,
per medical records, her husabnd had brought her for confusion x
2 days.  There was also a report of dysuria. At the OSH her
glucose was noted to be 521 and she was given 10U Insulin, she
had WBC of 24 w/ 24% bands and grossly positive UA w/>100 WBC's.
 She was intially treated with Levaquin and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt was noted to have Lactate 5.4, fever to
103, and significant tachycardia; she was placed on the sepsis
protocol. R IJ was placed, agressive rehydration with 4L of IVFs
was initiated and the patient was transferred to the MICU.

Overnight, patient's blood pressure remained stable. She was
afebrile. Blood sugar was controlled with insulin drip and she
was gradually weaned off insulin drip.

I/O 924/380 CVP16, off insulin gtt FS 162
PE:GEN: Pt resting comfortably in NAD
HEENT: nonicteric, mucosa dry, no JVD appreciated
CHEST: CTA bilaterally, occasional wheeze
CV: rrr, no r/m/g
ABD: obese, soft, NT, ND
EXT: 1+ LE edema bilaterally, in pneumoboots
Neuro: mild facial droop, A+O x3; otherwise grossly nonfocal,

Pertinent Results:
echo [**3-31**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The
branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion

CTA [**2117-4-2**]:
no pulmonary embolism , LLL pneumonia versus atelectasis with
associated pleural effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
Thi is 77 y/o female who presents from OSH with urosepsis now
resolving. She initially had bandemia, temperature, high lactate
and positive urinalysis which supports urosepsis. DUring
hospitalization, she remained afebrile with resolved bandemia
and lactate. She was initially covered with ceftriaxone and was
later switched to levofloxacin in preparation for discharge. Her
urine culture was negative x2. Her blood culture + CNS likely
contmainant, surveillance culture negative so far.

She was initially very hyperglycemic in the setting of
infection. She was on insulin drip for a brief moment in the ICU
and that was quickly weaned off. She remained on her home
insulin regimen and her blood glucose in hospital had been
fairly well controleed. She was also restarted on her home dose
of metformin.

Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on [**3-31**] shows EF of >55%,
suspicious of diastolic failure given dilated LA and pulmonary
artery. SHe recieved alomost 5L of fluid for her resuscitation
and was found to have crackles on exam. She was also
persistently hypoxic and tachypnea, likely due to fluid
overload. CTA was done that ruled out pulmonary embolism.
Heparin sc was discontinued because there was a question of HIT.
She was put on pneumoboots instead. She was also started on home
dose of lasix and hydrochlorothiazide.

Of note, she also presented high CK's in the setting of very low
phosphate on admission. This might be related to the electrolyte
abnormality. Her MBI was normal and her EKG was unchanged. Her
CK peaked at 2410 and then resolved spontanously.
