60 year old male complaining of lightheadedness and weakness.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**] is a 60 yo M with history of HTN, DM II, aortic valve
endocarditis s/p replacement with a mechanical valve and atrial
fibrillation who presented to the ED because of lightheadedness
and low BP (at home) for 4 days. Patient reports that he was in
his usual state of health until last Thursday when he noticed he
was becoming lightheaded upon standing and he was getting short
of breath with minimal acitvity and sometimes at rest, and his
physical therapist took his blood pressure and it was ~90/50. He
called his cardiologist who told him to stop his lasix which he
did. He had persistent symptoms throughout the weekend. He
reports having ~3 black, loose stools/day for one week but he
attributes this to eating more fruit.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.4, HR 70, BP 118/53, RR 17,
100% O2 sat. Patient was found to have a Hct of 19.4, be guaiac
(+) brown stools and an NG lavage showed coffee grounds that
cleared after 500 mL. He was given 1L NS, IV pantoprazole 80 mg
x2 and transfused 1 unit PRBC's. He was seen by GI in the ED.
.
On the floor, the patient states he is feeling better but
persistently weak.

Imaging:
RUQ US [**2171-9-16**]:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.

2. Splenomegaly.

Studies:
EGD:
Findings:
Esophagus:  Mucosa: Area of linear erythema without bleeding
noted at GE junction potentially related to NG tube trauma. of
the mucosa was noted throughout the esophagus.
Protruding Lesions 1 cords of grade I varices were seen in the
lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. The
varices were not bleeding.
Stomach:  Protruding Lesions What appeared to be large gastric
varices were seen in the cardia without stigmata of recent
bleeding.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Gastric varices
Area of linear erythema without bleeding noted at GE junction
potentially related to NG tube trauma. in the esophagus
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal
junction
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Given computer difficulty images not retained.
Area of erythema at GE junction likely from NG trauma though
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] active bleeding.What appeared to be a grade 1 varix
distal esophagus without cherry red spot. What appeared to be
gastric varices at the fundus without active bleeding. No hx of
cirrhosis or portal hypertension in the past. Recommend imaging
of abdomen, assessment of portal and splenic vasculature. LFTS,
albumin. Heparin gtt. If active bleeding, liver team for
potential injection of varices.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute blood loss: Presented with symptomatic acute blood loss
and signs/history consistent with upper GI etiology. EGD
demonstrated gastric varices (not actively bleeding) and grade 1
esophageal varices. Hct on admission was 19.7 from 30 @ baseline
and lactate was 3.3. Lactate normalized to 1.1 after 3 units of
pRBCs, but Hct showed an incomplete response to 24.5, prompting
an additional unit, after which Hct remained stable for the
duration, at ~27 on call-out from ICU, which then increased to
30 upon discharge.
- Though not actively bleeding at time of EGD source felt to be
gastric varices but to rule out lower etiology patient was
recommended to follow-up with pcp for colonoscopy [**Name9 (PRE) 13511**].

# Gastric Varices / Portal HTN work-up / lower GI bleed work-up:
Varices found on EGD prompted an RUQ US, which showed fatty
liver and splenomegaly. Cirrhosis work-up included negative Hep
serologies, GGT, AFP, and Fe studies. Further outpatient work-up
with hepatology will include alpha-1 antitrypsin and US with
doppler. Pt was prescribed low dose nadolol 20 mg to help reduce
splanchnic blood flow and reduce risk of variceal bleed.
- Patient should receive Hepatitis B and A vaccine
- Patient scheduled with liver for follow-up and further work-up

# Mechanical valve: Coumadin was held in the setting of an acute
bleed while pRBCs were transfused until Hct stabilized HD2.  It
was re-initated at dose of 10 mg daily and pt's INR was
monitored up to discharge at 2.1. Pt was counseled that
therapeutic range of INR for him is 2.5 to 3.

# A-Fib / [**Last Name (LF) 9215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 55%: Coumadin was held as described above
until Hct stabilized on HD2 and restarted HD3. Showed signs of
left heart failure with wet adventitial sounds on exam; diuresed
with IV Lasix, titrated to -1L daily and clinically improved.
Remained hemodynamically stable without RVR and without signs of
R heart failure; discharged in hemodynamically stable condition
and normalized volume status. Restarted on home [**Hospital1 **] 80 Lasix PO.
 Discharged on dronedarone and metoprolol per home meds. Will to
continue to follow with cardiology as an outpatient.

# Alcohol abuse: Patient declined intervention offered by social
work. Consoled on risk of alcohol use especially with new
diagnosis of liver disease.
