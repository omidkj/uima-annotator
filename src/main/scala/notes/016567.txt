[**2155-6-27**]
FINDINGS: Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained.
Overall, there
has been little significant interval change. Calcified breast
implants are
again noted projecting over the lower thorax bilaterally. There
is persistent
architectural distortion with fibrosis in the lung apices,
superior traction
of the bilateral hila and extensive calcified mediastinal and
hilar lymph
nodes, without significant interval change from the prior study.
Blunting of
the costophrenic angles and tenting of the hemidiaphragms
bilaterally are
chronic and stable. The lungs are again hyperinflated,
consistent with
chronic pulmonary disease. Apical pleural thickening is again
seen.
Partially imaged right humeral metallic hardware is again noted.


IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year-old female with stage IV sarcoidosis with combined
restrictive/obstructive disease, asthma, dCHF, pulmonary HTN a/w
COPD flare.
.
# COPD Flare, pulmonary sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension: The
patient was admitted to the ICU in respiratory distress
attributed to a COPD flare. She improved with steroids,
nebulizer treatments, and Levofloxacin and was transferred to
the floor where these therapies continued; she was never
intubated. She was discharged on home dose advair and
montelukast unchanged. Sarcoidosis contributed to the
presentation by decreasing pulmonary reserve; pulmonary
hypertension also contributed and sildenafil was continued.
.
# Hypertrophic C.Myopathy, dCHF, HTN: Continued home verapamil
and furosemide 20.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Osteoporosis: Continued Ca/Vit D, alendronate
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# Prednisone taper will be overseen by PCP.
