Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis
Cardiac catheterization, no intervention performed


History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with CAD s/p CABG in [**2125**] ([**2-28**] LIMA-> LAD, SVG ->
RCA/PDA, SVG -> OM1) with subsequent cath in [**2126**] showing patent
grafts, ESRD on HD, COPD, who presents with left-sided chest
pain while walking to dialysis. He describes the pain as strong,
non-radiating pain localized slightly to the left of the sternal
border. This pain was associated with SOB and nausea, but no
vomiting. He denies diaphoresis. The pain was constant and not
alleviated by change in position. He endorses recent
palpitations but not on the AM of admission. He also notes PND
but no orthopnea. He has a history of angina for which he is
prescribed SL nitro approximately 2 times/month. He has had no
change in excercise tolerance - can walk 5 blocks without
feeling short of breath or fatigued. Of note, he had a PMIBI in
[**7-/2128**] with moderate reversible inferior defect.
.
Pt. was sent to the ER from HD without being dialyzed. On
arrival, his HR was in the 50s and in a junctional rhythm on EKG
and his BP 158/50. He was given SL NTG x and ASA with which he
reports transient improvement. He was started on a nitro gtt and
his BP dropped to 85/40. He was given a bolus of 250ccs with no
response. Labs revealed a K of 5.8 and he was given
Insulin/dextrose, bicarb and Kayexelate. He was also given
Glucagon for presumed beta blocker toxicity with improvement of
his HR to the 70s. This was later stopped for unclear reasons.
He had a Troponin of .21 and CK of 54. He was started on a
Heparin gtt and taken to the cath lab where he was found to have
patent grafts, but markedly elevated right-sided heart
pressures: RA of 20, RV of 70/25, PA of 70/25 and PCWP mean of
27. Aortic pressure was 115/38, CO - 4.4 and CI - 2.65. He was
given Atropine .5 mg x 1 and Dopamine during the case, the
latter of which was weaned off by the end of the case with a HR
in the 50s and a stable BP.

.
EKG: junctional rhythm, nl axis, nl QTc, narrow QRS, rate 56
with intermittent PVCs or reentrant beats, peaked T waves in
V1-V3.
.
Echo [**2128-9-14**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2128-8-19**]-Persantine MIBI Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to
obtaining the resting images. This study was interpreted using
the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. Left ventricular
cavity size is mildly enlarged with stress and normal at rest.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a moderate reversible
inferior wall defect. Gated images reveal septal hypokinesis
consistent with a prior CABG. The calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 45%. Compared with the study of [**2127-10-10**]
the inferior wall defect appears more severe and the
inferolateral wall defect less prominent.
.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal myocardial perfusion scan showing a
moderate reversible inferior wall defect, septal hypokinesis
(consistent with a prior CABG) and a LVEF of 45%. There is
transient cavitary dilatation.
