History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 73 year old male with atrial fibrillation, ESRD on
HD, DM type 2, prior CVA, who presents to the ED after falling
in his bathroom at home. His wife reports she heard a thump, and
found the patient on the floor with a large laceration on his
head, awake.
.
He remembers walking to the bathroom and falling over his walker
into the tub. He does not think that he lost consciousness, but
according to his wife he did for about one minute. He remembers
lying in the tub and not being able to move his legs. His wife
called 911.
.
He denies any prodrome before the fall, including
lightheadedness, palpitations, chest pain, SOB.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was noted to have no strength in his lower
bilateral extremities, and poor strength in his upper
extremities. His cranial nerves were intact, and his vitals
remained stable. He had imaging of his neck, which showed an
acute C3 fracture, as well as C4/C5 osteophyte with cord
compression. Neurosurgery was consulted, as well as trauma
surgery. They recommended no surgical treatment at this time,
but decadron and close monitoring. CT chest showed a
non-calcified nodule, and there was a renal mass seen on CT abd.
He was admitted to ICU for monitoring of neuro status, and to
medicine due to multiple co-morbidities.
.
ROS: He recently has been feeling well.

[**2123-10-8**] CT C spine
1. Apparent blockage of the intrathecal contrast especially
ventrally at the C4/5 level due to a large disc osteophyte
complex which appears to be causing severe canal stenosis.
2. At C3/4, there is a disc osteophyte complex which appears to
be causing moderate canal stenosis. At C6/7, there is a disc
osteophyte complex which is causing mild canal stenosis.
3. No high-grade canal stenosis of the thoracic or lumbar spine
although evaluation of the lumbar spine is somewhat limited by
suboptimal filling of the thecal sac by contrast.
4. Again seen is a nondisplaced fracture of the anteroinferior
corner of C3.
5. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
Please refer to CT of the abdomen and pelvis for full
description of other significant findings.

[**2123-10-8**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
1) Non-calcified 4 mm lung nodules require CT follow up within
six to 12 months. Slightly larger area of ground-glass opacity
in the left upper lobe may represent contusion. Follow up is
advised.
2) Bilateral renal hyperdense and hypodense lesions, which may
represent simple and hemorrhagic cysts though evaluation is
incomplete on this noncontrast study. Further evaluation with
multiphasic CT or MRI is recommended. Cystic structure inferior
to left kidney may represent exophytic cyst.
3) Significantly enlarged prostate measuring approximately 5.5
cm.
4) Extensive calcifications of the aorta and its branches.
5) Degenerative changes with large posterior osteophytes of the
spine as described above.
[**2123-10-8**] CT Head
1. Extensive left frontal scalp and left periorbital and
preseptal soft tissue swelling and hematoma. Within the context
of this severely limited scan, there does not appear to be an
intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
[**2123-10-8**] ECG - Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to prior
tracing of [**2123-8-4**] atrial pacing is no longer clearly seen.
[**10-14**] intraoperative c-spine 2 views
Two intraoperative portable radiographs of the cervical spine
are submitted for interpretation. The first radiograph
demonstrates a probe positioned at
