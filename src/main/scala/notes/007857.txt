Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted through same day admission and taken to the OR
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an open gastric bypass with cholecystectomy,
see operative report for details. He tolerated the procedure
well and was extubated in the OR. Due to the length of the
operation, his morbid obesity, and his history of obstructive
sleep apnea, it was decided to keep Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 39722**] in the PACU
overnight. He experienced some elevated heart rate and blood
pressure on POD#0 that was treated with IV lopressor with good
effect.

He otherwise had an uneventful first night and was transferred
to the surgical floor on the morning of POD#1. His NG tube was
removed and he was advanced to a stage I diet. Nutrition and
physical therapy were both consulted.

On POD#2 the Foley catheter was removed. A methylene blue
swallow test was done which was negative. He was advanced to a
stage II diet which he tolerated well. He was ambulatory with
physical therapy.

On POD#3 he was advanced to a stage III diet which he tolerated
well.  By the time of discharge on POD #5 he was ambulating
well, saturating well on room air, and tolerating a stage 3 diet
well.
