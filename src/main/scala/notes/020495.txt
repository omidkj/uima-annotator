Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2115-11-13**], diagnostic paracentesis [**2115-11-20**], EGD [**2115-11-28**]

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o with NASH, on transplant list,  recently discharged for
worsening LE edema.  During his last admission he had two large
volume taps, EGD revealed large (grade II) esophageal varices,
one with a cherry red spot, that were banded.  He also had ARF -
his diuresis was restarted after initially being held (until his
Cr recovered), and he was sent to rehab.  There he apparently
was not receiving his lactulose, and became encephalopathic.  He
then experienced black stools with red clots, and was sent to
[**Hospital3 13313**] where he was apparently scoped without
evidence of ongoing bleeding.  He is being transfered here for
eval by the liver service, including repeat EGD, eval for
[**Last Name (un) 10045**] +/- TIPS.
.
On arrival he was found to be intubated, off sedation,
unresponsive to voice or examination.  He was immediately
prepped for upper endoscopy.  This was performed by the Liver
team, and he was found to have alot of blood in the stomach and
duodenum.  This was suctioned out, but no source of active
bleeding was found.  He is admitted to the ICU for further
management and evaluation.


Past Medical History:
1. Liver cirrhosis secondary to NASH, complicated by multiple
variceal bleeds, ascites, splenomegaly and portal hypertension.
No recent EGD or C-scope on file in OMR. Listed for transplant,
work-up to date with echo in [**8-/2115**] with preserved systolic
function, PFTs also done though records not available.
2. DM type 2, last HbA1c 6.5% on [**2115-9-16**].
3. Hypertension
4. Gout
5. Osteoarthritis
6. Glaucoma and macular degeneration
7. Status post right first digit amputation [**2115-4-29**] for
osteomyelitis and nonhealing ulcer.

the past.

whole stomach, but not obvious source of bleeding.Blood in the
whole duodenum
.
EGD [**2115-11-28**]:
Blood in the lower third of the esophagus.  Blood in the whole
stomach
1.Clotted blood in duodenum with no active bleeding.there was a
feeding tube noticed going into second part of duodenum.It was
coiled in fundus.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
CT ab/pelvic [**2115-11-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of ascites. No evidence of retroperitoneal

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 63 year old with NASH who was transfered from
OSH for UGIB and encephalopathy.  He expired on [**2115-11-29**] in the
setting of massive GI bleeding.  The following is a brief
hospital course by problem.
.
#Chronic Resp failure: The patient was extubated and reintubated
three times for failure to clear secretions and poor cough
reflex.  He was presumed to have a tracheobronchitis with MRSA
in sputum from [**11-16**], [**11-20**], and [**11-21**].  He was maintained on
primarily pressure support and MMV during times of apnea.  He
was treated with a 7 day course of ceftazadime and a 10 day
course of vancomycin starting [**11-16**] for
tracheobronchitis/ventilator associated pneumonia.  The
patient's ABGs revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a PCO2 of
22-23.  His resp alkalosis is likely partially as compensation
for met acidosis and due to primary process. On [**11-23**] the
patient had increasing respiratory distress with hypoxemia, felt
to be c/w mucus plugging on CXR.  His CXR had improved by [**11-24**],
as had his oxygenation.  The pt was satting well on PS of [**5-3**]% Fio2 on [**11-27**], but he had another GIB with suspected
aspiration.  Again, his PO2 dropped to 59 on the same vent
settings, so he was placed back on AC.
.
#UGIB/Anemia: EGD revealed blood in the stomach with no active
bleeding source.  He has evidence of grade II esophagitis and
gastritis.  He had a recurrent bleed on [**11-19**] with 400 cc of
bloody return from his OGT, requiring reintubation.  He received
2 units of PRBC on [**11-19**] after his hct dropped from 44 to 30. He
was maintained on an octreotide gtt for 2 days. His hematocrit
wavered between 30 to 40 thereafter and seemed to be dependent
on fluid shifts.  CT of the abdomen on [**11-22**] revealed no
retroperitoneal bleed. He remained guaiac positive through his
stay though to be due to the initial GI bleed.  On [**11-27**] the pts
hct dropped from 35 to 25 with red clots noted in his stool. He
was transfused 2 units of PRBC, 4 units of FFP, and 1 unit of
plt.  Octreotide gtt was again restarted.  Repeat EGD on [**11-28**]
revealed massive amounts of blood in the stomach.  There was so
much bleeding that a source was not identified.  He was
continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI, sucralfate, and rifaximine 400 tid. His
nadolol was decreased from 40 mg/d to 20 mg/d due to low BP. On
[**11-28**] the pt [**Doctor First Name **] made CMO due to uncontrollable bleeding.
.
# NASH with hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy
resolved with lactulose, rifaximin, and pentoxyfilline.
Diagnostic paracentesis on [**11-20**] revealed no evidence of
infection.  The patient was continued on nadolol 20 mg/d.  As
per below, he developed hepatorenal syndrome and was maintained
on daily midodrine/octreotide and albumin.
.
#ARF/Hepatorenal syndrome: The pts Cr on admission was 1.8.
This slowly improved to 1.1, but on [**11-20**] it slowly began to
rise, and was up to 1.7 on [**11-25**] despite albumin and fluid
boluses.  His UNa was less than 10 was UO of [**5-8**] cc/hr, so his
symptoms were felt to be c/w hepatorenal syndrome.  The patient
was started on daily midodrine/octreotide and albumin.  As his
creatinine increased to 2.4 by [**11-28**], his albumin was increased
to 25 gm [**Hospital1 **] and midodrine was increased to 15 mg tid.
.
# Pancytopenia: The patient developed pancytopenia on [**11-21**] with
platelet dropping to the 30s, hematoc
