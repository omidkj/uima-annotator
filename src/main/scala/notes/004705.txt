Service:

She is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female, who presented to the hospital on
[**2162-3-16**] to the medical service with vomiting and
anorexia.  Her presentation was weakness, lethargy, nausea,
and vomiting.  She was studied with a barium esophageal study
and found to have a large hiatal hernia, and she has been
refusing to eat with significant weight loss despite being
started on Reglan.

She was evaluated by a CT scan of her abdomen which showed
that she had a large hiatal hernia and a partial small bowel
obstruction with a transition point in the mid to distal
ilium without extrinsic compression or a mass and a left
thyroid lesion.  At that time, several attempts at
nasogastric were unsuccessful, however, during her prolonged
and complicated hospital stay, she did have some improvement
with decreased vomiting and nausea.  She was also noted to
have some lethargy and some facial droop.

A head CT scan on [**3-23**] showed no acute bleeding but
questionable lucency in the skull, and further workup was
deferred.

The Gastroenterology service also had been consulting on her,
and it was decided that there would be no acute surgical
intervention to try to resolve this partial bowel
obstruction.  She had electrolyte abnormalities as well which
were corrected for a high sodium and high chloride, which is
likely the result of the same process.

A chest CT scan showed a low attenuation lesion in the left
thyroid.  The pelvis CT scan showed scattered colonic
diverticuli and some uterine calcifications.

Patient had a PICC line placed, and was given supplemental
nutrition.  A Speech and Swallow evaluation resulted in
patient continuing on NPO status and not being fit for po
intake. Thus, enteral feeding option was explored and it was
determined on consultation with the Medical Team who is
taking care of her, that the surgeons will be [**Month (only) 653**]
regarding placement of some G or J tube.  It was decided that
the patient would go to the operating room where she was
looking slightly better during a very long hospital stay in
conjunction with a family meeting.

So on [**4-2**], the patient was taken to the operating room
with a preoperative diagnosis of aspiration and dysphagia
along with a partial small bowel obstruction.  She underwent
lysis of adhesions and enterostomy and a feeding jejunostomy
placed.  Intraoperative findings were multiple adhesions and
strictures of the small bowel secondary to these adhesions in
the distal small intestine, has required a small bowel
resection and postoperatively, the patient was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit, and despite having TPN, she never
regained her bowel function, and she postoperatively, had
some issues with atrial fibrillation.  Was treated with beta
blocker and some amiodarone, and was in the Intensive Care
Unit for several days until approximately a half an hour
before her death where she became decreased in her blood
pressure and noted to have agonal respirations.

Daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] at that time to inform her in the
change in her mental status.  She shortly thereafter, despite
fluid, did not recover blood pressure, respirations dropped
over to 0 and she was pronounced dead.
