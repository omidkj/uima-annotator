Chief Complaint:
Neck swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laryngoscopy ([**2152-12-15**])
Ultrasound guided neck biopsy
Percutaneous enterogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
65 y/o presents with neck pain. Patient first noticed increased
hoarseness 1 week ago. Then started having sharp, right sided,
constant [**12-23**] neck pain 5 days ago. Additionally started having
hemoptysis 3 days ago. Patient explains she has a chronic cough
that is frothy and clear but hasn't had blood until 3 days ago.
Patient has also had occassional chills and mild SOB. She denied
fever, chills, night sweats. She notes that she sometimes she
choked on food in the last 2-3 days. Patient thas a 53 pack year
history of smoking (started smoking 1 PPD at age 13). Presented
to her PCP's office, where an large painful mass was noted in
her right neck.  Urgent ultrasound demonstrated enlarged lymph
nodes and evidence of an underlying mass of unknown size.  She
was referred to the ED for CT scan and further workup.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.4 HR 78 BP 181/56 RR 20 SpO2
99% RA.
Exam notable for hoarseness and tenderness to palpation of the
right neck. CT non contrast of neck demonstrated large
circumferential mass nearly occluding her airway.  ENT was
consulted who performed direct laryngoscopy.  Recs pending on
transfer.  Admitted to ICU for monitoring given near airway
compromise, and for further workup of neck mass.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was hoarse and tolerating her
secretions well. Complains of neck pain but denies any
significant shortness of breath.

STUDIES:
CT Neck without contrast ([**2152-12-14**])
Severe circumferential narrowing of the airway by a soft tissue
mass that
extends from the epiglottis to the thyroid cartilage. Soft
tissue mass just deep to the right sternocleidomastoid
corresponds to lesion seen on
ultrasound; incompletely assessed without contrast. Consider MRI
for further assessment. Findings highly concerning for
malignancy, possibly squamous carcinoma.
-----------
CXR ([**2152-12-14**]): No significant interval change. No acute
cardiopulmonary
process.
-----------
Neck Soft tissue Ultrasound ([**2152-12-14**]): Palpable lump in the
lower right neck is an abnormal lymph node that measures 38 x 18
x 25 mm. It has some vascularity and shows marked irregularity.
It lies lateral to the internal jugular. Other abnormal lymph
nodes are present in this region, but are considerably smaller.
In the upper neck just inferior to the right submandibular
gland, a mass is seen with its broadest space at the right
trachea extending outwards into the more lateral aspect. This
measures approximately 4 x 3 cm in the transverse and is
associated with an enlarged lymph node in this region also.   No
evidence of abnormality is seen on the left side. Lobes of the
thyroid appear normal. These appearances suggest a malignancy
arising out of the region of the trachea or vocal cords with
metastatic lymph nodes. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was informed and the
patient was instructed to go to the emergency room for further
evaluation.
-----------
CYTOLOGY:  Lymph node (right neck), fine needle aspirate:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with squamous cell
carcinoma.
-----------
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing
evaluation was
performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow service
using multiple consistencies of barium. There was premature
spillover with evidence of pharyngeal swallow delay.
Mild-to-moderate aspiration was observed with thin liquids and
in part due to hyperextended position of the head, but not
cleared with prompting. Aspiration of nectar thick liquids was
also noted related to extensive residua in the piriform sinuses.
Please see the full speech and swallow service report in OMR for
further details.
-----------
CT CHEST:  New sub-4-mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary
nodules should be evaluated with chest CT in one year. No
additional suspicious pulmonary lesions. Large right neck mass
not fully imaged; see neck CT from [**2152-12-14**] for additional
details.
----------
MRI HEAD/NECK:
FINDINGS: Head images demonstrate prominent ventricles and
sulci, likely age related and involutional in nature. On the
diffusion-weighted sequences, there is no evidence of acute
ischemic disease or acute infarctions.
The study of the neck demonstrates soft tissue laryngeal mass on
the left,
causing narrowing of the airway, the right neck mass is not
clearly identified in this examination, please consider
obtaining additional images under conscious sedation or under
anesthesia for further characterization.
-----------
CT NECK:
1. Irregular, heterogeneously enhancing, lobulated mass seems to
originate in the left piriform sinus and crosses midline to fill
the right superior
piriform sinus. It also fills the laryngeal ventricles, causing
significant narrowing of the airway, and also invades the
glottis, aryepiglottic folds, true vocal cords, with only subtle
extension to the false vocal cords.
2. Another right neck mass at the level of C4 anterior to
carotid artery and SCM muscle may be an extension of the
laryngeal mass or
