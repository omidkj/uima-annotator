History of Present Illness:
66 year old RN who underwent mitral valve repair in [**2123-7-30**]
at [**Hospital1 756**] and
Women??????s Hospital. She has reported increasing shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion.  She can become short of breath
with as little as conversing with someone.  She is profoundly
dyspneic with one flight of stairs.  She also reports
progressive fatigue and though she continues to work, she feels
as though she is pushing herself.  Further evaluation with
echocardiogram and
right heart cardiac catheterization have revealed findings
consistent with mitral stenosis. She also appears to have
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Based upon the
findings, she was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions
Pre-bypass:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The gradient across the mitral valve is increased (peak = 17
mmHg and mean 8mm of Hg). There is a echodense, mobile 2 to 3mm
mass on the posterior leaflet close to the previously placed
mitral ring suggestive of pannus formation. These findings can
explain the increased gradients across the mitral valve and
mitral valve area of 1.2. There is moderate valvular mitral
stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen and the
tricuspid annulus diameter of 4 cm in end diastole. There is no
flow reversal in the hepatic veins.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass
Normal biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 40 to 55%.
There is a ring in the tricuspid position with residual mild TR.
The ring is stable and functioning well. The gradients across
the tricuspid valve is normal.
There is a mitral prosthesis, stable and function
