History of Present Illness:
75 yo female with PmHx of DM, asthma, HTN, hyperlipidemia who
presented from her [**Hospital3 **] home [**1-17**] with respiratory
distress.  On admission, she was found to have an O2 sat of 85%
on RA, and was given nebs/IV lasix.  Her initial ABG was
7.12/47/152/16 with lactate of 8, and CPAP was initially begun
in the ED.  She was noted to be bradycardic, with a ?junctional
escape rhythm at a rate of 48 bpm in the setting of hyperkalemia
(K=7), and was given atropine.  However, she subsequently became
hypotensive, was started on dopamine, and was electively
intubated.  Of note, several medications were apparently changed
[**1-13**] by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 19566**] initiation of Cardtia XT 300mg daily,
with discontinuation of nifedipine.  ED course also notable for
empiric initiation of levofloxacin, vancomycin, flagyl, and
hydrocortisone.

Micu course notable for resolution of her hyperkalemia, which
was thought to be secondary to a combination acute on chronic
renal failure and [**Last Name (un) **] toxicity, with resolution of normal sinus
rhythm (rate in the 70s), and pressors were waned off on
hospital day one.  Her renal function improved, with Cr 1.4 the
morning of [**Hospital 12145**] transfer to the floor (baseline 0.8 - 1.2).  She
was successfully extubated [**1-20**], though required intermittent
noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbia thought to be secondary
to combination of sedative medications and poor baseline
respiratory status.  She also was noted to be febrile, and was
treated empirically for possible MRSA pneumonia (sputum cultures
positive for MRSA), with defervescence on [**1-17**]. Furthermore,
discussion with outpatient psychiatrist revealed that patient
has atypical reaction (extreme agitation/?psychosis) to
midazolam, which may have contributed to her altered mental
status during weaning period.  She was also noted to have
hypernatremia, which was thought to be secondary to crystalloid
given during initial fluid resuscitation in the setting of acute
renal insufficiency.  Her hypernatremia improved with free water
repletion.

PMHx: HTN, DM II with neuropathy/nephropathy, asthma, increased
lipids, ?parkinsonism, paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
obesity, osteoarthritis, GERD, BPD, Diabetic neuropathy, R TKR,
Anemia, CRI.  Diverticulitosis.  ?hepatic cyst, S/p right total

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:

* BRADYCARDIA/HYPOTENSION:
Bradycardia was thought to be secondary to either junctional
rhythm vs. hyperkalemic arrhythmia, as potassium was >7 on
admission.  Hyperkalemia was thought to be secondary to a
combination acute on chronic renal failure and [**Last Name (un) **] toxicity.
Following correction of hyperkalemia, patient returned to [**Location 213**]
sinus rhythm with rate in the 70s.  Consequently, blood pressure
normalized and patient was easily weaned off pressors on
hospital day one.

* RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:
Patient was initially intubated upon arrival given hemodynamic
collapse.  However, patient was not extubated until hospital day
3, as patient was noted to be extremely agitated during
spontaneous breathing trials despite excellent objective
indications of successful extubation (low RSBI, appropriate
respiratory rates and tidal volumes).  Nonetheless, patient was
successfully extubated, but required intermittent noninvasive
ventilation for hypercarbia thought to be secondary to
combination of sedative medications and baseline COPD.
Discussion with outpatient psychiatrist revealed that patient
has atypical reaction (extreme agitation/?psychosis) to
midazolam, which may have explained patient's mental status
during weaning period.

* BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA: Given above difficulty with extubation
and intermittent fevers, sputum gram stain and cultures were
sent, and patient was found to have MRSA pneumonia.  Prior to
microbiological data, patient was empirically started on
levofloxacin and metronidazole, but vancomycin was added
following identification of Staphylococcus aureus in sputum
culture [**1-17**].  This colony was later found to be oxacillin
resistant, and patient was continued on vancomycin.  Patient was
afebrile by third day of treatment, with low grade temperature
elevations.

* BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER: According to outpatient
psychiatrist, patient is easily agitated at baseline and is best
managed by a combination of quetiapine, valproic acid, and
oxazepam PRN.  Following medical stabilization, patient was
restarted on quetiapine and valproic acid with PRN lorazepam for
acute bouts of agitation.  Quetiapine was uptitrated as needed.
Nonetheless, patient continued to require 1:1 precautions -
which outpatient psychiatrist felt would be expected at
patient's baseline mental status.

* HYPERNATREMIA: Thought to be due to large sodium load during
initial fluid resuscitation in the setting of acute renal
insufficiency.  Patient was given a combination of free water
boluses via NG tube and D5W to correct free water deficit
50%/day.  By the end of MICU course, patient's free water
deficit had largely corrected.

* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  On admission, patient's
creatinine was 2.7, thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion
during bradycardic episode.  With recovery of hemodynamics,
patient's urine output and renal function improved accordingly.

[**Hospital1 **] Course:
The patient was called out to the floor from the intensive care
unit on Thursday [**1-22**].

* PSYCH/AGITATION:
She experienced some agitation and getting out of bed although
she was unsteady on her feet. She was placed on 1:1 sitter for
one night on [**1-26**].

* BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA:
She completed a 10 day course of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
metronidazole on [**1-27**]. She has not experienced any fevers or
respiratory difficulty since being called out of the unit and
was successfully weaned off of oxygen.

* CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE/HYPERKALEMIA:
Her renal function has remained at baseline of 0.8-1.2 on the
wards without hyperkalemia. She was started on losartan [**1-29**] and
hydralazine was discontinued (due to concerns for compliance).
She will need monitoring of potassium to ensure that
hyperkalemia does not recurr on this medication.

* HYPOTENSION *
She experienced no further hypotension and instead experienced
hypertension throughout her course on the floor.
