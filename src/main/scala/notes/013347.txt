History of Present Illness:
39 yo male with history of EtOH cirrhosis presented to [**Hospital1 **]
on [**2171-4-18**] with increased agitation and confussion.  According to
OSH he had used increased EtOH use over weeks prior to admission
and was fired from his job.  He stated that he was feeling well
with no complaints prior to admission to [**Hospital1 **].  At OSH a head
CT was performed which was negative.  However he had labs and
symptoms consistent with EtOH hepatitis.  While there he had an
episode of hematemesis and was admitted to the ICU.  He had an
EGD there which showed no varices but did show gastritis.  The
lowest his HCT went was 24, he was transfused and has remained
stable at 29-30.  They had some trouble with access so a femoral
line was placed.  He had no withdrawal symptoms while there.
For his EtOH hepatitis he was treated with Vitamin K for
elevated INR, also got FFP at the time of femoral line removal.
At the OSH he appeared stable initially but then worsened.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care given his elevated INR,
elevated bili, and elevated creatinine.
.
He reports that he currently feels well.  He does note increased
leg swelling and abominal swelling although he states his belly
has been big like that for years.  He is currently hungry
although he says he gets full rapidly.  He denies fevers,
chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo male with history of EtOH cirrhosis presenting with EtOH
hepatitis and renal failure. He was treated on the medicine
floor for MSSA bacteremia with nafcillin. On [**2171-5-7**] pt had
increasingly worsening mental status on the floor. He was given
lactulose with no improvement. He had abdominal distention and
worsening renal failure (creatinine to 4.4) He was intubated as
he was found to have abdominal compartment syndrome, was not
able to maintain his airway. Over the course of the ensuing
days, Mr. [**Known lastname 3646**] was bleeding from line sites, paracentesis sites
and an upper GI source grossly. An EGD was done which showed
gastropathy and friable mucosa but no varices. CVVH was
initiated for worsening renal failure and to help the abdominal
compartment syndrome. As this was going on, pt also had septic
shock, source unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics and daptomycin was added when urine grew VRE.
Pressor requirements kept increasing and pt was maxed out on
three pressors. It became quite clear that he had an
irreversible process. Pt was made CMO and passed away on [**2171-5-21**]
in the presence of his family.
