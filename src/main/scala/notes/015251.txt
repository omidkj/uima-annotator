Fever at HD

History of Present Illness:
66 yo woman with h/o ESRD on HD, s/p failued renal transplant on
immunosuppression, DM, diastolic CHF, CAD, presents with fever
at HD. Per discussion with patient and daughter, she had had
some stomach upset earlier this morning and cold symptoms prior
to HD. No fever, chills, LH, dizziness, chest pain, SOB,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, urinary
symptoms. At HD, she had a fever to 102.8, malaise, respiratory
distress. Also had an episode of emesis at HD. Unclear whether
she finished her HD treatment today. Blood cultures were drawn
at HD, she was given 1g vanco, tylenol, and transferred to the
ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 102.8, BP 142/64, HR 87, RR 16,
SaO2 95% on 2L. While in the ED, she spiked to a Tmax of 104.
Remained HD stable. She was given 2L NS, tylenol for fever,
zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage. Given that she is on
chronic steroids, the ED gave her 100mg IV hydrocortisone. There
was also concern for PE, given her history of PE as well as her
tachypnea and hypoxia. Pt also developed severe R flank pain and
was given morphine 2mg IV x 2. She was started on a heparin drip
with the plan to get a VQ scan on the floor. Admitted to the
MICU for closer monitoring.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of feeling very
tired and having severe [**6-2**] pain at her R back/flank. She has
never had pain like this before. She also complains of
lightheadedness, SOB, nausea.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent

STUDIES:
CXR ([**3-24**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intra-thoracic process.

CT abd/pelvis ([**3-25**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Limited non-contrast evaluation. No definite evidence of
large fluid collection.
2. Distended gallbladder with gallstones, unchanged.

Renal US ([**3-25**]):
[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained
that demonstrate the native kidneys to be echogenic and small
(right 6.2 cm, left 8.5 cm). An anechoic avascular approximately
1 cm structure is
identified in the left kidney laterally, likely a cyst. The
transplant kidney measures 10 cm and is located in the right
pelvis. There is no hydronephrosis or renal mass. No perinephric
fluid is identified. Hyperechogenic foci likely represent sinus
fat.
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for perinephric abscess.

TTE ([**3-27**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot
be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

US of the left upper extremity AV fistula ([**3-27**]):
1. Thrombosed arteriovenous graft on the left upper arm and
forearm.
2. Patent left brachial and radial arteries.
3. No fluid collections on the left arm.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo female with pmh of ESRD s/p failed transplant on
immunosuppressants and HD, CAD, dCHF, DMII, htn, recent PE
admitted to the MICU after developing a fever and respiratory
distress at HD found to have a Coag-negative Staph bacteremia.

# Fevers/Coag-negative Staph bacteremia:  The day after
admission her blood cultures from the ED began growing out gram
positive cocci which speciated to coag-negative staph.  A line
infection was thought to be the cause of her fevers.  She was
started on vancomycin at HD on Friday and Zosyn was added on
admission for broader coverage (before the cultures had
returned).  She was continued on vancomycin, dosed by levels and
the zosyn was stopped.  Her leukocytosis trended down and her
fevers resolved.  Her last temperature
