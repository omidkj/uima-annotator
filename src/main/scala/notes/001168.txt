Studies:

Portable CXR [**2131-6-22**]
FINDINGS: Patient's positioning compromises the quality of the
film as well as comparison with prior radiographs. However,
bilateral perihilar haziness with upper redistribution secondary
to mild pulmonary vascular congestion seems unchanged. The right
hemidiaphragm is elevated. A left lower lobe radiopacity is
stable from prior radiographs and likely represents moderate
atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is
stable.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar
atelectasis, left
worse than right.

Chest CT:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no
axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. The pulmonary arteries
are well
opacified. There are no filling defects. A small left pleural
effusion is
identified. There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe. There
is left
lower lobe consolidation. A small amount of pericardial fluid is
noted. There are no lung nodules or masses. An NG tube is
identified.

Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal
gallbladder, liver, and spleen. A 1.2 cm nodule in the left
adrenal gland measures 16 Hounsfield units, is thus
indeterminate but most consistent with an adenoma. A 3.5 cm
hypodense lesion in the right kidney at mid pole measures 13
Hounsfield units and is consistent with a cyst.

On bone windows there is loss of height of T12 and L1 and T9.
This is of
indeterminate age.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for
pneumonia. Small
pleural effusion.
3. Compression deformity of several lower thoracic vertebral
bodies and of L1 are of indeterminate age.

Abd Xray [**2131-6-22**]
FINDINGS: One supine portable view of the abdomen is provided. A
G-tube is
seen within the stomach. The bowel gas pattern shows some mildly
dilated
loops of small bowel consistent with an ileus. There are
multiple
calcifications noted, most predominantly within the aorta. The
lung bases
appear clear. There is no evidence of free air.

IMPRESSION: Bowel gas pattern consistent with an ileus.

PATHOLOGY: [**2131-6-11**] Maxillary Tissue

1. Left medial palatal margin (A):

Negative for carcinoma.

2. Left medial lip margin (B):

Negative for carcinoma.

3. Left inferior periorbital margin (C):

Atypical cells present; cannot exclude carcinoma.

Note:  The atypical cells in the initial frozen section are
suspicious for carcinoma.  The focus does not appear in the
permanent section of the remaining frozen tissue.

4. Left medial periorbital margin (D):

Negative for carcinoma.

5. Left superior medial periorbital margin (E):

Negative for carcinoma.

6. Left proximal inferior orbital nerve margin (F):

Small cluster of atypical basaloid cells within soft tissue
consistent with basal cell carcinoma, see note.

Note:  There is a small focus at the edge of the permanent
section of the remaining frozen tissue.  The focus did not
appear in the original frozen section which was diagnosed as
negative for carcinoma.  The focus is within fat.  The nerve is
uninvolved.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] has reviewed this case and concurs
with the diagnosis.

7. Additional margin, left inferior periorbital (G):

Small cluster of atypical basaloid cells consistent with basal
cell carcinoma, see note.

Note:  There is a small focus at the edge of the permanent
section of the remaining frozen tissue.  The focus did not
appear in the original frozen section which was diagnosed as
negative for carcinoma.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] has reviewed this case and
concurs with the diagnosis.

8. Coronoid process of left mandible (H-I):

Portion of bone and muscle; negative for carcinoma.

9. Posterior portion of left inferior turbinate (J):

Nasal mucosa; negative for carcinoma.

10. Total maxillectomy, left (K-AK):

-Basal cell carcinoma, infiltrative type, present at inferior
orbi
