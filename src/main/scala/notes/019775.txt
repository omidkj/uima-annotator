after
a long battle with cardiac problems after endocarditis. Two days
ago, he developed some slight midline chest discomfort. He was
given a sedative two days ago once. He was fine when he woke up
yesterday, but later in the day, he did complain of a little
headache. He took possibly an aspirin or a tylenol at that time.
He went to bed and was fine when he woke up this morning. He did
some cleaning as they were preparing to have guests over to pray
with the family for his son tonight. The guest had arrived and
he
was sitting at the table at 7 pm, when he suddenly fell forward
onto the table and passed out. His family says he was not
complaining of anything prior to the collapse. After a few
minutes, he regained consciousness but he was not talking at all
and had right sided weakness. EMS was called and he was brought
to the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our NICU for management of his basal
ganglia hemorrhage.  The patient blood pressure was controlled
with iv labetolol, he was loaded with phenytoin, and started on
mannitol q6 hours.  Serial CT scans of his head showed a stable
degree of hemorrhage.  He was eventually extubated and became
more alert as the sedation was removed.  He was subsequently
transferred out to the floor, globally aphasic but alert and on
oral anti-hypertensive medications.  Over the course of his
remaining hospitalization, he experienced some improvements in
his neurologic exam, including some increased strength on the
right side of his body, and the ability to interact and follow
simple commands.  He worked extensively with our physical and
occupational therapy services.

We also noticed that his potassium was persistently low.  Our
endocrine and renal services consulted on the patient and felt
he most likely had primary hyperaldosteronism (he has a small
left adrenal mass, consistent with and adenoma).  He will have
appropriate follow-ups with these services arranged at the time
of his discharge.  He will have renin and aldosterone levels
pending at the time of discharge.
