Brief Hospital Course:
 In ED, initial VS 96.8 193/113 78 24 100% NRB. He desatted to
91% on RA. He had a CXR which did not show any infiltrate or
effusion. His labs were notable for acute renal failure and
hypernatremia, BNP lower than last value from [**6-4**].  His
shortness of breath worsened acutely and he was tried on BiPap
which he did not tolerate. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further monitoring in setting of elevated BP and transient need
for BiPap. He detereorated further and was intubated.  Abdominal
exam became more distended and a tranplant Surgery consult was
requested .  Initially, he was persistently hypertensive and was
treated with nitro and nicardipine drips.  On HD #2, renal U/S
showed no abnormalities.  On HD #3, he was intubated for
progressive pulmonary decompensation.  On HD #4, renal biopsy
concerning for rejection with superimposed ATN.  Progressive
acidosis at this time.  On HD #7, acute hypotensive episode, SBP
70, minimally responsive to fluid resuscitation and
vasopressors, guiac positive stool, KUB showing bowel
dilatation.  CT abdomen showed bowel pneumatosis.  On HD #8,
approximately 6 hours after initial surgical consultation, the
patient was taken to the OR.  At this point, he was on three
vasopressors, LFT markedly elevated, coagulopathic, and anemic.
Also of note, he demonstrated a methemoglobinemia as high as 13%
(nl 0-2%) on the day of his decompensation.  There was frankly
necrotic and perforated bowel, encompassing the majority of his
small bowel and transverse/proximal left colon, as well patchy
necrosis of his liver.  These portions of dead bowel were
resected and the patient was left in discontinuity, abdomen
open, and returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and then later transferred to the
SICU.  Massive resuscitation continued, with copious blood
product transfusions, CVVH initiated.  On POD #1, he was taken
back to the OR and there was a large amount of hematoma
evacuated without obvious source of bleeding, omentectomy was
performed, bowel looked viable, abdomen left open.  On POD #2,
he went into rapid afib with associated hypotension, treated
with electrical cardioversion and rate control.  Later that day,
he was taken back to the OR and an end jejunostomy was performed
after failed attempts at re-establishing continuity secondary to
tissue friability.  On POD #[**4-4**], vasopressors on and off,
continued CVVH, developed neutropenia (WBC 0.3) treated with
Neupogen, gradual increase in ventilator requirements (increased
FiO2 and PEEP).  On POD #7, he was taken back to the OR for
abdominal wash-out, vicryl mesh closure of abdomen, and VAC
dressing placement.  Bowel looked viable at this time.  On POD
#8, the patient went back into rapid afib with hypotension,
treated with electrical cardioversion, but progressed to
refractory shock requiring three vasopressors.  On POD #9,
precipitous decompensation ensued, family was consulted, CMO
status and expiration shortly thereafter.
