PERTINENT LABORATORY AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Creatinine 2.6,
potassium 3.7, white blood cell count 5.0, hematocrit 37.2,
PTT 79.3, INR 1.13.  Initial CK 1103 in the AM of 27, MB 102,
index 10.5, troponin greater than 50.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient's
enzymes continued to be trended, and they continued to trend
down from the outside admission labs.  The patient was
maintained on IV heparin, metoprolol, aspirin, isosorbide.
The patient was chest pain-free upon arrival.  Given his
acute renal failure, ACE inhibitor was held, and the patient
was not maintained on a IIB/III inhibitor.  The patient was
delayed catheterization until his creatinine decreased, given
the risks of nephrotoxicity, and on [**2126-1-5**], the
patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed
disease in his mid-LAD, and he received a PTCA to the
mid-LAD.  LVEDP was found to be 40 in the Cath [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
patient was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
postcath for tailored therapy.  PA diastolic in the 40s on
arrival to CCU.  The patient got 20 of IV lasix with little
effect, and started on an Natrecor drip with lasix 40 IV, and
diuresed approximately 1,900 cc to a PAD of 23.  Creatinine
continued to improve from 2.6-2.0.  Supplemental oxygen
requirement was weaned in conjunction with diuresis, but
likely in large part due to percutaneous coronary flow
restoration.  The patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service on [**2127-1-5**] with improvement of his diuresis,
and Natrecor was continued.  The patient was again maintained
on aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor
was held pending improvement of his acute renal failure prior
to discharge.
Cardiovascular :  The patient presented with decompensated
systolic heart failure.  Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy with
an EF
of 20%, [**State 531**] Heart Association III baseline, improving,
the patient was diuresed to a dry weight of 208 pounds.  The
patient was maintained on Isordil, metoprolol, Natrecor and
lasix drip.  Natrecor was DC'd on the day prior to admission,
and was started on a PO lasix regimen of 40-20 q am and q pm.
 The patient was fluid restricted of 1,500 liters per day.

RHYTHM:  The patient was maintained on telemetry without any
events during this hospitalization.  The patient is status
post AICD placement.  We continued his amiodarone during this
hospitalization stay.

2) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had an
ultrasound at the outside hospital which was negative for a
postobstructive process.  The patient's creatinine continued
to trend down with further diuresis and improvement of
renovascular flow, to a discharge creatinine of 2.1.
However, while being maintained on Natrecor, his creatinine
bumped again to 2.3 up to 2.5, which was likely thought to be
due to overaggressive diuresis, and we decreased his lasix
dose at that time.  ACE inhibitor was still held off.

3) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had reasonable fingerstick
blood sugar control.  Continued with regular insulin sliding
scale and his current regimen.

4) THRUSH:  The patient had an episode of pooled blood in his
oropharynx and white exudative thrush on oral mucosa.  The
patient was evaluated by the ENT service on [**2127-1-4**]
who felt that the patient likely had exudative oropharynx,
and the patient was treated with Hurricaine spray as needed
for tenderness.  Strep culture was sent which was negative.
The patient was maintained on a treatment of nystatin and
fluconazole x 7 days with marked improvement.

5) PNEUMONIA:  The patient was initially transferred with
Tequin, and was subsequently changed over to Levaquin with
renal dosing, for a total 10-day course of Levaquin with
marked improvement.  He had no further episodes of cough or
fevers during this hospitalization stay.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute myocardial infarcti
