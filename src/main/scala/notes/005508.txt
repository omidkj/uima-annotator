Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left carotid endarterectomy [**2117-5-25**]
TIPS redo [**2117-6-2**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4033**] is a 67 yo M w/ h/o severe COPD, ETOH cirrhosis s/p
TIPS [**2106**], CAD s/p CABG [**2106**], bladder CA s/p resection [**2104**],
chronic neuropathy, GERD and h/o R CEA s/p left sided weakness
[**2114**] who presents with right sided weakness for 4-5 days.
.
Of note, the pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 4107**] from
[**Date range (1) 52350**].  Originally he presented with diarrhea and a COPD
exacerbation. He was found to have pan-colitis on CT abdomen
thought to be [**2-23**] c diff and started on flagyl and vanco. He was
given gentle hydration in the ICU. He then developed a distended
abd with ileus on KUB. He was made NPO and given golytely with
some relief. He also had a paracentesis with 3.3 L removed
resulting in improved respiration and ileus. He also recieved
stress dose steroids and levoquin. The pt was treated for
"borderline hypotension" thought to be [**2-23**] hypoalbuminemia,
cirrhosis and sepsis with gentle hydration and albumin. Prior to
d/c, he was placed back on aldactone and lasix.
.
Of note, the pt's d/c summary from [**Hospital1 **] noted "baseline" right
arm weakness.  The pt states he thinks this started around the
time of his paracentesis at the OSH. Neuro was consulted in the
ED who noted proximal > distal R sided weakness was well as
likely chronic distal weakness 2/2 neuropathy. CT head showed
hypodensity in the parietal corona radiata.  Neuro thought pt
may have had a watershed infarct during a period of hypotension,
perhaps after large-volume paracentesis but also thought embolus
couldn't be excluded. Thusly, neuro recommended CTA head and
neck (which showed no e/o vascular aneurysm, occlusion or
dissection), antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**], keep BP elevated, MRI, TTE,
LENI on R to look for clot.
.
In the ED, CXR also showed ? pneumomediastinum for which CT [**Doctor First Name **]
was consulted. On CT chest, this was thought to be [**2-23**] medial
right sided subpleural bleb without pneumotosis and CT surgery
signed off.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T P BP R O2 sat. Patient was given
Hydrocortisone at stress dose, levofloxacin 750mg IV, flagyl
500mg IV, vancomycin 1gm IV, Albuterol nebs x3, ipratropium nebs
x2, lorazepam and 2L NS. Pt has free air on CT abd- there was
concern for perf from colitis but thought more likely [**2-23**]
persistent leak from para site. Leaking from parasite with
ostomy on. Transplant surgery consulted in ED said NTD but they
would continue to follow. Pressures have been stable in
80s-90s/40s-50. Vitals on transfer to ICU T 97.1 HR 85 BP 93/44
RR 14 O2 sat 99% on 3L NC.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt denies any pain. Pt states he is
having some baseline SOB but feels better after neb in ED. Pt
having liquidy stools.

2PPD x 50 year smoking history. Long prior h/o EtOH abuse, but
none for 1 year, no drugs

Carotid Series:
FINDINGS: With B-mode ultrasound, a moderate amount of plaque
was seen in the left internal carotid artery. No significant
plaque was seen in the right internal carotid artery. On the
right side, peak systolic velocities were 97 cm/sec for the
internal carotid artery, and 81 cm/sec for the common carotid
artery. The right ICA/CCA ratio was 1.1.
On the left side, peak systolic velocities were 212 cm/sec for
the internal carotid artery, and 77 cm/sec for the common
carotid artery. The left ICA/CCA ratio was 2.75.
Both vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow.
COMPARISON: The left carotid artery flap mentioned on the CTA
scan could not be visualized on this duplex scan.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis on the right
side.
2. 60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
.
TTE with bubble:
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is preserved (focused views only obtained).
Right ventricular systolic function is preserved. The mitral and
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is at least mild
to moderate tricuspid regurgitaiton.
.
MR HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with acute-to-early subacute MCA
distribution infarcts of the left hemisphere, predominantly
involving the left posterior frontal and parietal lobes. The
distribution suggests an embolic source.
2. Bilateral maxillary sinus disease.
.
Right-Sided LENI:
CONCLUSION:
1. No ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the right
lower
extremity.
2. Edema of the soft tissues of the right lower extremity.
.
CTA HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Regions of hypodensity in the left frontal and parietal
lobes, most
consistent with acute-to-subacute infarcts, perhaps embolic.
2. Atherosclerotic plaque at the bifurcation of the left carotid
artery, with suggestion of an intimal flap traversing the left
carotid bulb, concerning for a dissection. This may be secondary
to atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bulb, and may serve as
source of emboli.
3. Emphysema with a small right pleural effusion.
