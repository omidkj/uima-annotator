Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Status post pacemaker lead removal.
Temporary wire placement.


History of Present Illness:
87 year-old male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 30% with BiV ICD),
AF (on coumadin), diet-controlled DM, s/p recent admission for
sepsis, who now presents s/p fall with hypoxia and hypotension.
The patient fell x2 the night prior to admission at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] stating he felt "weak". He denies dizzines,
lightheadedness, LOC, or head trauma. He was subsequently
dyspneic, found to have an oxygen saturation in mid 70's, and
noted to be cyanotic. EMS was then called.
.
Review of systems positive for increased SOB over past several
days. The patient denies chest pain. He also denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. He has
had some minor dysuria recently with increased frequency.
.
In the ED, patient had SBP in 70's and lactate 4.0. A CVL was
placed, and he was given 1L NS, vancomycin 1g IV, levofloxacin
500mg IV, and flagyl 500mg IV. BP improved to 80/44. CVP noted
to be 24 and levophed was started instead of further fluid
bolus. Oxygen saturations were 95-98% on 100% NRB. He had oral
temperature of 99.5. He was then transferred to the MICU for
further treatment.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head on [**2104-1-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Dilated superior ophthalmic veins (right greater than left).
 This may be related to differences in section location on
current study v. the prior examination. It is likely not
clinically significant but suggest correlation for bruits on
auscultation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2104-1-30**]
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2103-12-28**], the left lower lobe is now
clear. There is now bilateral perihilar and right lower lobe
edema consistent with CHF/fluid overload.
No obvious consolidating pulmonary infiltrates.
.
Echocardiogram on [**2104-1-31**]:
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Dilated and
hypertrophied left
ventricle with moderate global systolic dysfunction. Dilated
right ventricle  with moderate systolic dysfunction. Moderate to
severe tricuspid  regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-12-24**],
the left
ventricle appears slightly more dilated. The other findings are
similar.
.
Chest Ultrasound [**2104-2-1**]:
IMPRESSION:  No abscess identified around the pacemaker pocket.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2104-2-6**]  8:09:30 AM
Atrial fibrillation and ventricular paced rhythm with capture.
Occasional
ventricular ectopy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-2-5**]
there is
occasional ventricular ectopy. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.
.
[**Numeric Identifier **] PICC W/O PORT  [**2104-2-6**]
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of PICC line via the left
basilic vein, terminating in the superior vena cava. Ready for
use.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old male with coronary artery disease s/p CABG,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes
mellitus, with recent admission for sepsis, who now presents
status post fall with hypoxia and hypotension secondary to
sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis: The patient had a recent admission for sepsis and was
found to have MRSA bacteremia and Pseudomonas UTI at that time.
The patient's recurrent sepsis on this admission was thought to
be secondary to infected ICD leads and the patient went to the
operating [**2104-2-3**] for lead removal and temporary lead
placement.  The differential initially included endocarditis,
recurrent UTI, pneumonia, and C. difficile infection.  These
diagnoses were excluded as there were no vegetations noted on
intraoperative TEE, the patient's urinalysis was negative, chest
X-ray negative for pneumonia, and C. difficile cultures
negative.  The patient was followed by Infectious Disease during
admission.  The patient was started on vancomycin [**2104-1-30**] and
will continue to complete a four-week course from [**2104-2-3**], the
date of pacer lead removal.  The patient will have a permanent
pacemaker placed once the antibiotic course is completed.  The
patient was transiently on cefepime and metronidazole
empirically but these were discontinued.  The patient initially
required levophed but this was weaned the second day of
admission.  Lactate 4.0 on presentation but subsequently
normalized.
.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of lung disease of unclear
etiology (restrictive and diffusion defects by last pulmonary
function testing).  The patient has a history of amiodarone use,
but CT chest in [**2101**] did not show definitive signs of amiodarone
toxicity.  The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement 2-3L.
The patient's increased oxygen requirement on admission was
believed secondary to hypoxia secondary to sepsis and/or CHF.
The patient's BNP was elevated on admission.  There were no
signs of pneumonia on imaging or sputum culture.  The patient's
oxygen requirement decreased during admission with diuresis and
treatment of sepsis.  On discharge, the patient was saturating
93% on 3L at rest, but required higher levels of oxygen on
ambulation from severe deconditioning.  The patient should be
given nebulizers and increased oxygen prior to exertion.  The
patient also intermittently desaturated during sleep, likely
secondary to intermittent hypoventilation.  The patient responds
to brief use of increased oxygen or non-rebreather mask as
needed.
.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient had creatinine 2.3 on
admission, from baseline 0.9.  This was likely pre-renal in
setting of sepsis and congestive heart failure.  The patient's
creatinine improved with diuresis and treatment of sepsis.  The
patient's renal failure subsequently remained stable 1.4-1.5 and
this may represent a new baseline.
.
4. Status post fall: The patient suffered a fall prior to
admission likely s
