HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] is a pleasant
46-year-old gentleman with history of Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy performed on [**2110-3-17**], who was
discharged on [**2110-3-21**], in excellent condition who
returns to the hospital today after acute onset of abdominal
pain in the early morning around 5:00 a.m.  He describes this
pain as [**11-21**], sharp, epigastric and radiating to both right
upper quadrant and right lower quadrant.  The pain is
constant in nature.  While this episode began Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] also
felt dizzy and almost passed out.  He is brought in by his
family for further evaluation.  On arrival he feels better
than he felt earlier in the day.  He denies fevers, however,
complains of some nausea and dry heaves.

Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] is well known to our service.  He has a history of
hypertension, kidney stones and a duodenal ulcer.  He also
has a history of exploratory laparotomy in [**2084**], ankle
surgery in [**2087**] and arthroscopy in [**2090**] and a rotator cuff
repair in [**2106**].  His troubles began when he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**]
cholecystectomy on [**2109-1-8**], when he suffered a
common bile duct injury.  He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] primary repair of this
common duct transection with a T-tube which was complicated
by a bile duct leak.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2109-1-12**] on the
Gastroenterology Service for further care.  He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**]
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed
extravasation of bile at the middle third of the bile duct.
This was treated with stent placement.  He had been doing
well in time symptomatically, however, he over time developed
stricture which was 10 mm long in the common hepatic duct.
His symptoms at this time included persistent early morning
diarrhea.  However, he denied any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting or constipation.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
repair of this 10 mm bile duct stricture.  He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**]
repair of this stricture through a Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy on [**2110-3-17**], after which he had
an uncomplicated postoperative course.  His diet was advanced
and he was discharged to home on [**2110-3-21**].  He is now
returning to the hospital with symptoms described above.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] had an
extensively complicated hospital course which is described in
detail below.

On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] presented with acute onset of upper
abdominal pain and episode of dizziness.  He went to an
outside hospital where his white count was 30 and hematocrit
was 32.  He was sent in to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation.  On admission he received an
abdominal CT scan which was significant for a large
intraperitoneal hematoma around the duodenum extending into
the mesentery.  The initial assessment at this time was a
mesenteric bleed and/or cholangitis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**], since he
was in stable condition, was admitted to the floor with close
observation.  Over the next 24 hours Mr. [**Known lastname 104879**] hematocrit
drifted to a low of 25.  In the meantime, however, he
continued to be stable and had adequate urine output.  This
hematocrit drop was assessed to be secondary to the hematoma
formation and Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] was transfused with an appropriate
rise in the hematocrit.  His abdominal CT scan was repeated
which showed a stable hematoma as found in the prior CT.  In
our effort to elucidate the etiology of the hematoma, Mr.
[**Known lastname 63555**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a CT angiogram of the right upper quadrant.
The CT angiogram was negative for any pseudoaneurysm
formation or any vessel injury that was obvious.  While being
followed on the floor on [**2110-4-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] had an
episode of coffee ground emesis and grossly bloody bowel
movements.  A Gastroenterology consult was obtained and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The EGD was
significant for the presence of a fresh blood clot in the
duodenum which was assessed to be consistent with either an
ulcer or an eroding vessel.  A repeat endoscopy was scheduled
at this time.  Over the next several days Mr. [**Known lastname 104879**]
condition once again improved and he was slowly progressed to
regular diet.  However, on [**2110-4-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] had
an acute change of events when he once again vomited bright
red blood.  He was emergently taken to the Intensive Care
Unit where he received resuscitation with multiple units of
blood transfusion.  Considering the fact that the brisk upper
GI bleed may be from a duodenal ulcer or, more significantly,
from a developing pseudoaneurysm, a decision was to take Mr.
[**Known lastname 63555**] back to the Operating Room.  Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] was taken back
where he received an exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of a
large intra-abdominal hematoma, take-down of the hepatic
flexure and Kocherization of the duodenum, repair of a
duodenal perforation and suture ligation of the right hepatic
artery and repair of the hepaticojejunostomy.  The
intraoperative observation was especially notable for a large
vessel which began bleeding and was likely the source of the
hematoma.  The estimated blood loss for the operation was
5,000 cc and multiple units of blood were transfused.  The
abdomen was packed at the end of the procedure and was left
open after placement of drains.  Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] was then
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with an open abdomen
in an intubated, sedated and paralyzed condition.  The
remainder of the Intensive Care Unit course was significant
for a left pneumothorax requiring a left chest tube placement
on [**4-8**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 104879**] hemodynamics and hematocrit
remained stable after this operation and he was able to
diurese.  On [**4-10**], four days after his
re-exploration, Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] was taken back to the Operating
Room where his abdomen was closed and prior Silastic placed
at the prior operation was removed.  Over the next several
days Mr. [**Known lastname 63555**] had slow but steady recovery and was
extubated on [**4-11**].  As he was re
