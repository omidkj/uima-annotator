   WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):
      This culture contains mixed bacterial types (>=3) so an
abbreviated
      workup is performed. Any growth of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus
and beta
      hemolytic streptococci will be reported. IF THESE BACTERIA
ARE NOT
      REPORTED BELOW, THEY ARE NOT PRESENT in this culture..
      WORK UP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] #[**Numeric Identifier 100855**] [**2164-8-12**].
      BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP B.    MODERATE GROWTH.
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE COMPLEX.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Piperacillin/Tazobactam PERFORMED PER REQUEST.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third

         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that

         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be

         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      ENTEROCOCCUS SP..    SPARSE GROWTH.
