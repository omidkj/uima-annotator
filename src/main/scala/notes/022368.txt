Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
58 year-old female with morbid obesity, OSA, h/o asthma,
transferred from [**University/College **] infirmary complaint of extreme dyspnea on
exertion and hypoxia.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports that 8 days prior to
admission, she had URI symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion,
cough, myalgia, mild subjective fever.  Took more prn ibuprofen
(1600mg/day).  When questioned about dietary intake, she reports
eating a diet consisting solely of canned soup over the last
week.
.
URI symptoms resolved by around 5-6 days prior to admission,
however, she noted severe fatigue and dyspnea with minimal
exertion starting late Sunday or Monday (4 days PTA).  She
reports severe dyspnea with minimal exertion.  Denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria, PND, orthopnea
(has slept on 2 pillows since childhood), hemoptysis or chest
pain.  Also denies sick contacts.  Does not feel like her
previous asthma flare.
Has a minimal nonproductive cough that she often has to
irritants.
.
She presented to the [**University/College **] infirmary today due to concern that her
dyspnea was not resolving.  In the [**University/College **] infirmary, she was noted
to be 60% on room air and 76% on 2L NC with a CXR revealing
bilateral infiltrates.  She was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient afebrile, with stable BP, but initially
tachycardic to 108 with O2 sat as low as 71% on room air (lying
flat), 92% on 4L NC and 100% on a nonrebreather mask.  Of note,
the patient reports that she did not feel worse when her O2 sat
was 71%.
.
CXR here showed bilateral patchy opacity consistent with
congestive heart failure.
.
Given Levofloxacin 500mg IV x1, Combivent nebs, Lasix 40mg IV
x1, with great improvement in symptom after diuresis.  Patient
reported large amount of urine but flushed it down toilet
without quantifying it.   Patient also started on heparin gtt
given concern for PE.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Dynamic
interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views.

Conclusions:
Technically difficult study. Limited views obtained.

1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal
(LVEF>55%). No wall motion abnormalities seen but the views are
limited.
4.The aortic valve is not well seen. No aoritic regurgitation
seen.
5.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old female with morbid obesity, osteoarthritis, history
of asthma, OSA, LE edema, who now presents with dyspnea on
exertion and hypoxia:
.
##Dyspnea/hypoxia: This was felt to be a combination of CHF,
asthma, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was
diuresed almost 18L and improved dramatically. She had no
leukocytosis, fever, productive cough, or clear consolidation on
CXR suggestive of pneumonia. She ruled out for a PE with a CTA.
She did have some wheezing on exam to suggest an asthma flare
and was treated with a short course of tapered steroids as well
as nebulizers RTC. She was discharged to complete her short
taper as well as started on Advair. Her hypoxia was also felt to
be likely in part due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and
she was placed on Bipap at night. She tolerated this well and
will follow up for a formal sleep study and be fitted for BiPap
at home.
.
## Pulmonary HTN: the echo showed that the pt's PASP was
markedly elevated at 52. She will follow up in the pulmonary
clinic for formal PFT's and will likely be referred for further
testing including possible Swan Ganz cathter with NO trial.
.
## Hypertension: She was continued on norvasc and lisinopril
with good BP control.
.
