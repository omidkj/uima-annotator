History of Present Illness:
Mr. EU Critical [**Last Name (un) **], believed to be [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7356**] born
[**2024-12-28**], but not yet identified, is a 70 year old gentleman
currently residing at [**Doctor Last Name **] House.  He was last known to be well
at 6pm this evening.  At 6:30 pm, the patient's roommate was
unable to arouse him from couch initially.  He apparently then
did arouse with slurred speech, although this may have been due
to missing dentures.  He was found to be confused, weak and
unable to stand, with a blood sugar of 100.  The ambulance was
called and he developed worsening confusion/mental status while
en route to the ED and was on a face mask on arrival.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: Tmax 99.2 P 68 BP 210/99 R 21 O2 sat
99% NRB. Patient was altered but following commands during code
stroke (neuro consulted, tPA not given). He was intubated for
airway protection, propofol for sedation.  After intubation, OG
tube placement yielded 500mL of dark bloody fluid that clear
with 250mL of NS lavage. He had guaiac positive brown stool.  He
received Protonix 80mg IV x1, 40mEq of potassium and had 2
peripheral IVs placed through which he received 1L NS. Transfer
VS: 52 180/82 14 100% on vent settings below.
.
On the floor, the patient arrives intubated and sedated,
responding only to sternal rub.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging/diagnostics:
1. CT head w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities.
2. EEG: This is an abnormal VEEG telemetry due to the presence
of a
generalized slow background rhythm of [**3-10**] Hz, with frequent
periods of
[**5-12**] theta activity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
This tracing is etiologically non-specific but indicative of
diffuse
encephalopathy such as metabolic disturbance, infection, or
medication
effect. There are no focal abnormalities or epileptiform
features
noted. Compared to prior EEG recordings, this EEG is unchanged.
3. CXR: Right middle lobe collapse. Adjacent right lower lobe
opacity could also be due to atelectasis, but appearance and
clinical symptoms raise concern for pneumonia. The terminal tip
of the left PICC line is positioned at the cavoatrial junction.
4. Video swallow test ([**2101-8-19**]): Aspiration with all liquid
consistencies with oropharyngeal residue after swallow.
5. Video swallow test ([**2101-8-23**]): No aspiration or penetration is
seen with multiple consistencies of barium. Normal swallowing
mechanics are demonstrated. For further details please refer to
full report on OMR by the speech pathology team.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year man, resident at [**Doctor Last Name **] house, admitted for altered mental
status, found to have an upper GI bleed, RLL pneumonia now
resolved who has been hemodynamically stable andambulating.
.
1) Altered mental status: On admission, patient had altered
mental status. There was concern for poor airway protection, so
he was intubated. EEG and CT head were obtained to rule out
intracranial bleed and seizure, which were negative. Metobolic
workup was all negative. Blood cultures were negative. He was
extubated and transferred to the floor.
.
2) Pneumonia: On arrival, patient was found to have clinical
signs of penumonia including fever, sputum production, and
cough. CXR showed RLL pneumonia, so patient was started
empirically on vancomycin + aztreonem + levofloxacin + flagyl
for  ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sputum culture showed H.
influenza and beta Streptococci, thus he was narrowed to
levofloxain, and completed a 7day course prior to discharge.
.
3) Aspiration: Initial video speech and swallow exam on the
floor showed aspiration of liquids. An dobhoff tube was placed
temporarily for feeding. Repeat video swallow showed no more
aspiration and patient was placed on thin liquid with crushed
solid diet.
.
3) Upper GI Bleed: On admission, NG lavage was positive for
blood. Aspirin was held and patient placed on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. On the
floor, patient remained HD stable. He refused an EGD and after
discussion with his legal guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 108882**], the decision was
made to perform the EGD as an outpatient.  Resuming aspirin
should be reconsidered as outpt after Hct has been stable for
several weeks.
.
4) Skin blisters on left back: There was concern for shinles at
first, thus DFA, viral cultures, and HSZ/VZV serologies were
sent, which came negative. Would care was provided and the rash
improved without further treatment.
.
4) CHF/Afib/Hypertension: No evidence of heart failure. He was
kept on his home medications ACE-I, metoprolol, and digoxin upon
transfer to the floor.
.
5) Schizophrenia: Continue Zyprexa 7.5mg PO QHS
.
6) Depression/Anxiety: Continue Paroxetine
.
7) Osteoporosis: Continue alendronate upon arrival on the floor
