History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] is a very pleasant 61 year old male with a new
diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer who was referred to the ED
after he was noted to have a creatinine of 10.3 on routine
pre-procedure labs. The patient has a history notable for CVA in
[**2149**], HTN, as well as recently discovered lung mass. The patient
has a several month history of feeling progressively fatigued
with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 40 pounds. He
reports complete lack of appetite. He denies nausea but does
endorse some dysphagia to solid foods. He also has shortness of
breath with minimal exertion as well as a mucous producing
cough. This was worked up by his PCP which revealed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] large
right-sided pleural effusion on CXR. A follow-up CT chest with
contrast on [**2154-4-23**] showed multiple concerning nodules
consistent with a likely metastatic malignancy of primary lung
origin. He was seen by IP on [**2154-4-29**] for thoracentesis (>1000
cc of bloody fluid was removed) and ultrasound-guided biopsy,
with a final diagnosis of poorly differentiated large cell
carcinoma. The biopsy results just recently returned and the
patient was made aware in the ED with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

In the ED, initial VS were:   97.8 117 94/55 18 94% ra.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 110
CBC, Chem-7: Reveals creatinine of 6.5 and K. of 4.2
Urinalysis: Revealed Small LE, Neg nitrite, few bacteria. Given
Ceftriaxone 1g for presumed urinary tract infection
Portable chest x-ray: Persistent right effusion
Fluids: 1Lns
Vitals prior to transfer: 97.4 107 103/54  20 1002L

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.9 110, 127/70 26
100% on 2L. The patient denied any pain. Although he did
describe pain with coughing that resolved after the throcentesis
on [**4-29**]. He does feel short of breath but feels more comfortable
with 2L of O2.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] is a  61 year old male with a new diagnosis of
metastatic lung cancer who was referred to the ED after he was
noted to have a creatinine of 10.3 on routine pre-procedure
labs.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 6.5 on admission, baseline was
1.1 in [**2153-10-30**]. Most likely pre-renal azotemia from poor PO
intake and possibly ATN due to IV contrast. Renal U/S negative
for hydronephrosis.Crea improved with IVF an dreturned to
baseline prior to d/c.
.
# Metastatic lung cancer: New diagnosis. CT chest with multiple
masses in the lung including pleural based masses as well as
evidence of bone mets.Pt has no pains incluing back pain or
other symptoms suggestive of other bone mets/other mets.
MRI of brainwas doen and negative fo rbrain mets. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
be pt's outpt oncologist and will follow next week.Palliative
care was also consulted for early supportive care.
.
# Pleural Effusion: s/p thoracentesis [**2154-4-29**] (atypical cells).
Effusion reaccumulated and IR peformed repeat thoracenetsis with
placeemnt of pig tail. Fluid c/w malignancy ( although cytology
negative)and not c/w infection.
Pig tail removed and plan for pleurx cath next week as an outpt.

.
# Anion-gap acidosis: Most likely from uremia. Lactate was not
elevated. Bicarb improved with IVF.
.
# EtOH Abuse: Banana bag given in ICU.Pt had no evidence of
withdrawal throughout hospital stay.
.
# Fever/Pneumonia:Pt was staretd on ceftriaxone empirically for
positive u/a on admision. Urine cx was eventually negative and
pt with new fevers while on ceftriaxone.Pt was started on
cefepime and vancomycin fo rpossible HCAP. Repeat blood, urine
and sputum cxs obtained. Sputum cxs positive for proteus and abx
narrowed to cefepime per sensitivities.Pt defervesced and
remained afebrile. He completed 5 days of cefepime.
.
# Diarrhea:Pt developed diarrhea during hospital stay. C. diff
PCR negative. Other cxs ,O&P  as well as [**Location (un) 27292**] all negative.
Pt started on a BRAT diet an dreceived one dose of immodium.
Diarrhea resolved and diet advanced.
.
# Dysphagia:Noted in teh ICU. Speech and Swallow consulted in
the ICU. Bedside swallow eval was unremarkable.
.
# Severe anion-gap acidosis: Due to uremia. Resolved with IVF in
the ICU.
.
.
#Asthma/COPD: Pt with h/o asthma and heavy smoker. On exam
positive wheezing. Started albuterol nebs and switched to
ipratropium due to tachycardia . Neb tretents improved breathing
signnificantly and pt d/c on advair.

.
#HTN: All hypertensive meds were d/c on admit. Pt started on low
dose m
