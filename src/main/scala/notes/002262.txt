History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 63 yo M s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**3-15**]
polycystic kidney disease on tacrolimus and prednisone,
metastatic prostate cancer, and MGUS who presents with fevers
from his rehabilitation facility. Of note, he had been recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 111347**] for shoulder and arm pains. He
developed leukocytosis and loose stools during this
hospitalization for which he was treated with flagyl empirically
for two weeks ending on [**3-8**]. Per his rehab records, PO
vancomycin was restarted on [**3-10**]. At rehab, stool had been C
diff+ as recently as 1/30 per the records available to us.

Per his wife, he developed a fever to 101F the evening prior to
admission, without any associated chills or sweats. He also
complained of left thigh pains.

Review of systems is otherwise negative for headache, vision
changes, neck stiffness, cough, chest or abdominal pain, rash,
discharge or redness from his urostomy site. He has had loose
stools, nonwatery, without any gross bleeding in ~2 weeks.

In the ED, vitals were T 98.5 P 120 BP 86/54 RR 16 O2 96%. The
sepsis protocol was initiated and a central line was placed.
Patient initially had a CVP of 2 cm, with good response to IVF
(~2L but total amount not clear from transfer notes). He
received solumedrol and dexamethasone, as well as zosyn 4.5g,
vancomycin 1g, and flagyl 500mg. He was also started on
neosynephrine for additional blood pressure support.

CT Abd/Pelvis/Thigh 2/4/8:
1. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right, compared to the previous study of [**9-13**]. Extensive new subcutaneous stranding and fluid. While the
majority of this could represent anasarca, there is a more focal
area of soft tissue density in the medial right thigh (not fully
evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast), which most
likely represents hematoma, although a metastatic focus or an
area of infection cannot be entirely excluded.
3. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

CXR 2/4/8:
1. Left IJ terminates at the origin of the SVC.
2. Moderate congestive heart failure.

Renal Ultrasound 2/5/8:
Transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant shows normal
echogenicity and vascularity. Size of the left transplant kidney
is 10.3 cm, grossly unchanged. There is no hydronephrosis,
calculus, or perinephric fluid collection. Doppler and spectral
analysis shows normal vascularity and waveform, with resistive
indices of 0.7, 0.6 and 0.6, within the range of normal, in the
upper, mid, and lower poles.

TTE [**2138-3-18**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the
more distal segments. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 40%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate
([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is very mild mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a very small
anterior pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2138-3-20**]:
Worsening of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions
with overall distention in mediastinal vasculature consistent
with volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension/Fever
Initially received broad spectrum antibiotics, stress dose
steriods and aggressive fluid rehydration.  Although he required
pressors on admission, he was weaned off after less than 24
hours.  Given his recent history of C diff and urine cultures
positive for pseudomonas, he was treated with vancomycin, zosyn
and flagyl empirically.  There was no obvious source for
infection; blood cultures as well as PICC line cultures were
negative.  During the course of his hospitalization, he devloped
worsening pulmonary edema with anuria, making it difficult to
support his blood pressure with IV fluids.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
Unclear etiology for acute worsening, perhaps secondary to
volume loss from recent C.diff, possibly secondary to
pseudomonal UTI, though per renal there is possibilty of chronic
pseudomonal colonization of patient's urine.  He developed
anuria and was dialyzed by renal.  After initiating dialysis,
the patient expressed his wish not to be put on dialysis.  He
and his wife, who is his health care proxy, agreed to change
goals of care to make him CMO so that he could go home with
hospice.

3. Pulmonary Edema
Likely multifactorial causes including aggressive fluid
replacement, worsening heart failure, acute renal failure and
possible pseudomonal UTI.  Echo demonstrated new wall motion
abnormality; however, upon review of the Echo with cardiology,
the feeling was that the basal wall akinesis was in fact present
on prior TTE.  Cardiology wa
