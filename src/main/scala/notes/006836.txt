Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization on [**2141-12-18**] with stent


History of Present Illness:
74 year old man with HTN, prior treatment at an assortment of
hospitals, patient denies history of MI, (+) 3 prior cardiac
arrests per patient report from VTach/VFib, apparently had an
ICD x 2 ([**2127**], [**2133**]) but it was removed when leads were not
working and patient did not want another one.  Patient also
states he has had a cardiac catheterization in the recent past
which looked okay and no interventions were done at that time.
On day of admission, patient went to the gym. After working out
had [**3-19**] chest pressure radiating to Jaw, nausea, shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. EKG with 3-4mm ST elevation V1-V3, ST
depression inferiorly.  Patient states he has known A.Fib and
there was supposed to be a decision this week whether to start
Coumadin.  He is DNR/DNI but willing to have cath/PCI.  He was
transferred from [**Hospital3 628**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.

[**2141-12-18**] Cardiac Catheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Likely severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute
primary PCI of
the proximal LAD with thrombectomy and deployment of a
drug-eluting
stent.
4. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Perclose suture deployment at the right femoral arteriotomy
site.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel
coronary
artery disease in this right dominant circulation. The LMCA had
a mild
distal tapering of 30%. The LAD had a 95% proximal thrombotic
stenosis
beginning at a very small D1 and spanning a small D2 with TIMI 2
flow
distally. The LCX had diffuse non-obstructive plaquing to 30%
ostially,
and 30% in the mid vessel. There was a large OM branch without
flow
limiting disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel with diffuse
non-obstructive plaquing to 40% with TIMI 2 flow.
2. Post-intervention hemodynamics from right heart
catheterization
demonstrated severely elevated right sided filling pressures
(RVEDP 17
mmHg). The PWP catheter was unable to be fully lodged in the
wedge
position; the mean PCWP was estimated at ~25mmHg with large
V-waves seen
superimposed on the PA tracing. Cardiac index and output were
severely depressed at 3.6 L/min and 1.7 L/min/m2 respectively
(using an
assumed oxygen consumption).
3. Left ventriculogram was not performed to reduce contrast
load.
4. Successful thrombectomy and stenting of the thrombotic LAD
lesion
were performed with a 3.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent, which
was
post-dilated using a 3.75 mm NC balloon, with a 5% residual
stenosis,
loss of a small 2nd diagonal branch, no apparent dissection, and
TIMI 2
flow (see PTCA Comments).
5. The right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a Perclose
Proglide device with good hemostasis after limited angiography
showed no
significant arterial pathology.
.
[**2141-12-19**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly-to-moderately
depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to akinesis
of the apex, severe hypokinesis of the interventricular septum,
and moderate hypokinesis of the anterior free wall; the other
walls are hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with HTN, AFib, h/o cardiac arrest presents after acute
Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.  Patient was
transferred from outside hospital for cardiac catheterization
and is s/p thrombectomy and [**Month/Day/Year **] to proximal-LAD.  He tolerated
the procedure well and was monitored in the Coronary Intensive
Care unit for 24 hours before being transferred to Cardiology
[**Hospital1 **].
.
1.  CV:
          Ischemia: s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to proximal LAD.  Continue
ASA, started Plavix, atorvastatin and Beta-blocker.  Cycled
cardiac enzymes until trended down (peak CK 1322).  Integrelin
was given at 1/2 dose as patient has renal insufficiency (Cr
1.5-1.8 during admission).  Integrelin was continued 18 hours
post-catheterization and then stopped.  Continued Heparin
post-cath given patient's history of AFib as well as the risk of
forming thrombus if Apex is now akinetic.  Echo done on [**12-19**]
showed akinesis of apex without thrombus.  He was started on
Coumadin after the benefits/risks were discussed with him and
bridged with Lovenox.  He received Lovenox teaching and is to
continue this until his INR is 2.0 or greater.
          Pump: Checked Echo on [**12-19**], EF 40%.  Started ACEI for
afterload reduction, and titrated up as blood pressure
tolerated.  Digoxin (home medication) was stopped during
hospitalization as it was felt it may not be beneficial for this
patient.
          Rhythm: known AFib, rate-controlled.  Started on
Coumadin on [**12-20**].
.
2.  CRI: Monitored Creatinine, unsure of baseline, 1.5-1.8
during hospitalization.  Patient should have BUN/Creatinine
monitored as outpatient while on ACE Inhibitor.
.
3.  FEN: Cardiac/Heart Healthy diet.  Low sodium diet.
Monitored electrolytes and repleted to keep Potassium > 4.0 and
Magnesium > 2.0.
.
4.  Dispo: Patient to be discharged to home.  Patient was
cleared by Physical therapy to be safe for home discharge.  As
he was started on Coumadin for akinetic apex and Atrial
Fibrillation, he is to have his blood drawn at [*
