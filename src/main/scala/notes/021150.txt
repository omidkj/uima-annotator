Admission Date:  [**2152-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-11-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2077-11-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 93777**] is a 75 -year-old
female with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and
hypercholesterolemia who presented with complaints of
shortness of breath and back pain.  She was found to be in
decompensated congestive heart failure and was admitted to
the Medical Service for diuresis and investigation as to why
she had suffered an acute decompensation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission examination was remarkable
for tachypnea, respiratory rate of 28, 84% on room air
saturation, bilateral crackles to the mid thorax, 9.0 cm
jugular venous distention, and an S3 gallop and trace
pretibial edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Noted for a BUN and creatinine of
99 and 2.1, her baseline is 0.9 as of [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, and
a CPK of 170, MB fraction of 7.0, and troponin I of 5.4.

Admission electrocardiogram was remarkable for sinus rhythm
at 70, a left bundle branch block that was new, flipped
T-waves in I, AVL, V5, V6 that were consistent with lateral
ischemia.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure,
cardiomegaly, cephalization, and bilateral effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was therefore placed on glycoprotein 2B
and 3A inhibitor therapy as well as nitroglycerin, aspirin,
and heparin.  A Cardiology consultation was obtained by
admitting Medicine Services.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2152-10-27**] showed high grade stenosis in the distal left main
system, involving the origin of the left anterior descending
artery as 90% osteal stenosis, moderate disease of the left
circumflex including 50% stenosis of the oblique marginal and
other diffuse disease throughout the circumflex system.
There is an 80% osteal stenosis of the right coronary artery
and it was additionally reported that the patient ultimately
ruled in for a myocardial infarction.  Cardiothoracic Surgery
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for operative management of the
patient's three vessel disease and left main disease.

A Renal consultation was also acquired perioperatively to
assist in optimizing her renal function.  She was given
Mucomyst and cautious fluid management and elimination of ACE
inhibitors and NSAIDs and other nephrotropic medications was
made accordingly in her management.

An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
approximately 20-30% and given the relative hypoperfusion of
her kidneys, her creatinine rose to a peak of 3.2.  On
[**2152-10-29**], the patient had a four vessel coronary artery
bypass graft; a left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to first diagonal and also
to second obtuse marginal artery sequentially, as well as a
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.

Postoperatively the patient was managed in the CSR Unit.  She
was extubated on postoperative day two.  Her renal function
initially worsened, but steadily improved after postoperative
day two.  By postoperative day three, she was transferred to
the floor and started on oral medications.  The patient's
pulmonary status was also an issue because of the relative
volume overload due to her acute renal failure and she was
noted to have bilateral pulmonary effusions by chest x-ray.
She underwent a thoracentesis drainage of the effusions with
marked symptomatic relief on postoperative day four.  She
eventually had a saphenectomy wound dehiscence that also
occurred postoperatively involving the right medial malleolus
and the right proximal thigh.

Postoperatively she did also suffer from serous drainage
involving the inferior aspect of the sternal wound that
persisted up until 24 hours prior to discharge.  The patient
received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation for diabetes management and
her usual measurement of Avandia and sliding scale was
changed.  See below for the medication list to see final
diabetic management.  Wet-to-dry dressing changes were
utilized to manage the wound dehiscence as well as vancomycin
and Levaquin.

On discharge, the patient was afebrile without sternal
drainage.  Her activity level was rated as [**3-9**] and her blood
sugars were well controlled.  The sternum was stable, no
erythema or exudate was noted.  The heart was regular.  Lungs
were clear.  Extremities were without edema and wounds were
granulating well with no erythema.  Discharge creatinine was
1.2, white count was 13,000 with a normal differential.
Chest x-ray had shown stable, but resolving bilateral
effusions and a room air saturation of 93%.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include Lipitor 20 mg po q day,
Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Levaquin 250 mg po q day times
fourteen days, Colace 100 mg po bid, Lasix 40 mg po q day,
Percocet as needed for pain, Keflex 250 mg po qid times two
weeks, K-Dur 20 mEq po q day, aspirin 325 mg po q day,
Humalog sliding scale and Lente 14 units q HS.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

FOLLOW UP:  Follow up will include seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
office in one month.  She will have a wound check in one
week, here on Far Six at the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] with the outpatient clinic staffed by the cardiac
physician's assistant.  Additionally, she will see her
cardiologist in three to four weeks from the time of this
discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times four,
complicated by postoperative renal failure.  This is now
improved.  She had a right saphenous vein graft site wound
infection and dehiscence.  The patient has native three
vessel disease and left main disease, is now status post
repair.
