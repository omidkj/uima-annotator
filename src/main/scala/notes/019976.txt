ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Angina

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old man with a
history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and angina who
underwent a cardiac catheterization two days prior to
admission which demonstrated triple vessel disease.  The
patient was having exertional angina, status post walking 10
feet, five days prior to the cardiac catheterization.  He
also had pain at rest which resolved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  The pain was 2/10 chest pain radiating to the
left arm.  The patient had a positive stress and the cardiac
catheterization showed triple vessel disease.  He was
discharged home with a goal to decrease his white count prior
to coronary artery bypass grafting, however, the patient was
home for 7 hours after discharge and was laying in bed when
he started developing chest pain again which radiated to the
left arm which did not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.
He was transferred to the Emergency Room at which time he was
having nausea and shortness of breath with chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Asthma

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated Aspirin
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d.
4.  Albuterol 2 puffs q. 6 hours prn
5.  Sublingual Nitroglycerin

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco, stopped in [**2084**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room he was found to
have a heartrate of 62, blood pressure 152/72 and respiratory
rate of 18, sating 99%.  His physical examination was clear
to auscultation with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  His extremities showed no edema and had 2+
pulses distally.  His troponin was found to be 2.9.  At this
point the cardiac surgery team was consulted and it was
determined that he would go for coronary artery bypass
grafting the next day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2101-8-25**], the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three as
follows:  saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1, saphenous vein
graft to right posterior descending artery, performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as physician
assistant, [**Name9 (PRE) **].  The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 83
minutes with a crossclamp time of 44 minutes.
Postoperatively the patient did well without any pressor
requirement or inotrope requirement.  However, he did go into
atrial fibrillation on postoperative day #2 and was started
on Amiodarone.  The patient subsequently converted back to a
normal sinus rhythm on postoperative day #3 and remained in
such for the remainder of his admission.  He did, however,
have chilled rigors and was found to be febrile to 101 on
postoperative day #4.  At this point he was examined and
noted to have erythema and induration at the site of an
intravenous line which was located in his left forearm.  The
intravenous line was removed and there was pus noted coming
from the site of the entry of the intravenous line into the
skin.  After a 24 hour period of observation, it was noted
that there was not significant improvement in the induration
or erythema and pus was expressible from the wound.  Given
these findings, the patient underwent an incision and
drainage of pus from this suppurative thrombophlebitis that
had occurred at the site of his intravenous.  The patient
tolerated his procedure well and by postoperative day #6
remained afebrile for 24 hours with resolution of the
induration of the cellulitis of the left arm.  He was clear
to auscultation with regular rate and rhythm.  Given this, it
was felt that he was stable for discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Motrin prn
4.  Albuterol metered dose inhaler 2 puffs q. 4 to 6 hours
prn
5.  Flovent 100 mcg metered dose inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. times three days and then
400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 7 days, then 400 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Tetracycline 500 mg p.o.q.i.d. times seven days
9.  Percocet prn

The patient was tolerating a regular diet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post chemotherapy
times two.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft [**8-25**].
