FINDINGS: Subcutaneous edema was present in the left lower
extremity. The left greater saphenous vein has been previously
harvested. The left lesser saphenous vein is patent with
diameters varying between 0.16 and 0.23 cm. The vein measures
0.18 cm superiorly, 0.23 cm in its mid portion, and 0.16 cm
inferiorly.

The right greater saphenous vein has been previously harvested.
The right lesser saphenous vein contains mural calcifications
but is patent. The diameters of the right lesser saphenous vein
vary between 0.14 and 0.18 cm.

A PICC line is present in the left cephalic vein, which is
otherwise patent. The left basilic vein is patent with diameters
of 0.25 cm superiorly, 0.14 cm in the mid arm, 0.39 cm at the
antecubital fossa, and 0.14 cm in the forearm.

The right forearm has an arteriovenous fistula. The right
cephalic vein has diameters varying between 0.35 and 0.52 cm and
is patent. There is pulsatility of the flow in the right
cephalic vein and this possibly represents an outflow vein from
the arteriovenous fistula. The right basilic vein is patent in
the arm with diameters varying between 0.29 and 0.51 cm.

IMPRESSION: Prior harvesting of the greater saphenous veins
bilaterally.

Small caliber lesser saphenous veins bilaterally with
calcifications in the right lesser saphenous vein murally.

Patent left cephalic vein containing a PICC.

The left basilic vein is patent with some diameters less than
0.20 cm.

There is an AV fistula on the right forearm. The cephalic and
basilic veins on the right are patent.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT scan.

COMPARISON STUDIES: [**2164-10-28**]. Noncontrast head CT
scan, also performed for mental status changes and interpreted
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as showing "small area of low attenuation
involving the right occipital lobe, suggestive of a small
infarct of uncertain age."

FINDINGS: The present study has a few images which are degraded
by streak artifacts. Allowing for this deficiency, no overt
interval change is noted. Once again, a small area of low
density is noted within the right occipital lobe region, which
likely represents an area of chronic infarction. Also, both
studies disclose a small linear area of low density within the
left parietal white matter, again probably representing an area
of chronic infarction within border zone distribution. Upon
referral to the prior MR report of [**2164-10-31**] (the
images not being available on PACS at this time), apparently
areas of T2 hyperintensity within the white matter were detected
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and may well conform to the CT abnormalities
noted above. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. The surrounding osseous and extracranial
soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable, abnormal study as noted above.

MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

MRA OF THE NECK:

The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the carotid
and vertebral arteries. No evidence of vascular occlusion or
stenosis is identified. The left vertebral origin is not well
visualized. If further evaluation is clinically indicated
consider gadolinium-enhanced MRA.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis or occlusion in the arteries
of neck. The left vertebral origin is not well visualized and if
clinically indicated, gadolinium-enhanced MRA would help for
further assessment.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. The distal left vertebral
artery is small in size secondary to the left cervical vertebral
artery ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal
variation.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
