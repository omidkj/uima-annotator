Brief Hospital Course:
86M with CLL, admitted several times for pneumonia, who again
presents with RLL pneumonia, fever, CKD, anemia, and progressive
leukocytosis.
.
-Pt was thought to have pneumonia with an element of CHF/COPD
exacerbation.   Ischemic event ruled out be CE's.  PE also felt
to be unlikely.  Pt treated with zosyn/vanco for presumed
pneumonia.  However, he showed no improvement.  He had
persistent fever and continued O2 requirement (100% face make).
Pt was diuresed without improvement.  Blood cultures were
negative to date.  Tried Bipap without improvement either.
Albuterol/ipratropium did not seem to help the pt.
Discussion was had with family (including HCP) and pt that his
situation was dire, particularly given the progressive and
nature of his underlying CLL.  It was decided that care and
comfort measures should be undertaken.  The pt died comfortably
within 24hrs of that decision.
