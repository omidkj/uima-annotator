Brief Hospital Course:
In brief this is a 71 yo F w/ DM II, bronchiectasis, HTN p/w
hypoglycemia, hypothermia and hypoxia.
.
#)Hypoxia: Patient was admitted to the ICU with hypoglycemia and
hypothermia. CXR was concerning for pneumonia and patient was
started on Ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for CAP. Patient
continued to have cough and wheezing so antibiotics was then
changed to vanc/zosyn for history of pseudomonal/proteus
PNEUMONIA. She was stable in the unit for the day and on the
evening of [**10-22**] she was transferred to the floor where her ABX
coverage was broadened to include azithromycin. She had one
episode of increased wheezing on the morning of [**10-23**] that
resolved with nebulizer treatments. She was started on chest
physiotherapy, and deep suctioning to aid in clearance of
secretions. Further history revealed that she had no respiratory
symptoms prior to her hypoglycemic episode. This fact in
conjunction with sputum cultures positive for mixed flora
suggested aspiration pneumonia and her azithromycin was held.
Her vancomycin was continued until discharge int he setting of
one sputum culture positive for GPCs in cultures to cover for
possible MRSA. On the day of discharge the likelihood of a MRSA
pneumonia was thought to be low and the patient was sent home
with a 5 day course of Augmentin and Guaifenesin and told to
follow up with her PCP.
.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Home 70/30 Insulin dose was stopped on admission
given hypoglycemic episode. HISS was started to cover patient
for day of admission. On transfer to the floor her insulin was
changed to 30U Lantus QHS to avoid hypoglycemia. Her sugars were
relatively well controlled on this regimen. Prior to discharge a
[**Location 7972**] speaking nurse [**First Name (Titles) 20554**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**Known lastname 49957**] training on her new
insulin regimen. She was discharged home on 35U Lantus QHS and
