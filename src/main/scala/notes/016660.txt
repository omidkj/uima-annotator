Imaging:
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2133-9-14**] 11:53 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
There is
dependent and lingular atelectasis, without focal consolidation
suspicious for pneumonia.
2. Coronary calcification.
3. Splenomegaly, without evidence for splenic infarct or
perisplenic
hematoma.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2133-9-22**] 8:37 PM
IMPRESSION:

As compared to the previous examination of [**2133-9-14**],
small areas of
atelectasis in the lung bases have partially resolved. No newly
appeared
parenchymal opacities, notably no evidence of pneumonia or other
infection.
Unchanged small hiatal hernia. No pleural effusions, no
pericardial
effusions.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2133-10-2**] 12:49 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of infectious process or lymphadenopathy in the
chest, abdomen or pelvis.

2. Less than 2mm Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule, attention on
follow up
examinations.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2133-9-15**] at 2:44:28 PM
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
