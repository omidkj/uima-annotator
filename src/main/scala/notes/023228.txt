HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 32 year old

pedestrian who was struck at high speed by either a motor
vehicle or a motor vehicle that hit a pole and struck him. He
is a Spanish speaking male.  There was positive loss of
consciousness and a questionable change in mental status.
The patient was found standing at the scene.

Notable at the scene were right orbital lacerations, a left
open leg fracture.  He was subsequently transported by EMS to
[**Hospital1 69**].  At [**Hospital1 346**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a seizure on the
CT scan table and desaturated to 58%.  He was subsequently
intubated on the CT scanner and further history was
unobtainable.

Toxicology screen negative.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.

Rotated pelvis film revealed no evidence of fracture.

Head CT revealed open skull fracture; bilateral frontal
contusions; right frontal intracranial hemorrhage; right
frontal epidural hemorrhage; right frontal subdural hematoma.
Left orbital fracture.  Left retrobulbar hematoma.  Medial an
lateral orbital wall fractures of the left orbit and lateral
wall fracture of the right orbit.

Cervical spine CT revealed no fracture, no dislocation.

Chest CT revealed atelectasis with right lower lobe
aspiration, no rib fractures.

Abdominal CT:  No apparent solid organ injury.  No free air.

Pelvic CT:  Cystic replacement of the right kidney.

Left lower extremity:  Left talus open fracture; multiple
metatarsal fractures and dislocations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On presentation, given Mr. [**Known lastname 46623**]
severe intracranial hemorrhages, he was taken immediately to
the operating room with both the neurosurgery team and the
orthopedic team.  In the operating room, an emergent
craniotomy as well as evacuation of the epidural hematoma was
performed.

At the same time, the orthopedic team performed an irrigation
and debridement, as well as an open reduction and internal
fixation of the left foot, metatarsal fracture and
dislocation.

Also, at the time of the surgery, an intracranial pressure
monitor was placed intraoperatively to monitor the patient's
intracranial pressure.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was subsequently
transferred to the trauma Intensive Care Unit for further
management of his intracranial pressure and his other
injuries.  He remained intubated for several days and his
intracranial pressures were controlled. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
started on Dilantin and Mannitol was used to keep his
intracranial pressure below 20.

A repeat head CAT scan on the [**2-25**] did not show
any progression for reaccumulation of the epidural hematoma.

On [**2-27**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the operating room
for a wash-out of his left lower extremity.  A VAC dressing
was placed.  Also on that day, he was self extubated. There
was no need for reintubation given that Mr. [**Known lastname **]
maintained his oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen.

On [**3-1**], he returned to the operating room for
another irrigation and debridement as well as a VAC change.
On the [**3-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] became somewhat
agitated.  He self-discontinued his intracranial pressure
monitor, all his peripheral intravenous and his nasogastric
tube.  Also on that day, he was transferred to the regular
floor because he was considered stable.

An angiogram of the left lower extremity on the [**3-2**] showed a normal vascular pattern, except for an
occluded dorsalis pedis at the talonavicular joint.

On the [**3-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the
operating room for debridement and wash-out again of his left
lower extremity.

On the [**3-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced respiratory
distress as well as acute chest pain with decreased
saturation to 91% and increasing respiratory rate to 40.  He
was intubated and subsequently transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit again.  A CTA of his chest revealed a large
pulmonary embolus and he was subsequently started on a
heparin drip.

His respiratory status slowly improved over the next several
days.  On the [**3-9**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] angiogram of his left orbit
was performed which did not show an arteriovenous fistula. He
was also extubated on the [**3-9**].  It was also
discovered on the [**3-9**] that he was growing
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from his left
lower extremity wound.  He was started on Vancomycin and
Levaquin.

On the [**3-10**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] inferior vena cava filter was
placed by the vascular surgery service.  He was again
transferred to the floor on [**2123-3-14**].  He was taken back to the
operating room with both plastic service and orthopedic
service for external fixation of his fractures as well as a
lateral rectus abdominous free flap to close the tissue
defect on his left lower extremity.  Postoperatively, he was
taken back to the Intensive Care Unit for frequent flap
checks and he has done quite well with his flap.  The plastic
service is satisfied with how the flap has continued to heal.


On [**2123-3-17**], he was transferred back to the regular floor where
he has remained stable until discharge.  On [**3-22**], all his
antibiotics were discontinued, including Levaquin and
Vancomycin.  He had been afebrile with a stable white count
of 10 at the time of discontinuation of his antibiotics.  On
the [**2-22**], he returned to the vascular laboratory
for potential removal of his inferior vena cava filter.
However, on venogram, there was noted to be a large clot at
the bifurcation of the aorta; therefore, the inferior vena
cava filter was left in place and will be permanent.

He was subsequently started on systemic anticoagulation with
Lovenox, dosed at 70 mg/kg twice a day as well as Coumadin.

Throughout the course of his hospital stay, multiple consult
services have been involved in Mr. [**Known lastname 46623**] care.
Immediately, at the time of his injuries, the oral
maxillofacial surgery team was consulted and worked in
conjunction with all other teams in managing his facial
injuries.  Ophthalmology was emergently consulted on
admission for a left retrobulbar hematoma.  The ophthalmology
consult team did not feel that there was any need for lateral
canthotomy and with no obvious ptosis or e
