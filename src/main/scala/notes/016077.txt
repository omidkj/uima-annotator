History of Present Illness:
67 y/o F with a h/o HTN, T2DM, and hyperlipidemia who presented
to the ED with a 4 day h/o cough, SOB, and fever. Of note, the
patient recently returned from a trip to [**Country 3587**] to visit
relatives. The patient had been living in [**State 108**] for several
years and recently moved to the [**Location (un) 86**] area. She flew back from

Imaging:

[**9-6**] PA and Lateral: CHEST, TWO VIEWS: There is dense
opacification of the right upper lung with associated air
bronchograms. There is thickening of the right minor fissure
likely due to a small amount of fluid in the fissure. The right
posterior costophrenic sulcus is blunted consistent with a small
pleural effusion. The left lung is clear. The heart size is
normal. The aorta is tortuous.
IMPRESSION: Dense opacification of the right upper lobe, likely
representing a lobar pneumonia. An endobronchial obstructing
lesion cannot be excluded on these radiographs. Followup imaging
after treatment is suggested.

[**9-7**] ECHO Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral

regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved left ventricular systolic function. Mild valvular
thickening with no signifcant stenosis or regurgitation.

[**9-21**] PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-14**] through [**9-18**]:
A small amount of volume loss persists in the right upper lobe.
There is no good evidence of recurrent pneumonia. Mild
cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal vascular engorgement has
improved.
There is an unusual configuration to gas shadows in the upper
abdominal midline, probably unusual displacement of the gastric
antrum. If patient has referable symptoms to abdominal pathology
I would reevaluate with routine abdominal radiographs.
Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the upper SVC. No
pneumothorax. Medical student [**Last Name (un) 71534**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4887**]
were both paged to report these findings at the time of
dictation.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, her vital signs were T 99.9 HR 120 BP 114/50 RR 32
95%NRB.  A chest x-ray [**Last Name (un) **] da RUL pneumonia, and ECG showed
afib with RVR. Her lactate was 3.0 and creatinine 2.1. She was
pan-cultured, given a dose of antibiotics, and transferred to
the MICU for presumed septic shock.
.
# Respiratory failure/Septic Shock:
In the MICU she quickly went into severe hypoxic hypercarbic
failure (7.26/59/63 on NRB) requiring intubation. She became
hypotensive, requiring transient pressors and a total of 13
liters net volume resuscitation. Culture data including EBV,
CMV, and TB were consistently negative, even after bronchoscopy.
She completed a ten day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
but was also on vancomycin. By chest x-ray, her consolidation
resolved quickly after 5 days (post-bronchoscopy for cultures),
suggesting increased secretions were a major component of her
pulmonary dysfunction. She had a prolonged intubation ([**Date range (1) **])
with hypoxia during spontaneous breathing trials for many days.
She was extubated on [**9-18**] with steadily decreasing secretions and
O2 requirements.  She had an O2 requirement for 1-2 days on the
floor that improved with incentive spirometry and walking with
PT.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis
Upon presentation in the MICU, her CK was 1297 with large blood
and few RBCs in the urine suspicious for rhabdomyolysis. Her
troponins wer negative. Her CPKs peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 6235**] on [**9-15**] along
with transaminases in the 300's. She was treated by aggressive
volume resuscitation and lasix to achieve UO > 100cc/hr. She
never had any bump in her creatinine. Her last CK [**9-20**] was 3000,
and she continued to have a stable creatinine until discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation
The patient's MICU course was also complicated by atrial
fibrillation for 3-4 days not properly rate controlled on
metoprolol or diltiazem. Echocardiography showed a normal heart
with LVH and preserved EF (>55%). She was therefore begun on an
amiodarone drip, leading to documented conversion on [**9-10**], after
which the drip was D/Ced. She was anticoagulated for a total of
5 days.  In discussions with the cardiology consult service, it
was felt that the transient risk factor for atrial fibrillation
(septic shock) had resolved and that long-term anticoagulation
would not be warranted. She remained in sinus rhythm for 9 days
on telemetry after her cardioversion, after which telemetry was
discontinued. She reported no palpitations at any point in her
stay.
.
# Weakness
Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] was initially weak while recovering from her extesnive
MICU course. She improved rapidly with hospital PT, however, and
was felt safe for discharge with home PT services to aid her
recovery.
.
# Anemia
She had a labile hematocrit during this admission, likely
consistent with a dilutional effect from high volume
resuscitation.  On discharge, she has borderline macrocytic
anemia with near-appropriate reticulocyte production and Fe
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She was
guaiac negative. Further w/u as an outpt may be clinically
indicated.
.
# Hypertension
Her blood pressure was titrated with IV beta-blocker in the MICU
and switched oiver to PO beta-blocker once the patient was
taking good POs. ACE-I was D/Ced out of concern for renal
toxicity while rhabdomyolysis resolving.  Pt discharged on
stable regimen of metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] with BPs in the 120
