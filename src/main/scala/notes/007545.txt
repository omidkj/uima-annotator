HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in [**2135**], coronary artery bypass
grafting times four in [**2135**] including left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to ramus and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
one, cardiac catheterization in [**2141**].  The patient presented
for an elective cardiac catheterization on [**2144-10-29**]
after a Persantine stress test demonstrated diffuse anterior
and inferolateral wall ischemia.  The patient has been having
worsening symptoms of shortness of breath as well as a 30 to
40 pound weight gain since early last year, requiring
admission to [**Hospital6 33**], as well as an admission
here from [**9-18**].

The patient presented on [**2144-10-28**] for prehydration,
did well overnight and had a morning blood sugar in the 50s
and was given one ampule of D50 to compensate for that.
However, in the holding area, the patient was noted to become
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and,
during the procedure itself, had a further decreased to a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  He was given a bolus of
250 cc of normal saline and started on Dopamine initially at
15 mcg/kg/minute and later decreased to 10 mcg/kg/minute.
Because of the issue of hypotension, interventions were
deferred until the patient was more stable after observation
overnight in the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  As above.
2.  Left ventricular ejection fraction 30%.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Status post femoral-popliteal bypass.
5.  Left below the knee amputation.
6.  History of bilateral carotid stenoses.
7.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus with associated retinopathy and
neuropathy as well as baseline morbid obesity.
8.  Status post penile implant.
9.  Cholecystectomy.
10. Appendectomy.
11. Carpal tunnel syndrome with release procedure in [**2144-4-23**].
12. Baseline creatinine 2.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q.d., iron 325 mg p.o.t.i.d., methotrexate, folic
acid, digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
valsartan 80 mg p.o. q.d., Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d., prednisone
5 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d., multivitamins, insulin
70/30 1 to 2 units s.c.b.i.d. and weekly dose of 4,000 units
of epoetin alfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and has no children.
He has a 60 pack year history of tobacco, quit in [**2109**].

STUDIES:  The patient's cardiac catheterization was notable
for the following:  Right dominant anatomy with a 60% distal
left main coronary artery neat lesion, 100% stenosis of
proximal left anterior descending artery, left circumflex 90%
lesion, right coronary artery 100% lesion, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal one 100%, saphenous vein graft to
the right coronary artery 100% lesion, saphenous vein graft
to distal obtuse marginal patent, left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery patent, mild
disease of left anterior descending artery.  Cardiac output
and index were 5.77 and 2.34 respectively with a mean wedge
of 14 and pulmonary artery pressure mean of 31.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination was notable
for a morbidly obese man in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  pupils equal, round, and reactive,
extraocular movements intact, no jugular venous distention
appreciated.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds.
Abdomen:  Soft, obese, nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds, no
palpable organomegaly, no rebound tenderness, left groin
sheath intact with no obvious bleeding hematoma.
Extremities:  Warm, palpable distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11, hematocrit 31,
platelet count 171,000, BUN 100 and creatinine 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was kept overnight for
observation.  He underwent an interventional cardiac
catheterization subsequently on [**2144-10-30**].  During
this procedure, a Cypher sirolimus oozing stent was applied
at the proximal diagonal one and a second Cypher stent was
placed at the left main coronary artery.  Good post procedure
flow was revealed.  The patient was kept for observation.  He
was initially planned for a MRA of his carotid vessels given
the recent stent placement.  This procedure will be deferred
as an outpatient.  The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy and was felt to be safe for discharge home.  The
patient was discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting times two.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Diovan 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
Prednisone to be tapered down, starting at 2.5 mg q.d for 14
days then 2.5 mg q.o.d. then stop.
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Folate.
............ 10 mg p.o. q.d.
