History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25062**] is a 78 year old gentleman with DM, CRI, HTN s/p AVR
(porcine) and 2 vessel CABG (LIMA--> LAD, SVG-->OM1) in [**2197**]
transfered from OSH with ? prosthetic aortic valve MRSA
endocarditis. Pt initially presented to OSH on [**2200-1-7**] with low
grade fevers, N/V, diarrhea. Had recent admission for PNA at
same hospital. Pt had persistent fevers and blood cxs grew high
grade GPC found to be MRSA. At this time pt also had plt drop
(222-->86), creat 1.9->2.9 and hct drop. Felt pt had DIC
although per OSH records no schistocytes on smear. However,
counts recovered prior to transfer. Pt underwent TEE at OSH
which showed veg on prosthetic valve, no abscess. Pt transfered
to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for further management. During this time pt initially
treated with Vanc/ CTX,  changed to vanc/gent after TEE on [**1-14**].
Of note, pt reports multiple tooth extractions prior to
admission.  He underwent TEE [**2200-1-22**] which showed prosthetic
valve thickening but no vegetation.  He is followed by
Infectious diseases.  Bl cx drawn on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] are
pending.  He was transferred to medicine service to undergo w/u
of source of bacteremia as Cardiac surgery did not feel valve
replacment indicated given the negative TEE.

.
pCXR [**1-20**]: A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2200-1-20**] and
is compared with the prior study of [**2197-10-5**]. The heart is not
enlarged. There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery. There
appear to be bilateral pleural effusions. There is haziness of
the pulmonary vasculature and especially in the perihilar areas
and the findings likely represent failure
.
Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2200-1-22**]:
The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
or right
atrium/atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy  with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch and descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The right coronary cusp of the prosthetic
aortic valve appears thickened without a definite vegetation. A
small paravalvular aortic valve leak is present near the
junction of the right and left coronary cusps. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. Trace (physiologic) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass
is seen on the mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valves. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
TEE [**2200-1-31**]: IMPRESSION: Small vegetation on right coronary
leaflet of bioprosthetic aortic  valve. Mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
.
CXR: AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The patient is status post
median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft. The cardiac
silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and
stable. There are dense intramural aortic calcifications. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax.
Small, stable pleural effusions are again noted, with bibasilar
linear and patchy atelectasis. The surrounding soft tissue and
osseous structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in small bilateral
pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25062**] is a 78 y/o M with h/o DM, CRI, HTN s/p AVR (tissue)
and 2 vessel CABG (LIMA--> LAD, SVG-->OM1) in [**2197**] who presented
to OSH with fevers, n/v/d. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with a
question of prosthetic aortic valve MRSA endocarditis after
having had several tooth extractions prior to admission. He had
had a recent admission at this OSH for PNA. Since then, he had
persistent fevers, and blood cultures revealed MRSA. At that
time pt also had plt drop (222-->86), creat 1.9->2.9 and hct
drop and there was concern for DIC however blood counts
recovered before transfer. TEE at OSH showed vegetations on the
prosthetic valve and he was treated with Vancomycin and
ceftriaxone, then vanc/gent which was started on [**1-14**]. Pt
transfered to CT [**Doctor First Name **] service and repeat TEE performed which was
negative for vegatiation. Pt was transfered to the medicine
service for further management.
.
On the medicine service, he had an MI, diagnosed when he had CP,
SOB, and diaphoresis on the morning of [**2200-1-23**]. EKG showed
dynamic ST/TWI in II, III, aVL, V3-V6 and he had positive CEs.
He had a cath which showed RCA patent, occluded LM, LAD, LCx.
OM1 occluded and OM2 perfused via SVG. He had a bare metal stent
placed to the LCX.
.
The following morning he became acutely confused after receiving
2.5mg of seroquel and 0.25 mg ativan x2. A stat head CT was
negative. He was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring and
further care. In the CCU, ortho was consulted, who felt his hip
was highly unlikely to be the source of his infection. ID
continued to follow the patient throughout his admission. He had
an episode of tachypnea, for which he received Lasix.
.
The TEE was repeated on [**1-31**] given persistent positive blood
cultures and revealed aortic valvular vegetation. Vancomycin was
continued. CT surgical consultation obtained regarding valve
replacement and significant discussion with family re. risks and
benefits of the operation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with CT surgery
re-evaluated the patient and decided long term IV antibiotics
would be the best approach for positive outcome at this time.

# [**Name (NI) **] Pt with multiple blood cultures with MRSA at [**Hospital1 **], which meets criteria for endocarditis (1 major, 3
minor) but did not have clear vegetation on TEE in this hospital
initially.  Started on Vanco/Gent (renally dosed).  Pt also has
