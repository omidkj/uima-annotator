Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Sustained VT and unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intracardiac Defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
52M with history hypertension, narcotics dependence and gastric
bypass presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with several days of nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. There he was given zofran for nausea
after which became unresponsive, noted to be in polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia. He was shocked and loaded on amiodarone
and then started on amiodarone drip 1mg/min and trasnferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival he was alert, oriented. Then had episode of VT
and became unresponsive shocked with 200J, got another 150 amio
gtt and then was changed to lidocaine drip 3mg/min, repleted K
40IV and 40 PO. Still having occasional 8-10 beat runs of VT in
the ED. Patient is also complaining of [**7-12**] intermittent chest
pain he describes as "irritating" localized to the area around
the pacer pads. He received morphine, toradol and rectal aspirin
in the ED. He has no recollection of the events surrounding his
episodes.

He denies any recent or remote episodes of chest pain but does
endorse some dyspnea on exertion while climbing stairs.

He does have a history of narcotic dependence and was recently
on dilaudid 16mg q4h for pain following a complicated right knee
replacement. He reports that he has since weaned himself down to
3-4mg PO q4h. He also reports that he recently stopped taking
his enoxaprin for DVT ppx 3 days ago.

Cardiac cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominants system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
was large
in caliber, with minimal luminal irregularities.  The LAD was
mildly
calcified, with diffuse mild luminal irregularities.   A large
diagonal
branch with luminal irregularities was noted.  The distal LAD
wraps
slighter aorund the apex, with slow flow consistent with
microvascular
dysfunction.  The LCx was large in caliber, with dlow flow
consistent
with microvascular dysfunction.  It supplies a large OM2, LPL,
and
modest LPDA.  A large caliber, patent ramus was noted.  The RCA
supplyinga modest caliber RPDA and several RV branches was
demonstrated.
Proximal to mid difuse diease with serial 75% stenoses with TIMI
2 slow
flow (similar to LAD and LCx) demonstrated.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left
ventricular
filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 12 mmHg.  There was mild
systemic
hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 140/93 mmHg
(mean of 113
mmHg.)
3.  Limited femoral angiography demonstrated mild profunda
plaquing iwht
arteriotomy stie at the SFA/PF bifurcation.  Closure device not
attempted.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery diease, but diffuse slow flow
consistent iwth diffuse microvascular dysfunction.
2. In the absence of symptoms and sentiment that VT was not
ischemia
induced, no intervention performed at this time, with plan for
further
evaluation of ischemia.
3. Normal LV diastolic function.
4.  Mild systemic hypertension.
.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis more prominent inferior wall
severe hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot
exclude multivessel CAD). Dilated thoracic aorta. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2156-4-22**], the findings are new.
.
Nuclear stress test:
No ischemic ECG changes noted and no anginal type symptoms
reported with Persantine infusion. Appropriate hemodynamic
response.
Nuclear report below:

1. Probably normal myocardial perfusion. Inferior wall defect
most consistent with attenuation.

2. Increased left ventricular cavity size. Moderate systolic
dysfunction with global hypokinesis.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old man with a history of gastric bypass, narcotics
dependence, and recent knee replacement who became unresponsive
in outside hospital's Emergency Department secondary to
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia following administration of
zofran for nausea and vomiting.
.
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: Possible etiologies considered were
ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, medication effects,
hypoxia, and metabolic causes. An Echo revealed global
hypokinesis. Although catheterization revealed a narrowing of
the RCA, nuclear stress test did not show any reversible or
nonreversible defects to suggest ischemia or infarction. The
[**Hospital 228**] medical records, recent and remote past EKGs, and
clinical presentation were reviewed, and it was concluded that
the patient's hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia in the setting of two
QT-prolonging medications contributed to development of VT. All
QT-prolonging medications were held, and his electrolytes were
repleted. Given the risk that the patient's ventricular
tachycardia might return, an ICD was placed. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. At the time of discharge, the
patient still required two days of antibiotics to complete his
course.
.
# ACUTE SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION
According to Echo, the patient's EF was 38% with global
hypokinesis. The patient showed no evidence of fluid overload
and seemed euvolemic upon discharge.
The patient was started on 5 mg lisinopril.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
The patient's catheterization showed 80% RCA lesion, and the
stress test showed inferior small reversible defect attributed
to attenuation. No plans for intervention. The patient will
continue on a beta-blocker and aspirin and be started on a
statin.
.
# NARCOTICS DEPENDENCE/CHRONIC PAIN: The patient has a history
of significan
