Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

noninvasive positive pressure ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98193**] is a 68 yo male with h/o of MS, depression, HTN,
neurogenic bladder s/p multiple UTIs who presents after an
episode of hypoxia. Pt was lethargic and not answering questions
so hx was obtained from notes. Per NH notes pt had increasing
dyspnea for several days and was found to have a LLL PNA three
days ago. He had been treated with Rocephin (1gm IM x 3 doses)
for 3 days. Today at the nursing home his O2 sats dropped to 79%
on 2L NC (baseline on 2L NC) and increased to 86-88% on 5L NC
02. He was noted to be very congested and received nebs. At that
time his SBPs were noted to be in the upper 70s to 80s with HR
in the 90s and his temperature was 98. He was also more
lethargic than usual. At baseline he answers questions promptly
but was very slow to respond this morning. EMS was called and he
was brought to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ER his rectal temperature was 100.1. He was given flagyl,
levaquin, vancomycin and decadron 10 mg. His BP was initially
86/44 with a HR of 51 and improved to 102/48 after 2L of NS. His
sats were up to 100% on a NRB. He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] his SBPs were in the low 100s and HR in
the 70s. Sats continued to be 100% on NRB. He denied chest pain,
SOB, abd pain or diarrhea. ABG was checked and was
7.25/63/107/29. His initial DNR/DNI status was confirmed with
his HCP, his [**Name2 (NI) 802**], but it was agreed he could start NIPPV. He
was started on CPAP of [**5-9**].

Past Medical History:
1. Progressive, relapsing, multiple sclerosis for the last 30
years. The patient is treated with monthly steroids, Solu-Medrol

and Avonex.
2. Prostate cancer status post brachytherapy.
3. Depression with multiple admissions in the past and history
of overdose of isopropyl alcohol.
4. Neurogenic bladder with recurrent urinary tract infections.
The patient has a suprapubic foley.
5. History of multiple UTIs. MRSA urine infection in [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2130**], also history of pansensitive Klebsiella and e.coli.
History of Pseudomonas UTI sensitive to Zosyn and enterococcal
UTI sensitive to vancomycin in [**2129**]. Both of the [**2129**] urine
cultures were resistant to levofloxacin.
6. History of right elbow bursitis with MRSA.
7. Hypertension.
8. Chronic lower back pain with cervical and lumbar spinal
stenosis.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. Impotence with penile prosthesis.
11. Chronic polyps.
12. History of peptic ulcer disease with upper GI bleed in the
setting of chronic NSAIDs use.
13. History of alcohol abuse with history of generalized tonic
clonic seizures in the setting of alcohol (see neuro note
written in [**2130-3-6**]).
14. Coagulase negative staphylococcal bacteremia in [**5-8**].
15. Pemphigus

accuchek 143
gen: knows his full name.  moves his hands to command.  seems to
answer questions.  says his age is 67 (he's 68.)
HEENT: EOM seem intact on my limited testing.  pupils react to
light bilaterally. anicteric.
chest: on right side, sounds clear except for scattered exp
wheeze.  i could not hear breath sounds on left side anteriorly.
heart: seemed slightly fast with occasional ectopic beat.  I
didn't notice a murmur on a very limited heart exam.
abd: BS+.  very obese. nontender.  guiac negative.
ext: contracted LE and UE.  He does feel me touch his toes and
when I pinch his toes, he does involuntarily contract his feet.
neuro: awake, alert.  answers some questions.  knows his full
name.  when I tell him he looks like he is 47 (he is 68), he
tells me that I look young, too.  pupils react bilaterally.
eyebrows up symmetric. handgrip is [**3-9**] on RIGHT and on [**4-9**] on

AP CHEST:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting position demonstrates now a diffuse density overlying
the left lower lung field and obliterating the diaphragmatic
contour. The left lateral pleural sinus appears somewhat
blunted. On the right side, the pulmonary lung fields
demonstrate normal vasculature without evidence of CHF and the
right lateral pleural sinus is free. The heart may be mildly
enlarged and the thoracic aorta is moderately widened and
elongated but not excessive for age.
Available for comparison are multiple previous chest
examinations from [**2130**] and [**2129**]. The now present density in the
left lung base did not exist on previous examinations.
IMPRESSION: Portable AP chest view demonstrates parenchymal
infiltrate in left lower lobe area with possible pleural
reaction. No evidence of CHF.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: This examination is limited by patient motion. There
is no evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally
midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci,
which are stable since the prior exam and may be secondary to
age-related involutional change. Also, stable periventricular
white matter hypodensity, which may be secondary to chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. The surrounding osseous
structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute intracranial abnormality
including hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
KUB
FINDINGS: Two supine radiographs are reviewed. Evaluation is
limited secondary to body habitus. Multiple air-filled bowel
loops are identified that are presumed large bowel. There is no
definite evidence for dilated small bowel loops. Note o
