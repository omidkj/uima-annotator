2. Interval development of mild-to-moderate left pleural
effusion.
3. Unchanged location of migrated stent of left mainstem
bronchus within the left lower lobe bronchus.
4. Complete collapse of the left mainstem bronchus in

ambulatory tol pos denies shortness of breath cough or
secrtions. On [**2181-9-24**] Flexible bronchoscopy and airway
inspection performed. Bronchoscopy -Subglottic stenosis
secondary to recent intubation and
    rigid bronchoscopy. Metal stent in proper place in the left
main-stem
    bronchus, with patent distal airways and minimal secretions.

The patient was observed overnight with out complications.  Plan
to re-evaluate her
airways in 2 weeks to ensure proper healing of her subglottic
