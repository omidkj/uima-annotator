Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, Diarrhea, elevated INR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
56 y/o female with PMHx significant for metastatic pancreatic
cancer who presents with elevated INR of 10 and fatigue. Patient
states that initially she has been having diarrhea for the past
5 weeks, non-bloody. Within the last week her diarrhea has
resolved however now she has nausea and vomiting, constipation
and decreased appetite. Her husband at home has also noticed
that her cellulitis at her left buttock region has gotten worse.
She went to [**Hospital3 4298**] ED intially where she was found to
have an INR of 5. She was transferred to our ED where repeat
coags showed a PT 78/PTT 39/INR 10. She did not have any obvious
active bleeding. Patient denies any blood per rectum, coughing
up any blood, or nosebleeds. In the ED patient also found to
have K of 2.3. She was given 1U PRBC, KCL, levofloxacin x1,
vitamin K, 1 unit of FFP and diluadid. She was intially admitted
to the floor, however on arrival to the floor nurses felt she
was too unstable for the floor so transferred her to the ICU
although her VS were stable.
.
In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was given FFP with correction of her INR.
However she subsequently developed respiratory distress
secondary to pulmonary edema likely due to volume overload and
required brief intubation. she was diuresed with iv lasix. she
also had bronch with bal. she was also treated for pneumonia
with vanco-zosyn-azithyromycin which was subsequently narrowed
down to levofloxacin alone. pt's respiratory status improved
rapidly and was extubated yesterday. since then she has required
minimal oxygen. she was also noted to have an enterococcus uti
which was sensitive to vanco and she was continued on that. pt
has a history of spinal myoclonus and had mri of spine per neuro
rec. she has not had any further recurrences. she continues to
have some diarrhoe and c diff was sent. Furthermore she had some
pre-renal azotemia for which she was rehydrated with
normalisation of her renal function.

Past Medical History:

breast, scalp, calvarium, thoracic and lumbar vertebra, s/p XRT
x 2 to the low back and once to the upper back. S/P chemo 5FU,
experimental drug, thalidomide (stopped due to neuropathy), with
Temodar and avastin (two cycles most recently [**2172-4-13**]).

ECG [**3-15**]: Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2173-1-10**] the
rate is somewhat faster. T waves are now flattened to slightly
inverted in leads I, III, aVF and leads V4-V6. The abnormalities
are non-specific.
.
Chest Xray [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: Interval significant progression of
bilateral mid- and lower lung opacities suggestive of interval
fluid overload or development of ARDS. Aspiration is a less
likely differential consideration.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION:
.
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
.
2. Progression of metastatic disease within the lungs and liver.
Questionable hemmorhagic metastasis noted within the liver may
explain mild Hct drop. Scattered areas of ill- defined patchy
opacities within the lung parenchyma. Differential included
infectious or inflammatory etiologies with areas of hemorrhage
from early metastatic lesions felt unlikely, but not completely
excluded. This can be followed up with subsequent imaging if
change in clinical management will occur.
.
3. Stable appearance of diffuse osseous metastatic disease.
.
MRI C/T/L spine [**3-17**]:
 L-spine: Mild interval improvement in the epidural extent and
spinal canal stenosis produced by expansile bony metastases in
the L2 and L3 verterbal bodies since [**2172-12-19**]. The epidural
component of an expansile metastasis in the L5 vertebral body is
also decreased - there is no spinal canal stenosis at this
level.
 T-spine: Diffuse osseous metastases are again noted. While no
axial images were acquired, there is epidural disease in the
paracentral regions bilaterally posterior to the T10 vertebral
body, causing mild spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral paracentral
epidural disease posterior to the T11 vertebral body is more
prominent on the right.
 C-spine: Interval progression of disease from most recent MR C
spine dated [**2173-5-15**]. Multiple bony metastases have increased in
size and number. There is epidural extension of disease with
mild spinal canal stenosis posterior to C4 and moderate stenosis
posterior to C6. Paraspinal disease cases neural foraminal
narrowing at multiple levels and encases the right verterbal
artery from C3-4.
.
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Improved bilateral diffuse air space
opacity likely representing pulmonary edema. Doubt focal
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 y/o female with PMHx of metastatic pancreatic cancer who
presents with fatigue, n/v, and elevated INR admitted to ICU for
close monitoring, transferred to the floor, then returned to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with mental status changes which resolved with intravenous
hydration, empiric antibiotic coverage.

## Respiratory failure. This was most likely secondary to volume
overload exacerbated by pneumonia. The patient was effectively
diuresed in addition to being treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics eventually tailored appropriately to a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
according to culture data.
- has done well since extubation. continued to wean off o2.
- levofloxacin was given for full 10-day course empirically for
pneumonia.
.
## Enterococcus UTI: identified vanc-sensitive Enterococcus in
urine
- completed vanco for a full 7 day course.
.
## Diarrhea:
- c diff pending.
.
## Spinal myoclonus: pt had RLE jerking movements on [**3-15**]. Neuro
was consulted. they had recommended MRI whole spine which was
done. Patient has had recurrence of her muscle spasms overnight
and this morning.
