History of Present Illness:
NOTE: This discharge summary should be signed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**], who was the attending of record; however, POE lists the
only option as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104514**].

83 yo f with PMH significant for CAD, DVT, CHF, presenting with
witnessed asystolic arrest in the field to the ED. Earlier in
the day, she went with her husband to his PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 104515**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is also her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was reportedly feeling well
at that time around 10 AM. In the taxi back to the apartment,
she began to feel diaphortic and unwell. She was helped up to
her apt and then at that time, her husband called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He
then tried to take her BP and was unable. He called EMS at
10:50. They arrived at 11:00 and found the patient apneic,
pulseless, and started CPR. After several minutes, she was
taking agonal breaths and had weak carotid pulses. Vomit was
seen in her mouth. Initial GCS was 3. She was intubated at 11:09
and was still pulseless. At 11;27, she had an initial rhythm of
asystole, which resolved to afib. At 11:28, she had her first
recorded blood pressure. Therefore estimated time pulseless was
40 minutes.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 50, BP 104/54, 16, 99%,
intubated. She then became hypotensive and was started on wide
open levophed and dopamine. She was given 5L NS with no urine
output. She was given ASA 600 PR, dopamine, levophed,
vancomycin, levofloxain 500, flagyl, ativan, dilantin, calcium
chloride. Bedside echo was done which was "normal". Cards was
consulted and felt that even if this was a cardiac issue, there
would be no intervention at this time because of her alarming
neuro exam which was documented as pupils fixed and nonreactive.

.
ED was concerned for PE with acute onset SOB, hypotension, and
h/o
DVT. Discussion of lytics, but pt sent for CTA which did not
show PE. CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ? air

bronchograms. Head CT negative

Initial CXR:
Right mid lung zone opacity which could represent either
asymmetric pulmonary edema versus consolidation. Probable skin
fold on right but re-evaluate with follow up film to rule out
tiny pneumothorax.

Initial Head CT:
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
of normally midline structures, interval development of a major
or minor vascular territorial infarction. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are normal aside from what is likely a mild
degree of bifrontal chronic microvascular infarction within the
periventricular white matter. This abnormality, as well, is
stable since the prior study.

Initial Chest CTA/ Abdomen/Pelvis CT:
1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism. No
evidence of
aortic dissection or aneurysm.
2. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, slightly improved
compared to
[**2141-12-14**].
3. The nasogastric tube should be advanced further into the
stomach.
4. Peripancreatic fat stranding, which is concerning for
pancreatitis.
Correlation with pancreatic enzymes is suggested.
5. Acute left lateral rib fracture.

[**2142-3-13**] CXR:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Improving pulmonary edema.
3. Stable small left effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The etiology of Mrs.[**Known lastname 104516**] asystolic arrest and resultant
anoxic brain injury remained unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 15110**] to the rapid onset and
prodrome of diaphoresis and SOB, it was most likely to have been
cardiogenic in nature. After initial evaluation and
stabilization in the ICU, spoke with Mrs.[**Name (NI) 104516**] husband
about the gravity of the situation, explaining that due to her
physical findings, serious anoxic brain injury was likely.
Placed on dilantin, due to extensive myoclonic activity. Valium
was also used prn when thought to be experiencing greater
myoclonic and possible seizure activity. Also placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics for elevated wbc count and possible PNA on
CXR. Initially required dopamine and norepinephrine for
maintenance of MAP>65; these were weaned off over the first
12-24 hours. Neurology was consulted, who agreed with primary
team's findings, and recommended the addition of valproic acid
for myoclonus and seizure prophylaxis. Multiple discussions were
held with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his daughter regarding the grave
nature of Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 104516**] condition. They requested that
aggressive treatment be maintained until her second daughter
could fly in from [**Name (NI) 18317**]. This was done, and her clinical
situation continued to decline, with worsening renal and hepatic
function, along with difficulty in finding a ventilatory
strategy that provided adequate oxygenation without very high
pressures, though s
