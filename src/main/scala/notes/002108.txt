HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time the patient was admitted to

course was remarkable for a postoperative ileus. This was
managed with an NG tube decompression and NPO status.  This

postoperative day 1 for volume overload.  Urology consult was
called secondary to penile and scrotal swelling which caused
multiple small ulcers which were well healed at the time of

drop in hematocrit requiring a take back for evacuation of
hematoma on [**2145-4-30**] and [**2145-5-12**].  At this time, the

difficult to extubate.  The patient was extubated and failed
this trial and had to be reintubated.

The patient had another postoperative ileus after the third

ileus resolved and the patient's TPN was weaned and diet was
advanced without problems.  The patient continued to require
hemodialysis throughout the hospital course.  Physical
therapy and occupational therapy were working with the

signs, doing clinically well.  The patient was finishing up
treatment with Zosyn for postoperative pneumonia and switched
to Augmentin on discharge for 10 days.  As mentioned upon
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
tolerating regular diet and voiding without problems. The
patient was ambulating with a walker and help with physical
therapy without problems as well.  The patient's white count
was 16 and stable. Hematocrit was 29.4 and stable.  Platelets
were 392 and stable. Potassium was 34 and BUN 45 and

drainage from the wound site and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain  in
place draining minimal serosanguinous fluid.  Otherwise
