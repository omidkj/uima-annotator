Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The reason for admission is as
follows.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and aortic
stenosis who was [**Hospital 487**] Hospital on [**1-11**] complaining
of chest pain substernal in nature.  He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which showed coronary artery disease with
blockages in the posterior descending artery, PDL, total
right coronary artery, LAV, first diagonal, second diagonal,
total [**Last Name (LF) 11641**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ejection fraction of 40%.  The patient had an
echocardiogram which showed aortic stenosis.

He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further treatment of his cardiac disease.  He was
admitted to the Cardiology Service at the [**Hospital1 346**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (His past medical history is)
 1.  Diabetes.
 2.  Aortic stenosis.
 3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 4.  Chronic abdominal pain.
 5.  Supraventricular tachycardia.
 6.  Asbestosis.
 7.  Pleural plaques.
 8.  Right bundle-branch block.
 9.  Left atrial fibrillation.
10.  Coronary artery disease.
11.  Depression.
12.  Anxiety; no clear [**Hospital1 **] diagnosis.
13.  Hypotension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were Lopressor,
nitroglycerin, Prinivil, Zyprexa, Lipitor, Serzone,
Glucotrol-XL 5 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat with pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  No jugular venous distention or bruits.  Chest
revealed fine crackles.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
systolic [**4-13**] cardiac murmur.  The abdomen revealed positive
bowel sounds, transmitted murmur.  Groin revealed there was
no hematoma or bruits.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course was as follows.  The
patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
on [**2101-1-14**] and underwent a cardiac catheterization
which showed left main coronary artery was normal, left
anterior descending artery with 60% middle subtotal distal
and apex with diffuse first diagonal.  Left circumflex,
occluded [**Year (4 digits) 11641**], total first obtuse marginal, 50% distal
circumflex, long severe, 90% third obtuse marginal, right
coronary artery with long 90% middle, 95% distal, 95%
proximal posterior descending artery and PLVBR.  The patient
also had critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of
approximately 0.67 cm2.

The patient was then consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
Cardiothoracic Surgery.  The patient was seen in consultation
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25067**].  The patient was then consented for
cardiac surgery.

On [**2101-1-18**], the patient was taken to the operating
room where a coronary artery bypass graft surgery times three
with left internal mammary artery to the [**Year (4 digits) 11641**], saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal, left anterior descending
artery, and an aortic valve replacement using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] #23.
Please refer to cardiac surgical Operative Note for full
details of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit in satisfactory and hemodynamically stable
condition.

In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient continued to
do well; however, on [**2101-1-19**], the patient had some
right-sided weakness.  He was seen by Neurology who felt the
patient, after looking at a CAT scan, had a large left
cerebrovascular accident of the middle cerebral artery
region.  They felt it was okay to anticoagulate the patient.
The patient was anticoagulated.

Postoperatively, the patient was doing well.  He still
remained intubated though.  Hemodynamics were good.  The
patient was seen by Physical Therapy because of his
cerebrovascular accident.  He was receiving bedside physical
therapy to help him maintain his mobility.  Neurologically
followed him postoperatively.  He continued to do well.
Because of his inability to wean off the ventilator, the
patient underwent a bedside tracheostomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.  This was done on
[**2101-1-25**].  On [**2101-1-25**], the patient also
had a bronchoscopy for his percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placement which showed some mucous plugging.
From there, the patient continued to do well.  He was
continued on his ventilatory.  He was seen by the nutritional
support services.

At this point, placement to rehabilitation was considered as
the patient was going to be a long-term ventilator wean and
he would obviously need rehabilitation for his
cerebrovascular accident.  The family was informed of all of
this.  The family agreed that this would be the best plan.

The patient was then transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit Service because of his long-term care needs.  He
had a right peripherally inserted central catheter line
placed for intravenous access; and, at this point, he was
then slowly starting to be weaned from his ventilator, and
his hemodynamic medications.

Neurology saw him and felt that (you know) the fact on
[**2101-2-6**] he had global aphasia and right hemiplegia,
and felt his deficit was going to be severe, and there was
some chance for any more recovery, but his deficits would
most likely be what they were; and they signed off.

At this point, the patient was then kept in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  He continued to do well.  He was seen
by Speech and Swallow and Physical Therapy, and he was just
awaiting placement.

On [**2101-2-10**], the patient was then transferred to the
rehabilitation hospital (which was [**Hospital1 **]) via ambulance.
He had a tracheostomy, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  He still had (you know) right hemiplegia and
right-sided deficits, but his cardiac status was good.  His
valve was crisp and working well.  He had no chest pain.  His
electrocardiogram was stable.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery with
aortic valve replacement.
