Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**2152-8-7**].
Intubation on [**2152-8-7**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109603**] is a 48 yo male with a h/o schizophrenia and CAD who
had a witnessed cardiac arrest at [**Company **].  Per report, AED
advised shockable rhythm x 2.  Patient vomited after the first
shock.  He was down for approximately 35 minute prior to arrival
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was agitated, unable to provide
name, with noted to have son[**Name (NI) 7884**] respirations.  Patient was
unable to provide any additional history.  ABG 6.96/92/114. EKG
was reported as NSR with HR [**Street Address(2) 109604**] elevations in the inferior
leads with ST depressions in V2-V3, and code STEMI was called.
He was intubated due to hypoxia, SpO2.  Patient had asystolic
arrest and was given epi 1 mg and atropine 1 mg.  He was
subsequently shocked x 2 for vfib.  Amiodarone 150 mg IV and
lidocaine 100 mg IV were given. Patient was transported to the
cath lab with delay due to VT arrest in ED.  Prior to cath lab,
patient received Plavix 600 mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg PO, and was
started on a heparin gtt.
.
In the cath lab he was found to have 3V disease. No intervention
was performed.  Course was complicated by perforation of left
superficial femoral artery, and patient was taken directly to OR
for repair by Vascular Surgery.  Cardiac Surgery was also
consulted to evaluate for CABG.
.
On review of symptoms, patient has no prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Per patient's friend, patient had complained of intermittent
chest pain in recent months.  A complete cardiac review of
systems was not able to be performed as patient was intubated
and sedated.

EKG at presentation to ED revealed sinus tachycardia with IVCD,
HR 125, normal axis and normal intervals.  ST elevations in II,
III, AvF.  ST depressions in V3-V6.
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: sinus rhythm with occ. PVC's, HR 100

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**1-/2144**] demonstrated:
There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and mild
left
atrial enlargement.  The cardiac valves are structurally normal.
 There is no major valvular regurgitation.  Contractile function
of the right ventricle and left ventricle is normal.  The left
ventricular ejection fraction 60-70%.  No atrial septal defect,
ventricular septal defect, or pericardial effusion seen on
two-dimensional or color-flow imaging.
IMPRESSION.  No structural evidence of major right ventricular
pressure overload state.

DISCHARGE LABS:
Patient passed away on [**2152-8-10**]


Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo male with known CAD s/p cardiac arrest followed by
multiple resuscitations with AED and cardiac cathterization
complicated by performation of left superficial artery, who was
transferred to CCU on IABP 1:1.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient was found down at [**Company **].
He was shocked once at the store and then was brought emergently
to [**Hospital1 18**].  A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed
extensive three-vessel disease.  The patient's right superficial
femoral artery was perforated during this procedure.  He was
found to have an ejection fraction of [**10-4**]% and thus had an
aortic balloon pump placed in the catheterization lab.  He was
maintained on levophed.  Cardiac Surgery was consulted for
potential CABG, and the patient was continued on his [**Date Range **],
Plavix, high-dose statin, and heparin gtt.  The patient's family
was [**Name (NI) 653**], and they asserted that the patient would not have
wanted any heroic measures to be taken.  He was made CMO shortly
thereafter and passed away in the CCU on [**2152-8-10**].
