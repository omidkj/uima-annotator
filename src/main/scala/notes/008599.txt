Service:  NSU


ADDENDUM:  This is the continuation of a Discharge Summary
that was started earlier.

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  On [**2162-3-12**] she
underwent both tracheostomy and placement of a PEG tube.  She
ended up being evaluated by Neurology for her mental status
examination that was decreased in ability when compared to
her pre hospital stay.  Recommendations included an EEG to
rule out ongoing seizure and correction of thyroid
abnormalities which could cause a fluctuation of mental
status.  She was started on Synthroid, and TSH and free T4
were followed.  She ended up having her Synthroid increased.
EEG results did show the patient had findings that may
indicate an increased risk for seizure activity but clear
epileptiform discharges were not seen.

On [**3-17**]  her ventricular drain was removed and a
lumbar drain was inserted at its place with the goal of 10 to
15 cc of drainage per hour.  On [**3-18**] the patient ended
up having a Passy-Muir valve placed.  Her mental status exam
waxed and waned.  She was sometimes following commands and
other times not.  She did move extremities spontaneously.
She was seen by a Wound Care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 60140**] on her
buttocks.  On [**3-23**] the lumbar drain output was
decreased to 5 cc per hour.  On [**2162-3-24**] she ended
up spiking a temperature to 102.4 rectally and was pan-
cultured.  A chest x-ray did show right interstitial
opacities and a small right pleural effusion.

She was seen by Infectious Disease who recommended Zosyn for
her pneumonia.  They also recommended to change her Foley.
She did have a urinalysis culture that was not consistent
with colonization, and therefore not felt to be a UTI.  A
sputum culture did end up growing Pseudomonas and Infectious
Disease recommended double coverage with ciprofloxacin as
well as the Zosyn.  As part of her pneumonia workup she had a
CT of the chest that did show a right upper lobe lesion and
recommended a repeat CT which was done one week later without
any change in appearance.  After consultation with Pulmonary
it was recommended that this could be infection related and
she should continue on her full course of antibiotics.  After
that time she could be re-imaged, and if the appearance is
unchanged she may need a needle biopsy at that point as it
was in a location that did not lend itself to bronchoscopy.

On [**2162-3-31**] the patient was brought to the Operating
Room where under general anesthesia she underwent placement
of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Postoperatively, she was monitored in the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit for an appropriate amount of time and then was
returned to the floor.  She was seen by Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy throughout this time.  She was also seen
by Orthopedics on [**3-31**] for a question of hardware that was
palpable on the right distal femur.  X-rays did confirm that
the plate was shifted and there was evidence of a broken
screw.  However, it was recommended that if there was no skin
[**Month (only) 60140**] there was no further treatment recommended at this
time.

Endocrine was also consulted in regards to an enlarged
thyroid that was seen on the previously mentioned chest CT.
An ultrasound was recommended; however, due to her
tracheostomy this was unable to be performed.  Endocrine felt
that she most likely had a benign goiter but did recommend an
ultrasound of the thyroid after the tracheostomy was out.
They also recommended following the TSH with the goal being
0.5.  If the thyroid ultrasound showed any abnormalities she
would at that time need to follow up with Endocrinology.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Hydrocephalus.
3. Aspiration pneumonia.
4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Seizures.
6. Status post hardware placement in right femur.
7. Anemia.

   discontinued on [**4-11**] after a total of 14 days).
2. Morphine 1 mg to 2 mg IV q.4.h. as needed (for pain).
3. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice per day.
