CXR showed possible bibasilar opacities. CTA (prelim) was
suboptimal but did not show central or subsegmental PE but did
show bibasilar opacities L>R. Given levoflox 750 mg IV, morphine
IV, zofran IV, NS 1L. Vital signs prior to transfer to the

STUDIES:
[**2178-6-11**] CXR -  Bibasilar atelectasis, pneumonia, or acute chest
syndrome due to sickle cell anemia.

[**2178-6-11**] CTA Chest -
1. No central PE and probably no subsegmental PE.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right is consistent
with acute
chest syndrome in the appropriate clinical context.
3. The visualized spleen is small consistent with
autosplenectomy of sickle cell disease.

[**2178-6-15**] CXR - Slight interval improvement of left lower lung
consolidation and effusion as well as improved aeration of right
lower lung.
