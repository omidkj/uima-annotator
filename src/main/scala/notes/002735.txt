Pertinent Results:
[**2155-12-15**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. with depressed free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**12-17**] CTA Aorta/Bifem/Iliac: 1. 3-cm area of occlusion in the
right common femoral artery just distal to the inguinal
ligament. There is rapid reconstitution. Otherwise patent
vasculature with atherosclerotic areas as desribed above. 2.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis. 3. Prominent bilateral ureters with enlarged
prostate suggest bladder outlet obstruction.
[**12-19**] CXR: Moderate edema, left effusion and retrocardiac
atelectasis, all slightly increased from prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o male admitted to MWMC with mid-sternal chest pain - taken
to cath lab at MWMC for urgent cath which revealed 3 vessel
disease. He did experience ongoing pain in the cath lab and had
IABP placed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergency CABG.  On
[**2155-12-10**] he underwent an emergent coronary artery bypass
grafting x 4 with the left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to
the right coronary artery, ramus intermedius artery and the
diagonal artery. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  IABP was pulled
on post operative day 1 and the patient initially was noted not
have a dopplerable PT or DP pulse but PT pulse did return as
dopplerable signal. [**Date Range **] surgery was consulted on POD 7 when
he noted sensory differences to lower extremities.  At this time
he still had an absent Right DP and monophasic PT signals with
Right CFA occlusion likely from thrombus secondary to
intra-aortic balloon pump. The leg did not look threatened as pt
was able to ambulate, move all toes and had no ischemic pain.
Symptoms were bilateral and only sensory. He was taken to the
operating room for a femoral thrombectomy and femoral
endarterectomy with the [**Date Range 1106**] surgery team.  He had a silver
dressing placed intra op and this was to be removed on Sun
[**12-21**].  He does not need any further anticoagulation per the
[**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery team. POD 1 the patient was extubated after the
balloon pump was pulled.  He was alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He did develop pulmonary edema and
required BIPAP after extubation.  He was placed on Milrinone x 2
days, was taken off and dropped his mixed venous saturations and
was put back on for Milrinone x 2 days with a slow wean. The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on
no inotropic or vasopressor support after several days on
Milrinone.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  His
Foley was removed and he had urinary retention with preoperative
symptoms and Flomax was started. Foley is to remain in place
until urology follow up. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 24591**]
Rehab at [**Location (un) 5176**] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
