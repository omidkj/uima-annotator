Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19193**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and IPH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for airway protection.


History of Present Illness:
84 YO right-handed female transferred from [**Hospital1 25991**]Hospital after presenting with witnessed GTC seizure per EMS.
Per the patient's daughters, the patient seemed fatigued with
decreased appetite but otherwise normal self until just prior to
presentation.  She appeared tired and did not eat much for
dinner but was well enough to read her mathematics journal and
do her usual routine before going to bed including brushing
teeth at 2:30 am.

At 6:30 on the morning of presentation, her daughter heard her
cough but no stirring.  The patient's daughter went to check on
her mother and found her in bed unable to get up.  She was awake
and was saying "[**Last Name (un) **], what is wrong with me?" in Hindi.

EMS was called and patient was brought to the [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital. Per EMS record, patient was noted to have GTC seizure
but the daughter denied any shaking, LOC, gaze deviation and
etc.  The family denies any prior history of seizure.

Upon presentation, the patient had head CT that demonstrated 2
discrete hemorrhages in L frontal and parietal lobes with no
mass effect. (Of note, the patient is known to have a left
frontal meningioma discovered on CT done in [**2135**]).  Patient was
intubated for airway protection at OSH after being given
paralytics including succinylcholine, vercuronium and sedatives
including Ativan 4mg and propofol.  Patient was also loaded with
Dilantin 1g prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where her primary
caregivers are.

Her history was otherwise unobtainable at presentation as she
was intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. hx of L breast tumor - ductal carcinoma in-situ s/p
excisional
bipsy in [**2131**] with 2 weeks of radiation.  Normal follow-up since
per family.
3. DM - HbA1C of 10.2 in [**3-18**] but not on meds
4. R cataract s/p laser therapy


Social History:
Lives at home with daughters - independent of all ADLs.
Mathematician and currently writing a book.  Daughters are [**Name2 (NI) 2759**]

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
T 97.2 BP 173/64  HR 72 RR 16 O2Sat 100% RA
Gen: Lying in bed, intubated and sedated.
CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear anteriorly
Abd: +BS, soft, nontender
Ext: No edema

Neurologic examination:
MSE: Intubated and sedated.  No spontaneous movements or opening
of eyes.  Does not follow commands.
CN: R pupil slightly irregular - both reactive (3->2mm).  Face
appears symmetric but no blinking to visual threats.  No OCR.
No
corneals bilaterally and no gag.
Motor: Normal tone.  Localizes to painful stimuli for both UEs
but does not withdraw LEs to noxious stim.  Some spontaneously L
foot movements.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Appears intact to noxious stim in all extremities.
Reflexes: 2s for biceps and [**Last Name (un) **] but none in LEs.  R toe
upgoing
and L mute.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was alert and oriented to
person, place and time. She was able to ambulate with
assistance. Exam was otherwise pertinent for bibasilar crackles
and mild non-pitting lower extremity swelling slightly worse on
the right as compared to the left.

Imaging:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2137-10-22**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Hemorrhagic lesion in the left parietal lobe, with
surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect. While no
definite underlying mass lesion is identified, differential
diagnosis includes a hemorrhagic metastatic focus versus
hemorrhage secondary to hypertension. Amyloid angiopathy is a
less likely consideration given the lack of other susceptibility
foci in the parenchyma. There is no evidence of a developmental
venous anomaly or other abnormal vessels, but an underlying
vascular malformation could also be considered.
2. Meningioma overlying the left frontal lobe, stable in
appearance and size compared to the prior CT from [**2135**], when
accounting for differences in technique.
3. Areas of white matter hyperintensity are a nonspecific
finding, but likely represent the sequela of chronic
microangiopathy given the patient's age.
.
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2137-10-25**]):
Enhancing heterogenous mass in right lower quadrant, may
represent a
conglomerate nodal mass, metastasis, less likely a primary
mesenteric neoplasm such as carcinoid.
2. Bilateral pulmonary opacities and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process, however
given high risk for malignancy,dedicated follow-up chest CT
within three months is recommended.
4. Endometrial fluid and right adnexal fullness, correlation
with ultrasound is recommended.
5. Indeterminant subcentimeter hepatic lesions, too small to
characterize.
6. Coarse pancreatic calcifications, with mild dilation of the
proximal
pancreatic duct measuring up to 3.5 mm, chronic pancreatitis or
calcified
mucinous neoplasm are potential considerations. [**Month (only) 116**] be further
evaluation with MRCP.
.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**2137-10-23**]):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due four
electrographic
seizures in the right occipital region consisting of rhythmic
sharp
waves and at times sharp and slow wave discharge for 1-2 minutes
in
duration without obvious clinical correlate on video. The
background
rhythm is also noted to be of low voltage. Would recommend
further
EEG monitoring given multiple subclinical seizures detected on
this
recording.
.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**Date range (3) 25995**]):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Background EEG showed a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but
encephalopathies may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features. No
electrographic seizures were recorded.
.
Chest X-ray ([**2137-10-26**]):
New left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation and ill-defined
opacities in
the remaining left lower lobe are new worrisome for infectious
process
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are
unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
.
Sputum cytology [**10-29**]: ATYPICAL. Atypical epithelial cells,
squamous cells, neutrophils, bacteria, and rare macrophages.
.
CXR [**10-29**]: Overall, the examination is unchanged. There is
stable moderate
cardiomegaly and stable mild pulmonary congestive pattern.
Retrocardiac
consolidation and ill-defined opacities in left lower lung are
unchanged.
There is a small left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged examination; mild pulmonary
congestion.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 YO woman with hypertension, NIDDM, meningioma, and left
ductal carcinoma in situ who presented to [**Hospital1 25991**]Hospital following a generalized tonic clonic seizure and was
found to have a new intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-10-22**] where she was initially
admitted to the neurology service.
.
At the time of admission, an MRI of the head was performed to
better characterize the lesion and identify contributory
structural abnormalities.  The study revealed an acute
hemorrhagic lesion in the left parietal lobe with surrounding
vasogenic edema and local mass effect.  While there were also
findings consistent with chronic microangiopathy, there was no
suggestion of amyloid angiopathy.  The hemorrhage was also
