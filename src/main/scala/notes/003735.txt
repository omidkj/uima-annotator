Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath -> admitted to the floor then transferred to
the ICU for hypotension and hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- nasotracheal intubation
- central line placement

History of Present Illness:
39 y.o. male with past history of morbid obesity, sleep apnea,
who was admitted originally with rapid weight gain, increasing
exertional dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. He was initially
admitted to the MICU for desaturations. While in the MICU,
patient subsequently became obtunded and was found to have
acidosis from hypercarbic respiratory failure and required
nasotracheal intubation. While evaluating the etiology of his
respiratory failure, echocardiogram revealed severe global
reduction in LV systolic function with EF of 20%. Given this
finding and above symptoms consistent with failure, PA catheter
was placed for tailored diuresis and patient was transferred to
CCU.
.
While in the CCU, patient was diuresed ~6 litres on furosemide
and dobutamine gtt. This did not improve his oxygenation.
Despite this, his hypoxia persisted even as FiO2 was increased
to 100% and PEEP increased to 20. Given lack of improvement in
oxygenation, shunt physiology was then evaluated with bubble
echocardiogram but this did not reveal right-to-left shunting.
Next, a trial of inhaled nitric oxide was attempted to relieve
his elevated pulmonary artery hypertension, in case this was
contributing to his hypoxia. Again, no improvement was noted and
this was discontinued. Finally, a diagnosis of ARDS was then
entertained and patient was placed on APRV mode for ventilation
and paralyzed with cisatracurium. At this point, given concern
for ARDS, it was decided to transfer patient back to MICU
service. A Chest CT was obtained en route to further
characterize the question of ARDS and also to evaluate a
possible infectious source of recurrent fevers patient had been
having, but the results of imaging did not correlate with the
clinical diagnosis. Of note, prior to transfer, patient was
transiently hypotensive, presumably from overdiuresis and
responded well to normal saline 1 liter bolus.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Assess for interval changes s/p ET tube change from nose
to

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
39 year old man with resp failure, reintubated.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess for interval changes s/p ET tube change from nose to
oral.
STUDY: AP chest [**2183-9-13**].

HISTORY: 39-year-old man with respiratory failure. Assess for
interval change.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**9-12**], [**2182**].

The study is very limited due to technique and poor inspiratory
effort. The patient has cardiomegaly. There is likely no
interval change with bilateral pleural effusions, left
retrocardiac opacity and pulmonary edema.
.
[**9-4**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 30-35 %).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function
appears depressed. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve
leaflets are not well seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior studies (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-31**]
and [**2183-8-21**],
unable to adequately compare ventricular function, although
function may have
been more vigorous (estimated ejection fraction then ~40%) in
the study of
[**2183-8-21**] in which images were of better quality.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA

Reason: r/o infection; PLEASE DO WITHOUT CONTRAST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
39 year old man with 39 year old man with abdominal distention,
DOE for 3 weeks with LE edema, [**Hospital1 **]-V heart failure w/ fevers
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infection; PLEASE DO WITHOUT CONTRAST
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: ARF

INDICATION: Fever and abdominal distension. History of heart
failure.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT imaging of the sinuses was performed
without intravenous contrast and displayed in 2.5 mm axial
collimation. No comparison is available.

FINDINGS: The patient is intubated. There is near complete
opacification of all of the visualized paranasal sinuses and of
the mastoid air cells. There is only partial aeration of the
left frontal sinus. Frontal sinus demonstrates no
aerosolization. An endotracheal tube passes through the left
naris. An orogastric tube is present. The mastoid air cells are
poorly pneumatized, although there is also partial opacification
of the bilateral mastoid air cells. Visualized portions of the
brain are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Near total opacification of the paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells. These may reflect retained fluid due to
prolonged intubation, but CT cannot distinguish sterile from
infection fluid.
