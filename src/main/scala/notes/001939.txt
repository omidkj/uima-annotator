CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ?PTX/interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman s/p RUL/RML lobectomy for metastatic colon CA.
CT now out
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?PTX/interval change
TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2168-7-25**]

COMPARISON: [**2168-7-23**].

INDICATION: Pneumothorax.

Examination is limited by underpenetration and low lung volumes.
A previously reported right lateral pneumothorax has nearly
resolved in the interval, with only a tiny residual lateral
pneumothorax remaining. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. There is increasing hazy increased opacity within the
lower portion of the right hemithorax. There is also a probable
small right pleural effusion. Allowing for technical factors,
the left lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of
significant left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Resolving right pneumothorax.
2. Increasing hazy opacity in lower right hemithorax. In the
appropriate clinical setting, evolving pneumonia should be
considered.
