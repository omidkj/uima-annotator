Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R internal jugular central line placement
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
46 M w/ pmh of anoxic brain injury, diabetes, GERD, and end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, recently admitted with a
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and new onset seizure
disorder p/w chest pain and coffee ground emesis. UGI bleed with
vomiting of jelly like substance, abd pain, called in by VNA who
called ambulance for transit to [**Hospital1 18**]. Patient also has had the
hiccups for the last 4 days, has not slept at all and is
miserable. He feels like the hiccups prevent him from breathing
well. He has had hiccups in the past thought to be secondary to
gastroparesis, and treated with thorazine or baclofen.
.
In the ED, vital signs were: 98.9, 167/93, 75, 16, 100% on 1L
NC. NG lavage---coffee ground; hct 25; guaiac neg; BP to 192/92,
had CP that resolved w/ NTG and morphine. EKG and enzymes at
baseline. L EJ is his access. Given protonix 40 mg IV X 1,
zofram 4 mg IV X 1, Morphine 4 mg IV X 2. Admitted for R/O MI
and upper GI bleed but went to dialysis prior to arriving to the
floor where he received 2 U PRBC.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is feeling bad. He is very
uncomfortable with his NG tube in place, so it was removed. He
has a sore throat from the tube. He continues to have severe
hiccups. His chest pain is now minimal. He no longer feels
nauseated. He has not vomitted since this morning with the jelly
like substance.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR [**10-12**]
FINDINGS: There is vascular engorgement consistent with mild
pulmonary edema. There is no evidence of pneumonia. Moderate
degree of cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. Osseous structures appear intact.
No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly. Bilateral small pleural
effusions with mild fluid overload.

[**10-14**] CT head

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, edema, or
shift of normally midline structures. There is no evidence of an
acute major
vascular territorial infarction. A small chronic lacunar
infarction is again
seen in the right parietal subcortical white matter. The
ventricles are
stable in size.

The imaged bones appear unremarkable. Calcifications are again
noted in the
lens of the left globe. Thickening and calcification are again
noted in the
sclera of the left globe.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.

MRI brain [**10-15**]
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study, both by patient-motion and
lack of
intravenous contrast, with:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Stable small focal FLAIR-signal abnormality centered on a
small vascular
structure in the left frontal corona radiata, with imaging
characteristics
most suggestive of an underlying developmental venous anomaly
(as suggested
previously); there is no associated cavernous angioma or other
vascular
abnormality, or hemorrhage.
3. Mild cortical atrophy, as before.
4. Unremarkable cranial MRA, with no flow-limiting stenosis or
aneurysm
larger than 3 mm in diameter.
5. Extensive chronic abnormalities involving the left globe and
its contents
with evidence of past retinal detachment and subretinal
hemorrhage, as well as
evidence of apparently known glaucoma (N.B. according to the
history provided
for one of the prior examinations, the patient is "blind in this
eye"); there
is no evidence of abnormality involving the contralateral orbit
or globe.



Brief Hospital Course:
45 M with ESRD, DM I, HTN, p/w chest pain, hematemesis x1 day
and four days of unremitting hiccups.
.
# CP - many possible etiologies of chest pain. Most likely is
severe esophagitis as seen on prior EGD. Treated with viscous
lidocaine for now and morphine to see if it improves. Troponins
negativeCould be cardiac pain, trending troponins (slightly
high, although CKs are going down). EKGs did not show ST
elevations. Think ischemia is not likely contributing and
increasing troponins are likely from demand stress from HTN.
Patient remained chest pain free during hospitalization.

# Hematemesis - has known esophagitis on last EGD, found to have
upper GI bleed in ER. Not actively bleeding during hospital
stay, with stable HCT. GI was consulted and defered EGD given
risk of intubation, and recent EGD showing esophagitis. They
will follow up with him as an outpatient and consider EGD as an
outpatient. Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

# Hiccups - Initially treated with baclofen, but this was
discontinued once patient was in the ICU. Neurology considered
that the baclofen may lower his seizure threshold.  Without
hiccups for one week prior to discharge.
.
# DM I - Sugars well controlled with lantus and sliding scale
insulin.

# ESRD - on HD, due for dialysis tomorrow and is on Mon Wed Fri.

# HTN - patient severely hypertensive on admission with SBPs in
200s. BPs well controlled on Losartan 10mg po qd and Metoprolol
50mg po tid.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 40-45% ([**2149-9-6**]) -
increasing losartan, switching to PO beta blocker; appears
euvolemic on exam, has fluid status monitored at HD.
.
# Hx of seizure disorder - Patient had EEG which showed
