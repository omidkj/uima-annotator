Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from outside hospital with lung mass/lymphadenopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS
Chest tube s/p VATS


History of Present Illness:
50 yoM w/ h/o chronic pain syndrome, history of testicular
cancer, and recent PNA presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] [**2119-1-20**] with
chough X 2 days productive of  yellow mucus and subjective fever
without chills. (+) occasional pleuritic left flank pain. In the
ED, CXR with consolidation vs mass at RLL. He was thought to
have right lower lobe PNA and ?RAD exacerbation. He was treated
with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone), nebulizers, and admitted to
medical service for further evaluation. Given concern for mass
on initial CXR, he had a Chest CT [**2119-1-20**] that showed extensive
lymphadenopathy. w/ lymphadenopathy of left axilla, mediastinum,
and right hilum and celiac axis (worrisome for lymphoma). Course
c/b fever to 101.4, leukocytosis with bandemia. Given concern
for aspiration and history of MRSA, his antibiotic coverage was
changed to Flagyl, Ceftazidime, Azithromycin, and vancomycin. On
hospital day four, due to the patient's worsening shortness of
breath, there was concern for superimpsosed congestive heart
failure, and the patient received 40 mg IV lasix and nitropaste.
However a CXR was without CHF findings and a BNP was normal at
73. A pulmonary consult was obtained , who recommended lung
biopsy/lymph node biopsy via VATS, and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management

Currently, the patient reports mild shortness of breath, only
with coughing. (+) diffuse chest pain only with coughing. (+)
intermittent subjective fevers/chills. (+) sputum yellow/green
with occasional streaks of blood. (+) wheezing

ROS: Mild intermittent frontal headache. No rhinorrhea, sore
throat, ear pain, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
dysuria, or diarrhea. (+) history of IVDU (quit [**2094**]). Last HIV
test 1 yr ago (per pt at [**Hospital1 112**]) negative. No history of TB,
although pt has been incarcerated in the past. No recent travel.
(+) daughter with pneumonia.

sequelae of previously treated lymph nodes or granulomatous
exposure. Nonspecific consolidation and ground-glass opacities

etiology. Surgical clips in RML.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pulmonary: Given the patient's leukocytosis/bandemia, fever,
hypoxia, the differential diagnosis includes CAP (typicals and
atypicals), PCP (multiple HIV risk factors), aspiration
pneumonia (given history of narcotic overuse), malignancy
(lymphoma, testicular CA, other), or TB. The patient was broadly
covered with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl, and vancomycin.
A CT was obtained [**2119-1-24**] that showed diffuse centrilobular
opacities and apical ground glass attenuation with bilateral
axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient's
eosinophils rose to 13%, raising concern for hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, or bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis. Legionella urinary antigen and HIV Ab tests were
negative. LDH was elevated, which could be suggestive of PCP or
lymphoma. PCP smear was negative X1 and sputum cultures grew
only oropharyngeal flora. Pulmonary and thoracic surgery were
consulted, and the patient underwent VATS on [**2119-1-26**] with
biopsies of left upper and lower lung and left axillary lymph
node. A PPD was placed, and was negative. ANCA and RF were
negative.
The patient developed worsening hypoxia and shortness of breath
and required a MICU stay, though no intubation. He was started
on IV steroids for his lymphadenopathy and worsening pneumonia.
He was also continued on his Vanco, CTX, and Azithromycin. He
had a CT scan to look for a PE and this found large b/lateral
pulmonary emboli. A heparin gtt was started. In this CT scan, it
was also noted that his infiltrates and lymphadenopathy
improved, so steroids, abx were also continued. The patient
improved his oxygen saturations and breathing and was
transferred back to the floor. His chest tube had been removed
without complication, including no pneumothorax, while he was in
the MICU and 2 nylon sutures were removed from the site on
[**1-31**].
After coming back to the floor, the patient did well and was on
room air at discharge. His cultures from a BAL were all negative
and after discussion with pulmonary team antibiotics were
discontinued after 9 days of vanc, ctx, azithro. He was afebrile
and his wbc was elevated (thought to be related to high dose
steroids). Diff was normal.--tapering CCST

His VATS pathology came back and demonstrated 2 discrete
morphologies affecting upper and lower lobes. In the upper
lobes, the process appeared to be infiltrative dz of the
alveoli, while lower lungs demonstrated bronchiocentric
inflammation. Path was read as acute organizing PNA with
neutrophilic predominence, likley viral/bacterial etiology. Pt's
steroids were tapered down to 20 mg QD, which he will cont for 3
days, then will switch to 10mg QD for 5 days and then off. He
will follow-up in pulmonary clinic on [**3-6**].

2) Chest wall hematoma- Pt c/o pain over LN bx site with tender
mass and expansion over a 24hr period. U/S showed hematoma. His
anticoagulation proceeded cautiously with heparin (goal PTT
50-70). His HCT remained stable and there was no significant
expansion of the lesion, so he was bridged to coumadin (goal INR
