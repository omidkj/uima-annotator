Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
intracranial hemorrhage, possible seizure & hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pt arrived from OSH intubated and was extubated on [**3-4**].

History of Present Illness:
50 year-old man with history of EtOH abuse who was transferred
from an OSH. The history was obtained from the medical record
and is not clear. Pt may have had a fall from standing vs.
possible seizure activity vs. possible assault. It is not clear
whether this was a witnessed event or if pt was presumed to have
fallen foward, because of injuries to his face. Pt was taken to
an OSH yesterday morning where he was initially alert and
talking. Head and neck CTs and CXR were negative per report from
OSH records. Pt was seen by ENT who repaired a lip lac but did
not document any facial fractures. Throughout the course of the
day, pt became increasingly agitated. EtOH level was <10, and
given his ETOH history, pt was believed to be in withdrawal. He
received increasing doses of ativan and was put on an ativan gtt
(prior to intubation). Given the increasing agitation as well as
increased facial swelling, pt was ultimately intubated for
airway protection. Pt was first started on propofol but became
hypotensive with a HR in the 140s to 180s and was then switched
to fentanyl and versed with some improvement in hemodynamics. Pt
was also given Thiamine, Folate, MVI & approx 2L of NS, then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED here, VS: T 97, HR 130, BP 144/74, RR 20, 98%.
He was noted to have minimally reactive pupils and was moving
when off sedation (pt had been given fentanyl, ativan, and
versed for sedation). Pt had a repeat head CT which showed a
small intracranial hemorrhage, pt was then noted to be in Afib
with RVR of 160s. Pt received a total of 5L NS. FAST exam was
negative. Pt received a total of 15mg diltiazem IV with SBP to
90s and HR 110, he was  then started on a dilt gtt with HR 120s
and SBP 100s. Initial ABG was 7.38/46/369 & vent was adjusted.

.
CT head [**3-3**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the small hyperdense focus, 0.7cm in
the right superior colliculus, extending into the quadrigeminal
cistern, likely representing a hemorrhagic focus, with no
significant change, allowing for the technical differences.
2. Prominent bifrontal parietal subdural fluid collections,
representing hygromas or chronic subdural hematomas. No acute
hemorrhage noted within these fluid collections.
.
CT head [**3-3**] repeat IMPRESSION:
1. 7-mm focus of acute hemorrhage adjacent the right superior
colliculus.
2. Prominent bifrontoparietal collections are hygromas or
chronic subdural hemorrhage.
.
[**3-3**] ECHO : The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). The right
ventricular cavity is small. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: small, hyperdynamic left ventricle
.
EEG [**3-3**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the low
voltage background with beta frequencies superimposed and due to
the bursts of generalized slowing. These findings indicate a
widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and
subcortical structures. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes.
The widespread beta rhythm suggests a prominent role for
medications.
There were no clear areas of focal slowing, but encephalopathies
may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features.
.
CXR [**3-7**] IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening right lower lung pneumonia and a questionable small
focal left mid lung pneumonia.
.
MICRO:
Sputum Culture from [**3-3**]: + Group A beta hemolytic strep.
All other blood & urine cultures were neg for growth

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course: Pt was sent to the MICU intubated & was extubated
successfully on [**3-4**]. Pt was noted to be febrile to 101.5 on
[**3-3**] with an associated bandemia and was started on
Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for broad empiric coverage.  Pt had reported a
cough at OSH and was ruled out for flu at OSH. Blood cultures
are pending, urine cultures were negative for growth but sputum
cultures were positive for Group A strep. Neuro was consulted in
the ED and notes suggest that intracranial hemorrhage may have
been due to spontaneous ICH secondary to thrombocytopenia.
Alternatively, it may have occurred secondary to trauma, thought
location of ICH unusual for trauma. Serial CT scans were
performed and demonstrated stability of the ICH.  Pt was treated
Atrial fibrillation with RVR with a diltiazem gtt that was
weaned prior to transfer.  Once his heart rate was well
controlled, pt was transferred to the medical floor for further
management.
.
Hospital Course on Medicine Floor:
.
# Fall/Syncope/ETOH abuse: Events leading to presentation were
thought most likely secondary to EtOH abuse.  EEG did not show
any evidence of seizure activity and pt was noted to have
several prior admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**] with ETOH withdrawal and
Delirium Tremens. Psychiatry was consulted for ongoing confusion
thought possibly due to hallucinations vs repeated head
injuries. Pt did not have any clear evidence of
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and was not requiring Ativan by CIWA
scale.  Pt initially required 1:1 sitter but mental status
improved on the floor and psych recommended discontinuing the
sitter. Psych recommended substance abuse treatment on discharge
however pt was not interested.  By the day of discharge, pt was
alert & oriented and was eager for discharge home due to concern
that his mother would be worried about hi
