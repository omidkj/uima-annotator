Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sotalol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion & abdominal bloating

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right cardiac catheterization
Pericardial tap

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 yo female with history of PAF/tachy-brady
syndrome s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] pericardial effusion of
unclear etiology who presents with worsening abdominal bloating
and DOE x 1 week found to be in AF with RVR and to have worsened
pericardial effusion.

Patient's history with EP started [**5-1**] when she had a [**Month/Year (2) 4448**]
placed for AF/tachy-brady. She was also started on coumadin and
sotalol, however the sotalol was stopped [**3-1**] symptoms of
worsening right heart failure. TTE showed dilated left and right
atria with normal LVEF. In addition, she was noted to have a new
small pericardial effusion of unclear etiology which was
followed by serial imaging and eventually resolved in the Fall
[**2163**]. She states that she was doing well until [**4-2**] when she was
admitted for AF with RVR and CHF exacerbation. She was
rate-controlled, diuresed, and started on dofetilide and
converted to sinus prior to discharge. On follow-up TTE, a small
RA lead mass was noted that was thought to be a thrombus and INR
goal was increased to 3.5. [**9-2**] TTE revealed the stable RA mass
but return of a small pericardial effusion.

She resented to clinic on [**11-30**] for follow-up and reported
worsening abdominal bloating and DOE. She was able to walk to
work prior to [**11-20**] but since this time becomes SOB with minimal
exertion. Notes increased ankle edema but no PND or orthopnea.
Does occasionally have palpitations. Denies chest pain. Found to
have 16mm Hg pulsus paradoxus and worsened pericardial effusion
on TTE but no obvious hemodynamic compromise. Admitted from
clinic for rate-control, diuresis, and further w/u of
pericardial effusion.

On ROS, denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
Reports anorexia and recent weight loss of unclear amount. No
diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cardiac catheterization ([**2162**]): 1. Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated mildly elevated right and left-sided filling
pressures with a low cardiac index.  There was no equalization
of pressures or blunting of the y-descent in the PCWP tracing
(no evidence of tamponade). 2. After volume loading with 1000 cc
of normal saline, the RA pressure rose to 15 mmHg and the PCWP
rose to 23 mmHg.  Again, there was no equalization of pressures
or evidence of tamponade, but cardiac index remained low.
3. After placing a magnet over the patient's [**Year (4 digits) 4448**] which
increased the heart rate to 80 bpm, the hemodynamics were
unchanged.

2)ETT-MIBI ([**4-/2162**]): No angina with uninterpretable ECG in the
presence of multiple arrhythmias. Normal myocardial perfusion
with EF 66%.

3)ECHO([**8-/2164**]): The left atrium is normal in size. A small
mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in
the right atrium and/or right ventricle. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5 cm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2164-7-2**], the pericardial effusion is new. The
small mass/thrombus on the pacer wire is unchanged.

4)Cardiac Catheterization [**12-3**]: 1. Hemodynamics revealed mildly
elevated right-sided pressures of 34/18 mmHg in the right
ventricle. Pre-pericardiocentesis mean right atrial pressure was
15 mmHg, post-procedure mean RA pressure was 5 mmHg.  Systemic
arterial pressures was 99 mmHg pre and 109 mmHg post
pericardiocentesis. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was
17 mmHg.  Pericardial pressure was 12 mmHg. Findings were
consistent with early tamponade. 2. A successful
pericardiocentesis was performed via the subxiphoid approach,
producing approximately 350 cc of dark, bloody fluid.

5)ECHO([**2164-12-3**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function are normal(LVEF>55%). There is a moderate
sized circumferential pericardial effusion  without right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. A catheter is
identified in the pericardial space with agitated saline
identified in the pericardial space.

6)ECHO([**2164-12-4**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
restrictive/constrictive MV filling pattern. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echo signs of tamponade.Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2164-12-3**], the pericardial effusion
is now slightly larger than it was immediately post
pericardiocentesis.

7)ECHO([**2164-12-5**]): The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular c
