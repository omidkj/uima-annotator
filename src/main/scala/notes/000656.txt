History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 33 yo M with DM Type I, ESRD on HD (T/Th/S),
HTN with multiple past admissions for DKA, who self-presented to
the ED on [**2145-11-19**] with recurrent nausea and vomiting. He had
been in his usual state of health until Thursday evening,
[**2145-11-18**], when he suddenly developed nausea and multiple
episodes of vomiting of a non-bloody, non-bilious emesis that
lasted throughout the night. He also experienced progressively
worsening abdominal pain, describing it as a "fire" diffusely
located within his abdomen that was accompanied by new onset
back pain. Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] reported that his presenting nausea and
vomiting feels distinct from those associated with his past
admissions for DKA in severity and acuity. He denied any fever
or chills at home, but did experience diffuse sweating. He
denied recent cough or dyspnea; denied any constipation,
diarrhea and change in bowel habits; denied dysuria and change
in his urination.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] initially denied any significant changes in his oral
intake prior to the onset of his symptoms, but upon further
discussion mentioned that his refrigerator had stopped working
in the middle of the week and he and his girlfriend had been
eating out for most of their meals. Additionally, on Thursday
evening he drank some juice that had been in the refrigerator
and stated that he believes his symptoms are likely due to
ingestion of juice "that had something growing in it,"
particularly as he had his first episode of vomiting soon after
he drank the juice.
.
Over the course of the night, Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] felt too ill to check
his blood glucose level and administer his insulin. His symptoms
became progressively worse, without any relief the next morning.
He did not take his morning dosage of glargline or
anti-hypertensives, and instead self-presented to the ED.
.
Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 40896**] insulin regimen consists of glargine 15 units in
the morning with breakfast and lispro sliding scale injections.
He reported that his blood sugars have been under reasonable
control (~140s) over the past few days. His last HD prior to
presentation (on Thursday [**2145-11-18**]) had been uneventful. After
dialysis is blood glucose levels were in the 70s and he received
some [**Location (un) 2452**] juice. He denies experiencing any recent dizziness,
lightheadedness, or sensation that the room is spinning.
.
<I>Per MICU signout</I>: In the ED, initial VS T 100.8, BP
203/110, HR 112, RR 18, O2 100% RA. He was later febrile to
101.9 and was given 1 g vancomycin. His AST/ALT/AP were elevated
at 73/42/165 respectively. Finger stick blood glucose (FSBG) was
initially 712, with an AG of 25. He was given 10 units of
regular insulin IV after which FSBG decreased to 583. He was
then given another 10 units IV regular insulin followed by 10
units SC insulin. A R external jugular line was placed for
access. He received a total 2L IVF.
.
While in the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] was initially placed on insulin
gtt and later transitioned to glargine and lispro sliding scale
as his diet was advanced. His AG (25 at presentation) decreased
to 15. He was given oxycodone prn for pain and compazine for
nausea. His ALT and AP have decreased from their values at
presentation, yet were still elevated on [**11-20**] at 55 and 135
respectively. His AST normalized at 31. His LDH was elevated at
266.
.
Currently, on the floor the patient has no acute complaints. He
denies any nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain and reports
feeling ready to go home.

Imaging:
# KUB [**11-19**]:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern and no evidence of
acute abnormality.
.
# TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**11-22**]: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-35 %) with global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral
