Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lightheadedness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     This is a 77 year old male
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, atrial
fibrillation, and Hepatitis C, who was brought to [**Hospital1 346**] after a pre-syncopal episode while
having a bowel movement this morning at 02:30 in the morning.
The patient was found by his family on the toilet; he felt
woozy.  He did not fall; he did not lose consciousness.  He
was recently admitted to the [**Hospital **] Hospital two weeks ago for
weakness.  He was evaluated for heart failure.  Amiodarone
was stopped at that time secondary to liver toxicity and a GI
evaluation which consisted of an upper GI study which was
normal.  During that study, he was found to have ascites.

The patient complains of intermittent epigastric abdominal
pain, non-radiating, with each bowel movement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post five-vessel coronary
    artery bypass graft with a redo in [**2139**].
3.  Hepatitis C with recent ascites.
4.  Pacemaker.
5.  Congestive heart failure; ejection fraction approximately
    15%.

ALLERGIES:  To eggs, he gets short of breath and to contrast,
he gets a fever.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Spironolactone 300 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Nitroglycerin patch, 0.4 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denies any
tobacco, alcohol or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.6 F.; blood pressure
80s to 90/40; heart rate 150 to 175; respiratory rate 16; O2
99% on three liters.  In general, he is a cachectic somnolent
man.  HEENT examination:  Oropharynx is clear.  Pupils
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Neck is supple.  Full range of motion; no
jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular examination:
Irregularly irregular, tachycardic, no murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Pulmonary examination:  Decreased breath sounds
bilateral bases, right greater than left.  Decreased fremitus
at the right base, no egophony.  Abdomen examination:  Mildly
distended.  Diffusely tender.  No guarding, no rebound.
Guaiac positive stool.  The lavage via the nasogastric tube
was negative.  Liver span is 12 cm.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologic examination:
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The patient is
alert and oriented times three.  Skin examination, no
jaundice, no spider hemangiomas.

LABORATORY:  Laboratory data on arrival at the Emergency Room
on [**10-22**] at 3 a.m., white count 5,900, 37 neutrophils,
52 lymphs, 7 monos, 3 eos.  Hematocrit 38.8, platelets 120.
PT 15.3, PTT 33.3, INR 1.5.  SMA-7, 128, 5.0, 97, 17, 29,
1.2, glucose 101, calcium 8.9, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 2.1.

CK #1 drawn in the Emergency Room was 67, troponin less than
0.3.

An EKG on arrival showed atrial fibrillation at 80 beats per
minute, left ventricular hypertrophy, Q wave in V2 through
V5, ST elevations in V2.

A CT scan of the abdomen was performed that showed bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left, large amount of
ascites, showed a cirrhotic liver, showed minimum aortic
dissection above the bifurcation of 2.8 cm.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions, enlarged cardiac
silhouette, cephalization of vasculature.

At 5 a.m., EKG showed a heart rate of 150 beats per minute,
in ventricular tachycardia with Qs anteriorly and laterally.
There was still left ventricular hypertrophy.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 77 year old man who presented to the
Emergency Department for lightheadedness.  While in the
Emergency Department, he experienced bright red blood per
rectum.  The NG lavage was negative.  He was found to be
alternating between atrial fibrillation and ventricular
tachycardia.  He was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further observation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.      Gastrointestinal:  The cause of the bright red blood
per rectum is most likely a lower GI source.  The
possibilities include ischemia and diverticulitis.  The
patient will be placed on Protonix.  He will be kept NPO;
hematocrits will be checked q. four hours and a call will be
sent to the Blood Bank.

2.      Cardiovascular:  He has a history of atrial
fibrillation.  He is currently not anti-coagulated.  He has a
pacer placed recently at the VA.  He has congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 15%.  The plan would be
to restart amiodarone, however, given the patient's recent
toxicity, Cardiology will be consulted to: 1) Identify the
intrinsic rhythm of his heart and identify the rhythm of the
pacemaker and, 2) make recommendations for anti-arrhythmic
therapy.

3.      Infectious Disease:  The patient became febrile on
transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Blood cultures,
urine cultures will be sent.  A thoracentesis will be
performed if the patient spikes again and if another source
for infection is not found.

Over the next few days, at first the patient required more
oxygen and the patient's blood pressure remained low, which
is close to his normal of 90s over 60s.  The GI bleeding
resolved.  The cardiac work-up consisted mostly of obtaining
prior history that showed that prior EP studies had
demonstrated aberrant atrial tachycardia with no inducible
ventricular tachycardia.  The patient then progressed to
tachy/brady syndrome which led to a permanent pacemaker and
he is currently AV paced at 80.

The patient's ascites remained stable.  The patient was
transiently started on Neo-Synephrine to maintain blood
pressure.  By hospital day number four, [**10-24**], the
patient had guaiac negative bowel movements.  He was no
longer on pressors.  He was feeling better.  The patient was
continued on antibiotics of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl which
was started empirically on the first temperature spike.  He
was transferred to the Floor on hospital day number four,
[**10-24**].

The patient remained on the Floor for two days and was
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
[**10-26**], secondary to hypoxia.  This is secondary to a
worsening pneumonia complicated by congestive heart failure.
On [**10-27**], the patient was intubated for worsening
hypoxia and respiratory distress.  The patient's blood
pressure decreased at that point in time.  Possible
contributing factors included sepsis from the pneumonia,
medication induced from the anesthetics used to sedate the
patient and low cardiac output secondary to the patient's 15%
ejection fraction.

A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and that demonstrated good
cardiac output for this patient of 5 liters per minute.  This
probably represents a hyperdynamic heart for this patient
given his reduced ejection fraction and a line was also
placed, an OG tube was placed.  Levophed was maxed out.
Neo-Synephrine was also started overnight from [**10-27**]
until [**10-28**].  On [**10-28**], the patient's family
arrived.  While seeing him, the patient went into an
supraventricular tachycardia at the rate of 170.  The patient
was on 100% oxygen and was maintaining a blood pressure in
the systolics of 60s and at that time the Medical Team
thought further treatment would not benefit the patient.

The family saw the patient and concurred and care was
withdrawn.  Approximately ten minutes later, the patient was
pronounced dead on [**2141-10-28**].  An autopsy was refused
by the family.  The patient was not discharged; he was
declared deceased on [**2141-10-28**], at 12:55 p.m.
