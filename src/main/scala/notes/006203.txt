nebs with improvement in O2, levaquin 750 for possible pna, and
lasix 40mg IV x1 for possible CHF exacerbation. CXR showed known
cardiomegaly, pulm HTN but minimal evidence of CHF and no
infiltrate. EKG showed NSR, borderline RAD, nl intervals, TWI
III, II, aVF. TW flattening V4-V6
.
Currently, she reports that she feels well. She has a persistent
cough but otherwise no SOB, chest pain, abd pain, worsening leg
edema, f/c/ns

Radio:
[**5-13**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
congestion are both worsened since [**5-11**], which may indicate a
component of left-sided heart failure in addition to
longstanding pulmonary hypertension responsible for pulmonary
artery and hilar enlargement and possible right ventricular
failure with elevation of central venous pressure reflecting
distension of the azygous vein. No focal pulmonary abnormality
or pleural effusion is seen.
.
[**5-14**] CXR: The heart size is markedly enlarged but unchanged as
well as pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar haziness,
demonstrating pulmonary edema. There is worsening of left
retrocardiac consolidation which might be either due to
pneumonia or to developmenting atelectasis due to heart failure.
There is no sizeable pleural effusion.
.
[**5-15**] CXR: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**5-14**] and has
been substantial decrease in mediastinal vascular engorgement.
Mild cardiomegaly and particular pulmonary artery dilatation are
longstanding. There is no pleural effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome,
obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension on
sildenafil, who presented with increased dyspnea and cough in
the setting of missing a week of sildenafil.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
# SOB: multifactorial.  Thought to be related to COPD, asthma,
CHF, pulmonary hypertension, possible PNA, obesity
hypoventilation syndrome.  See below for details.
.
# Hypoxia: patient transiently became hypoxic while on the
BiPAP.  This occurred in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory
failure and delta ms [**First Name (Titles) 6643**] [**Last Name (Titles) 59337**] a transfer to the ICU
briefly.  The etiology was uncertain but thought likely related
to mobilization of fluid now that sildenafil is restarted giving
LV a higher work load.  Patient's relative hypoxia is also a
chronic problem for her and resuming her home therapy would be
the most therapeutic. She was started on levofloxacin as below
with regard to the bandemia and retrocardiac opacity as
described below.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is likely secondary to
obesity hypoventilation and pulmonary hypertension with reduced
DLCO.  She also was markedly wheezy on exam at times,
particularly on transfer to the ICU.  She was started on
solumedrol high dose for several days.  She continued on nebs
but at a higher frequency.  We transitioned her to oral steroids
and recommend a 14 day total dose/taper.  We asked patient to
bring in her own BiPAP machine which helped her mental status,
oxygenation, and we believe ventilation.  *** if readmitted, get
home BiPAP machine in-house asap ***
.
# Asthma: She has COPD written in her records, however PFTs have
been consistent with a restrictive picture, and she has a
minimal smoking history. Nevertheless, she does have wheezes on
exam, and in the setting of hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory
failure, we treated with IV steroids, as well as standing
nebulizer treatments as above.
.
# CHF, right sided, preserved EF: Patient with lower extremity
edema which is old per patient report and OMR. We initially
diuresed her with 1-2L negative per day.  Her dry weight is
reportedly 263 pounds.  She was 281 pounds on admission and
improved to 264 on discharge.  She was discharged on lasix 80
[**Hospital1 **].
.
# Hypotension: The patient had transient episodes of hypotension
in the ICU that were attributed to the re-introduction of the
sildenafil. Small amounts of IVF were given as boluses to
support the transient decrements. She remained asymptomatic with
each episode.
.
# Cards vascular: CE neg x3.  Not thought to be related to
ischemia
.
# ID: as above.  Additionally, there was concern for a UTI and
possibly a PNA.  She received levoflox for a 7 day course.  She
had a bandemia (although no elevated WBC) which improved on
therapy.  Her cultures were negative.
.
# Code: Full.  this was discussed on admission and on transfer
to unit.  The patient has difficulty making this decision.  She
would like transient intubation but was hesitant to receiving a
trach.  The ICU team explained to her that she would likely
require a trach if she is ever intubated.  The patient remained
full code but with plans to further discuss this with her
mother.
