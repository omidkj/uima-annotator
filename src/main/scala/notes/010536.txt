CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is no mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. The lateral
ventricles are symmetric and non-dilated. The density values of
the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.

The vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its tributaries are
patent without evidence of significant stenosis, occlusion, or
aneurysm. The right posterior cerebral artery is noted to have a
partially fetal-type configuration receiving supply from a
prominent posterior communicating artery as well as from the
basilar artery.

ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Within normal limits. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

MRI HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST:
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect,
or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber
and configuration. The MRV appears normal.

CHEST (PA & LAT):
Probable left upper lobe pneumonia. Repeat chest x-ray after
therapy recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 33 year-old female transferred to neurology from
neurosurgery for w/u of headache. Initial differential diagnosis
included chronic daily headache mixed with migraine, pseudotumor
(fundi normal goes against this but weight gain is for this),
sinus venous thrombosis (given h/o miscarriages), aseptic
meningitis (much less likely given absence of nuchal rigidity).
Patient was evaluated and transferred to the Stroke service. She
was neurologically stable without focal deficits.

Brain MRI did not show evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect, or infarction, or sinus thrombosis. For treatment
of her headache, she was placed on scheduled IV toradol and
scheduled IV reglan.  She was started on topamax for prophylaxis
and weight loss. Nicotine patch was placed to aid in smoking
cessation and prevent nicotine withdrawl.

Patient had a elevated WBC count but remained afebrile.
Urinalysis was normal. A CXR revealed left upper lobe pneumonia.
She had a productive cough and lung exam was positive for
crackles in left upper lobe, without rales/ronchi. Sputum
culture was unremarkable. Patient was started on azithromycin
and ceftriaxone x 2 days.  She will be discharged on PO
azithromycin and PO cefpodoxime to complete a 10 day course.
WBC count had declined to within normal limits. Her blood/urine
cultures were pending.

At discharge, patient's headache had subsided and her
neurological exam was unchanged from admission (ie. normal). She
was counseled on side effects of topamax and to stop taking it
if she has increased eye pressure or renal stones. She will
remain on topamax as outpatient for migraine prophylaxis and
gradually increase dose as noted on discharge med list. For
acute severe headache pain relief, patient was prescribed reglan
and relpax.  LP was not attempted ultimately as we did not want
to worsen her headaches, which already worsen with upright
posture.  She had no signs of meningitis.

She will followup with PCP for further medical management and
was instructed to see an ophthalmologist to evaluate for
glaucoma, a side effect of topamax.  Due to insurance reasons,
she will need to f/u with a neurologist at [**Hospital1 2177**], and thus we are
getting an appt for her to see [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95631**] (pain specialist).
