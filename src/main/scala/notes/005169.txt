STUDIES:
[**2137-10-12**] CXR:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. A
dual-lead pacer is again noted with lead tips positioned in the
approximate location of the right atrium and right ventricle.
Midline sternotomy wires are noted. There is minimal elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm, with probable left lower lobe
subsegmental atelectasis. No large pleural effusions are seen.
There is no overt CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, with
calcification noted along the aortic knob. There is pleural
thickening noted at the apices bilaterally. Scoliosis is noted
in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
Left lower lobe atelectasis, stable. No acute intrathoracic
process.
.
[**2137-10-13**] CXR:
Single portable radiograph of the chest excludes the left
costophrenic angle. Visualized cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged compared with [**2137-10-12**]. No consolidation is evident.
There is left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Trachea is
midline. Patient is status post median sternotomy.
IMPRESSION:
Persistent left basilar atelectasis
.
[**2137-10-14**] Barium swallow:
FINDINGS: The upper portion of the esophagus was patulous with
loss of normal peristaltic wave. Tertiary contractions were seen
in the lower two thirds of the esophagus. The gastroesophageal
junction is widely patent with no evidence of stricture or
intraluminal mass. Mildly prominent folds are seen in the lower
esophagus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of stricture or esophageal mass. Mildly
patulous upper esophagus with moderate dysmotility.

PROCEDURES:
[**2137-10-12**] EGD:
ESOPHAGUS:
Contents: A large amount of food was found in the esophagus.
Retrieval of the food bolus was extremely difficult due to the
size of the bolus and the extremely narrowed GE junction.
Decision was made to intubate the patient for airway protection
part way through the procedure. Subsequent food bolus removal
took approximately 3 hours- during which the GE junction was
effectively dilated by an EGD scope, which was initially
difficult to pass, followed by a larger bore therapeutic scope.
The GE junction appeared extremely narrowed, but could be
traversed with gentle pressure by the endoscope and then would
remain open for a period of time. This was felt to be possibly
consistent with achalasia. No mass was seen.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Food in the esophagus (foreign body removal)
Recommendations: Barium swallow should be next step in
evaluation for achalasia, vs pseuodachalasia vs stricture etc

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with past medical history significant for
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation
admitted with dysphagia and found to have food impaction with
decreased esophageal diameter at the GE junction.
.
1) Dysphagia: Patient presenting with acute episode of dysphagia
and food impaction. EGD [**2137-10-12**] showed food impaction and
narrowing of the esophagus at the GE junction which was
traversed and dilated by the EGD scope; no grossly evident
esophageal masses were observed. Barium swallow [**2137-10-14**] showed
no stricture, no narrowing of the GE junction, no esophageal
masses, however, esophageal dysmotility was noted. The patient
was advised to take small bites, chew thoroughly, and eat with
plenty of liquids to aid in esophageal transport of food
boluses. The patient is cleared for a regular diet. The patient
is advised to follow-up with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**]. Differential
includes peptic stricture, achalasia, esophageal compression,
esophageal ring or neoplasm, all less likely given above
imaging.
.
2)  Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been in sinus with
outpatient amiodarone.  Patient also on metoprolol.  Coumadin
was held for above procedure but was restarted on [**2137-10-16**] with
an INR of 1.2.  INR to be followed with adjustment in Coumadin
as needed.  Goal INR is 2-2.5.
