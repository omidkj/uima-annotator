Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 66-year-old
Caucasian female with history of COPD, who presents with
respiratory failure.  The patient was last seen by her PCP
approximately two weeks prior to admission.  At the time, she
was complaining of increased cough and shortness of breath.
Was given a prescription for Zithromax and five days of
prednisone.

Initially after this treatment, the patient improved in terms
of her symptoms.  However, over the few days prior to this
admission, she noticed increased shortness of breath.  The
patient was seen at an outside hospital Emergency Department
and was transferred here for further management.  The patient
denied any fevers, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms.  She stated that
her cough was improving with decreased sputum production.

Upon arrival to the Emergency Department at this hospital,
the patient had an arterial blood gas that was 7.34/75/68.
At this time, she was put on BiPAP and started on
levofloxacin and prednisone.  Patient was not able to be
weaned off BiPAP immediately and was admitted to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD with a FEV1 23% of predicted.  Patient is on home O2
and BiPAP.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Advair.
2. Lipitor.
3. Spironolactone.
4. Combivent.
5. Multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  Allergic to sulfa, which results in jaundice.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had a 44 pack year smoking
history, having quit four years ago.  No alcohol history.
She lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.3,
blood pressure 130/60, pulse 91, respiratory rate 20, O2
saturation 93%.  In general, the patient was alert in no
apparent distress.  HEENT exam:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive.  Patient was anicteric with clear oropharynx and
moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular:  Patient was
tachycardic with a normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lung exam:  Patient had diffuse wheezing throughout
both lung fields.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There was trace
edema bilaterally of the lower extremities.  There is no calf
tenderness.  Neurological exam:  Alert and oriented times
three, and mentating well, and otherwise grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC significant for a white count
of 14.6, hematocrit of 46, platelets of 251.  Chemistries is
significant for a sodium of 142, potassium 6.0, chloride of
94, bicarb 41.  Normal BUN and creatinine.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute with a
right axis deviation, normal intervals, no significant
changes from prior EKG.

Chest x-ray on admission shows a left upper lobe pneumonia
and pulmonary artery hypertension.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1. Respiratory failure:  Patient's respiratory failure
appears to be consistent with COPD exacerbation.  Chest x-ray
is also positive for a lobar pneumonia.  Patient was
initially started on IV steroids and nebulizers for her COPD
exacerbation.  She was also started on levofloxacin for the
lobar pneumonia.  Initially she was placed on BiPAP for
improved oxygenation.  Subsequently, the patient was also
started on ceftriaxone for treatment of her pneumonia.

Repeat arterial blood gases showed that the patient had
hypercarbia with CO2 pressures ranging from mid 60s-70s.  It
was thought that due to her severe COPD, the patient had a
baseline CO2 of approximately 60.  In order to prevent
further hypercarbia from decreased respiratory drive, the
patient's O2 saturation was maintained at approximately 90%.
The patient was taken off BiPAP during the day and
transferred to the floor for further management.

On the floor, the patient continued to use BiPAP at night as
she did at home prior to admission.  During the day, she
remained approximately 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula
with oxygen saturations in the low 90s, which is her
baseline.  She did not complain of any shortness of breath,
or wheezing, or increased cough.  She felt that her
respiratory status was improved.

Of note, the patient did have desaturation on her BiPAP
machine at night with her O2 saturations decreasing to
80-89%.  Per the patient at home, she also noticed her O2
saturations on the BiPAP were in the high 80s.  It is likely
that patient needs retitration of her BiPAP setting and will
call Respiratory to do this.  She is oxygenating well
otherwise.

With regards to treatment for her COPD exacerbation, the
patient was switched from IV steroids to p.o. prednisone at
60 mg once a day.  Once discharged, she will continue on a
very slow taper decreasing the prednisone by about 10 mg
every three days.  She is to continue on Atrovent and
albuterol metered-dose inhalers.  Her ceftriaxone was D/C'd
after day four, and she will continue on levofloxacin for
continued treatment of her pneumonia.

2. Hypercholesterolemia:  Patient was continued on Lipitor on
her outpatient dose.

3. Code status:  Patient was full code on admission and at
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is to be discharged to rehab
facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Patient is afebrile,
hemodynamically stable, and is tolerating p.o. with no
complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2. Lobar pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levaquin 500 mg q.d.
2. Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
3. Atrovent metered-dose inhaler two puffs q.6h. as needed.
4. Albuterol two puffs inhaled q.6h. as needed.
5. Prednisone 60 mg q.d. to be tapered by 10 mg every three
days.
6. Colace.
7. Senna.
8. Multivitamins one cap q.d.
9. Spironolactone 25 mg q.d.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is scheduled to see her
pulmonologist on [**2-16**], one week after discharge.
