History of Present Illness:
75 yo man with past medical history significant for CHF (EF
20%), s/p Vtach arrest and PNA 2 weeks ago who now presents
after being found unresponsive at rehab. Family called him as
late as 10:30 the morning of admission, and he was alert and
oriented at his baseline. When his wife arrived at 1:30pm, she
found him with "agonal breathing" responding only to painful
stimuli. He was placed on a face mask and slowly began to wake
up. The pt states he remembers riding in the ambulance and by
the time he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] was A&Ox3.
.
Family states that he had been doing better at rehab and was off
O2. However, three days PTA his BUN/Cr were elevated and they
talked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and agreed to give him a slow infusion
of fluid. Family states he felt better that day, but then the
following day was c/o increased trouble breathing and was placed
back on O2 NC (they estimate 5-10L but are unsure). The daughter
states that when she came to visit she would turn him down to 2L
and he seemed comfortable. Pt also notes he felt like his
abdomen was getting more distended (this is his normal symptom
when he has a CHF exacerbation) and asked his wife to remove the
top button from his pants. They note that since being at rehab
he has kept the head of his bed up when sleeping. They also
remark that in the past he has not always known when his AICD
has fired. He denies any CP, LH, dizziness, N/V today, but does
not remember what happened.

and 40mg IV lasix.

CXR [**2177-1-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse increase in density in the right lung, which could
represent asymmetric pulmonary. However, superimposed pneumonia
cannot be excluded.
2. Patchy opacities in the left mid lung zone and lower lung
zone could be secondary to asymetric pulmonary edema or could
represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2178-1-8**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2178-1-8**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 24448**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24449**] ON [**2178-1-8**] AT 11:35A 11R.

      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
         Reference Range:  Negative.
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).


Brief Hospital Course:
75yo man with PMH significant for afib/atach, s/p AICD/pacer,
cardiomyopathy, s/p cardiac arrest, s/p MVR, HTN,
hypothyroidism, who was admitted for an episode of
unresponsiveness at his rehab facility and respiratory distress.

.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
#) respiratory distress - Pt was initially admitted to the ICU,
and then transferred to the floor once his respiratory status
stabilized.  SOB most likely multifactorial with components of
pneumonia and CHF exacerbation. Pt currently with decreasing O2
requirement (was up to 100%[**Date Range 597**]< now on 4L NC). Pt was diuresed
with Lasix 40 IV on a prn basis.
1) pneumonia -
- covered with azithro and ceftriaxone (now day #5) for
atypicals, gram positives, gram negatives.  Should continue for
14 day course.
- flu was negative
2) CHF - BNP >8000
- continued lasix 40mg IV prn
- baseline BP 90/60, and pt tolerated BP's in the 80's without
symptoms
.
#) unresponsiveness at rehab - most likely cardiac vs
respiratory. ABG on admission 7.52/33/68 on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been
worse w/o [**First Name3 (LF) 597**] at rehab, likely was hypoxic causing
unresponsiveness (as improved with oxygen). Pt w/ AICD/pacer,
but pacer spike occasionally occuring on QRS.
- EP consulted, interrogated pacer, reported that they would not
be able to pace the patient out of MAT
- pt was monitored on tele
- continued amiodarone at 400mg daily
- continued [**First Name3 (LF) **], coumadin, carvedilol for cardiac issues
.
#) CRI - Cr 1.6 on last discharge, 1.4 on admission, but stable
at 1.1 this am. Cr was monitored closely given aggressive
diuresis.
.
#) Decubitus ulcer - continued miconazole powder, wound care
.
#) anorexia - likely secondary to underlying illness, nutrition
consulted. Continued diet w/ soft foods and ensure. Pt does not
like boost.
.
#) constipation - aggressive bowel regimen - colace, senna,
dulcolax, lactulose prn.
.
#) low BP - pt's baseline 90/60. ACEI changed to captopril for
better titration.
.
#) FEN: Cardiac diet. Continued diet w/ soft foods and ensure.
Pt does not like boost.
.
#) PPX: continued coumadin, bowel regimen, ppi
.
#) Dispo: to rehab
