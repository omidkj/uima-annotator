Chief Complaint:
Syncope

upper endoscopy x2


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1057**] is a 59 year-old woman with a history of diabetes and
hypertension who presents with nausea/vomiting and syncope,
found to have a new anemia and likely GI bleed.
.
One week prior to admission, she reports a mild cough and runny
nose; similar to an infection her husband had had earlier.  She
was taking NSAIDS for these symptoms
.
One day prior to admission, patient felt week and dizzy at work.
She also had an upset stomach. She rested some but didn't feel
significantly better so her boss sent her home.
.
At home, while trying to get water, she syncopized. She felt
dizzy and lightheaded beforehand with mild shortness of breath
and chest discomfort. She does not know how long she was out but
did not feel that she hit her head. Later in the morning, she
felt extremely week and did not feel that she was strong enough
to go to work. She later syncopized again.
.
In addition to the above, she reports two episodes of emesis
with possible blood (reports seeing what she felt was a spicy
sauce she had eaten). She is unsure of the amount of emesis
produced.
.
When asked about bloody stools, she is unsure, reporting that
does not usually look at her stools. She does recall one episode
of very dark watery stool one month ago. She denies any
abdominal discomfort or dyspepsia now or in the past. Reports
one episode of diarrhea the day prior to admission. ROS
otherwise negative for fevers, though she has had some mild
chills.
.
Regarding her insulin, she reports not taking any yesterday
evening or this morning as she has had poor PO intake.
.
In the ED, her initial temperature was 97.5, BP 102/75, HR 56.
While getting the second unit of blood, she spiked a temp to
101.1 She also recieved 3 liters of NS. An NG was placed which
showed dark blood which cleared after 500cc. Her finger stick
was >400 and she was started on an insulin gtt.
.
She was initially admitted to the ICU where she had an EGD,
approximately 5units of PRBCs were transfused (one stopped early
due to fever and ?transfusion reaction).  She had a significant
cough which required narcotics for cough suppression.  She felt
that her pulmonary symptoms started to resolve by hospital day
4. She continued to be febrile, however. MICU team consulted ID
who felt that this was most likely chemical pneumonitis and
recommended adding flagyl if she continues to be febrile for
aspiration pneumonia.  They did not feel she was likely to have
pertussis.  Radiologist did not feel CT had the appearance of
aspiration pneumonia however. Flagyl not added given improving
condition. She also had a positive urine culture with e.coli
sensitive to ceftriaxone.

Endoscopy [**2111-2-24**]
Impression: Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus
Ulcer in the angularis (injection, thermal therapy)
Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part
of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: 1. Continue IV PPI drip for 72 hours and then
IV BID as long as she is in hospital.After that she needs po PPI
[**Hospital1 **] for 6 weeks and repeat endoscopy in 6 weeks to document
healing of ulcer
2. Check H. pylori serology and treat if positive
3. Serial HCT and transfuse PRN
.
Chest CT [**2111-2-26**]
1. Extensive right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Additional multifocal areas of consolidation with
peribronchovascular distribution (right lung greater than left).
Considering rapid development in 24 hours, this could
potentially represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema especially
considering the new septal thickening and history of treatment
for GI bleed. However, rapidly progressive multifocal pneumonia
is also possible.
3. Incompletely imaged marked splenomegaly with large
wedge-shaped defect suspicious for an infarct. Dedicated
abdominal imaging with ultrasound or CT would be helpful for
more complete assessment, as communicated by phone to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2111-2-26**].
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, probably reactive in
the setting of pneumonia.
5. Probable fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
Echocardiogram [**2111-2-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
? Transfusion Reaction - Report
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 1057**] experienced
fever
during the transfusion of packed red blood cells. The laboratory
workup
did not reveal any evidence of hemolysis. Of note, her fevers
continued
after stopping the transfusion and new pulmonary infiltrate was
detected
on the chest X-ray the following day. In addition, there was
also
evidence of UTI. Septic reactions are very rare with red blood
cell
