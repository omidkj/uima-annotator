Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L hip spacer removal, washout, and wound closure


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 76 year-old Female with a PMH significant for
coronary artery disease (4-vessel CABG), critical aortic
stenosis with bovine AVR (s/p re-do sternotomy for wound
dehiscence with rib plating), s/p carcinoid tumor resection,
obstructive sleep apnea (on 2L NC at nighttime), history of deep
venous thrombses (IVC filter currently not on anticoagulation),
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, chronic systolic heart failure (LVEF 40%) and anemia
of chronic disease who has a complicated surgical history after
a left subtrochanteric femur fracture repair in [**2197**] with
subsequent opeartive site infection, debridement and irrigation
of a left hip abscess with hardware removal and antibiotic
spacer placement ([**2205-7-30**]) followed by repeat washout and
antibiotic spacer exchange for on-going left septic hip joint
([**2205-8-15**]) now presenting from her rehab facility with persitent
hip pain, spacer dislocation and evidence of a larger open
wound.
.
Her infectious history begins when her left prosthetic joint
speciated S.lugdenesis in [**2-/2204**] requiring washout with a
retention strategy and 6-weeks of IV Vancomycin and Rifampin,
followed by 3-months of Rifampin and Doxycycline.
.
She was subsequently re-admitted on [**2205-7-29**] with on-going left
hip pain and underwent debridement and irrigation of a left hip
abscess, removal of arthroplasty hardware components, antibiotic
spacer placement, with VAC application for wound closure on
[**2205-7-30**]. Tissue cultures at that time again noted S.lugdenesis
and coagulase negative Staphylooccus. Her post-operative course
was complicate by delirium, hypotension and acute renal failure
and episodes of coffee-ground hematemesis without decreased
hematocrit (treated for H. pylori infection) and she was
discharged to rehab on IV Vancomycin for 6-weeks (on [**2205-8-9**]).
.
Her most recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] was on [**2205-8-12**], at which time
she returned from rehab with a decrease in her hematocrit to 22%
and evidence of sanguinous drainage from her left hip. She was
reportedly hypotensive to the 80s in the ED, but responsive to
IV fluids and 2 units of packed red cells. She underwent an
uncomplicated incision and drainage and placement of
articulating antibiotic spacer on [**2205-8-15**]. Tissue cultures from
her prior debridement had speciated Staphylococcus lugdunensis
(similar to her prior hip infection) and her blood cultures from
[**2205-8-12**] speciated two species of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Infectious disease was involved and recommended continuing the
extended course of Vancomycin IV. She was discharged to rehab on
[**2205-8-20**] to continue IV antibiotics.
.
She is now being directly admitted from clinic given on-going
hip pains and evidence of a larger open wound. She was
interviewed with her daughter presents. She has been doing
'okay' while at rehab. She has no fevers or chills, ocassional
sweats at nighttime. She is tolearting PO intake with nausea,
emesis or abdominal pain. She has no headaches or vision
changes. She denies chest pain or trouble breathing. No
numbness, paresthesias or new weakness in the lower extremities.
She denies changes in her bowel habits. Her left hip is painful
and has this pain has been escalating while at rehab; she gains
some relief from Oxycodone PO. She has been working with PT at
rehab, but has not ambulated since her first surgery in late
[**2205-6-28**].
.
ROS: Denies headaches or vision changes. No cough or upper
respiratory symptoms. Denies chest pain, dizziness or
lightheadedness; no palpitations. Denies shortness of breath or
exertional dyspnea. No nausea or vomiting; denies abdominal
pain. No dysuria or hematuria. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias
or neurologic complaints. No leg swelling. Denies rashes or
lesions.
.

sternotomy for wound dehiscence with rib plating, [**10/2203**])
3. Carcinoid tumor of the lung (right middle lobe, s/p

4. Obstructive sleep apnea (oxygen-dependent since lung
resection; utilizes 2L nasal cannula O2 only at nighttime; no
BiPAP)
5. History of chronic congestive heart failure
6. History of deep venous thrombosus (in [**2176**] twice, s/p IVC
filter placement; no chronic anticoagulation since [**2197**])
7. Hypertension

9. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
10. Restrictive lung disease
11. Carpel tunnel syndrome (bilateral decompressions, [**2179**])

.
PAST PERTINENT SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. s/p right middle lobe resection, VATS for carcinoid tumor
([**2195-3-20**])
2. s/p intramedullary rod fixation of left subtrochanteric femur
fracture ([**2197-6-3**])
3. s/p irrigation debridement left hip joint, arthrotomy,
exchange bipolar component left hip hemiarthroplasty ([**2204-3-14**])
