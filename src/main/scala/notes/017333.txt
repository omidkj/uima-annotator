History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1661**] is a 28 yo F with a history of asthma and atypical
chest pain who presented to the ED [**8-23**] with the chief complaint
of facial swelling and sore throat.  She was in her usual state
of health until last week when she went to her PCP for ongoing
[**Name9 (PRE) 11756**] (several months) and new RLE swelling and
parasthesias/weakness.  She states that she was given a
medication and had an x ray but does not know the results or the
name of the medication, which she took only one time.  She did
not have any other symtpoms until 2 days PTA when she developed
tongue burning and swelling after eating a slice of pizza.  She
also developed diarrhea (x 5) and nausea and emesis x 2.  Of
note, her father whom she saw three days earlier also had
similar symptoms.  She recently went to NY, but denies nay
exotic or new foods.
.
The next morning she developed a sore throat and presented to
[**Location (un) 2274**] urgent care where her temperature was reportedly 103.  She
also noticed that the left side of her face was numb and swollen
as well as the bottom of the right side of her face.  She was
sent from the clinic to the ED where EMS reported wheezing at
the apex, but no stridor.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:97.7 HR:88 BP:114/82 RR:20
O2sat:98. Patient was given benadryl 25 mg x 2, famotidine 20 mg
IV, decadron 10 mg IV, afrin, magic mouthwash, and clindamycin
as well as toradol 30 mg IV x 2, and morphine for pain.
Overnight her facial swelling improved but sore throat
continued.  CT scan with contrast showed no parotid
abnormalities, no submandibular abnormalities or tissue
inflammation.  ENT was called to evaluate for sore throat.  Pt
reports no change in voice, some drooling overnight but not
during the day. Throat pain with head turning but no torticollis
or trismus.  The patient remained afebrile in the ED for 24 hrs.

.
On the floor,  pt c/o chest pain and HA. EKG showed NSR, 81 bpm,
nml PR and QRS interval, no ST or t wave abnormalities, good r
wave progression.

([**2188-8-24**]): Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2187-6-27**] no change.
([**2188-8-26**]): Probable sinus rhythm. Low amplitude P waves. ST-T
wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2188-8-24**] there
is probably no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Throat pain/swelling: Patient was initially admitted to the
ICU for an unclear cause of likely allergic reaction versus
angioedema.  She did not report any new medication a few days
prior to the episode or new foods.  C1 esterase deficiency was
also in the differenital, which could affect the gut and cause
GI symptoms.  She was by ENT and there was no indication for
intubation. Her O2 saturations were stable and she did not
exhibit any stridor or subjective dyspnea.  She was transferred
to a general medical floor within hours and her diet was
advanced as tolerated.  She remained stable and her sore throat
was treated with lozenges and "magic mouthwash"
(lidocaine/diphenhydramine/maalox combination).  She was watched
overnight and discharged on a rapid steroid taper and instructed
to follow-up with an allergy specialist to determine a possible
cause of her adverse reaction.  Given her history of asthma and
a high incidence of concurrent atopy, it was highly recommended
to her to procure an EpiPen in cases of extreme shortness of
breath and to avoid taking NSAIDs or aspirin, as these are
common causes of allergies.
.
# Diarrhea: She was complaining of diarrhea prior to admission
that seemed to resolve.  This may have been a viral
gastroenteritis, as her father was also sick with similar
symptoms.
.
# Chest pain: Her chest pain was atypical and nonexertional. She
does not have any cardiac risk factors and no EKG changes. The
H2 blockers and magic mouthwash seemed to improve her symptoms,
indicating a likely GI cause of her chest pain.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure treating you at [**Hospital1 1170**].  You were admitted to the hospital with increased facial
swelling and numbness, fevers, and a sore throat.  We were
initially concerned that you were having an allergic reaction
that may cause you to have difficulty breathing, so you were
brought to the intensive care unit.  When it was felt your
breathing was stable and your facial swelling decreased, you
were transferred to a regular medical floor for further
observation.  While we could not figure out the cause of your
adverse reaction, we would advise you not to take aspirin or
NSAIDs such as motrin or ibuprofen, as there are common causes
of allergic reactions.  As we discussed, many patients with a
history of asthma can also have allergies that are unknown to
them.  We recommend following up with your primary care
physician at [**Hospital6 **] and an allergy specialist
in the next few weeks.  See this information belo
