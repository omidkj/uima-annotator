Admission Date:  [**2141-8-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-9-14**]


Service:  Medicine - [**Hospital1 212**]
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital
for [**Hospital **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with a
history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis, reactive
airway disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer,
who presented initially on [**8-25**] after being found obtunded
at home, in respiratory distress, and hypoxic.  He was intubated
in the field and transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital where he was
hypotensive and started on Levophed and Dopamine pressors.  Blood
cultures grew out gram-negative bacteremia; AST was 533, ALT was
399, alkaline phosphatase was 268, total bilirubin was 14.6,
direct bilirubin was 12.1; INR 1.3; white blood cell count 40.6,

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was positive for gallstones and
positive for mild intrahepatic duct dilatation.  The common bile
duct was not visualized.  An electrocardiogram showed normal
sinus at 100 with left axis deviation, a primary AV block,
however, no ST changes.

The patient was referred to [**Hospital6 256**]
for [**Hospital6 **] for obstructive cholangitis secondary to cholelithiasis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission his heart
rate was 97, blood pressure 121/66, temperature 96.4??????,
respiratory rate was 16-17.  General:  The patient was
intubated and in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  He had
scleral icterus.  His pupils were equal 3-4 mm, although
sluggishly reactive to light.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and
S2.  Regular, rate and rhythm.  He had a 2 out of 6
holosystolic murmur.  Positive S4.  Lungs:  Mild bibasilar
rales.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  There was no right upper quadrant tenderness.
Extremities:  Without edema.  He had 2+ pedal pulses.  His
right hip had a swollen ecchymotic lesion.  Neurological:  He
was not able to follow commands, but he was able to nod to
questions regarding pain.  Skin:  Notable for jaundice.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
He has a history of asbestosis exposure secondary to work.
2.  Asthma.  3.  Prostate cancer.  He has had negative bone
scans for metastases.  4.  Spinal stenosis.  5.  Atrial
fibrillation.  He is not on anticoagulation secondary to fall
risk.  6.  Recent fall in early [**Month (only) 216**] where he suffered a
right hip ecchymosis and swelling; however, there was no
fracture.

LABORATORY DATA:  As mentioned in the HPI above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **]-
[**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for obstructive cholangitis secondary to
cholelithiasis.  [**Last Name (Titles) **] was performed on [**8-26**] that
demonstrated multiple 1-3 cm stones causing partial obstruction
at the common bile duct and postobstructive dilatation.  The
common bile duct was dilated at 2 cm, and a stent was placed.

He was admitted to the MICU for gram-negative sepsis secondary to
suppurative cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis.

His MICU course was notable for resolving cholangitis status post
stent and antibiotic treatment.  He received a 14-day course of
Zosyn for blood cultures that were positive for E-coli, as well
as Aeromonas.  He had no further complications during this
hospital course regarding his cholangitis and his alkaline
phosphatase, and total bilirubin trended downward during
throughout his hospital course.

His hospital course was also complicated by two pulmonary
issues; he was difficult to wean off the vent with intermittent
hypoxia of question etiology (mucous plugging versus congestive
heart failure).  He was extubated on [**8-28**], reintubated on
[**8-30**], and then extubated on [**9-2**].  Chest x-ray
demonstrated a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate versus
atelectasis, and he was therefore treated with a course of
Levofloxacin.

Regarding his history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, he
was maintained on his home dose of Prednisone at 10 mg p.o. q.d.

Regarding his reactive airway disease (in the past he has been on
home oxygen), he was weaned off the vent and currently maintained
on 3 L nasal cannula with the patient suctioning his own
secretions at the bedside.

Regarding infectious disease, the patient received a 14-day
course of Zosyn for the aforementioned positive blood cultures
and Levofloxacin as noted above.  He also received a 7-day course
of Vancomycin for 1 out of 4 bottles being Streptococcus
epidermis that were grown from his right IJ triple-lumen
catheter.  The patient also had HSV1 labialis.  He received a 7-
day course of intravenous Acyclovir, and he has been maintained
on topical Acyclovir since.

His cardiac course was complicated on [**9-1**] with diffuse T-
wave inversions anterolaterally, negative cardiac enzymes, and
associated with sinus bradycardia.  He was anticoagulated and
taken to the Cardiac catheterization Laboratory.  There it was
noted that there were no significant obstructive coronary artery
disease.  His left anterior descending had 20% origin.  Of note
also was moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 55%.  His home dose of Digoxin was
discontinued.  He also has a history of atrial fibrillation for
which he is not anticoagulated secondary to fall risk. The
patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout his hospital course.

Renal course was complicated by acute renal failure with
creatinine elevation to 2.9 (baseline 1.2), likely ATN in the
setting of his presenting hypotension/hypoperfusion.  He was
hydrated with resolution of his creatinine to 1.4 with good urine
output.  This likely represents a new baseline.

His neurologic course was complicated by a question of decrease
in mentation postextubation.  MRI with gadolinium on [**9-4**]
was obtained with no evidence of herpes encephalitis.  There was
a 2 mm left temporoparietal lesion that was deemed to be benign.
On [**9-5**], a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained that
was negative for vegetations.  The thinking was perhaps the
lesions noted in the temporoparietal region of the brain may have
been ischemic from vegetations; however, given a negative
echocardiogram, this idea was dismissed.  He also had a
carotid duplex ultrasound on [**9-8**] which demonstrated
patent carotid arteries bilaterally (plaque was less than
40%).

His ENT course was complicated by mild to moderate dysphagia.
He failed a bedside swallow evaluation and video swallow
evaluation on two occasions, so he was maintained as NPO with an
NG tube placement and tube feeds.  His most recent video-assisted
swallow evaluation, on [**9-12**], demonstrated nonfunctional
swallow with aspiration of a large amount of all consistencies
attempted.  It was felt that his failure was due to his recent
severe illness and herpes labialis, and that there was hope for
recovery in the near future.  The GI team was consulted regarding
potential PEG placement, and they felt that due to the above
reasons, in addition to his recent Aspirin use, the patient would
best be suited by repeating another swallow evaluation next week,
and if he again fails, he is to follow-up in one week with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31960**] [**Name (STitle) 3044**] for PEG placement as an outpatient.

The patient was also seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy during this admission who both recommended ongoing
treatment.

Concerning follow-up issues, the patient was fully ambulatory
prior to admission and will benefit from acute rehabilitation. He
is to have close blood pressure monitoring for hypotension.  He
is to have monitoring of his alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and total
bilirubin, and clinically for signs of further cholestasis.  He
also to have monitoring of white blood cell count as the patient
is on steroids, and monitoring for signs of new infection.  The
patient will also be maintained on supplemental oxygen at
nasal cannula at 3 L.  He currently desaturates with ambulation
on room air.  He will likely need at least 2 L of home oxygen as
he did in the past.  The patient will also n
