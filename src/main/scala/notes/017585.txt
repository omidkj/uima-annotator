Patient was admitted, placed on IV Heparin and nitroglycerin,
as well as scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting.  On
[**7-12**], the patient was brought to the operating room.
Please see the OR report for full details.  In summary, the

the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM.  Her bypass
time was 80 minutes and her cross-clamp time was 44 minutes.
She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred from the
