Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old male status post CABG. Evaluate
for
pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.

AP chest radiograph compared to [**2136-5-14**] at 10:32 a.m. shows
removal of a
left apical chest tube with subsequent small apical
pneumothorax. The
remainder of the exam is unchanged. The heart size remains
moderately
enlarged. Post surgical changes related to a median sternotomy
and CABG are
redemonstrated. No consolidation is identified. Small bilateral
pleural
effusions persist.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) MR. LV inflow
pattern c/w restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated LA
pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**11-23**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis.
There is moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20-25%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Normally-functioning aortic
valve bioprosthesis. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.




Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery preoperatively for IV heparin
and preoperative testing. He was taken to the operating room on
[**5-7**] where he underwent redo sternotomy, AVR and CABG x 2 and
IABP placement, please see operative note for details.It was
determined that his AS was more severe than anticipated, with
some MR still present.  He was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition on epinephrine and levophed. Chest tube was placed
postoperatively for pneumothorax. IABP was dc'd and He was
extubated on POD #1. He was seen by electrophysiology for ICD
consideration but will continue to wear his life vest for 3
months postop. He was transferred to the floor on POD #3.
Mediastinal tubes removed and left pleural tube remained. Pacing
wires removed without incident. Coumadin restarted for chronic A
Fib.  Left chest tube removed with residual small left apical
pneumothorax. He was ready for discharge home on POD #8.
Coumadin to be followed by [**Hospital1 2025**] coumadin clinic as prior to
surgery.
