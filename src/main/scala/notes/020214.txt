Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: Elderly Female with Parkinson's disease admitted for
ORIF s/p mechanical fall with A. fib with RVR, aspiration PNA
during hospitalization now comfort measures only being
discharged with home hospice care.

Plan:

# Comfort Measures: Pt has a long history of Parkinson's disease
and has difficulty clearing her secretions secondary to this. On
admission to the floor from the CCU pt was noted to be hypoxic,
chest x-ray revealed new aspiration PNA. Pt was started on
antibiotics but due to her end stage Parkinson's disease was not
able to clear her secretions adequately and continued to
aspirate and require frequent uncomfortable nasotracheal
suctioning. A discussion made with the family and pt with the
palliative team present, based on her poor and uncomfortable
outcome family and pt decided on comfort measures only and home
hospice care. All non-comforting medications were discontinued
and pt was discharged home with home hospice care and SL
Morphine.
