Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R humeral ORIF
Cervical laminectomy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year old Russian speaking only woman brought from
home after a syncopal episode on day of admission. Through
Russian interpreter, patient states that she had an episode of
chest pain and shortness of breath after lunch and then thinks

In ED, GCS 15, AOx4, FS 130. Patient denied chest pain or
shortness of breath. EKG showed coarse afib vs atach with 2:1
block without no acute ischemic changes. Head CT was negative
for intracranial hemorrhage and no new c-spine fracture on
C-spine. Hip films show no definite fracture. Right arm x-ray
negative for fracture. CTA to rule out PE in setting CP and
syncope. [**First Name3 (LF) 1957**] was consulted. Patient rec'd IV morphine and a
tetanus shot in ED.

XII:  tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations.

Sensory:
Sensory level to pin anteriorly on the left side only at around
C4/T3 (above the breast).  Decreased proprioception on the right
arm/leg, intact on the left hand and only mildly abnormal left
toe. Sensation intact to LT bilaterally.  Decreased vibratory
sense bilaterally distally (intact at the ankles). No extinction
to double simultaneous stimulation.

Motor:
Normal bulk, increased tone lower extremities, right arm is
flacid.  No fasciculations.  Unable to test drift.  No
adventitious movements.  Dropping the phone while attempting to

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 4 VIEWS  [**2134-3-8**] 3:46 PM
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the c-spine, with limited
range of motion. No listhesis seen on these views.
.
MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed
above.
.
MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN
IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus
just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the
subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process,
likely secondary to trauma. No mass or hematoma impinging upon
the nerves within the axilla or medially. The appearance of the
nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is
not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
2. Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid
bursa not completely evaluated on this study.
3. Cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] thoracic injury seen on prior imaging of uncertain cause.
.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT  [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous
demineralization. There are degenerative changes with no
definite fracture. Joint spaces are preserved.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT WRIST: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There are multiple rounded calcific
bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be
fracture fragments.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ELBOW: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There is an enthesophyte at the
posterior olecranon.
.
C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Bulky
calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are
identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate
spinal stenosis.  Multilevel degenerative changes are identified
with disc space and osteophyte formation. Bridging osteophytes
are identified at C7-T2.  The T1-3 processes appear fused.
There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and
superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies
onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
These findings are likely chronic.  There is no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.  The lung apices are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cervical spine fracture.  Extensive
degenerative changes as described above.
.
Head CT: FINDINGS:  There is hyperdensity along the left frontal
vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.  There is
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction.  Hypodensity in the
periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. Small prior infarcts are identified in
the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external
capsule.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite
fracture.
.
CTA: Impression:
1. no PE
2. enlarged pulmonary arteries
3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified
4. calcified hilar lymph nodes
5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally
6. fat density structures in liver and stomach
.
EKG: afib/atach
