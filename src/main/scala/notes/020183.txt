[**3-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. Low lung volumes somewhat limit evaluation. There is
no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Osseous structures are intact. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
.
[**3-24**] FINDINGS: Multifocal areas of consolidation have developed
involving the right middle lobe and both lower lobes, most
marked in the retrocardiac region. Small left pleural effusion
is also new as well as a possible small right effusion. Heart
size remains normal with left ventricular configuration, and the
aorta is tortuous without change.

IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for multilobar pneumonia.

Microbiology:

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 44 year old female with PMH of right thyroidectomy who
presented with fevers and SOB with findings consistent with
pneumonia.
.
#. Pneumonia: The fevers, rigors, and myalgias with positive
sick contacts was most consisitent with a superinfected viral
infection resulting in pneumonia.  Initial chest xray was
negative, but on day of transfer to the floor PA and lateral CXR
showed multifocal pneumonia.   Flu was ruled out with a nasal
swab and a nasal viral panel was not checked given that it would
not change her clinical management.  She was continued on
azithromycin and ceftriaxone for 72 hours for CAP and will be
discharged with moxifloxacin for an additional week.  Blood
cultures have remained negative to date.  Demerol was given once
for rigors.

#. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome with infectious
cause.  She had tachycardia and low blood pressures in the
setting of infection, consistent with SIRS.   She was
aggressively hydrated.  She had sinus tachycardia to 140s likely
related to dehydration and fevers which improved with fluid
repletion.
.
#. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia:  The patient
had unexplained deficiencies in all of her electrolytes.  Her
nutrition status is normal and she has no evidence of
alcoholism.  Given the h/o hemithyroidectomy, the initial
concern was for parathyroid/thyroid abnormality, but her TFTs
and PTH was normal.  Her electrolytes were repleted
aggressively.  Her urine electrolytes did not reveal electrolyte
wasting and her electrolytes remained stable for 24 hours
without repletion.  The abnormalities were likely due to her
acute inflammatory response.
.
#. Hypertension: Her home lisinopril was held given the initial
concern for sepsis, and was restarted on discharge.
.
#. Anemia: Normocytic anemia with no previous hematocrit levels
to trend.  It is likely dilutional in the setting of massive
fluid repletion.   Her anemia labs revealed a borderline low
iron, but elevated ferritin and haptoglobin.  Reticulocyte count
was low at 1.  CBC should be rechecked after recovery from acute
infection.
.
#. Code. Confirmed full code.
.
Follow up:
She is scheduled for follow up with her PCP in the next week for
repeat electrolytes.
She needs repeat CXR in [**2-28**] weeks for verification of
resolution.
She should have repeat CBC in the next month to follow up on
anemia.
