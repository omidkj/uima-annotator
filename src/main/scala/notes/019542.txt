EKG showed ST depressions in lead I, as well as V4 through
V6, and Q's in II, III and F.

PREOP LAB WORK:  Showed a white count 13.8, hematocrit 43.0,
platelet count 331,000.  Additional lab work showed sodium
140, K 4.1, chloride 105, bicarb 22, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0,
blood sugar 116, PT 13.2, PTT 25.3, INR 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac cath
lab on [**3-10**], the next day, which showed the following:
Ejection fraction 20 to 30%, [**2-22**]+ mitral regurgitation,
diffuse left main disease with an 80% lesion, 80% LAD lesion,
subtotal lesion of the circumflex at the takeoff of the OM2,
a totally occluded RCA.  The patient also had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed in the cath lab and immediate CT surgery
consult was obtained, and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] saw the patient
emergently in the cath lab.  On [**3-10**], the patient was
taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for emergency coronary artery
bypass grafting x 5 with a LIMA to the diagonal, vein graft
to LAD, vein graft to ramus, vein graft to PL, and vein graft
to PDA. TEE post bypass showed EF of 40% with mild MR. The
patient was transferred to Cardiothoracic ICU in
stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 2 mcg/kg/min and
a propofol drip at 10.

On postoperative day #1, the patient had been extubated.
Balloon was on [**1-21**], as it was being weaned.  Neo-Synephrine
drip remained at 2.5.  The patient was on an insulin drip at
2.  He continued his perioperative vancomycin.  He was
receiving Toradol for pain and started aspirin also.  He had
a T-max of 101.7, sinus tachycardia at 107, blood pressure
88/55, CVP 17, PA pressures 49/24, cardiac index 2.9.  He had
a good blood gas.  He was satting well on 4 liters nasal
cannula.

Postop labs showed a white count of 16.8, hematocrit 22.3,
platelet count 318,000, K 4.6, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, PT
14.2, INR 1.3.  The patient was alert and oriented, was
progressing well.  His balloon pump was removed later in the
day.  Chest tubes remained in.

On postoperative day #2, the patient had gone into atrial
fibrillation early in the morning.  He received 1 unit of
packed red blood cell transfusion for his low hematocrit.  He
received Lopressor 2.5 x 2, as well as 40 of lasix x 2
overnight.  Diuresis was begun.  His Neo-Synephrine was at
0.3.  He continued on aspirin and vancomycin.  He converted
back into normal sinus rhythm with a pulse of 88 in the
morning of that day, with a blood pressure of 95/60.  Cardiac
index continued to be good at 2.4, after the removal of the
intra-aortic balloon pump the prior afternoon.  Lactate 2.2.
The patient was satting 94% on 3 liters.

He had some crackles, was alert and oriented, but his heart
was regular in rate and rhythm.  His abdominal exam was
benign.  He had 1+ peripheral edema in his legs.  He was
started with regular beta blockade with Lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **],
and continued on lasix po.  He was neurologically intact with
no deficits.

He was seen by physical therapy in evaluation.  On
postoperative day #3, his Neo was weaned off after being at
0.2 overnight.  He was restarted on Plavix, and continued on
the aspirin, Lopressor, and lasix.  He had a blood pressure
of 143/61, sinus rhythm in the 80s, and satting 97% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  His lungs were clear.  His white count
dropped to 12.3.  His hematocrit rose to 25.8.  BUN and
creatinine remained stable at 27 and 1.0.

He was transferred out to FAR-2 where he began working with
physical therapy and the nursing staff on increasing his
ambulation.  The patient continued to do very well over the
ensuing 48 hours on the floor.  He was monitored carefully
with telemetry.  He had good vital signs.  He remained in
sinus rhythm.  He ambulated with physical therapy and did
extremely well.  He did Level V on the morning of [**3-14**]
and was discharged to home on [**3-14**].  He had a blood
pressure of 105/70, in sinus rhythm at 87 with good oxygen
saturations.  He was alert and oriented.  His lungs were
clear.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  His pacing
wires were removed early in the day before he was discharged
