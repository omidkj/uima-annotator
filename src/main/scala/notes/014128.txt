HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old woman with
no significant past medical history who presented to an
outside hospital on [**2113-6-10**] with 8/10 abdominal pain and
nausea and vomiting.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound at
that time showed cholelithiasis and sludge, and the patient
had subsequent cholecystectomy with lysis of adhesions on
[**2113-6-12**].

The patient had a fever to 102.8 postoperatively and elevated
LFTs with an AST of 170, ALT 204, alkaline phosphatase 134,
and right upper quadrant pain.  A MRCP was negative (no
ductal dilatation or filling defects).  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for an ERCP on
[**2113-6-14**], however, before the procedure could be completed,
while she was lying on the table, the patient became hypoxic.
Apparently, a periampullary diverticulum was visualized at
that time with limited views of the pancreatic duct that
appeared normal.

The patient was sent to the MICU and found to be in pulmonary
edema that was resolved with diuresis.  The patient stated
that her severe shortness of breath while on ERCP had started
more mildly even before the transfer to [**Hospital1 190**].  The patient had never before had chest pain,
shortness of breath, orthopnea, or PND.  She said that her
symptoms were relieved with diuresis.  In the MICU, she ruled
out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and a transthoracic
echocardiogram was normal, ejection fraction equals 60-70%
and normal P.A. systolic pressures.  The patient was
transferred to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Service on [**2113-6-15**] for
subsequent ERCP.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
2. Status post cholecystectomy ([**2113-6-12**]).

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives at home alone.  Prior smoker two packs
per day, quit 23 years ago.  Drinks two glasses of alcohol
per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 100.8, [**Known lastname **] pressure
124/70, heart rate 81, respiratory rate 18, and O2 saturation
is 93% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no acute
distress, appears comfortable.  Lungs:  Few bibasilar
crackles, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, however, slight tenderness in the right
epigastric region.  Extremities:  No edema, warm bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  ALT of 180, AST of 85, alkaline phosphatase
200.  CKs:  46, 38, and 30.  Iron 21, TIBC 224, TSH 0.57,
ferritin 724, TRF 172.  T bilirubin 3.3 and downtrending,
amylase 33, lipase 27.

The patient was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Service.  She
remained afebrile, however, had low-grade fevers of 99.0 and
100 throughout her hospital stay.  The patient still had a
slightly elevated white count of about 17.  The patient was
continued on antibiotics, Levaquin and Flagyl throughout the
hospital stay.  The Flagyl was discontinued on the last day
and the Levaquin was continued for three more days on the
patient's discharge.  The patient had no evidence of
pneumonia per chest x-ray, no cough, and no sputum.  The
patient's urinalysis was negative, and the patient had no
diarrhea, no nausea, and no vomiting, and felt well.

The ERCP was performed on [**6-16**], which revealed normal
esophagus, normal stomach, normal duodenum, a single
nonbleeding periampullary diverticulum with large opening was
found on the rim of the major papilla.  Cannulation of the
biliary and pancreatic ducts was successful and deep with a
sphincter tone using a freehand technique.  The common bile
duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, and
biliary radicals were filled with contrast and well
visualized.  The course and caliber of the structures were
normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal
abnormalities, and no filling defects.  A stent was
successfully placed in the common bile duct.  Following stent
placement, there was passage of sludge from the common bile
duct.

The patient did well postprocedure over the weekend and
through Monday.  The patient had a stress MIBI on [**2113-6-19**].
The preliminary report:  The stress portion was normal with
no anginal pain, no electrocardiogram changes, and 7.5
minutes of exercise per standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  The MIBI
portion of the test was also normal showing no perfusion
defects and an ejection fraction of about 83%.  A repeat
chest x-ray was also normal with almost entire resolution of
the bilateral pleural effusions which has been present
following the first ERCP attempt.

The patient was discharged in good condition with followup to
her primary care physician as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2113-6-19**].
