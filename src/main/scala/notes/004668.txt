Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve replacement

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is an 88yo caucasian female with h/o CAD, s/p RCA and
OM1 stenting, PVD s/p right renal artery stenting, stage 4 CKD,
SSS, s/p VF arrest,hypothyroidism, chronic mesenteric ischemia,
and multifactorial gait disorder, and known aortic stenosis. She
reports worsening of shortness of breath over the last [**2-8**]
months. She admits she can only walk to bathroom before having
to rest. Should she continue, she devolops light headedness,
heavy legs, and chest discomfort. She was referred for aortic
valve treatment options. She was deemed not a surgical candidate
due to her extreme risk. She was enrolled in the Corevalve/TAVI
study, underwent the appropriate studies and has been accepted
as a corevalve participant under the Extreme arm of the study.
She is here for elective Corevalve placement.

# PERTINENT STUDIES
- [**7-28**] CXR portable
The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiac silhouette is
normal. The mediastinal silhouette shows aortic knob
calcifications. The hilar contours and pleural surfaces are
normal. No pneumothorax is present. A left-sided pacer
terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right
ventricle. A low thoracic vertebral body compression fracture
has cement from a vertebroplasty within it. The patient is
status post right mastectomy.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intrathoracic process.
.
- [**7-29**] CXR portable
Aortic valve endograft projects over the anticipated location.
There is no
appreciable mediastinal widening. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly
is unchanged since the preoperative study. No pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is new. Vascular congestion is
mild. There is no pulmonary edema. A right skinfold should not
be mistaken for pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements, unchanged.
.
- [**7-29**] ECHO
Conclusions
Preimplantation: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results at the time of procedure.

Postimplantation: New percutaneous stented aortic valve in
position. Aortic valve leaflets opening adequately. Mean
gradient across the new aortic valve is 9 mmHg. Paravalvular
aortic regurgitation is mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+), with trace
central aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified of the
results.
.
- [**7-31**] ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic CoreValve with normal
transvalvular gradients and mild aortic regurgitation. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and preserved global bive
