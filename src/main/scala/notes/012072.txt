CT trachea:
1) Large, nearly 5-cm diameter, lobulated left upper lobe mass,
obstructing the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe
bronchus and resulting in marked narrowing of the left upper
lobe bronchus. The mass is contiguous with left hilar
lymphadenopathy, and is most consistent with bronchogenic
carcinoma in this patient with extensive emphysema.
2) Inflammatory changes distal to the mass with small airways
disease in the adjacent left upper lobe, likely post obstructive
inflammatory/infectious in etiology.
3) Spiculated 11-mm diameter right lower lobe lung nodule with
morphology raising the concern for a synchronous primary lung
cancer. Differential diagnosis includes a metastatic focus as
well as an inflammatory etiology.
4) Nonspecific bilateral bronchial wall thickening and scattered
central lobular opacities, most likely infectious or
inflammatory in etiology.
5) Mild tracheomalacia.
6) Evidence of prior granulomatous infection.
7) When available, multiplanar and 3D images will be reviewed,
and an addendum will be issued to the report.

Chest X-ray [**2168-1-6**]:
Large left-sided hilar lung mass, COPD, but no acute pneumonic
infiltrates.

UE US bilateral [**2168-1-7**]: No DVT of either upper extremity.

CT torso [**2168-1-8**]: 1) Compared to the prior study of 3 days ago,
there has been interval development of numerous focal densities
with irregular margins, at least one with questionable area of
cavitation, consistent with septic emboli or an atypical
infection.
2) Stable appearance of a large lobulated irregular left upper
lobe mass with obstruction of the apical posterior segment of
the left upper lobe bronchus.

Echo [**2168-1-8**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.  No vegetations seen (cannot
exclude).

Cardiac catheterization [**2167-1-12**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries without angiographic evidence of disease.
2. Moderate to severe systolic and diastolic ventricular
dysfunction.

Echo [**2167-1-12**]:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include akinesis of the lower half to [**2-12**]'s
of the LV with a dyskinetic septum.
3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle with
a severe decrease of RV function.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is  not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2168-1-8**], there ae new wall motion abnormalities seen with a
significant decrease in LV and RV function.

Renal US [**2167-1-26**]: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] general
medicine service on [**1-3**] for bronchoscopy and biopsy of the LUL
mass. Repeat CT showed LUL mass obstructing LUL bronchus; mass
contiguous with LUL LAD. Also showed post-obstructive
inflammation, spiculated mass 11 mm RLL, ? evidence of prior
granulomatous disease. Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2168-1-5**]
and bronchial washings/brushings came back suspicious for
squamous cell carcinoma. Heme/Onc were consulted. On HD #3 the
patient spiked fever of 101.4 with an associated leukocytosis to
36.6. On repeat chest CT [**1-7**] there were new multiple pulmonary
opacities. There was a concern that the new opacities on chest
CT could represent septic emboli. This was felt to be unlikely
as blood cultures were negative. Metastatic spread was also
unlikely given very rapid progression over days. New opacities
were likely to represent new pneumonia with focal
consolidations. ID service were consulted. The patient was
started vancomycin/Zosyn empirically. Sputum was sent for
culture, AFB,  nocardia and fungal culture and subsequently grew
Pseudomonas. The patient initially improved on Vancomycin and
Zosyn. WBC started to decrease. Trans-thoracic echo on [**2166-12-29**]
was negative for vegetations, EF was >60%, and [**1-11**] + AR, 2+ TR.
On HD #9, [**2167-1-11**], the patent was noted to be somewhat
dyspneic, with SaO2= 96% on 5L, with bilateral crackles, L>R.
Was thought to be intravascularly "dry" with FE NA of <0.2%, not
responding to Lasix trials. The next day she developed tachypnea
on the floor with RR of 36, became diaphoretic and exam was
consistent with CHF exacerbation. ABG - 7.22/94/60 on 35% FM,
increased from 7.45/50/111 about 1 day earlier. The p
