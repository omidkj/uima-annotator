Date of Birth:  [**2112-3-3**]        Sex:  M

Service:  ORT


DIAGNOSIS:  Cervical spinal cord injury with C5 burst
fracture.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Anterior and posterior spinal fusion,
cervical, tracheostomy, PEG placement, posterior spinal
decompressive laminectomy and debridement, central line and
then eventual PICC line placement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  His 56 year old male was admitted to the
Trauma Service on the [**2168-8-19**] after sustained
a cervical spine injury during an intoxication event. The C5
burst fracture was associated with a central cord spinal cord
syndrome. He was medically stabilized and underwent cervical
spine stabilization procedure on the [**8-21**]. A C5
vertebrectomy and fusion was performed on the [**2168-8-20**]. In addition, a posterior spinous process
wiring stabilization was also performed. The immediate
postoperative course was unremarkable with extubation
proceeding on the 29th. Due to difficulties with secretions,
percutaneous tracheostomy was placed on [**2168-9-1**]. The
anterior and posterior fixation was performed on [**8-22**]. On the [**7-30**], decreased movement to the lower
extremities was noted and the MRI scan confirmed compression
of the cervical spinal cord and emergent posterior
decompression with removal of the hardware and laminectomy
from levels C3 to C7 was performed. Findings at the time of
surgery included hematoma in the epidural space and also
purulent material in the subcutaneous space adjacent to the
hardware and bone graft fixation. Eventually, this culture
from intraoperatively grew out an Enterobacter species and he
has been treated with piperacillin and ceftazidime
intravenously. Perioperative cefazolin was the initial
antibiotic coverage. Only low grade temperatures were
documented. The antibiotics recommended included vancomycin,
piperacillin and ceftazidime. MRSA screen was negative and on
[**8-24**], Clostridium difficile toxin screen was negative. The
culture from the [**7-30**] grew out the Enterobacter
species. Zosyn was initiated along with vancomycin from the
time of surgery and ciprofloxacin was also added for the
acute perioperative coverage. The Zosyn, Cipro and vanco were
continued until [**9-1**] where he received four days of Zosyn
and two days of ciprofloxacin. The vancomycin was
discontinued on the [**8-3**] and Cipro and Zosyn were
also continued.  Ciprofloxacin was changed to levofloxacin on
the [**8-3**] and Zosyn was continued.

He tolerated the trach procedure. The anterior wound healed
and the suture was removed on postoperative day 10.
Eventually, the posterior incision healed well and the
staples were removed on postoperative day 10 after the
posterior procedure. No signs of active wound sepsis
occurred. Repeated transfusion for asymptomatic anemia were
performed and multiple replacements of magnesium have been
performed during his hospitalization.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are metoprolol 100
mg po tid, lorazepam 1 mg IV tid, Atrovent MDI two puffs q6h,
famotidine 20 mg IV q12h, olanzapine 5 mg po Q.D., Zosyn 4.5
g IV q8h and levofloxacin 500 mg IV q24h and now
metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h. The metronidazole should be
continued as long as the other antibiotics are continuing.
The duration of antibiotics from the time of discharge is an
additional four weeks of therapy via the PICC line. Tube
feedings have been initiated for the last 48 hours. Diarrhea
occurred and this was felt to be due to the strength of the
tube feedings and they were cut in half and free water was
added. However, in light of the C. difficile toxin positive
screen, the tube feedings may be advanced per his nutritional
requirements and tolerance up to the goal of 70 cc per hour
with a 300 cc water flush every 12 hours.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The care needs include trach care
and this has been attended by the General Surgery team prior
to his transfer, fitting a size 7 cuffed tube which they felt
could be inflated or not inflated. Also, the PEG is the
source of nutrition and for PO medications. A PICC line in
the left brachium was inserted by the radiology
interventionists and verified to be in position and has been
successfully used for installation of intravenous medications
and this will be continued for the four week duration of
antibiotics.

The cervical collar should be also used for an additional
four weeks. After three to four weeks, follow-up with
Infectious Disease should be performed with follow-up of CBC,
sed. rate, C-reactive protein. Orthopedic follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 363**] will be performed in four weeks with AP and lateral x-
ray of the cervical spine to assess healing. The cervical
collar should remain in place full-time until this follow-up
is completed.

Mobility is important for pulmonary toilet and he has
successfully been mobilized to the seated position out of the
chair.
