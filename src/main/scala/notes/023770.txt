Discharge Date: [**2117-11-2**]
Sex:  F
Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
status post a fall from 6 stairs due to tripping. There was
no definitive loss of consciousness. She was transferred to
[**Hospital3 51769**] Hospital in hemodynamically stable condition.
There was a report of weakness and cord compression and she
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, asthma, coronary artery
disease, urinary tract infections, vaginal prolapse,
pneumonia and thyroid disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Thyroidectomy in [**2052**], hysterectomy
in [**2076**], rectal surgery in [**2110**], CABG and valve surgery in
[**2114**].

MEDICATIONS:  Advair, lisinopril, verapamil, hydroxyzine,
Prevacid, calcitriol and Ditropan.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 96.8, heart rate 72,
blood pressure 130/47, respiratory rate 17, 100% on room air.
On physical examination, she was awake, alert, following
commands. Lungs were clear. Heart was regular. Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended. Her hand grip was diminished
bilaterally at 3/5. Lower extremity strength was [**6-17**]
bilaterally. Her right eye was swollen with gross ecchymosis.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 10.8, hematocrit
28.6, platelets 348. Chemistry - sodium was 148, potassium
3.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 21, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 178. Urine Tox was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on steroids at the
outside institution. CT of the head showed a right frontal
contusion. CT of the face showed orbital fracture with
fragment into the orbit, additional contusion and question of
entrapment of the medial rectus, superior oblique. CT of the
spine showed severe degenerative disease. C3-C4 and C4-C5 had
some canal narrowing. The orthopedic spine service was
involved and determined the patient had central cord
syndrome, spinal stenosis. Ophthalmology service was also
involved and they determined that they would not need any
emergent repair of the orbit at that time. The patient was
admitted to the intensive care unit for close neurological
checks. The patient was brought to the operating room and had
a cervical anterior and posterior fixation. This was done on
[**10-17**] for central cord syndrome. The patient was
intubated through the admission and eventually became very
difficult to wean from the ventilator. Tube feeds were
initiated early in the hospital course which were tolerated
well. We attempted several CPAP trials which were tolerated
temporarily, but we would eventually have to switch her back
to assist-control several times. The patient had a
percutaneous tracheostomy and a percutaneous gastrostomy tube
placed by the trauma surgery service. This was done on
[**10-23**]. The patient was started on tube feeds well at
goal. The patient did have some erythema of the trachea for
which vancomycin and Zosyn were started. This erythema
significantly improved. The patient also had MRSA from the
sputum for which vancomycin was again started. She had a
period of diarrhea and the C. diff's were negative, but
Flagyl was started for 6 days empirically and she did well
from that as the diarrhea stopped. The patient had a PICC
line placed on [**10-26**]. The patient will need gradual
wean from the ventilator.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. The patient had a hematocrit
of 23.5 on the day of discharge. It was ranging in the low
range and we elected not to perform a transfusion. Please
check hematocrit at outside institution and if necessary and
feel appropriate, may use blood transfusion. White blood cell
count of the patient was hovering in the 10,000-15,000 range
for approximately 10 days. The patient was afebrile for most
of this time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post central cord syndrome and
cervical fixation, status post tracheostomy, status post PEG.

albuterol nebs p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., iron 325 mg
