Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
Intracranial hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
67F reportedly being transported from Nursing Home to ambulance
by stretcher for anticipated dialysis when she reportedly fell
to the ground, striking her head. She was found to be unconcious
and was intubated at the scene, then transferred to [**Hospital1 3325**] where a CT of the head was obtained. This study
demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and a large left temporal
subdural hematoma. A significant left to right midline shift was
also noted. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by
Neurosurgery and Trauma services. In the ER here at [**Hospital1 18**], she
was unresponsive with fixed and dilated pupils. She was noted to
have minimal brainstem reflexes. No other traumatic injuries
were noted. An emergent Neurosurgery consultation was obtained
in the ER.  After review of the films and the patient, their
recommendations were that the patient had incurred catastrophic
injuries that could not be reversed with surgical or medical
management. They explained to the patient's family that a brain
injury of this degree carried an extremely poor prognosis. She
was admitted from the ER to the Trauma SICU for further
managment.

Brief Hospital Course:
The decision was made by the family to change to the patient's
code status to DNR upon admission, however they wanted to
maintain supportive measures until family members could come to
a conclusion regarding the plan of care. The patient was
admitted to the Trauma SICU where she remained intubated and was
maintained on IVF's. No invasive interventions were performed.
Repeated neurologic examinations confirmed initially minimal
brain stem reflexes, and later in the hospital course, absent
brain stem reflexes. At no time did she exhibit any signs of
higher cortical functioning or neurologic improvement. There
were several conversations held by the ICU team, Neurosurgery,
and Neurology, with the family regarding prognosis. On hospital
day #5 she was noted to have absent brain stem reflexes and she
was not noted to be triggering the ventilator for over 24 hours.
The family then decided to change to plan of care to comfort
measures only after extensive discussion. She expired shortly
thereafter, with time of death being pronounced at 3:01PM.
