Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo homeless M w/PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis and HCC
that presented to the ED in septic state following witnessed
tonic clonic seizure. Volume resuscitated with NS and started on
broad spectrum abx. Stabilized and transferred to floor. Treated
for aspiration PNA with resolution of fevers by time of
discharge.
.
Active Issues:
#SIRS: Pt was hypotensive with SBP in 70's and fever to 102.7
when presenting to the ICU. BP responded well to volume
resuscitation and pressures stabilized on first day of
admission. Pt had no recollection of events leading up to
admission. Fever resolved while on vancomycin and zosyn, but
returned on the floor (see below). Thought to be caused by
aspiration pneumonia, however, initial chest xray unrevealing.
Patient was pan-cultured, however, all cultures remained
negative. Although fever recurred, no hypotension, tachycardia,
or leukocytosis while on the floor.
.
#Fever: Developed recurring fevers to 101-102 despite being on
broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and zosyn. Wide
differential included infection, medications, collagen vascular
disease, and neoplasm. Switched to PO levofloxacin and
metronidazole to treat for aspiration pneumonia after CXR
positive for BLL infiltrates and physical exam significant for
productive cough and b/l dense crackles. Despite this fevers
persisted, so he received a CT torso to evaluate for HCC
metastases vs. occult abscess. This was unrevealing. At time of
discharge, he had been fever free for >24 hours, and had
completed 3 days of a 10 course of metronidazole and flagyl.
.
#Aspiration PNA: See above. Treated with empiric vancomycin and
zosyn, then switched to levofloxacin/flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia. Received 3 days of 8 day course, and given
prescription for outpatient meds.
.
#EtOH Withdrawal/Abuse: Patient seizure likely [**1-28**] EtOH
withdrawal as head CT negative and no documented history of
seizure in the past. Seizure resulted in L. parietal scalp
laceration, that was closed with staples. Although patient
states that he has not had alcohol in months, his BAL was 64 in
the ED. Patient did not initially score on CIWA in MICU,
however, did so for several days on the floor. Had not scored in
>48 hours prior to discharge. Pt ad no recollection of events
prior to admission. This is consistent with Korsakoff's
dementia, though no ataxia, opthalmoplegia or confabulation.
Patient was started on thiamine and folate in-house, and
discharged on these medications.
.
#C1 Fracture: CT at time of admission significant for C1
fracture. [**Month/Day (2) **] by neurosurgery in ICU, and instructed to
wear neck collar for no less than 3 months. If he takes this off
prior to this, there is chance of subluxation, paralysis, and
death.
.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient Cr on admission was 3.0. Resolved immediately
after administration of IVF. Back to baseline of 0.5-0.7 for
several days prior to discharge.
.
Chronic Issues:
#Hypertension: Patient BP was difficult to control. Started on
lisinopril 20mg qday per note in WebOMR, however, increased to
40mg qday at time of discharge. SBP 117 on
discharge.
.
#HCC: He is known to have hepatocellular carcinoma. RUQ U/S at
time of floor transfer significant for enlarging lesion from
prior exam suspicious for HCC. AFP increased to 944 from 326 in
[**Month (only) 116**]. Patient is being followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital 2082**]. Outside records were obtained, which show
