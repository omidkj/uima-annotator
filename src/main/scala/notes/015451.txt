Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive
Hematemesis
Odynophagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
63 year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, emphysema,
presenting from home with a few days of hemoptysis vs.
hematemesis brought in after syncopal episode at home. He states
he was in his usual state of health until two days prior to
presentation, when he developed malaise and cough. Cough was
initially productive of white sputum, which turned dark
yesterday. This morning he produced bright red blood - it is
unclear if this was hemoptysis or hematemesis. He states he
attributes it to sputum because it was small in quality, but
does endorse wretching with vomiting (patient somewhat unclear
historian regarding this). His wife states more clearly that he
had several wretching and vomiting episodes.

He recalls getting up to cough vs. vomit blood, and then passed
out. Remembers then being in ambulance on way to OSH. Wife
apparently found him in bathroom, unclear how long he was down.


Per patient's wife, patient's best friend died on Saturday and
he had a large drinking binge on Saturday. He normally drinks 2
liters of liquor a week at least, plus extra vodka in between.
He then stopped drinking completely since Saturday ([**2139-2-28**]).
She noticed he had been vomitting profusely with large amounts
of frequent wretching. On [**2139-3-2**], the pt developed a cough.
Then on [**2139-3-3**] the patient began to vomit blood and later cough
up blood. The same day the wife heard a loud thump and scream
from his husband while in the bathroom. She went upstairs to
find him "shaking all over". She thinks he was having a seizure.
He was unresponsive, moving all four extremities in a rhythmic
shaking pattern. No bowel/bladder incontinence. This episode
lasted 1-2 minutes. After he stopped shaking he was still
unresponsive for 10-20 minutes. He finally started coming to in
the ED, about 1.5 hours later.

He was brought to an outside hospital. Nasogastric lavage was
attempted but nasogastric tube was not successfully placed. Hct
was 42. Reportedly guaiac positive. Received antiemetics and
potassium. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 98.2, HR 133, BP 138/76, RR
22 98% 2L. Continued to have sinus tach throughout stay. ECG
unremarkable otherwise. Patient was given vancomycin 1g, zosyn,
pantoprazole 80 mg, lorazepam 4 mg, banana bag. CTA negative for
PE. Was guaiac negative here. Admitted to MICU given unclear how
stable patient was from bleeding/respiratory standpoint.

Past Medical History:
- Pleural asbestos related disease - pleural calcifications and
scarring seen on radiology. Also reports having had asbestos
related pleural effusion in past.
- COPD/emphysema. Significant disease by imaging, unknown PFTs.

- Skin cancers of face and chest (presumed nonmelanoma but not
entirely clear)
- EtOH abuse
- s/p umbilical hernia repair.

Social History:
Alcohol abuse as above; reports drinking [**3-19**] very large rum and
cokes daily, none since Saturday/Sunday binge. Smokes 1 PPD x
many years, more at times and has quit at other times. Previous
asbestos exposure working in a shipyard. Lives with wife.

Family History:
Brother died of cirrhosis, other brother with lung cancer.
Mother had question of colon cancer.

[**2139-3-3**] CT CHEST/AB/PELVIS
CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute
aortic process.  The heart is normal in size and shape. No
lymphadenopathy is seen. The airway is centrally patent. There
is diffuse thickening of the esophagus, which is more pronounced
distally. An underlying malignancy cannot be excluded. No
cardiophrenic lymphadenopathy is seen. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions. Pleural calcifications are also noted, which
is likely related to prior asbestos exposure.

Lung windows are notable for significant paraseptal and
centrilobular
emphysema. No definite nodule, mass, or consolidation is seen.
Prominent
diaphragmatic calcification along the pleural surfaces with
associated
scarring is noted.

ABDOMEN: Within segment IV of the liver, there are three
discrete liver
lesions, the largest of which measures approximately 3.1 x 3.2
cm with
peripheral enhancement and central low density concerning for
necrosis.
Overall, this appearance is concerning for metastatic lesion. A
second lesion abutting the left portal vein, best seen on series
2C, image 123 measuring approximately 2.4 x 1.3 cm. A third
lesion is seen abutting the liver capsule in segment IVB on
series 2B, image 136. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic
biliary ductal dilation. The gallbladder is normal. There is
trace free fluid inferior to the liver edge. The spleen appears
normal. A small hiatal hernia is noted. The stomach is mostly
collapsed. The pancreas appears atrophic without focal lesion or
ductal dilation. Adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable
bilaterally. Kidneys enhance symmetrically.  There is a tiny
hypodensity within the right kidney mid-upper pole of series 2B,
image 135, too small to accurately characterize. Bilateral
perinephric stranding is nonspecific. The abdominal aorta and
major branch vessels are widely patent with scattered
atherosclerotic calcifications noted. There is artial
duplication of the IVC merging at the level of the left renal
vein.

There is evidence of prior abdominal surgery with multiple clips
noted along the abdominal wall.

PELVIS: Small bowel demonstrates no evidence of ileus or
obstruction.
Colonic diverticulosis is noted without evidence of
diverticulitis.
Evaluation for colonic neoplasm is limited given the lack of
bowel distention.
There is no free fluid in the deep pelvis. The urinary bladder
is moderately
distended and appears unremarkable. The prostate gland measures
approximately
4.1 cm in transverse dimension and contains coarse
calcifications. There is
no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

BONES: No worrisome lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Three discrete liver lesions, with appearance concerning for
metastatic
disease. Given the peripheral location, the lesions would be
amenable to
percutaneous biopsy.
2. Diffuse thickening along the distal esophagus which in the
setting of
hematemesis require further evaluation by endoscopy.
3. Extensive paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema with
evidence of
asbestos-related dis
