L-SPINE (AP & LAT)  [**2163-1-6**] 3:09 PM
FINDINGS: There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebrae.
Severe multilevel degenerative disc disease is evident, most
notably at L3-L4 and L5-S1. Extensive facet arthropathy is noted
at the lumbosacral junction. Grossly alignment is preserved. No
suspicious osteolytic or blastic lesions are identified. The
sacrum and sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. Incidental note
is made of an indwelling left-sided nephrostomy.

IMPRESSION: Extensive multilevel degenerative disease with no
suspicious osseous lesions evident.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2163-1-6**] 2:38 PM

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color Doppler, Doppler waveform evaluation
were performed of the left lower extremity. The common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were interrogated and
demonstrated normal compressibility, color Doppler signal, and
Doppler waveforms.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the veins
interrogated above.
.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT  and TIB/FIB [**2163-1-6**] 3:09 PM
FINDINGS: Mineralization is within normal limits. The hip, knee,
and ankle joints are grossly appropriately aligned. Mild
degenerative changes are noted at the knee. The ankle mortise is
congruent. The talar dome is intact. There is diffuse soft
tissue swelling throughout the lower extremity particularly at
the ankle and anterior to the proximal tibia. Extensive vascular
calcification is incidentally noted.

IMPRESSION: No underlying fracture. Mild degenerative change in
the knee. Soft tissue swelling as above.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2163-1-6**] 3:09 PM
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are further diminished. There is no
consolidation. There is mild central vascular congestion,
although no overt edema is seen. Again noted are prominent
pulmonary arteries. There is tortuous aorta. The cardiac
silhouette size remains enlarged but stable. There is pleural
thickening along the lateral aspects of both hemithoraces. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident. Median sternotomy
wires are stably aligned.

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
ECG ([**1-6**]) - A-fib@56, LAD, RBBB, Q's II/III/aVF. (no
significant change vs. previous)
.
.
MRI L-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bony metastasis or acute compression fracture.
2. Mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L3-4 level.
3. Moderate-to-severe left foraminal and mild to moderate right
foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 level with disc and facet
degenerative changes.
..
..
MRI hips:
FINDINGS: The ilia are not completely imaged in coronal STIR or
axial sequences. There is abnormal bone marrow signal within the
left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], extending to the articular surface at the left
sacroiliac joint and to the medial acetabular wall and roof. The
marrow signal within the sacrum is within normal limits, so is
in the right ilium except for a small focus of T1 low signal and
T2 high signal in the medial acetabulum, which likely represents
a subchondral cyst. The heterogeneous marrow signal within the
proximal femoral shafts likely represents hematopoietic marrow.
The bone marrow signal within the visualized vertebrae is
unremarkable except for mild endplate changes. There is
increased T2 signal within the adductor and obturator internus
muscles, left greater than right, and within left gluteus medius
and minimus muscles.

The urinary bladder is contracted, and shows nodular thickening,
which is concordant with the patient's history of bladder
carcinoma. There is also dilatation of the visualized distal
ureters bilaterally. There are multiple shotty and mildly
enlarged perirectal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest
measuring 11 mm in the right iliac chain.

IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal left ilium, which likely represents a non-displaced
fracture; however, metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Atypical radiation changes are much less likely. Edema within
the adductor and gluteus muscles as described above. Ilia are
not completely imaged. We will be happy to complete the MRI of
the pelvis at no additional charge; however, followup CT would
be better to assess for fracture.
2. Findings in the bladder are concordant with the patient's
history of bladder carcinoma. There is distal bilateral
hydroureters.
3. Multiple shotty and mildly enlarged lymph nodes, the largest
measuring 11 mm in the right iliac region.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: LEFT ILIAC BONE LESION.

Reason: Assess for CVA/bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with h/o Afib and metastastic bladder CA, p/w
lethargy and acute change MS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess for CVA/bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST

fibrillation, metastatic bladder carcinoma, presenting with
lethargy and acute mental status change. Assess for hemorrhage,
CVA.

COMPARISON: Not available.
