History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is a 79-year-old right-handed man with an
unknown medical history who presents with acute right sided
weakness, found to have a left thalamic intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. He is a poor historian and alternate sources of
information are limited, but it appears he was in his USOH until
around 8 pm last evening. He had just finished dinner, stood up
to go upstairs, and suddenly fell. He did not lose consciousness
or suffer head trauma. He believes he fell due to sudden
weakness. He was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where he was noted
to
have a right facial droop, right-sided weakness, and dysarthria.
He was also noted to have SBP in the 200s. CT showed an
intraparenchymal hemorrhage (images reviewed) in the left basal
ganglia. He was placed on a nipride gtt and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Here, his initial BP was 220/96; the nipride gtt was titrated
up.


Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] headache, loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. [**Last Name (Titles) **] difficulties
comprehending
speech.  [**Last Name (Titles) **] numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. [**Last Name (Titles) **] difficulty with gait.

On review of systems, he [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] recent fever or chills.  No
night
sweats or recent weight loss or gain. [**Last Name (Titles) **] cough, shortness of
breath.  [**Last Name (Titles) **] chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  [**Last Name (Titles) **]

[**2160-1-6**] CT/CTA head:
HEAD CT:  A region of acute hemorrhage is identified in the left
thalamus,
measuring 21 x 17 mm and exerting moderate mass effect on the
atrium of the
left lateral ventricle.  Focal hypodensities are noted in the
pons and in the
white matter of the frontal lobe, reflecting old lacunar
infarcts.  The right
lateral ventricle, third and fourth ventricles are normal in
caliber and
configuration.  No fractures are identified.

HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The carotid and vertebral arteries and their
major
branches are patent.  There is a region of focal narrowing in
the left
internal carotid artery just before it enters the carotid canal.
 No intimal
flap is seen, but the location and configuration of this
narrowing suggests
prior dissection.  There is no evidence of aneurysm formation.
The distal
cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm in diameter on
the left and 5
mm in diameter on the right.  Incidental note is made of a
fenestrated
right vertebral artery with the right PICA arising from the
smaller component.

IMPRESSION:

  1.  Acute left thalamic hemorrhage exerting moderate mass
effect on the left
lateral ventricle.  Old lacunar infarcts in the pons and frontal
lobe white
matter suggest hypertension as an etiology.

2.  Focal narrowing of left internal carotid artery just before
it enters the
carotid canal with no evidence of acute dissection, but features
suggesting a
prior dissection.

3.  No aneurysm, acute thrombus or acute dissection.

MRI head [**2160-1-7**]:
FINDINGS:  Again seen is acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus
with
surrounding vasogenic edema, resulting in minimal mass effect on
the left
lateral ventric
