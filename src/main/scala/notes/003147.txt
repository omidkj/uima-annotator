Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
 transferred from OSH for ? urgent cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with h/o DM, SVT, afib not on anticoagulation who
presented to an OSH on [**2104-2-16**] with weakness, decreased
appetitie, cough and increase in chronic back pain. She was
found to have an NSTEMI with initial trop I of 1.[**Street Address(2) 71258**]
depressions in precordial leads of 3mm. She was placed on nitro
gtt, heparin gtt and given asa, plavix, lopressor. Later in the
evening she began to have respiratory distress requring a
non-rebreather. She was given lasix for diuresis and had an ABG
of 7.46/34/64/23 with an O2 sat of 93% on NRB. She continued to
have ST depressions and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ? urgent
catheterization. Her second set of enzymes showed a troponin I
of 2.81. Her hospital course was also complicated by her afib
which became rapid with HR to 120-160's. She was rate controlled
with IV lopressor. Her digoxin level was 0.4mg on admission.
Also of note, her initial blood sugar was 457 but this came down
to the 200-300 range with insulin.
.
Per her daughter, the patient has had SOB, palpitations,
syncope, and weakness. She denies CP, DOE, PND or orthopnea.
Since arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was in afib with RVR and given IV
lopressor 5mg x2 to bring her rate down to the 80's.

conjunctiva

Abdomen: +BS, soft NTND
Ext: cool. no edema, pulses 2+ DP


Pertinent Results:
[**2104-2-17**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe infiltrate. Given the
diffuse increased interstitial markings, the chronicity of this
process cannot be assessed.
.
[**2104-2-18**] CXR: There has been an improvement in the appearance of
the chest with decrease in the prominence of the interstitial
markings bilaterally. The patchy air space space disease in the
right upper lobe has significantly improved. Given the rapidity
of the change, this likely represents some clearing of
interstitial edema.
.
[**2104-2-19**] ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (given small body size). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2104-2-19**] Cath: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with miuld
disease in the LAd and chronic total occlusion in the LCX.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
[LM - no disease;  LAD - 50%;  LCx - total occulsion;  RCA/PDA -

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33352**] is an 80 year old female without documented CAD who
presented with demand ischemia and flash pulmonary edema likely
from afib with RVR. Transferred from OSH for management of
NSTEMI and afib with RVR.
.
# cardiac:  Ms. [**Known lastname 33352**] presented to the OSH with ST depressions
and rising cardiac enzymes in the setting of afib with RVR.  Her
respiratory status decompensated requiring a non-rebreather for
adequate oxygenation at the OSH. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for possible urgent catheterization.  Upon arrival she was noted
to have a questionable RUL infiltrate and definate pulmonary
edema in addition to her afib with RVR.  It was unclear if a
community acquired pneumonia added strain to her heart or if the
rapid a fib alone initiated the event.
.
- Pulmonary edema:  She was given furosemide for diuresis and
very quickly was weened off of the non-rebreather to a nasal
cannula and subsequently to room air.  She had an ECHO which
showed a LVEF of 60% with some AS and MR and trace AR. She does
not appear to have CHF and her pulmonary edema was likely
secondary to strain on her heart from the rapid afib.  Once she
was diuresed, she remained euvolemic and did not require further
furosemide doses.  She was continued on and ACEI and BB.
.
- Atrial fibrillation:  Her afib was rate controlled by
titrating up metoprolol to 150mg TID and adding amlodipine back
from her home regimen.  She was monitored on telemetry and had
no events other than her afib.  She was not anticoagulated at
home secondary to fall risk. We spoke with her PCP who confirmed
this to be true saying that she has had several falls and is
quite unsteady on her feet. She was treated with a heparin gtt
initially but she is not being sent out on warfarin given her
baseline mild dementia and h/o falls giving her a high risk of
bleeding complications.  She is being treated with ASA for
anticoagulation.  She was on digoxin for her afib at home.  This
medication was discontinued in favor of a beta blocker for rate
control as it will be beneficial given her CAD as well.
.
- CAD:  For her NSTEMI, she was loaded with plavix and kept on a
heparin gtt (also for her a fib).  She went to the cath lab and
was found to have obstruction of the LCX and mild disease in the
LAD and RCA.  Her CK peak at 264. The decision was made to
medically manage her CAD without intervention.  She was
continued on aspirin, BB, ACEI and statin along with amlodipine
for rate and BP control.
.
- Cardiac medications: at discharge she was placed back on her
combination medication of amlodipine and benzapril as well as
fluvastatin.  Her new medication includes metoprolol 150mg TID.
Digoxin has been discontinued.
.
# Infection: Ms. [**Known lastname 33352**]' initial CXR suggested she had a RUL
infiltrate suggestive of community acquired pneumonia as well as
pulmonary edema. She was treated with levofloxacin.  Subsequent
CXR showed almost complete resolution of the RUL infiltrate
suggesting it was more likely pulmonary edema than infiltrate,
but given her initial temp of 100.5 on admission, she was
continued on a full 7 day course of antibiotics.   All blood
cultres and urine cultures showed no growth to date on
discharge.
