History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old woman with h/o afib, copd, and htn
recently admitted to the MICU and treated for presumptive
pneumonia.  She originally presented to ED on [**2146-3-2**] c/o cough,
back pain, and loose stools.  She says that she had begun
coughing the day prior to admission with increased use of her
inhaler and that many people in her elderly [**Hospital3 **]
facility had been ill with a cough.  Her back pain started at
the same time, woke her from sleep, was located in the middle of
her back, sharp in quality and w/o radiation. After 3 loose
stools, she called her son, saying she wasn't feeling well, and
he brought her to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  She denies fevers, chills,
shortness of breath, sputum production, or wheezing.
.
In the ED she was worked up for back pain, including a neuro
evaluation for ? epidural abscess in the setting of back pain
and an elevated white count. Neuro found her to have mild
peripheral neuropathy consistent with her age and had low
suspicion for epidural abscess.  A CT of the abd/pelvis was
performed which did not show colitis or mesenteric ischemia.
given her h/o afib, there was concern of mesenteric ischemia but
CT neg. An MRI of the spine was performed to r/o abscess, but
was technically limited due to movement artifact from cough and
abscess could not be ruled out.
.
Deteriorating hemodynamics following sedation for MRI included
hypotension tot he 70's and HR in 100-110 range/ afib where it
had been all day. ED gave 4L NS over 2 hours w/o response from
blood pressure. O2 sat dropped 92 to high 80s on 6L. ABG
performed with 7.35/39/61. As MAP remained < 60 with SBP ~70-
low 80s pt was started on Dopamine. With this HR increased to
130s. BIPAP started. She was admitted to the MICU on [**2146-3-3**].

In the MICU she her pressure was supported with levoquin, her
diltiazim and coumadin were held.  She was treated with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed CAP.  She was reported
to have an aspiration episode in the MICU.  After 3 days her
hemodynamics stablized and she was called to the floor.

Past Medical History:
1)Atrial Fibrillation - rate controlled, on coumadin, never
cardioverted
2)COPD - no home o2
3)HTN - clinic BPs usually 120s/70s
4)Depression
5)s/p back surgery [**50**] years ago, tumor resection on spinal cord.
did not received chemo or radiation per son.
6)osteoporosis

EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Right
bundle-branch block. Possible anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2143-5-27**] right bundle-branch block is new.

.
Echocardiogram.
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
Chest CT:
FINDINGS: There is a consolidation in the left upper lobe. A few
other small round areas of consolidation are noted in both
apices bilaterally. There is no evidence for pulmonary masses.
There are small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. A
large hiatal hernia is visualized containing part of the stomach
and colon. There are a few calcifications in the coronary
arteries. A small amount of fluid is noted in the pericardial
sac. There is enlargement of the right and left atrium. Coarse
calcifications are also demonstrated in the thoracic aorta
without aneurysmal dilatation. The airways are patent.
.
CT BONES: There is a laminectomy at multiple levels in the
thoracic spine. There are degenerative changes with osteophyte
formation at multiple levels. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are
visualized.
.
The visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a
2.4-cm mass in the upper pole of the left kidney containing fat.
This is consistent with an angiomyolipoma.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe infiltrate corresponding to the increased
density seen on prior chest x-ray. This is consistent with
pneumonia. A few other small consolidations are noted
bilaterally at the lung apices. Findings are most consistent
with infectious process. Followup imaging is recommended after
resolution of the symptoms.
2. Large hiatal hernia.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Status post thoracic spine laminectomy at multiple levels.
5. Left renal AML.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88 year old woman with h/o COPD presenting
with back pain and cough.
1. Pneumonia and respiratory distress.  Her CXR showed large
left sided consolidation concerning for pneumonia, possibly
leading to sepsis w hypotension. A chest CT with contrast was
obtained as well because of the unusual round shape of the
consolidation in her left lung, but this also supported the
diagnosis of pneumonia.  She was treated initially with 4D of IV
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, followed by 3 days of PO
levofloxacin.  Following transfer from the MICU to medicine she
remained afebrile and had a decreasing WBC.  Clinically, her
cough steadily decreased, her oxygen requirement decreased until
she no longer required O2 by nasal cannula, and her lung exam
improved.
.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  She
remained in atrial fibrillation throughout her admission.  A TSH
was found to be normal to r/o hyperthyroidism.  It was thought
that her atrial fibrillation was exacerbated by her underlying
infection and hospitlization.  Cardioversion was not attempted
given her DNR/DNI status and rate control was pursued instead.
She failed a maximal dose of diltiazem and required multiple
agents.  She was started instead on .125 mg QD of digoxin and
metoprolol which was titrated up to 100 PO TID.  With this
therapy, her heart rate was persistently 90-110 at rest with
elevations to 130-150 with activity.  With the addition of
diltiazem at 30mg PO QID and with the resolution of her
pneumonia, her heart rate remained below 120's and digoxin was
discontinued.
.
3.  Anticoagulation.  The patient had been chronically
anticoagulated for her atrial fibrillation, but this had been
discontinued in the ICU in preparation for possible procedures.
As such, she was started on transfer on IV heparin titrated to a
PTT of 60-80 while her coumadin was restarted.  When her INR was
2.1 on 7.5 QD of coumadin, the heparin was discontinued.
.
4. HTN - Her hypertension improved with the regimen used to
control her atrial fibrillation.
.
5. Back Pain.  Her back pain resolved by the time she was
transferred from the ICU.  She had no neurologic deficits.
Daily physical therapy and her own ambulation to the bathroom
with her walker failed to reilic
