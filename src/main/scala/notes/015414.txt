Physical Exam:
At the time of discharge, [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 55278**] was in no acute
distress.  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  Her lungs were
clear to auscultation, but diminished bilaterally at the bases.
Her heart was of irregular rhythm but without murmurs, clicks,
or rubs.  The sternal incision was without erythema or drainage.
 Her sternum was stable.  Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, and
non-distended.  She had a bowel movement on [**5-16**].  Her
extremities were warm, but she was noted to have [**12-25**]+ edema
bilaterally.  Her left endovascular harbest site was clean, dry,
and intact.  A left-sided IJ double-lumen was in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2199-5-13**] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 55278**] underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA), mitral
valve replacement (27mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine valve), and
removal of a right sternal lipoma.  This procedure was performed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please see the operative note for details.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in
critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care
unit on levophed, epinephrine, milrinone, insulin and propofol
drips.
In the surgical intensive care unit she progressed well.  She
was weaned form her pressors.  By post-operative day two she was
extubated.  Her chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.
Post-operative day three she was noted to convert into atrial
fibrillation, for which she was placed on amiodarone and her
beta blockade was increased.  While she did not convert with
this regimen, her rate was controlled in the 80s.  On the
following day she was transferred in stable condition to the
step down floor.
Her course on the step down floor was unremarkable. She
continued in controlled atrial fibrillation and was therefore
started on coumadin.  She was seen in consultation by physical
therapy and by post operative day #5 she was ready for discharge
to a rehabilitation facility. Target INR is 2.0-2.5 for postop A
fib. Pt. is to make all discharge appts. as per discharge
