History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19484**] is a 55M with a PMH s/f morbid obesity, type II DM,
and OSA who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with altered mental
status after being found by a family member.  According to the
patient's daughter who lives with him, he was in his USOH until
the night prior to admission to [**Location (un) **] on [**9-13**].  On [**9-13**] he
slept in unusually late into the afternoon.  His daughter
finally went into his bedroom to wake him up, and reports that
patient was too lethargic to arouse completely.  He would
intermittently wake up and speak in meaningful sentances, other
times he would be non-sensical and drift off into sleep.  She
also reports he seemed to have weakness on his left lower
extremity, and complained of back and left leg pain.
.
At [**Location (un) **] he was found to be febrile to 101, hyperglycemic with
a fingerstick of 600, hypertensive in the 150-200 range, and
somnolent.  He was treated with 20 units of insulin, but did not
have an anion gap.  He reportedly did not respond to narcan.  A
foley was placed and drained 1650cc of urine.  His O2
saturations dropped to 88-91% on RA, requiring NRB.  A head CT
showed "no evidence of gross ICH, hypodensities are noted in the
bilateral thalami which may represent infarcts of indeterminate
age, recommend correlation with MRI".  A CXR was negative for
any acute pulmonary pathology.  A d-dimer waws elevated to 1.55(
0.22-0.44); ABG 7.42/39/77/23
.
On arrival to our ED, his inital vital signs were 103 axillary,
182/100 (170-200/90-100), 103, 99% NRB.  His fingerstick was in
the 300s with no anion gap on his electrolytes.  His mental
status was severely declined, he was minimally responsive to
painful stimuli, and had a reduced gag reflex.  The ED called
anesthesiology, who placed a nasotracheal airway.  A serum tox
screen was negative.  An EKG was wnl, as were cardiac enzymes.
An infectious work-up was started including a CXR, UA, lumbar
puncture, urine and blood cultures.  Lumbar puncture showed no
leukocytes, and a mildly elevated protein.  He had a CT torso
with contrast, which preliminarily is negative for PE, and shows
some pelvic lymphadenopathywith ? asymmetric sclerosis of the
sacroiliac joints.  The patient was empirically started on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone for meningitis coverage.
