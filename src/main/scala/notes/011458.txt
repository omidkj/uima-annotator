Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing Angina


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-1-3**] redo CABG x3/ ASD closure (LIMA to LAD, SVG to DIAG, SVG
to OM)

History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 y/o M
w/ h/o CAD s/p IMI and CABG x3 (in [**2120**]: SVG to LAD and LCx, SVG
to RCA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and PAF who p/w
increasing anginal symptoms over 2 months. He has been generally
pain-free since his original CABG, although did have a brief
period with anginal symptoms 7 months after his surgery; this
was treated medically. This fall, he began noticing anginal pain
occuring with less activity than before, associated with greater
DOE. Since that time, the frequency and severity of these
symptoms have been increasing with less activity, to the point
now that just getting into bed will leave him SOB and walking on
level ground gives him anginal pain (substernal, non-radiating,
no nausea or diaphoresis, resolving with rest). Given his
relatively high risk score (TIMI 3), he was admitted for cardiac
catheterization.
.
His cath revealed severe diffuse 3 vessel disease (see below for
details) and he is therefore awaiting revision of his CABG,
expected to be [**2147-1-3**].

use. He consumes [**1-21**] alcoholic beverages per night. Married with
3 children; works in electronics sales.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
.
BP 94/60; HR 48-64 (reg) RR 18; Temp 97.8; O2Sat 94%RA
.
Gen: well developed, well nourished and well groomed. The
patient was oriented to person, place and time. The patient's
mood and affect were not inappropriate.
HEEN: no xanthalesma, conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or
cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: supple, JVP of 4 cm. The carotid waveform was normal.
There was no thyromegaly.
Chest: no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Pulm: respirations were not labored and there were no use of
accessory muscles. CTAB, normal BS and no adventitial sounds or
rubs.
Cor: PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular
line. no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. normal S1S2, no
rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
Abd: abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation, no
hepatosplenomegaly, NT, soft, ND
Ext: no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin: no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
.


Brief Hospital Course:
EKG on [**2146-12-29**] demonstrated Sinus rhythm with nl axis, prolonged
PR, prolonged QTc, prolonged QRS; RBBB, no ST-T changes; with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2146-12-27**].
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2146-12-27**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Although technical quality was limited, there appears to be
severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF
40%)consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Borderline elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2146-12-27**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe diffuse three vessel CAD. The LMCA had 20%
luminal stenosis. The LAD was occluded from mid-vessel forward
after giving several large diagonal branches. The RCA was
occluded proximally. The LCX had 70% proximal stenosis and the
OM1 had 90% stenosis.
2. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed the SVGs to
OM and to RCA were occluded at origin. The SVG to LAD had an
ulcerated lesion causing 90% stenosis
3. Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal
systemic BP
(105/52 mmHg) and mildly elevated left heart filling pressure
(LVEDP
15 mmHg)
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease with
occlusion of two SVGs and severe ulcerated lesion at the SVG
supplying the LAD with occluded distal LAD.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Consult cardiac surgery.
.
OTHER TESTING:
- CXR: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or
significant
change from prior.
- Carotid U/S: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40%
carotid stenosis.
.
Admitted [**12-27**] and cath and studies done with results above.
Surgery delayed for plavix washout after he was given 600 mg
[**12-27**]. Underwent redo cabg x3 and ASD closure on [**1-3**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on
phenylephrine and propofol drips. Extubated on the morning of
POD #1. Reverted back to his chronic Afib on POD #2 and
amiodarone started, and then changed to norpace for improved
rate control.Heparin also started and vasoactive drips weaned.
Continuing hypoxemia ultimately resulted in bronchoscopy on [**1-10**]
which revealed bronchitis.Diuresis continued and coumadin
started on [**1-11**].Remained in the CSRU for aggressive pulm. toilet
and transferred to the floor on POD #12. Respiratory status
continued to improve however he continued to require 2L of
oxygen to remain above 90% saturated, so home oxygen therapy was
planned, and he was ready for discharge on POD #14.
