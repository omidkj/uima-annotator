Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH for intracerebral hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 year old woman with a history of HTN,
HL, prior SAH/IVH and PE who presents as as transfer from
[**Hospital1 **] and subsequently as a transfer from the Neurosurgery
service with fourth ventricular hemorrhage. In [**2137-1-22**], she
suffered a fall backwards while seated in a chair, fracturing
her
right humerus. While in rehab for this fracture, she suffered
another fall and developed SAH with intraventricular extension.
She had no neurosurgically intervention performed at that time.
Unfortunately, in [**2137-5-24**] she was found to have a LLE swollen
leg with a finding of a DVT and PE. She was started on warfarin
therapy and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter. She was going to see a
Hematologist at the recommendation her PCP to help determine the
course of warfarin, but this has not yet happened. One day prior
to admission, the nurses at the patient's care facility called
her PCP noting that she appeared to be confused. They report
"episodic confusion" over a few weeks with impaired orientation
to place, poor insight, poor memory, possible hallucinations,
and
poor completion of routine tasks. She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
where she described that since waking up on the AM of admission
she has felt nauseated with dry heaving in the absence of
abdominal pain, headache, cough, fever, etc. She does endorse
chills. She also reportedly vomited "greenish fluid" at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**]. She was transferred here to the Neurosurgery service
who
upon review of imaging felt she was not a neurosurgical
candidate
and requested transfer to Neurology.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
lightheadedness.
Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech.
Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Denies muscle weakness.
Denies loss of sensation.
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait (with her walker).

On general review of systems, the patient endorses chills.
Denies
fevers, night sweats, or noticeable weight loss.
Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal
pain.
Denies dysuria or hematuria.
Denies myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.


Past Medical History:
HTN, HL, Depression, SAH/IVH, PE on warfarin, possible
prior SDH


Social History:
No tobacco, ETOH use. Lives at [**Doctor Last Name 5749**] [**Doctor Last Name **] facility.
Normally ambulates with a walker. Visited by her son.

seen. Brain atrophy and small vessel disease again identified.

MRI: No evidence of acute infarct. There is an evolving
hemorrhage in the left cerebellum, just lateral to the fourth
ventricle. Diffuse volume loss. Extensive bilateral subcortical
and periventricular T2 FLAIR
hyperintensities likely representing microangiopathic chronic
ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neuro-intensive care unit and the
Neurology wards of the [**Hospital1 69**]
following the discovery of a relatively small cerebellar
hemorrhage with extension into the fourth ventricle. This was
likely related to hypertension in the setting ongoing
anticoagulation. She had a very brief stay in the intensive care
unit where she remained NPO. Neurosurgery was initially
consulted on the case and deferred intervention given the size
and location of the bleed. Given her ongoing hemodynamic
stability and stable neurological examinations, she was
transferred to the floor. While in house, she received an MRI.
This study confirmed that her bleed was NOT as a consequence of
underlying tumor or vascular malformation.

The patient was evaluated by speech therapy who felt that she
was safe to swallow and have a regular diet. Her intravenous PRN
antihypertensives were switched to oral antihypertensives, per
her previous home regimen. Unfortunately, in spite of adding
back her home medications, her blood pressures continued to
remain quite elevated above goal, averaging at 170-180 systolic.
Ultimately, her metoprolol was switched to labetalol and she was
started on TID clonidine, and together, we attained better
control of her blood pressure. On the day of her discharge, we
were able to obtain blood pressures on average in the 140s
systolic.

Her neurological examinations were consistent with her prior
dementing process. She would at times be somnolent but
arousable, always poorly oriented and inattentive. She would
occasionally refuse medications and foods, and had very poor
shor
