History of Present Illness:
(adapted from MICU admission note):
.
55y/o F with sarcoidosis, COPD, idiopathic cardiomyopathy with
EF 40% and diastolic dysfunction, varices s/p TIPS and
hypothyroidism presenting today with confusion. She has had
multiple recent hospital admissions (4 in the last few weeks)
for similar symptoms that required intubation and resolved with
lactulose therapy. She was last d/c on [**2110-2-26**] and was in her
USOH at home per her husband and compliant with her medications.
She did have one episode over the weekend where she was nauseous
and had NBNB emesis x1. Other than this she has been taking PO
and without complaint. She reportedly was taking her lactulose
and had 5BM prior to her evening dose which she then skipped. On
admission, she was difficult to arouse and he called 911 and had
her taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital. There, she remained difficult to
arouse and received 1 dose of lactulose after a NGT was placed.
Her glucose level was in the 60s so she also received glucagon
and D5 containing IVF. The husband denies any antecedent fevers,
chills, SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, BRBPR, melena,
hematemesis, dizziness, LOC, falls, paresthesias, or weakness.
He claims that she is taking her lactulose as directed and that
he administers the doses to her and watches her take them.  The
patient concurs that she adheres strictly to her medical
regimen.  Prior to her episodes of AMS, she reports increased
fatigue, but no other symptoms.
.
Her liver disease is thought to be [**3-15**] sarcoidosis, although per
[**2104**] review of path slides "the granulomas do not contain
polarizable foreign material. Possible etiologies for the
granulomas include drug reactions, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease,
infections, and primary biliary cirrhosis." Repeat biopsy [**9-18**]
showed findings consistent with prior sarcoid and now with
nodular regenerative hyperplasia. The patient has had multiple
admissions for encephalopathy believed to be [**3-15**] medication
non-compliance as hard stools observed on rectal exam at
admission. She has grade II varices with h/o bleeding and
recurrent transfusions and gastric and colonic AVM w/ h/o bleed.
 Also severe portal hypertensive gastropathy and grade 3
esophagitis seen on EGD.  She is s/p TIPS 12/[**2109**].
.
In our ED, she was felt to be protecting her airway though she
was not following commands or opening her eyes. She received PR
lactulose [**3-15**] concerns that she would aspirate any NGT meds. She
remained hemodynamically stable and her labs were significant
only for thrombocytopenia (lower than her baseline) and mild LFT
abnormalities that are in line with her previous values.
.
In the ICU, she was seen to be opening her eyes to voice and
vocalizing (though inappropriately). She was started on
lactulose and [**Month/Day (2) 8005**].  Although she did not have significant
stool output her mental status improved significantly.
.
On transfer to the floor the patient reports feeling back to her
baseline but does feel slightly constipated.  She denies any
dizzyness, fevers/chills, weight loss or weight gain, shortness
of breath, cough, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hematochezia,
melena, chest pain or palpitations. She reports a good appetite.

STUDIES:
CXR [**3-5**]:
Since the prior examination, the patient has been extubated.  A
nasogastric tube remains in place with the distal tip off the
inferior edge of the radiograph below the diaphragm.  The lungs
are well expanded; however, there is minimal bibasilar
atelectasis evident.  The mediastinum is  unremarkable.  The
cardiac silhouette is stable, accounting for patient and
technical factors.  No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  The
visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.

FINDINGS:  This was a limited Doppler evaluation of the TIPS
stent.  Again
demonstrated in the right hepatic lobe is a TIPS stent catheter,
which appears unchanged in position.  Color Doppler evaluation
shows wall-to-wall color Doppler signal within the TIPS stent.
