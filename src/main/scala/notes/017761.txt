Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
53 year old woman with hypertension, end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, diasolic CHF (preserved EF),
pulmunary HTN, and COPD, with recent admission for SVC syndrome
during which she received catheter based tPA, who was brought to
the ED from rehab after her hemodialysis catheter had fallen
out. She was was brought to the angio suite where she had a
right IJ hemodialysis catheter advanced into the right atrium.
She subsequently complained of dyspnea, became profoundly
hypoxic (O2 sat 50s), and had a respiratory code initiated.
.
The patient was admitted from [**5-30**] through [**6-10**] with facial
swelling. She was found to have an SVC clot and received
catheter based tPA overnight. The following day ([**6-3**]) she
underwent thrombectomy and dilatation of the SVC.
Post-thrombectomy she had good flow in her SVC. On [**6-7**] she had
acute dyspnea, at which time she had a CTA which did not
demonstrate any PE, and demonstrated decreased collaterals,
indicative of resolution of SVC clot. It did, however,
demonstrate a new right upper lobe infiltrate. She was started
on ciprofloxacin and discharged to rehab to complete a 7 day
course.
.
At rehab her dialysis catheter apparently fell out on the day of
admission. She was brought to the ED, from which she went to the
angio suite after getting 2 units of FFP. In the angio suite
they reintroduced a hemodialysis line through the old tunneled
site in the right IJ. The wire advanced with ease, as did the
catheter. While suturing in the catheter after the procedure the
patient acutely complained of inability to breath, after which
point her O2 saturation dropped to the 50s on room air. She
received nebulizer treatment several times without effect. A
code blue was called. Hemodynamically she was stable throughout,
with systolic BP 150-220, HR 120-140. She had a right femoral
central line placed. She was difficult to bag, and after
intubation her peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be in
the 50s and she was therefore given bag mask ventilation until
she arrived in the CCU. Post-intubation CXR demonstrates
placement of the HD line relatively low, almost RV, with dense
infiltrate throughout the right lung.
.
She was admitted to the MICU and remained intubated until
[**2206-6-14**] when she was extubated. It was felt her respiratory
decompensation was due to pneumonia, and her antibiotics
coverage was expanded to Meropenem/Vancomycin. She also had a
chest CT angiogram of the chest which showed RUL/RLL pneumonia
without evidence of PE. On presentation now she is sating 100%on
2L NC. Afebrile for 24 hours and w/o complaints.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CTA 5/11/07:1. Status post endotracheal intubation.
2. Findings suggest mild upper tracheal stenosis, which could be
related to prior intubation.
3. Evidence of pneumonia in the right upper and lower lobes.
4. Findings suggest left subclavian artery stenosis near its
origin
.
SVC venogram [**6-3**]: IMPRESSION:
1. SVC venogram post TPA check demonstrated persistent clot and
stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein/ SVC.
2. Mechanical thrombectomy performed with AngioJet and
angioplasty with 10 mm balloon with good angiographic results.
3. A final venogram demonstrates free flow of contrast through
the SVC, with small residual clot.
.
CTA [**6-7**]: IMPRESSION: Since [**2206-5-30**],
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. New ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe that could
represent a combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema and
infection.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Interval resolution of multiple collaterals in the right
upper chest and neck suggesting that the previous SVC
obstruction has resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old female with hypertension, end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, diasolic CHF (preserved EF),
pulmunary HTN, and COPD with recent admission for SVC syndrome
during which she received catheter based tPA, who comes to the
MICU after hypoxic respiratory failure shortly after a
replacement of a right IJ tunneled dialysis line, found to have
increased/new infiltrates in the right lung but no PE on
admission CTA of chest. Pt was initally intubated and in ICU.
She was started on broad spectrum ABX HD1 and was dialysed via
new catheter. After fluid removal via HD per the renal service,
she was able to be extubated evening of HD1. Bronchoscopy
[**2206-6-13**] demonstrated mucous plugging and rare blood. Her
antibiotic regimen was changed to IV Vanomycin and Meropenam
renally dosed for a 8 day course- complete on [**2206-6-20**].  She was
maintained on Albuterol/Iprtrapium NEBs and inhalers and on HD 2
was sating 100%on 2L NC. She was transferred to a regular
medical floor in stable condition. She had repeat Hemodialysis
on HD 4 and was sating well on RA.

Medications on Admission:
Fluticasone-Salm
