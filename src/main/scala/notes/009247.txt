Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Planned right carotid stent placement for asymptomatic 80%
stenosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catheterization and carotid stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
67 year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
CAD s/p LAD and Lcx stents in [**2182**], and right carotid stenosis
admitted to the CCU after right carotid stent placement with
subsequent labile blood pressures.  The right carotid stenosis
was discovered after he was noted to have a carotid bruit by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was asymptomatic.  Work-up for carotid
bruit included carotid ultrasound with right peak systolic
velocities 332, 79, and 109 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA
respectively, with peak ICA end-diastolic velocity 117.  MRI/MRA
neck [**2189-12-27**] which showed a high grade and critical, greater
than 95% stenosis involving the suprabulbar right ICA, 1 cm
above the right carotid bifurcation in the neck.  CTA head and
neck [**2190-2-5**] showed 60% short segment focal stenosis within [**Country **]
without left-sided stenosis.  He was referred for percutaneous
carotid intervention as part of the CREST study.  He has been
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology for his
pre-procedure evaluation.
.
Catheterization revealed no significant left vertebral disease.
The bifurcation of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**]/ECA had mild disease.  The [**Country **] had
an 80-85% stenosis.  There was no significant intracranial
disease and there was cross filling via a patent ACOM.  An
Acculink stent was placed to the right carotid.  Final
angiography revealed <40% residual stenosis with no dissection
or angiographic embolization.  The patient was placed on
neosynephrine gtt for hypotension which was titrated up to
0.6mcg/kg, although the patient's blood pressure was labile with
systolics as high as 200 off neosynephrine.
.
On cardiac ROS, patient denies chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
claudication, PND, orthopnea, edema, lightheadedness, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  The
patient denied neurologic complaints.  Review of systems
otherwise negative in detail.

LCX and LAD
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Diabetes

ECG Study Date of [**2190-2-23**]  11:16:30 AM
Sinus bradycardia. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Left

no significant change.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2190-2-23**]
COMMENTS:
1) Diagnostic angiography revealed a Type 1 aortic arch with no
signficant disease.  The left vertebral and left [**Doctor First Name 3098**]/ECA/CCA
had no
significant disease.  There was some cross filling by the
posterior and
anterior communicating arteries.  The right ICA had an 80-85%
stenosis.
2) Successful PTCA and stenting of the R ICA with a 7.0/10
tapered x30
mm Acculink stent which was postdilated up to 5.0 mm.  Final
angiography
revealed <30% residual stenosis, no dissection, and normal flow.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-2-24**]
Compared with [**2186-5-8**], there is a new contour abnormality
in the region of the ascending aorta and azygos vein. There is
no pneumothorax, cardiomegaly, consolidation, or pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year-old male with coronary artery disease status post
LCx/LAD stents, type II diabetes, admitted for right carotid
stent placement for asymptomatic right carotid stenosis as part
of CREST study.
.
1. Right carotid stenosis: The patient was found to have an 80%
ICA stenosis on catheterization. The patient is status post
stent without immediate complications. The patient's blood
pressure and heart rate were labile during hospitalization
secondary to baroreceptor irritation and the patient was
monitored in the CCU for 36 hours. The patient was given
neosynephrine as needed to keep systolic blood pressure 100-140.
The patient's heart rate became as low as 29 during sleep. The
patient's vagal response improved with intravenous fluids and
exertion. The patient was instructed to hold all
anti-hypertensives until blood pressure check at his primary
care physician's office. The patient was continued on aspirin,
plavix, and vytorin.  The patient will follow-up with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**]
and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
.
2. Possible ascending aortic aneursym: The patient was noted to
have a possible ascending aortic aneursym on chest X-ray as
above. The patient will have an outpatient MRI/MRA chest for
further evaluation.
.
3. Coronary artery disease: No active issues during
hospitalization. The patient was continued on aspirin, plavix,
and vytorin. The patient's beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor were
held for hypotension as above.
.
4. Pump: Diastolic heart failure. The patient was euvolemic
during hospitalization.  The patient's lasix was held for
hypotension as above. The patient was instructed to hold his
beta-blocker and lasix until blood pressure check at his primary
care physician's office.
.
5. Rhythm: The patient remained in sinus rhythm with bradycardia
to 29 as above during hospitalization without other events on
telemetry. The patient's beta-blocker was held as above.
.
6. Diabetes mellitus, type II: The patient's metformin was held
for 48 hours after contrast administration during
catheterization. The patient's ACE-inhibitor was held as above.
.
7. Glaucoma: The patient was continued on his outpatient
regimen.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized after a procedure to stent your carotid
