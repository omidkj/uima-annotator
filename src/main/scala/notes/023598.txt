Reason for MICU transfer: For possible bronchoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy on [**2189-5-14**]

History of Present Illness:
75 year-old with history of aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation
([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2), CAD with DES [**5-/2188**] on Plavix, PPM for AVB in
[**2184**], breast cancer in [**2153**], chronic hepatitis C and recent
admission for SVC syndrome s/p Y stent placement by IP now BIBA
from home with [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] cough and dyspnea. Patient initially
presented to PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 547**] complaining of neck and facial
swelling.  She was ultimately referred to allergy and ENT with a
neck CT ordered revealing SVC syndrome from extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and chest CT showing a right
supraclavicular mass displacing the trachea and massive
mediastinal lympadenopathy.  Given the CT findings, patient's
allergist called her to present to ED.
.
Had Dumon silicone Y stent placed by IP on Monday.  She was
completely weaned off oxygen and had a normal ambulatory oxygen
saturation, so she was discharged home Tuesday morning.  Patient
reports her breathing worsened throughout the day and she "felt
like she was drowning." Feels exhausted breathing through all
fluid, crackles with coughing. Feels she is getting weaker and
just breathing is making her very tired. Cough is productive of
mucous and occassional small amount of blood. No fevers, or
chills. No abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 98 149/58 22 100% 12L.  Exam
was significant for diffuse crackles and rhonchi in both lung
fields.  Labs were significant for proBNP of 4048 and VBG of
7.49/43/78.  Patient had CXR showing slighly worsened pulmonary
edema and RML collapse.  Patient received lasix 10 mg IV,
albuterol/atrovent nebulizer treatments.  She was also ordered
for vancomycin and cefepime given crackles on exam (although she
has not been febrile and no leukocytosis).  Interventional
pulmonology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended admission for possible
repeat bronch.  Patient was admitted to ICU given high risk of
respiratory decompensation.  Vitals on transfer are 98, 148/54,
96% on 4L, RR 27.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient continues to complain of cough
and some mild dyspnea.  The cough is the most bothersome
problem.  [**Name (NI) **] fevers, chills, chest pain. No orthopnea.

IMAGING
CXR [**2189-5-14**]
IMPRESSION:

1.  Right middle lobe collapse. CT would be required to evaluate
airway
patency.
2.  Mild CHF, with interstitial fluid and slight increase in
bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  Stable bilateral paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
.
CT CHEST [**2189-5-18**]
1.  Interval decrease in size of soft tissue encasing the
mediastinum.  The
tracheal Y-stent has been placed in the interim, and remains
widely patent,
without extrinsic compression.  The SVC remains markedly
narrowed, and is not significantly changed in appearance
compared with [**5-7**].
2.  Interval increase in now moderate-sized bilateral pleural
effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.  Multiple foci of
irregular pleural thickening are noted, concerning for
lymphomatous implants.  Ground-glass opacity within the anterior
segment of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure is
new compared with prior, is nonspecific. An 8-mm nodule in the
left upper lobe appears new.
3. Left breast mass, with adjacent surgical clips and skin
thickening, better evaluated with mammography.
.
Renal US [**2189-5-19**]
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydronephrosis.

CT Chest ([**2189-5-24**]):
1.  Persistent soft tissue encasement of the mediastinum with
unchanged severe narrowing of the SVC.  Overall, soft tissue
density within the mediastinum appears unchanged compared to
recent prior examination.
2.  Widely patent Y-stent within the distal trachea and main
stem bronchi.  No extrinsic compression or narrowing.
3.  Persistent small left pleural effusion with resolution of
prior right
pleural effusion.
4.  Decreased density of prior ground glass opacities seen
within the right upper lobe suggesting interval improvement of
probable prior infectious or inflammatory process.
5.  Resolution of prior 8-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule,
likely related to focal atelectasis or inflammation.
