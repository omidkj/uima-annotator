Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath x 1 month, and chest pain for 2-3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization with placement of Swan Ganz catheter

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] is 75F with history of CAD s/p STEMI, CABG in [**12/2155**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG Y-graft-diag, SVG-PDA), ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), most recent estimate at 10%, HTN,
HLD, s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-18**] who initially presented with dyspnea on
exertion for the last one month and chest pain for 2-3 days
prior to presentation.

In the ED on [**7-4**], the patient was noted to have EKG in ? a-fib
vs. NSR at 94 bpm RBBB with LAFB, and evidence of past
anteroseptal MI, without change from prior. A CXR showed mild
vascular congestion.
An echo was done on [**7-5**] showing LVEF < 20% (approx 10%; Left
ventricular cavity dilation with severe global hypokinesis.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Increased PCWP. Prev study on
[**2156-2-11**] showed LVEF 20-25%)

While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was initially given lasix
boluses, and was later started on a Lasix drip on [**2156-7-5**]. The
patient diuresed 914ccs [**2155-7-6**] PM after stopping lasix gtt. Her
volume status improved and she had no oxygen requirement. Her Cr
bumped to 1.3. However, she still complained of SOB, so RHC with
Swan Ganz was performed to assess volume status. The patient
tolerated the R heart cath well. Pressures were notable for
wedge of 20, RA pressure of 20, and CI 1.5. Given her elevated
pressures despite Lasix and in the setting of a creatinine
increase and low EF, the patient was transferred to the CCU for
initiation of milrinone and IV Lasix.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports feeling well. She
reports that she feels better than when she was first admitted
to the hospital. Denies any current shortness of breath (satting
100% on RA), no chest pain. Denies any abdominal pain. Does
reports some discomfort at the site of her line placement,
reports having some difficulty moving her neck.

Of note, while on [**Hospital1 1516**], the patient was also started on
amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation.

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2156-7-4**]  6:44:28 AM
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Interpolated
ventricular premature contractions. Right bundle-branch block
with left
anterior fascicular block. Probable prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. No major change from the previous
tracing.
Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] V.

TTE [**2156-7-5**]
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with severe global
hypokinesis. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Increased PCWP.
Com;pared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-2-11**], the
false tendon has ruptured and the left ventricular cavity is now
larger.

Cardiac catheterization [**2156-7-7**]
COMMENTS:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
filling
pressures. The RVEDP was 14 mmHg. The pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure
was elevated at 21 mmHg. The cardiac index was notably depressed
on 2L
supplemental oxygen (with an assumed oxygen consumption) of 1.58

l/min/m2.
2. Right internal jugular swan [**Last Name (un) **] catheter was sutured to the
neck
for additional pressure measurements during hospitalization.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Decompensated congestive heart failure with depressed cardiac
output.
2. Moderate diastolic heart failure.
3. RIJ VIP swan sutured in place.

Cardiac perfusion study [**2156-7-7**]
Final Report

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
   10.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2156-7-7**]);
HISTORY:
75 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior MI and CABG
referred for evaluation
of chest pain and worsening left ventricular systolic function.
Stress imaging
was planned but unable to be performed.

METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Tracer was
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.

Imaging Protocol: SPECT

This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue
attenuation and patient motion.

Left ventricular cavity size is markedly increased.
Resting perfusion images reveal a moderate reduction in photon
counts involving the mid anterior wall, mid anteroseptum, the
entire distal ventricle and the apex.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large, moderate severity resting perfusion defect involving
the LAD
territory.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] is 75F with history of CAD s/p STEMI, CABG in [**12/2155**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG Y-graft-diag, SVG-PDA), ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), most recent estimate at 10% who
initially presented with dyspnea on exertion for the last one
month and chest pain for 2-3 days prior to presentation.

ACUTE ISSUES
# DECOMPENSATED ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE (EF
10%): Prior to her CCU admission, she was being diuresed while
on the cardiology service service. Given her persistent
shortness of breath without other signs of heart failure, right
heart catheterization was p
