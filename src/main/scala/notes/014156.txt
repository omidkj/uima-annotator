the trachea at risk for perforation and fistula formation.
Probable pleural and parenchymal scarring at the lung bases,
although it
is difficult to fully exclude a pneumonia at the left lung base.

CXR [**10-21**]  1. Persistent tracheostomy cuff distention. 2.
Worsening mild congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 y/o female with PMHx significant for
tracheobronchiomalacia and chronic respitory distress with
tracheostomy on chronic vent who presents from [**Hospital3 672**]
in severe respitory distress, afib with RVR, hypotension and
febrile.
.
1. Sepsis:  PNA vs Cdiff.  Pt came in with Positive Cdiff
cultures from OSH.  Cultures sent from [**Hospital1 18**] were subsequently
negative.  Will continue flagyl for complete course.  In
addition, gram stain revealed gram neg rods, gram + cocci in
pairs and cocci and gram + rods.  Speciation pending at time of
discharge.
- Will continue to keep patient on current vent setting and
titrate back to baseline as tolerated.
- Will conitnue vanco/zosyn/flagyl which could cover possible
VAP or aspiration PNA and CDIFF.  Should complete full course of
antibiotics at [**Hospital3 672**].  Vanco and zosyn started [**10-20**]
and flagyl started at OSH should continue until [**10-27**].
- Continue albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
- Patient with resp acidosis, would check daily ABG to make sure
correcting on current vent settings
- [**10-15**] Cdiff positive from [**10-15**] sample drawn at OSH.  Cdiff
negative at [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-20**].
.
2. Yeast infection- From urine cx.  Pulled foley on [**10-21**].
Should recheck U/A at [**Hospital3 672**] on [**10-23**] for persistent
fungal UTI.
.
3. PAF - Patient currently in sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation
could have been exacerabted by infectious cause.
- Will hold off on BBlocker at this time as BP low.
- Consider repeat cardiovesion if returns back to atrial fib.
- Pt needs to be anticoagulated with Warfarin.  This was
communicated with physician at [**Hospital3 672**] on [**10-21**].
.
4. Acute Renal Failure - Patient with Cre 1.3, last Cre was 1.1
in [**2199**].  Could be ATN secondary to hypotensive episode.
Patient with minimal urine output.  Would continue to monitor
BUN/Cre and K+.  Trending down.  Probably [**2-18**] infection.
.
5. DM  RISS
.
6. Anemia: HCT improved but some guiaic + stool on last day of
admission in setting of heparin.  D/C'd heparin on final night
of admission.  Can reconsider anticoagulation at [**Hospital1 1099**].
.
7. Access: Femoral line
.
8. FEN: Continue IVF to maintain BP and UOP
.
9. PPx: Heparin SC, PPI, bowel regimine
.
10. Code: Full
.
11. Comm with daughter
.
12. Disp: To rehab
