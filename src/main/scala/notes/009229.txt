Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Mechanical intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
77 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, CHF, CAD, who presented to the ED with diarrhea and
dizziness.  She had been having some minimal diarrhea for the
prior few days.  Then 1 day prior to admission she developed
profuse diarrhea with multiple stools per hour.  According to
her son, the patient did not notice blood in the stools, but
they were dark.  Her son reports that she felt well up until
friday.  She had been out doing errands and did not complain of
any fevers, chills, night sweats, sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] son did
not believe she had had a previous colonoscopy.  She gets her
INR checked every 3-4 weeks, and at last check her INR was 2.2
([**7-10**]).  The patient initially refused to come to the hospital,
but her son eventually persuaded her to come.  Her son reports
that the patient was alert and appropriate on arrival to the ED.


In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5 P 67 BP 95/27 R 18 O2 sat
100.  She was found to be hypotensive with a Hct of 14 and an
INR of 18.  She had melanotic stools in the ED.  The patient was
given PPI, Vitamin K 10 IV and Factor 9 1500 units.  She was
intubated for airway protection.  GI & general surgery were
consulted.  She was resusitated with PRBC 4 units, NS 4 L, FFP 1
unit and 1 bag of platelets.  In addition, she received 1 amp
calcium gluconate, regular insulin 8 units and 1 amp of D50 for
her hyperkalemia.  She received atropine 1mg IV for a HR of 30.
Her BP was as low as 78/20 and she was started on
norepinephrine.  Several attempts were made at femoral line
placement but she quickly developed hematomas.  Her EKG showed
ST depressions in V3-V5.  She was intubated in the ED for airway
protection.

STUDIES/IMAGING:

Chest Xray ([**2176-8-3**]): Endotracheal tube as above. Consider
retracting 3 cm for optimal placement. Massive cardiac
enlargement of indeterminate etiology. This is stable relative
to the prior exam which is the only comparison study available.
No acute pulmonary process.

CT Head: No acute intracranial process. Partial opacification of
the
mastoid air cells may be chronic, but this is of unclear time
line given lack of priors. Correlate clinically.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Indeterminate density of ascites suggest there may be
hemorrhagic or
proteinaceous ascites. However there is no evidence of
retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Anasarca.
3. Massive cardiomegaly.
4. Mildly atrophic kidneys.
5. Non-specific hepatic hypodensity; consider US to characterize
if not
previously characterized.

Abdominal Ultrasound: Trace of ascites in the lower quadrants
and a right pleural effusion.

Abdominal Doppler Ultrasound: 1. Patent and appropriate flow in
the hepatic vasculature. No portal vein thrombosis is
identified.
2. Right pleural effusions and trace of ascites in the
perihepatic space.

Right upper extremity ultrasound: 1. No evidence of deep venous
thrombosis.
2. Partial occlusive thrombus in the superficial right cephalic
vein.

TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-5-28**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced. A small
interatrial shunt (stretched patent foramen ovale vs.small
secundum atrial septal defect is now identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, on
coumadin, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2176-8-3**] with hypotension,
dizziness, several days of melanotic diarrhea.
presenting with GI bleed and hypovolemic shock.

# GI Bleed/Hypovolemic Shock: She presented with GI bleeding in
the setting of supratherapeutic INR of 18 on warfarin.  She was
stabilized with transfusion of total 9 units PRBCs and 6 units
FFP, Factor IX, 1 bag of platelets, and IVF. She underwent
urgent EGD by gastroenterology which showed 2 AVMs without
active bleeding.  She was intubated for airway protection. She
was admitted to MICU and remained stable following blood product
resucitation and IV pressors.  She was started on octreotide and
a PPI drip which was later changed to po omeprazole.  A
colonoscopy demonstrated multiple colonic ulcerations felt to
represent ischemic colitis, and this was felt to be the most
likely source for her massive GI bleed. She was weaned off IV
pressors and her hematocrit remained stable for the duration of
her hospitalization.  Her INR returned to [**Location 213**] range and
warfarin was held and was not restarted at discharge.

# Intubation: She was intubated for airway protection in
emergency department. She had an uncomplicated extubation on
[**2176-8-7**].  She was then diuresed due to fluid overload from
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Her respiratory status remained
stable for the duration of her hospitalization.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: She
