HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. End-stage renal disease:  Patient was continued on his
usual schedule of hemodialysis.  Patient's peritoneal
dialysis catheter was thought to be possible source of
infection, and it was therefore removed on the 20th of
........  Patient was continued Nephrocaps, calcitriol,
PhosLo, and calcium carbonate, as well as low dosed
prednisone.  Patient will be setup for outpatient dialysis
upon discharge.

2. Fevers of unknown origin:  Patient had multiple workups in
the past for high fevers and multiple ID consults in the
past, however, no workup has been fruitful.  Early in this
hospital course the patient spiked a fever to 104.7.  A
gallium scan was obtained per prior ID recommendations,
however, the gallium scan was negative.  ID was reconsulted
and recommended following blood cultures and urine cultures
for fevers greater than 101.5.

After peritoneal dialysis catheter, there was evidence of
erythema and mild induration on patient's abdomen.  Patient
was treated with a course of Vancomycin and treated the MRSA
growing from his wound.  There is also evidence proteus
growing in the wound, however, further additional antibiotic
therapy was not indicated.

was 55 indicating no significant acute inflammatory process
and C-reactive protein level was 7.8, which the lowest level
