None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with PMHx sig for afib w/ pacer, CHF, CABG,
DM, and colon can who presents with fall 3 days earlier and
subsequently found to have a SDH.  The patient lives in a
dementia unit.  He apparently fell and hit his head while
walking with a walker three days earlier.  After the fall, the

be confused.  He was confused when getting helped to dress and
was off his baseline. He was brought to an OSH where CT head
showed a L parieto-occipital SDH.  He was then transferred to

Pertinent Results:
[**2127-2-6**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. No fracture or acute malalignment is detected. Collection
around odontoid process with encroachment of ventral cord is
suggestive of hematoma in setting of trauma. MR of cervical
spine is recommended.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine as described.

[**2127-2-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Acute left hemisphere subdural hematoma which is most
pronounced adjacent to the left occipital lobe . 5mm shift of
normal midline structure is visualized.
2. No fracture detected.

[**2127-2-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Large, but stable, left subdural hematoma with mild mass
effect.

[**2127-2-8**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Unchanged appearance of large left parieto-occipital subdural
hematoma, and mild mass effect.

[**2127-2-10**] ECHO - Moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left ventricular
systolic function. The right ventricle is not well seen but may
well be dilated and hypokinetic. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of outflow tract
gradient.

[**2127-2-13**] CXR - New bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration
giving its relatively rapid appearance.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with dementia, AFib, HTN admitted with
SDH s/p fall.

NEURO: Mr. [**Known lastname 76261**] was admitted to the ICU on [**2127-2-6**] with a left
parietal/occipital SDH. He did well neurologically while he was
in the ICU. The patient does have baseline dementia, but was
moving all 4 extremities and was partially oriented. He had a CT
scan on [**2127-2-8**] which showed that the SDH was stable and he was
transferred to the neuro step-down unit that day. He was placed
on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis for a total of 10 days (last
day [**2127-2-16**]).  The patient continued to do well neurologically
and was transferred to the floor on [**2127-2-9**]. The ortho-spine
team recommended that the patient wear a soft collar and he will
follow-up with them in 2 weeks with dynamic C-spine xrays.  The
patient was neurosurgically stable and did not need any surgical
intervention and it was decided that the patient should be
transferred to the geriatrics service for further care.   Prior
to his acute decompensation, he was instructed to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His respiratory status then worsened, prompting his
family to seek comfort measures only.  He expired [**2127-2-16**].

RESP: On [**2127-2-10**] the patient had a video swallow evaluation,
showing that he was aspirating 50% with an agreed upon resultant
plan for PEG.  Pt's mental status improved over 48hrs with a
repeat video swallow [**2127-2-13**] showing minimal aspiration and a
diet for honey thick liquids and pureed solids was recommended
with supplemental IV fluid.  The family then decided that they
would not want a PEG tube placed.  On [**2127-2-13**] the patient had an
episode of emesis and a fever of 102F.  He was found to be
tachypneic and was pan cultured and a chest xray was done.  The
chest xray showed new bibasilar opacities consistent with
aspiration.  He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (levo to
finish on [**2-16**], flagyl to finish on [**2-18**]).  He respiratory
status improved and he was oxygenating well on RA.  He resumed
oral feeding with honey pre-thickened liquids and pureed solids
with assistance.  [**2-15**] was transferred to the MICU after he
developed sudden SOB with destaurations into the 60s and
tachycardia when being transfered from chair to bed. There was
no aspiration event noticed. The patient was confused and unable
to voice complaints. An EKG was concerning for STE in III and
aVF. Cardiology was called but did not think ACS was likely and
an intervention would be feasible in the light of SDH. The
patient was transfered to the MICU where he was started on a
NIPPV.  He was also given aspirin, metoprolol, morphine and
started on Heparin gtt with a goal of PTT 40-60 per
neurosurgery. Haldol was given for sedation. A Stat ECHO
revealed left ventricular systolic function of 30-40% secondary
to a new basal inferior and posterior hypokinesis as well as to
rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. The right
ventricular cavity was dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The patient continued to be tachypneic on the
NIPPV.  Given worsening respiratory status and obvious patient
discomfort, family meeting was held.  Given poor prognosis,
patient was made CMO and care was directed towards comfort until
he expired on [**2127-2-16**].

CARDIAC: He also complained of some right sided chest pain and
dyspnea. An EKG was unchanged from previous with no acute ST-T
changes.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn and set 1 had a CK of 710
and troponin of 0.15.  It was felt that the elevation could be
due to chronic renal insufficiency, but enzymes were cycled.
His enzymes remained stable and he was maintained on ASA.
Expired [**2127-2-16**].

HYPERNATREMIA: During this admission, he also became
progressively hypernatremic which was not responsive to changing
IV fluids to D5 1/2NS and later D5 1/4NS and given several free
water boluses per NGT.  His potassium was repleted to normal
levels.  His creatinine increased to 2.4 from baseline of 1.9.
With continued hydration with D5W his Na started to improve.
Given family wishes for comfort, aggressive free water
repleation was stopped and he expired [**2127-2-16**].

COAGULOPATHY: INR also was found to be increased during the
course of the admission.  This was thought likely to be due to
poor nutritional status.  He received a dose of vitamin K on
[**2127-2-13**].  Which did decrease his coagulopathy, was briefly
started on a
