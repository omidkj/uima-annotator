History of Present Illness:
According to hospitalist note, "Patient is a 54 year old man

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course/Impression/Plan:
Patient is a 54 year old man with alcoholism and diabetes who
presented with mental status changes and found to be in diabetic
ketoacidosis.
.
1) Mental status changes:
Most likely due to low blood glucose as mentation improved once
blood sugars well controlled.  There may have been some
contribution from alcohol withdrawl, as patient with extensive
history. No evidence for infection.  Urine analysis negative.
Serum and urine toxicology were negative.
Patient followed by psychiatry during admission.  Agitation
controlled with diazepam and haldol.  Placed on CIWA scale and
required restraints and 1:1 sitter.
.
2) Diabetic ketoacidosis:
On admission, patient states he has very hard time controlling
blood sugars.  Home regimen of 17 units of NPH twice daily.
During admission, insulin drip was never initiated, as anion gap
closed upon arrival to ICU.  Several episodes of hypoglycemia
during admission.
With improved PO intake, will discharge patient on 8 units of
NPH twice daily with instrucitons to increase by 2 uints if
blood glucose consistently >200.  Patient will need close
monitoring by PCP to assess efficacy of new insulin regimen.
.
3) Cough/hypoxia:
Patient noted to have significant wheezing on pulmonary
examination.  Continued nebulizers and inhalers.
.
4) Alcohol Withdrawl:
As above, possible evidence of withdrawal by CIWA.  Psychiatry
followed patient and placed on CIWA scale and given haldol for
agitation.  No evidence of hemodynamic instability.  Did not
require any sedatives or sitter during last day of admission.
