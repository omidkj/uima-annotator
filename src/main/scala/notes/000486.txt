Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old man
who presented with chest pressure and an irregular heart rate
for 14 days prior to admission that awoke him from a sound
sleep.  He was noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes and
underwent an exercise tolerance test which was positive as
well as a positive nuclear imaging study.  The imaging study
noted reversible inferior defect.  The patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization on [**2183-10-23**] that revealed three
vessel coronary artery disease with significant left main
stenosis, left main had a 90% stenosis at its origin.  There
was a 40% stenosis in the diagonal branch.  There was a
dominant RCA that had a 90% stenosis in its proximal segment
and a 70% stenosis in its middle segment.  Initial surgery
was delayed secondary to a diffuse rash the patient had noted
for approximately three weeks over his entire body.  The
patient was seen by dermatology and was placed on Clobetasol
cream.  Biopsies were consistent with psoriasis.  The rash
improved with treatment.  The patient was taken to the
operating room for CABG on [**2183-11-6**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for bilateral carotid
disease.  He had a carotid ultrasound on [**2183-10-24**] which
showed 40-60% right carotid stenosis and no left carotid
stenosis.  He also has history of claudication and the right
lower extremity had a monophasic doppler tracing at all
levels with an ABI of .79.  On the left the patient had an
ABI of .73.  Arterial duplex consistent with significant
bilateral superficial femoral artery and tibial disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for fusion of his left
foot in [**2121**] secondary to polio and revision in [**2149**].  The
patient had a bilateral carotid endarterectomy and subclavian
bypass in [**2179**], status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in
[**2181**].

MEDICATIONS:  Prior to surgery include Isosorbide,
Atorvastatin, Lisinopril, Lasix, Atenolol, Nitroglycerin,
Co-enzyme Q, Diflucan, several herbal medications.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin. There was noted to be an anaphylactic
reaction.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for his father deceased at age
53 secondary to an MI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac surgery on
[**2183-11-6**].  The patient underwent CABG times three with a LIMA
to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM, saphenous vein graft to
PDA.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU, not on any drips.  The patient had
an endovein harvest on the left thigh.  Postoperatively the
patient did well and was extubated successfully the evening
of his surgery.  On postoperative day #1 he was started on
Lasix, Lopressor and Aspirin and was transferred to the
floor.  The patient received Vancomycin as perioperative
antibiotic.  The patient was noted on interoperative TEE to
have an EF of 55-60%.  The patient was seen by physical
therapy and was noted to benefit from short term stay at
rehab.  The patient continued to do well but on the evening
of postoperative day #1 was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  This was
controlled by IV Lopressor and patient was started on
Amiodarone.  The patient did convert to normal sinus rhythm,
however, on the evening of postoperative day #2 he did have
another second episode of atrial fibrillation that was
converted to normal sinus rhythm after 10 mg of IV Lopressor.
The patient, on postoperative day #3, had third episode of
atrial fibrillation that converted spontaneously to normal
sinus rhythm, however, at this point after three episodes of
atrial fibrillation, it was decided to start the patient on
Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0.  On discharge patient is
doing well, he is afebrile, all vital signs stable, he is in
normal sinus rhythm with heart rate in the high 50's to low
60's, his blood pressure is 140/80 and his O2 sats are 96% on
room air.  On exam patient is in no apparent distress, his
heart is regular, his sternal wound is clean, dry and intact,
his sternum is stable, his lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally, his abdomen is soft, nontender, non distended,
his extremities are warm and his incisions are clean, dry and
intact.

through [**11-14**], then Amiodarone 400 mg po bid from [**11-14**] through

Amiodarone 200 mg po q d.  He is started on Coumadin 2 mg po
q h.s.  He will need to have his INR checked and his Coumadin
dose adjusted for a goal INR of 2.0.  He is on Lopressor 25
mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po q d, Aspirin 81 mg po q d,
Atorvastatin; he will be restarted on his preoperative dosage
which is unavailable at this time.
