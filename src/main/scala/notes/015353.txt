glucometer, she took humalog 15u and checked FSG an hour later
but it was still very high. she checked her levels 4 times at
home. hence she took lantus 12 u and checked FSG after a couple

Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old female with type I diabetes, presented with diabetic
ketoacidosis, transferred to MICU with aggressive IVF and
insulin, now discharged with stable glucoses and electrolytes.

1.  Type 1 Diabetes with Diabetic Ketoacidosis - cause not
elucidated, no evidence of infection and patient reported
compliance with insulin treatment at home.  Intake sheet present
at [**Last Name (un) **], patient has not been officially seen.  Initial anion
gap metabolic acidosis with elevated glucoses >500, with
transient hypotension, started on D5 1/2 NS at 500/hr, and
received ~ 13 L of fluid during her stay with stabilization of
blood pressures.  Insulin drip started, then transitioned to
sliding scale insuling q4H w/ Glargine 20 Units QACHS when her
anion gap stabilized, with close of anion gap.  Electrolytes
remained stable.

   Her cultures were negative and tox screen for other metabolic
causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis were ruled out.  She also
had a non-anion gap acidosis post IVF administration, which will
need to be rechecked as outpatient.  Patient needs follow up [**Hospital1 **]Clinic to check electrolytes on Weds, [**2126-8-7**],
at 10AM with [**F
