Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p coronary artery bypass grafting x3(Lima-LAD/SVG->OM/PDA)


History of Present Illness:
61F w/ significant cardiac history with multiple stents, last to
LCx in [**10-9**], was in her USOF when she developed chest tightness
after dinner. Patient went to her bedroom and experienced [**10-11**]
crushing chest pressure at rest that radiated to the LEFT
axilla, was nonpositional, was associated with SOB, and lasted
for roughly 1 hour. No syncope or lightheadeness. No back pain.
No leg pain. No palpitations. No pnd. Has noted increase leg
swelling for 1 month. PCP doubled lasix dose and checked TTE
which showed unchagned EF. Pt thinks she has been gaining weight
but is unsure how much because she does not check. Does report
cough x 2 days but nonproductive and without fevers. She took 3
sub lingual nitroglycerines without relief. After calling EMS,
she experienced some relief with SL nitro spray. Patient reports
she has experiencecd chest tightness in the past as her anginal
equivalent, but reports this was more painful.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. The MR
vena contracta is <0.3cm. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened, primarily at leaflet tips. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post bypass: Preserved biventricular function, LVEF >55%. MR
remains trace/mild. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
