Chief Complaint:
found down with right upper extremity shaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube placement [**2111-1-18**].


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 35 year-old man with minimal PMH. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, intubated, from an OSH. We were
consulted for seizure.

By report, he had a trip-and-fall on his head yesterday (Sat
[**1-3**]), with no LOC and no known sequelae. He was reportedly
normal that evening and this morning ([**1-4**]), and went out with a
friend. On returning home in the afternoon he told the friend he
felt weak and sat down. When he did not get up hours later,
EMS was called and they took him to the [**Location (un) 47**] ED where he
was noted to have right-sided arm/leg weakness and expressive
aphasia. According to their notes, he was able to give
appropriate y/n head-nod/shake responses to questions and follow
commands. He denied any h/o stroke, seizure or illicit substance
abuse (he was MJ/THC+ on their Utox screen, however). He was
taking Nexium for GERD and Xanax tid for mood Sx (I confirmed
these Rx with [**Company 4916**], his pharmacy, and with his HCP/Aunt).
Then, he was noted to exhibit myoclonic jerks of his right arm
and leg. A Neurology assessment there was partial-complex
seizure. He was given a total of 12mg LZP and loaded with 1gm
PHT
to stop the shaking/jerking, and consequently intubated with
succ+etomidate for airway protection. He was bolused 200 of
propofol, self-extubated, given 2mg/h LZP gtt, 50mcg/h propofol
gtt, Phenobarbital 65mg IV, and then after re-intubation, was
given 4mg more of LZP on transport-EMS on the way here due to
Right-sided shaking.

He arrived intubated and sedated on a propofol gtt at 50. He was
again re-intubated on arrival (balloon above the vocal cords on
arrival). He exhibited shaking of his right arm, and a MDZ gtt
was started in the ED. A NCHCT here revealed a
left-insular/opercular/subcortical hypodense region (completed
infarct), and CTA revealed a left ICA large occlusion
(just proximal to bifurcation) and decreased # of distal MCA
branches on the Left. He has no known risk factors.

I spoke on the phone with his HCP/aunt [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88058**]. [**Name2 (NI) **]
was apparently in an OSH ED 5d PTA with cold Sx, normal CXR,
negative flu swab, sent home.

<<Exam was greatly limited by sedation not stopped [**1-14**] c/f sz.>>

General: Sedated, intubated.
HEENT: Intubated. Blood in ETT suction catheter after 3x
intubations. Normocephalic. Mild bruise on Lt forehead. No
scleral icterus. Mucous membranes are moist.
Neck: Supple, with full range of motion and no nuchal rigidity.
No carotid bruits appreciated, including specifically no bruit
over Left ICA (clot location seen on CTA). No lymphadenopathy
was
appreciated.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally. Non-labored breathing with
vent.
Cardiac: RRR, normal S1/S2, no M/R/G.
Abdomen: Mildly obese. Soft, non-tender, and non-distended, +
moderate bowel sounds. No masses or organomegaly were
appreciated.
Extremities: Warm and well-perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema. 2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

DISCHARGE EXAM
Eyes open, making eye contact, shakes head yes and no but not
appropriately to simple questions, and does not follow axial or
appendicular commands reliably or specifically.
Moves left side spontaneously with apparent full strength. Not
moving right side, but it withdraws purposefully to noxious
stimuli.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation may be due to left
anterior fascicular block. RSR' pattern with early precordial
QRS transition is non-specific. Consider posterolateral
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age, although is
non-diagnostic. ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but
cannot exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

IMAGING:

CTA HEAD AND NECK
1. Nonocclusive filling defect within the proximal left internal
carotid
artery, with occlusion of the distal left M1 segment and
opercular and insular branches with a nonhemorrhagic infarct in
the left MCA distribution. The atherosclerotic disease elsewhere
is most compatible with a dissection of the proximal cervial
[**Doctor First Name 3098**] with embolization to the left MCA.

MRI BRAIN
Acute infarct of the left MCA territory, likely secondary to
dissection as proposed in the prior CTA - post-traumatic versus
collagen
vascular disease etiologies are diagnostic considerations.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

EEG [**1-6**]

This 16-hour recording showed only severe diffuse
encephalopathic changes with loss of background and irregular
high
voltage delta with a little preservation of fast rhythms
centrally in
the right. This could be anoxic, ischemic, or possibly secondary
to
medication. No seizure activity or paroxysmal epileptic
interictal
discharges identified.

EEG [**1-7**]

This EEG shows an evolving encephalopathy going from an
extremely severe marked attenuation of all activity which may
have
reflected drug effect to a still severe encephalopathy with
diffuse
delta activity and suppression of rhythms posteriorly but there
were no
ictal or interictal discharge
