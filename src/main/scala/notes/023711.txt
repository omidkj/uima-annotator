pus.  He went to the wound care doctor, who was concerned for
osteomyelitis, and sent him to the ED.

#R Olecranon Osteomyelitis: The patient was started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics for his infected ulcer upon
admission. His antibiotics were tailored to vancomycin. Both
physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted. The
patient remained afebrile and his WBC was 8.6 at discharge. A
bone scan was performed to investigate the possibility of
osteomyelitis and this did show evidence of osteomyelitis of the
R elbow. Infectious disease was consulted and they recommended
6-weeks of vancomycin therapy at a dose of 1g q8h; with goal
trough levels 20-25. A L PICC line was placed. His vancomycin
trough was 23.6 at discharge (on 1250 mg q8h). F/u was to be
performed with the ID team; they requested qweek labs: CBC/diff,
BUN/Cr, ESR, CRP, Vanc trough qweek. This is to be faxed to Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 86061**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
