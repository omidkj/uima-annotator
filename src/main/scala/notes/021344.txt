surgery was tolerated well. She received 1700 cc crystalloid
intraoperatively and made 350 cc urine. Estimated blood loss was
100 cc. Blood pressures during the procedure ranged from the 90s
to 130s systolic.

She was noted to be hypotensive in the PACU to 87/30s with urine
output less than 15 cc/hr. She was given only 250 cc fluid out

and hypotension. She received another 250 cc fluid bolus and
albumin 500 cc x 1. Oxygen saturations were stable in the mid
90s on 2L nasal cannula without dyspnea. Hematocrit was noted to
be decreased to  23.8 from 30.6 preoperatively and she was

poor. She is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for central line placement
to monitor CVP to guide fluid management.

deep breath in. No lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, leg pain. She has mild
lower extremity edema which is unchanged over the past year. She
does have mild pain over incision. All other review of systems

CVP monitoring. Initial right subclavian line noted to be
misplaced in the neck. Line removed and replaced with left

motion/strength. An x-ray was done showing no acute fractures or
alignment abnormalities, mild DJD is noted at the AC joint.
