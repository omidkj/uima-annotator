Pertinent Results:
[**2121-10-1**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses. The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all
without any significant coronary artery disease. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 15 mmHg.  Left-sided filling
pressures were also moderately elevated with a PCWP of 22 mmHg.
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated with a PAS
pressure of 55 mmHg. There was borderline systemic systolic
arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 140/57,
mean 88 mmHg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 2.4 L/min/m2
(using an assumed O2 consumption).

[**2121-10-1**] Chest CT: 1. No significant calcification of the
thoracic aorta. 2. Large right non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion
with associated compressive atelectasis. Small left
non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion. 3. Right paratracheal lymph
node measuring 16-mm (2:24) with mutliple additional small
mediastinal/prevascular nodes. 4. 5-mm left apical nodule (4:32)
should be followed-up with CT in 12 months if patient does not
have a history of smoking or malignancy. Otherwise, follow-up
with CT in 6 months is recommended.

[**2121-10-2**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is elongated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is a
coronary sinus which appears dilated at > 1.5 cm. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild to
moderate ([**1-5**]+) tricuspid regurgitation. The tricuspid annulus
measures 2.7 cm in the septo-lateral dimension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2121-10-2**] at time of surgery. POST-BYPASS: 1. Improved
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. 2. Bioprosthetic valve in
mitral position, well seated and stable with good lealfl;et
excursion. 3. Mean transmitral gradient is 4 mm Hg. 4. Moderate
TR and mild AI. 5. No other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 89083**] was admitted preoperatively for Heparin bridge and
cardiac cath. On day of admission she underwent routine
pre-operative work-up. On [**10-1**] she underwent a cardiac cath
which revealed no coronary artery disease. In addition, she
underwent a chest CT. On [**10-2**] she was brought to the operating
room where she underwent a redo mitral valve replacement. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one she was
started on beta-blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed
towards he pre-op weight. EP interrogated pacemaker on post-op
day 1 and it was functioning appropriately. Later this day she
was transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
Coumadin was restarted for chronic atrial fibrillation and
titrated for goal INR. She remained slightly anemic post-op with
discharge HCT of 28.6. she worked with physical therapy during
her post-op course for strength and mobility. She continued to
make good recovery and was discharged to rehab on post-op day
five with the appropriate medications and follow-up
appointments. Coumadin dose of 2.5mg will be titrated by rehab
for goal INR 2-3.0. Upon discharge from rehab, rehab to set up
long-term f/u for Coumadin with PCP.
