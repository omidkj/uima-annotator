History of Present Illness:
This 63 year old woman has a history of hyperlipidemia, COPD,
diabetes and Crohn??????s disease. Since the spring she has been
bothered by episodes of chest discomfort that have been felt
across the chest, occurring at rest several times a week. She
underwent stress testing in [**2109-5-7**] which did not reveal any
perfusion abnormalities. LVEF was 68%. In [**Month (only) **] she was evaluated
at [**Hospital3 2737**] for similar complaints. She reportedly ruled
out for an MI. She has continued to have chest discomfort
several times a week and was seen by cardiology today. She has
since been prescribed Aspirin, plavix and SL nitroglycerin and
is now referred for cardiac catheterization to further
evaluation.

[**2109-9-2**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
with
significant intermedius branch revealed 3 vessel coronary artery

disease.  The LMCA and LAD did not had any angiographically
apparent
coronary artery disease.  The LCx had a proximal 80% OM1 lesion.
 The
RI had an ostial 60% lesion.  The RCA had severe disease
throughout the
entire vessel with up to 90% stenosis in the distal vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
sided
filling pressures (LV 168/18 mmHg).  The systemic arterial
pressure was
moderately elevated at 168/68 mmHg.  There was no gradient
during
pullback of the pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the
aorta.
3. Left ventriculography showed normal systolic left ventricular

function.  Ejection fraction was calculated at 77%.  There were
no
regional wall motion abnormalities.  There was no mitral
regurgitation.

[**2109-9-3**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on Mrs. [**Known lastname **] at 8:30AM.

During the OPCAB, there was inferior wall motion abnormality
which recovered.

[**2109-9-5**] CXR
No evidence for pneumothorax following removal of chest tubes.
Retrocardiac atelectasis possibly with small effusion. Overall,
standard
appearance for post-bypass graft chest film..


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2109-9-2**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed two vessel disease. Given the
severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical evaluation. She was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner and was ready for surgery. On [**2109-9-3**],
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to th eoperating room where she underwent
off pump coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Within 24
hours, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and plavix were resumed. She
stayed in the intensive care unit for hypotension responsive to
neosynephrine. On postoperative day two, she was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. She has remained hemodynamically stable, passed her
physical therapy evaluation, and is ready to be discharged to
home.
