Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OPERATION PERFORMED:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3, with a left internal
    mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending and
    reversed saphenous vein graft to the marginal graft and
    the right coronary artery.
2. Mitral valve repair with a 30-mm Physio II annuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
61M complicated hx including Diabetes,Dyslipidemia,Hypertension
Afib s/p failed cardioversion on coumadin and amiodarone,
Dilated cardiomyopathy, sCHF with EF of 25-30%, severe 3+ MR,
PFO, CAD, severe pulmonary hypertension on sidafenil, and CKD
p/w complaints of worsening dyspnea over the past 4-5 days. Per
the patient, has been doing well with rehabilitation, walking up
to [**1-6**] mile per day and "getting stronger everyday". Woke up
around Sunday morning, stating his legs were extremely week. In
addition, he felt he was more SOB and having worsening chest
pain. On the day of presentation,
his VNA saw him and noted increased work of breathing. He denied
fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain,
although did attest to right LE swelling with B/L LE pain
(aching). He does have 4 pillow orthopnea which has been stable
since he was discharged one month ago (was admitted here and
found to have pulmonary hypertension) as well as PND, though no
lower extremity swelling at baseline. Denies any recent trips.
Has been compliant with low sodium/low fluid diet. Called Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] today and spoke with [**Doctor First Name **] Nestory, who recommended the
patient present to the hospital. Of note, was scheduled for
surgery [**2182-8-28**] for MV replacement as well as PFO correction and
CABG.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T99 HR89 BP136/86 RR18 98% RA.
EKG showed sr 88, lad, 1st deg avb, ivcd, STD V4/5 [**Doctor Last Name **] to prior,
no stemi with scattered pvcs. Labs were significant for WBC of
10.6 (baseline), HCT of 33 with microcytosis of 80 for MCV
(baseline since [**2182-7-5**]), Creatinine of 1.7 (baseline), proBNP
of 3699 (last value of 8480 in [**4-/2182**]), troponin of 0.08
(baseline since [**4-/2182**]), INR of 2.4. CXR showed mild engorgement
of central pulmonary vasculature as well as scattered lines
denoting intralobular thickening with an impression of pulmonary
edema likely cardiogenic in etiology. Vitals prior to transfer
were 99.1 91 124/83 22 100%2l.
.
On the floor the patient is c/o chest pain (at baseline).
Otherwise NAD, but feels generally unwell.

Pertinent Results:
CAROTID DUPLEX ([**8-23**]):
1. There is no evidence of significant carotid artery stenosis
bilaterally.
2. Atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid bulbs and internal
carotid arteries bilaterally.
.
PANOREX TEETH AND MANDIBLE ([**8-23**]; handwritten note): 4x6mm
asymmetric nodule under angle of left mandible. Would recommend
repeat read by radiologist. Otherwise unremarkable
.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2182-8-23**])
FINDINGS: Mild engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature
is
identified. There is minimal prominence of the interstitial
markings. Few
scattered lines are denoting interlobular septal thickening
identified at the bases. The mediastinum is otherwise
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. No
definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Degenerative
changes are seen throughout the mid and lower thoracic spine and
in the included left acromioclavicular joint.
IMPRESSION: Mild prominence of the interstitial markings may
indicate mild
early edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology.
.
RIGHT HEART CATHETERIZATION ([**2182-8-29**]):
1. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
2. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Minimally elevated RA pressure.
4. Preserved cardiac output.
5. Slight response to nitric oxide in addition to 100% O2,
sildenafil,
and nifedipine (last dose given evening prior to AM test).  PVR
decreased from 6.5 to 5.7.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**8-29**]):
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and severely depressed
left ventricular systolic function with regional wall motion
abnormalities as described above. Mildly dilated aortic root and
ascending aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2182-8-12**], the previously noted noncoronary sinus of Valsalva
aneurysm is not clearly visualized. The peak pulmonary artery
systolic pressure has increased from 70 mmHg to 80 mmHg.
