Brief Hospital Course:
79M (Polish speaking) h/o CHF, CAD, OSA, atrial fibrillation,
presented with lethargy, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was
found to have urinary tract infection and hypernatremia.  Pt was
intially admitted to the MICU given possible urosepsis, but he
remained stable and was transferred to the floor the following
day.
.
# UTI: Pt had chronic indwelling foley for BPH, with urinalysis
consistent with UTI on admission, and urine culture growing
pansensitive Klebsiella.  Pt was initially treated with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone, with the vancomycin later stopped
given speciation of his urine culture.  Urology changed his
Foley catheter.  Follow-up urine culture demonstrated no growth.
 Pt was discharged to complete a 14 day course of cefpodoxime.
.
# C. Diff: Pt had loose stool so stool cx were sent which
returned CDiff pos.  He was started on metronidazole 500mg PO
TID, to be continued for 14d after completing cefpodoxime
course.
.
# ?Cellulitis: Pt developed erythematous, mildly indurated areas
at the bilateral upper arms, at pressure points where his arms
rested on pillows.  While it was considered unlikely cellulitis,
pt was prescribed mupirocin topical antibiotic.
.
# Altered mental status: Pt's lethargy was considered likely
secondary to UTI and hypernatremia.  His symptoms improved as
his infection was treated with antibiotics and as his
hypernatremia was treated with free water repletion.  TSH
demonstrated slight hypothyroidism which was considered likely
secondary to sick euthyroid.
.
# Hypernatremia: Serum sodium reached a maximum of 151 during
admission, and pt was treated with IVF with improvement.
.
# Afib with RVR: Pt was noted to have a rate in 120s, likely due
to metoprolol being initially held.  Pt was restarted on his
metoprolol with good subsequent rate control.  Metoprolol was
ultimately reduced to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] given frequent
asymptomatic pauses of up to almost 3 seconds.
.
# Elevated INR: Pt's elevated INR on admission was considered
most likely due to nutritional deficiency v. possible recent
levofloxacin.  Pt received vitamin K 10mg SC in the ED, and his
warfarin was held on admission.  Pt's INR trended down to less
than 2, and he was restarted on warfarin with a heparin bridge.
On discharge, his INR was 1.5 on warfarin 3mg QHS.  Given the
relative low daily risk of stroke [**2-20**] afib, pt was transferred
to his [**Hospital1 1501**] with instructions to recheck INR in two days and to
adjust his warfarin dosage accordingly.
.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Pt received an echocardiogram revealing
a hyperdynamic EF of 80% with severe symmetric LVH.  Pt did not
demonstrate signs of heart failure and was not started on any
new medications.
.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission
was elevated at 3.1 above his baseline of 2.4.  He was treated
with IVF and his creatinine improved.

# Anemia: Pt's hematocrit was stable during this admission, with
no evidence of bleeding.  Pt was continued on ferrous sulfate PO
as per outpatient regimen.
.
# BPH: Pt's chronic indwelling foley was changed by urology
during this admission, and pt was continued on finasteride.
.
# Depression: Pt's fluoxetine was discontinued, given his
altered mental status, and pt was changed to citalopram.
.
# Aspiration: Pt was evaluated by speech and swallow who
recommended a soft dysphagia diet, thin liquids, pills
administered whole with purees, and sitting upright for 30 min
after meals.
