History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62 y/o male with HTN, DM, Dyslipidemia, PVD presents from
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital after an inferior MI.  He presented there
this am from a nursing home with one day of chest pain.  Pain
was located across the chest without raditation to arms, jaw, or
back.  It was associated with SOB, nausea, diaphoresis. Pain was
[**10-8**] at its worst.  Pain did not resolve until he underwent
catherization.  ECG on presentation revealed an inferior STEMI.
BP was 80/40. Temp 101.5.  Patient was taken to cath lab where
PTCA was performed on mRCA.  TIMI III flow was achieved, however
stent could not be deployed.  Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival, patient c/o [**2-8**] chest discomfort.  He denied SOB,
N/V, abd pain.  He complained of left elbow pain.

[**2196-11-16**] Cath report
PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography showed an 80-90% stenosis
of the
distal RCA. We planned to treat this lesion with PTCA and
stenting.
Eptifibatide was given prophylactically. A 7 French JR4 guide
provided
suboptimal support (an AL0.75 and a MP guide would not engage).
A
Prowater wire crossed the lesion with ease and was positioned in
the
distal vessel. Pre-dilation was performed with a 3.0x15 mm
Maverick
balloon for multiple inflations at 6-8 atm. Angiography showed a
type
IIb dissection at the proximal edge of the lesion. We then
attempted to
deliver a 3.0x18 mm and subsequently a 3.0x8 mm Vision stent but
could
not advance either stent beyond the mid RCA. The wire was then
exchanged
for a Choice Floppy wire, which facilitated the delivery of the
3.0x8 mm
Vision stent to the dissection site and the stent was deployed
at 14
atm. Attempts to deliver a second 3.0x8 mm Vision stent further
distally to completely cover the lesion failed due to vessel
tortousity
and poor guide support. Final angiography showed a <20% residual

stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow. The patient left the
lab in
stable condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the RCA.

[**2196-11-14**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the
inferior wall). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
leftventricle. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion.

RIGHT FOOT, TWO VIEWS:  There are extensive vascular
calcifications noted.  An extensive soft tissue defect is noted
on the plantar surface of the heel. There is an overlying
dressing, which obscures fine bony detail.  There are no
fractures, dislocations, bony destruction, or periosteal
reaction.  Note is, however, made of diffuse increased density
in the posterior calcaneus, which appears to be due to thickened
and ill- defined trabeculae, more prominent in the left foot.
The joint spaces are grossly preserved.

LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS:  Extensive vascular calcifications are
noted.  There is a smaller soft tissue defect seen on the
plantar surface of the heel.  Note is made of diffuse increased
density in the posterior calcaneus, which appears to be due to
thickened and ill- defined trabeculae.  No fractures,
dislocations, bony destructions or periosteal reaction is
identified. The joint spaces are grossly preserved.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral soft tissue defects on the plantar surfaces of the
heel.
2.  Bilateral trabecular thickening, left greater than right,
within the
calcaneus.  This finding can represent chronic infection though
given that
these findings are not specifically in the area of the
posteroinferior
calcaneus where the soft tissue lies this is less likely;
neuroarthropathy or
healing insufficiency fracture are also in the differential.


IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(multivessel CAD vs toxic/metabolic state).


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 y/o male with multiple cardiac risk factors who presents
with inferior STEMI associated with heart block, now s/p cardiac
catherization with PTCA of mRCA but without stent deployment. Pt
now intubated, in HF, ?septic with long standing ext wounds.
.
1) STEMI: The pt received a cath with balloon angioplasty of the
RCA. However, a stent was unable to be placed. The pt's
presenting symptoms resolved during cath. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] with plans of having a repeat cardiac cath for a further
attempt at opening the lesion. At [**Hospital1 18**] the pt was placed on
ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg, and lopressor, titrated up as
tolerated by his blood pressure. He was kept on these
medications throughout his hospitalization. He was placed on
integrillin for 18 hours. Upon admission he was also placed on
stress dose steroids as the patient was on chronic steroids for
arthritis. Initially the pt was planned for an elective cardiac
cath 3 days after admission ([**2196-11-14**]). However, given the fact
that he spiked a temperature as high as 103.2 and was frequently
tachycardic with low blood pressures, it was felt that the pt
was questionably septic. The pt's chronic b/l heel and left
elbow wounds were felt to be a likely source of sepsis. The ccu
team felt that given the possibility of sepsis, a stent would
not be warranted given its potential as a nidus of infection.
The pt was planned for balloon angioplasty of his RCA rather
than stenting. During this period a swan ganz catheter was
placed. His swan readings were followed and did not indicate a
septic physiology. Also, the pt's blood cultures never
demonstrated the growth of any organism. Therefore the pt was
again felt to be a candidate for stenting. The pt was intubated
during a period of respiratory distress (discussed below). Once
stable the pt was kept intubated and was taken to cath where the
pt received successful stenting of his mid RCA with less than
20% residual flow.  Post Cath pt had some Sinus tachycardia
which was treated with increase in BB.  Pt also had one episode
of chest pain along with some abdominal pain and distention.
ECG was unchanged and pt's pain improved with maalox and
simethicone and did not recur.
