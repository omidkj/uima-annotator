Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo M w/ asthma flare likely [**2-20**] URI admitted for increased
nebs and further monitoring.
.
1. Asthma flare: Though recently pt w/ 2 flares in past week, he
seems to usually not have flares. He also may have been
underreporting sxs and has high tolerance of sxs at baseline. On
arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was switched to IV methylprednisolone,
which he received for two days, and then switched to po
prednisone (60-40-30-20-10) 10 day taper for continuation as
outpatient. He was placed on continuous neb treatments
initially, and then switched to albuterol q2 then albuterol q4.
By HOD3, he required no prn albuterol nebulizer treatments. He
was placed on an albuterol inhaler prn, as well as Advair [**Hospital1 **].
His peak flows improved to 600.
Patient is fairly noncompliant with his medications - states he
is unwilling to have regular follow-up with doctors. He would
ideally need a PCP and outpatient [**Name9 (PRE) 11149**], and minimizing of
environmental triggers (pt unlikely to be getting rid of dog,
however). His URI symptoms appeared viral, and did have
productive yellow cough. He remained afebrile in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but did
have a rising white count in the context of steroids. No
antibiotics were started.

2. Metabolic acidosis with gap and lactate 5.3, as well as
ketones in urine. Patient's acidosis was likely secondary to
lactic acidosis from acute asthma flare. Lactate down to 1.7
with fluids. Urinalysis shows glucose and ketones, but in the
context of poor po intake and poor glycemic control on steroids.
No sx of DKA. ABG c/w compensated metabolic acidosis. He may
need outpatient followup for FSBG.
.
3. FEN: He was on a regular diet.

4. Glucose: ISS.

5. Proph: PPI on steroids. Bowel regimen.

6. Code: DNR/I- confirmed with pt

7. Comm: with pt
