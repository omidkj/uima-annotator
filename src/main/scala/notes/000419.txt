Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath - Outside hospital transfer for pneumonia.

Intubation and mechanical ventilation at outside hospital
PICC Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31824**] is a 60 year old woman s/p OLT in [**2142**] due to HCV
cirrhosis with recurrent hep C (on peg-interferon) and ESRD on
dialysis who was admitted to OSH MICU for pneumonia and is now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  She was in her
usual state of health until the day of admission ([**2143-12-15**]) when
she woke up with SOB and cough productive of frothy pink sputum.
.
In the OSH ED she was febrile to 101.2.  CXR showed bilateral
infiltrates, new from CXR taken [**12-13**] in ED for evaluation of
possible rib fractures s/p fall.  The patient subsequently
developed respiratory failure requiring intubation.  She was
started on IV Zosyn and Azithromycin.  Her course was
complicated by hypotension requiring Levophed, and IV Vancomycin
was started.  She also developed atrial fibrillation with RVR
requiring IV Cardizem.  Her RVR resolved and she was weaned off
pressors. On HD#3 (day of transfer) she was extubated without
difficulty.  Her liver [**Month/Day (4) **] coordinator was [**Name (NI) 653**], and
agreed to have the patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On transfer, initial vitals were T 96.3, HR 98, BP 113/60, RR
16, O2 sat 99% on 2L NC.  She denies current SOB, but continues
to have occasional cough productive of brown sputum.  She also
complains of R rib pain, which she attributes to a mechanical
fall she sustained 2 days PTA.

AP Portable CXR [**2143-12-17**]:  Mild cardiac enlargement is new,
mediastinal venous engorgement is more pronounced and there is
persistent pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] plethora. Edema in the left lung
is mild. On the right side, there are larger areas of perihilar
opacification which could be the residual of what was previously
more widespread edema, or could be pneumonia or hemorrhage in
the right lung. It would be very helpful to have recent prior
chest radiographs.

Left PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial
junction. No
pneumothorax. Pleural effusion, if any, is not appreciable in
size.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C complicated by
cirrhosis s/p OLT in [**2142**], with recurrent hep C (on
peg-interferon), and ESRD on dialysis who was admitted to OSH
MICU for pneumonia and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
#Pneumonia:  Patient transferred from outside hospital with
RML/RLL pneumonia, status-post two-day intubation for
respiratory failure.  Patient was treated for health care
associated pneumonia because of her ongoing dialysis treatments.
 On arrival to the MICU she was afebrile with stable vital
signs, breathing comfortably on NC.  She was continued on IV
vancomycin from OSH and her zosyn/azithromycin was changed to IV
cefepime/flagyl.  She was transferred to the liver service.  On
the floor, the patient breathed comfortably on room air with
vast improvement in her cough.  She was continued on
ipratroprium nebs for dyspnea and incentive spirometry.  She was
treated with a lidocaine patch to her right chest for rib pain
to prevent further splinting.  The patient was discharged on
vancomycin with hemodialysis and levofloxacin to complete a
14-day antibiotic course.
.
# Hep C cirrhosis status-post OLT with recurrent hepatitis C:
Currently on peginterferon for hepatitis C. On sirolimus and
mycophenolate following OLT.  Sirolimus levels and LFTs remained
stable throughout admission.  The patient was continued on
single-strength bactrim for prophylaxis.  She will follow up in
the [**Hospital1 **] clinic upon discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, on propafenone,
diltiazem, and aspirin 325mg daily s/p ablation x 2.  The
patient had self-discontinued use of coumadin in [**2141**], as she
did not want further blood draws.  On admission to the outside
hospital, the patient was reported to have rapid ventricular
response controlled with IV diltiazem.  On the liver service,
the patient had several episodes of symptomatic rapid
ventricular response with rates to the 120's to 150's.  The
patient was seen by electrophysiology, who recommended an
increase in diltiazem and discontinuation of propafenone.  Her
rates improved.  The patient was discharged on diltiazem 240 ER
and ASA 325 daily.  She will follow up with her outpatient
cardiologist on discharge.
.
# Hypothyroidism:  Stable.  The patient was continued on home
levothyroxine throughout admission.
