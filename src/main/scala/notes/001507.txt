Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77 yo Greek-speaking female with PMH of HTN, A Fib, CAD
presented to the ED with 3-day history of shortness of breath
and abdominal pain. Patient, speaking through her son, reported
worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, and bilateral lower extremity
pitting edema, which has been a chronic problem for her. Her
functional status has been worsening, now only able to climb a
few steps before tiring. Reported a dry cough for 1-2 weeks.
Patient reported good medication compliance and no recent
changes in her diet. Patient also complained of abdominal
pain/bloating with early satiety and constipation. Stated
radiation of pain/burning up her chest. Denied vomiting,
diarrhea. Also complained of intermittent lower back pain
described as "somebody hitting her."

Patient presented to the ER with O2Sat=86% on RA.  She received
nitro and lasix (20mg IV x 1) and ASA as well as steroids
(solumedrol 125mg x 1) given history of underlying interstitial
pulmonary disease. Sent for CT angiogram to rule out PE and then
transferred to the MICU. In the MICU, she was placed on a nitro
gtt and diuresed with IV lasix. When oxygen was weaned to 4L NC
with sats in the mid-90s, the patient was transferred to the
floor.
.
ROS: The patient denied any fevers, chills, weight change,
vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,  urinary
frequency, urgency, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal
weakness, headache, rash or skin changes.
Stated recent retinal reattachment procedure.

CTA Chest [**2158-10-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Allowing for respiratory motion, no evidence of pulmonary
embolism seen.
2. Scarring and bronchiectasis in left upper lobe consistent
with history of interstitial lung disease. Prior studies, if
available, would be useful for comparison.
3. There is likely superimposed mild interstitial edema, with
small-to-
moderate right and small left pleural effusions and related
compressive
atelectasis. Numerous scattered sub-4-mm nodular opacities may
be related to early alveolar edema.
4. Evidence of prior granulomatous disease.

Renal U/S [**10-22**]:
1. Inability to perform full Doppler analysis to evaluate for
underlying
renal artery stenosis due to patient inability to breath-hold.
If high
clinical concern, a dedicated MRA could be performed.
2. Well-defined hyperechoic peripheral 1-cm left lower pole
lesion most
suggestive of a benign renal angiomyolipoma. Probable but not
definite 1-cm
right renal cyst. If not characterized by cross sectional
imaging, can get
follow up ultrasound in 6 months to confirm expected stability.

TTE [**10-24**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Left atrial dilation with mild diastolic LV dysfunction. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgiation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Dilated ascending
aorta.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-6-27**],
degree of diastolic LV dysfunction, as well as mitral and aortic
regurgitation has increased. Pulmonary hypertension is now
identified. The other findings are similar.

EKG [**10-29**]:
Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V block with a P-R interval of
0.52. Left
anterior fascicular block. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes. Poor R wave
progression could
be due to left anterior fascicular block and/or left ventricular
hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes are probably due to left
ventricular hypertrophy
but cannot exclude ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2158-10-28**] the
ventricular rate is faster such that the P wave is generally
within the
T wave, except in leads V2-V3. The P wave can be seen at the
tail end of the
T wave and then there is one early beat such that the R-R
interval is longer
and you do see the P wave with the P-R interval of 0.52.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old Greek-speaking female with a history of HTN, A Fib,
CAD, DMII, and ILD who presented with hypertensive urgency and
acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation.
.
# HYPERTENSION:  The patient has a history of hypertension, LVH
on EKG, diastolic dysfunction on her echo 1 year ago.  Her blood
pressures in the ED peaked at 250/110.  It was unclear whether
or not the patient had been taking her medications
appropriately. She denied recent dietary changes or increased
salt consumption. The patient was also felt to have a high
pretest probability of renal artery stenosis. She had renal
ultrasound completed but doppler could not be completed due to
technical difficulties. While awaiting MRA, the patient
developed acute on chronic renal failure.

Her initial home antihypertensive regimen was toprol xl 100mg
daily, benicar 40mg daily (max dose). Her meds were titrated up
with resolution of her hypertension and SBPs in the 120s-130s
range. When she developed ARF with eosinophil
