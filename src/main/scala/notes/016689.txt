HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
an unfortunate 67-year-old gentleman who presented initially
to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital on [**2147-4-9**]
with a history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  He
was started initially on the Surgical Service and failed to
resolve a small-bowel obstruction, and on [**2147-4-11**], he
underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy with laparoscopic lysis of
adhesions as well as a subsequent exploratory laparotomy and
washout for an enterotomy that occured. His postoperative course
was significant and
prolonged and characterized by respiratory failure and
sepsis.  He was re-intubated directly following initial
extubation after the case and kept on
vasopressors for a long period of time.  He subsequently
underwent emergent exploration for an abdominal compartment
syndrome with an abdominal washout as well as an abdominal
closure with a Vicryl mesh.  After this procedure was done, 3
weeks
later, he was taken back to the operating room for a lysis of
adhesions and a ventral hernia repair with a component
separation procedure as well as a vicryl mesh overlay.  The
second postoperative course was significant for ARDS
complications requiring a prolonged ventilatory support,
pneumonia, and sepsis.  He was treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics for this pulmonary sepsis.
The intensive care unit course was prolonged and was further
characterized by renal failure as well as cholestasis and
liver failure secondary to sepsis.  He required hemodialysis
and was followed by Renal Service and the Hepatology Service
for a complete evaluation of his liver profile and failure.
Eventually, he was trached on [**2147-5-3**] due to the prolonged
mechanical ventilation and subsequently easy to manage from
the pulmonary toilet standpoint.

On [**2147-6-8**], almost 2 months after his initial admission, he
was found to be stable enough to be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Rehab to continue his recovery.  At that time, it was
explained to the family that he remained ill and that the final
prognosis was reserved.  Three days after he was discharged
to [**Hospital3 672**], the patient re-presented and was
readmitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] after
an episode of hypotension following hemodialysis the day
prior.  Apparently, the patient was resuscitated with a
significant amount of oxygen, became tachypneic, and dropped
his saturations requiring resumption to a ventilator.
All along until that time, he was stable on a trach mask.
Since he was hemodynamically not improved, he was transferred
back to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.  Once in the ER, he was found to have a systolic
pressure in the 80s with saturations in 100 percent, being on
assist control ventilatory support.  He looked frankly
dehydrated still, and he had a white count of 21,000.  His
antibiotics were discontinued a couple of days before, and it
was thought that he might have had a recurrence of his septic
process, and he was immediately started on IV antibiotics
after he was adequately cultured.  He was admitted to the
intensive care unit for close monitoring.

Over the next couple of days, with antibiotic therapy, IV
fluid regimen in ICU care, he defervesced and his white count
came down.  His antibiotics were continued, and he was
restarted on his 3-times-a-week hemodialysis.  Nevertheless,
his liver profile continued to deteriorate and his bilirubin
with levels of 50, 55, and 58.  At this point, a new meeting
was held with the family to further clarify the code status
on this patient.  Family was still very adamant about doing
everything for the patient, even though the patient himself
expressed that he did not want to continue for much longer.
Eventually, the patient started to refuse hemodialysis, and
despite aggressive factor and blood product resuscitation, he
became progressively more and more coagulopathic.
Remarkably, he did not bleed despite the fact that his
platelet count was down in the 20 range with an INR of 5 and
a PTT above 150.  Once again, the MICU team concerted a
family meeting with the presence of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his attending
surgeon, and an ethicist of the hospital [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Clear-
cut
terms of resuscitation and endpoint of medical management
were discussed with the family.  The family decided to continue
full support despite
the dismal prognosis of this gentleman and asked for a second
opinion. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] arranged for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to evaluate the
current situation especially in regards to the unusual pattern of
his liver failure. Later that night, the daughter of the patient,
[**Name (NI) 26129**] [**Name (NI) **], called the unit
saying that the family further reconvened and decided to make
him DNR.  ICU care and support was continued, but the
antibiotics were discontinued and a medical decision was made
in order not to continue to give him blood products.  Two
days after this decision was made, he progressively
deteriorated, and after being evaluated earlier in the
morning of [**2147-6-24**], he was found to be hypotensive and
bradycardic.  He was still somehow somnolent and arousable
following commands, but he looked and appeared significantly
ill and worse.  Family was, at that point, present in the
hospital.  They were notified that the patient was moribund
and that he might not have much longer.  Shortly after noon,
on [**2147-6-24**], we were called to the Medical ICU to pronounce
him. We found him unresponsive, not moving.  Corneal reflexes
were absent as well as gag reflex or any withdraw similar to
pain.  He had absent pulses as well as no spontaneous
breathing, and there was no monitored trace in the telemetry.
He was pronounced dead at 12:10 p.m. on [**2147-6-24**].  As was
stated above, the family was present at the time and they
declined a postmortem examination.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**], the
attending covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified, and all the
paperwork was issued to the administration office at the [**Hospital1 1444**].
