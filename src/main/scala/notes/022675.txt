Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
[**2182-3-26**] AP CXR
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis.
Otherwise,  unremarkable study.

[**2182-3-27**] CXR:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bibasal atelectasis,
left more
than right, is unchanged. There are no new abnormalities seen
except for
interval development of mild vascular engorgement that might be
consistent
with mild fluid overload.
