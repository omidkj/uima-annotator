TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2112-1-21**] 11:41 PM

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT; LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO WITHOUT

Reason: ORIF LT TIB-FIB W/RODDING

STUDY: Intraoperative left tib/fib.

INDICATION: Left tib/fib rodding.

Eight intraoperative images of the left tibia and fibula were
obtained without a radiologist present. Images reveal interval
placement of an intramedullary tibial rod with interlocking
screws for stabilization of a comminuted tibial fracture. For
further details please see the operative report.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2112-1-21**] 5:55 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for injury
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old man s/p ped struck
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: History of trauma.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous images were obtained from
the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. Multiplanar
reconstructions were performed.

CONTRAST: 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast was administered due to
the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images
demonstrate no mediastinal abnormality. The vascular structures
are intact. There is no mediastinal air or fluid. The heart and
pericardium are normal in appearance. No pathologically enlarged
lymphadenopathy is identified. Lung window images demonstrate
tiny left pneumothorax. There is emphysematous change within
both lungs bilaterally. There is bilateral dependent
atelectasis. A chest tube is seen positioned within the left
hemithorax in the major fissure, with the tip positioned at the
apex. No pleural effusions are seen. The airways are patent to
the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. There is
subcutaneous emphysema adjacent to the area of chest tube
insertion on the left.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, kidneys,
adrenal glands, pancreas, and gallbladder are normal in
appearance. No free fluid or free intraperitoneal air is seen.
No pathologically enlarged lymphadenopathy is seen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is seen
within the bladder. The rectum is normal in appearance. No free
fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.

BONE WINDOWS: Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen, of the
5th, 8th, 9th, and 10th left ribs. No other definite fractures
are seen. The pelvic bones are intact. There is slight
irregularity of the left inferior pubic ramus which suggests
prior trauma. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were
performed, permitting evaluation of the thoracic and lumbar
spine. No definite fractures or spondylolisthesis is seen. There
is minimal anterior wedging of the L1 vertebral body of unknown
chronicity.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential
in delineating the anatomy and pathology.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pneumothorax. A left chest tube is seen in the
major fissure, with the tip positioned at the left apex.
Consider repositioning.
2. Multiple left-sided rib fractures.
3. Minimal anterior wedging of the L1 vertebral body of
uncertain chronicity.
4. Emphysematous changes within the lungs bilaterally.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2112-1-21**] 5:54 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old man s/p ped struck
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: History of trauma, evaluate for intracranial
hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The study is somewhat limited
secondary to motion. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally
midline structures. No intracranial mass effect is seen. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The density of
the brain parenchyma is within normal limits. No fractures are
identified. Minimal soft tissue thickening is noted within the
left maxillary sinus. There is soft tissue thickening and
hematoma overlying the right temporal region.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture is
identified. Scalp edema and hematoma over the right temporal
region.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2112-1-22**] 8:52 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: is there a PTX?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old man s/p MVC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
is there a PTX?
INDICATION: Intubation.

FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube ends above the clavicles at least
5 cm above optimal position. The heart size and mediastinal
contours are normal. No pneumothorax is seen. A chest tube
identified on a CT from [**2112-1-21**] has been removed. Subcutaneous
gas along the left chest wall is unchanged. The lungs are clear
without effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary parenchymal
consolidation.

IMPRESSION: High placement of the endotracheal tube. This
finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 64926**] at the time of
interpretation.
