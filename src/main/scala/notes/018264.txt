Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of HTN and
tobacco use was presented to an OSH ED ([**Hospital3 51058**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 86711**]) from her PCPs office with hypotension in the 70s. The
patient is currently intubated, so most information was gained
from the medical records. She presented to her PCPs office with
complaints of 3 days of severe shortness of breath, cough,
congestion, and general malaise. Her symptoms [**Doctor Last Name **] also noted be
associate with subjetive fevers/chills, poor PO intake, and
loose stool. At the OSH ED, she was noted to be hypotensive
76/45, HR 103, T 99.4, satting 86% on RA. She was noted to have
new ARF with Cr to 4.5m Depsite receiving 2L. She was given a
dose of levofloxacin, placed on a NRB, and transfered to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for further manegement.
.
On arrival to the ED, patient's 92/40, HR 100, RR 24, satting
98% on 15L. She remained hypotensive throughout her ED course
with SBPs in the 70s and 80s, and was uptitrated on levo, neo,
and dopamine to maximal doses with continued hypotension. She
recieved an additional 7L of NS. She was given vancoymcyin and
clindamycin with concern of a PCN allergy. With continued
hypoxia with O2 sats to low 80s, she was intubated. No ABG or A
line oculd be placed. The patinet continued to have low O2 sats,
and had her FiO2 increased to 100%, PEEP increased to 15. She as
transfered to the floor for further care.
.
On arrival to the floor, an ABG was checked showing a gas of pH

6.91 pCO2 77 pO2 67 HCO3 17. 2 amps of HCO3 were given and a
HCO3 drip was started. Vasopressin was started. Her pressors
were weened over the course of her first hour, to low levels of
levophed and vasopressin. Her CVP was 15, and fluid
ressusitation was held. With high peak pressures and ? partial
right mainstem intubation, her ET tube was pulled back 1 cm. An
A line was placed, her PEEP increased from 15 to 20. With absent
bowel sounds on exam and marked leukocytosis with a history of
loose stool, flagyl was given. 4g of Ca were given for iCa of
0.7. Paralytics were started. She was placed on droplet
precautions and tamiflu was given. An A line was placed and
oxygention improved

  RADIOLOGY
=============

CHEST X-RAY
CHEST, UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP VIEW: The right IJ catheter
terminates in the
right atrium. Diffuse airspace consolidation, most severely
involving the
right upper and lower lobes is concerning for pneumonia. Left
hilar
lymphadenopathy may be reactive, although an underlying mass
cannot be
excluded.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right IJ catheter terminating in right atrium.
2. Extensive bilateral airspace consolidation and left hilar
lymphadenopathy. As noted on the previous study, this should be
followed to resolution to exclude an underlying mass.

ECHO ([**2179-12-15**])
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT CHEST ([**2179-12-15**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Dense parenchymal multifocal airspace consolidation, most
compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
2. Distended gallbladder with small amount of pericholecystic
fluid and
gallbladder stone seen in the region of the neck. Mild
mesenteric stranding adjacent to gallbladder tip. Recommend
clinical correlation, and right upper quadrant ultrasound to
exclude possibility of cholecystitis.
3. No discrete fluid collections that would be concerning for
abscess
formation.
4. Mild wall thickening seen in several regions of the colon,
though is more likely secondary to collapsed bowel from
underdistension as no associated mesenteric stranding to suggest
active colitis.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  The patient presented with 3 days of
fever, cough, SOB and congestion.  She presented to an OSH
hypoxic and hypotensive.  She was given levofloxacin, placed on
a NRB and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  IN the ED she continued to be
hypoxic to the low 80's and hypotensive requiring pressors
(levophed, neo, dopamine). She was intubated for respiratory
failure.  She was also given Vancomycin, clindamycin and
tamiflu.  She was transferred to the ICU for further management.
 The patient had a CXR that showed multifocal opacities and was
venilated based on ARDS protocol.  The patient's flu came back
negative from the State Lab and tamiflu was d/c.  However, blood
cultures from [**Hospital1 15331**] returned with S. pneumo (pan-sensitive)
and he was continued on meropenem/vancomycin.  The patient was
eventually narrowed to a 14 day course of levofloxacin.  The
sputum cultures have only grown yeast and all blood cultures
remained negative.  The patient was aggressively diuresed given
volume overload on a lasix gtt and eventually was able to be
extubated on [**12-25**].  Following extubation, patient did well with
oxygen via nasal canula. It was weaned as tolerated.  On
discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname 86712**] was satting 95% on 2-3L by NC.
.
#Hypotension- On admission the patient was hypotensive and
required pressors including levophed, neo, and dopamine.  He
received approx 7L of IVF for hypotension.  In the ICU the
patient's pressors were able to be weaned to levophed and
vasopressin overnight.  The patient was able to be weaned off
levophed on [**12-18**], but remained on vasopressin intermittently
until [**12-25**] while being diuresed.  Aside from one episode of
hypotension while on lasix/ ambien, Mrs.[**Known lastname 86713**] blood
