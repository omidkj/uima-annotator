Mr. [**Known lastname 8498**] is an 81 year-old former smoker with [**Last Name (un) 309**] body
dementia and dysphagia who presents with respiratory distress.
He is bedbound at baseline, cared for by his family, and has
been having likely aspiration for at least one year, with
worsening over the past week, as demonstrated by increased
coughing after eating. He was doing well until last night when
he began coughing more frequently, though his cough was
non-productive. This morning, he developed gradually worsening
dyspnea and was brought to the E.D. by his daughter and
son-in-law, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], one of the attending cardiolgoists
at the [**Hospital1 18**]. He was also described as having difficultly
clearing his secretions en route. ROS was negative for fevers,
chills, sick contacts, pets, n/v/diarrhea.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98.2 120 106/61 27 89%ra.
He appeared in marked respiratory distress and was placed on
cpap (peep 5), with improvement in his respiratory status. An
ABG demonstrated 7.32/39/71 and a CXR was concerning for a
likely LLL pneumonia. He was given ceftriaxone, azithro, and
clinda for aspiration and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8498**] is an 81 year-old former smoker with [**Last Name (un) 309**] body
dementia and dysphagia who presented with respiratory distress.
.
Primary Diagnosis: 486 PNEUMONIA, ORGANISM UNSPECIFIED
Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia.
Now has a persistent infiltrate on CXR likely an aspiration
pneumonia vs community-acquired pneumonia. After receiving bipap
he was sent to the ICU. His respiratory status improved enough
to be transferred to the floor soon afterwards.  He was treated
with levofloxacin to complete a 10 day course. At the time of
discharge he was on room air breathing comfortably.
.
Secondary Diagnosis: 584.9 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Secondary Diagnosis: 585.3 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, STAGE III
(30-59)
Cr elevated to 3.2 from baseline of 1.2.  Improved with IVF and
intake from TF. To be checked the week following discharge.
.
Secondary Diagnosis: 276.0 HYPERNATREMIA
The patient was dehydrated on admission. Free water repleted
with combination of IV and NG free water. Nutrition recommended
daily intake of 450cc a day to maintain sodium, which did not
appear to work as his sodium was increasing on this regimen, so
he was discharged on 750cc/day of free water to be checked in
the week following discharge.
.
Secondary Diagnosis: 287.5 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, UNSPECIFIED
Has baseline Plts in mid 100's. fell lower with fluids, but
returned to baseline.
.
Secondary Diagnosis: 787.20 DYSPHAGIA, UNSPECIFIED
S/S evals revealed aspiration.  Plan for 2 weeks of TF to regain
strength and to clear infection along with heavy secretions. At
2-3 weeks, repeat bedside swallowing eval to be performed to
return to prior PO intake.
.
Secondary Diagnosis: 331.82 DEMENTIA, [**Last Name (un) **] BODIES (PICK'S)

effects even in advance [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Confused - always
Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair
Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable


Discharge Instructions:
-Tube Feeding:The tube feeds will operate on a continuous pump
at 50ml/hr. The dobhoff tube has been marked at it's current
site and please ensure that it is secured at all times. When the
patient is getting out of bed or laying flat in bed, the tube
feeds should be put on hold for [**11-10**] minute prior if possible.
While the tube feeds are running the head of the bed should be
at >45 degrees. The free water flushes should start at 125 ml
six times a day and can be administered by shutting off the tube
feeds for 5-10 minutes, then slowly infused with a syringe. Our
nutritionist recommend 125 ml flushes 3 times a day to meet his
free water goals, but he appeared to require approximately 6 to
maintain his blood tests in normal range. The free water will
likely need to be adjusted based on his laboratory findings
which will be drawn by VNA 2 times in the next week.
-Swallowing function:We recommend re-evaluating his swalling
with a bedside swallowing evaluation in [**3-1**] weeks when his
strength has returned to pre-hospitalization levels. While his
swallowing function is improving, we recommend oral care every 6
hours to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
-Antibiotics:He received 7 doses of antibiotics during the
hospitalization and he will only need 3 more days of treatment.
This can be done by crushing and soaking the pills in water and
flushing them in the tube once a day.

Followup Instructions:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] has been contact[**Name (NI) **] about his discharge and we
recommend calling his office for follow up plans on monday.  If
you would like to arrange a new patient follow up with a
geriatrician in your area that is recommended as well.
