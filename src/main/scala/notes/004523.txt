History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 45yo F w/hx of asthma who presented to the ED
with 6 days of epigastric pain and 2 episodes of BRBPR.  She
states that in [**Month (only) 404**] she had similar epigastric pain and an
episode of BRBPR and was hospitalized in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].  She
reports having a CT scan which showed diverticulitis vs.
proctitis and she was given a course of antibiotics.  She did
not have any further episode until 6 days ago when she developed
a "contraction"-like pain in her epigastric area which lasted
for several hours and then resolved.  She also had an episode of
"significant" blood in the toilet bowel and on the outside of
her stool.  This resolved that day and she was fine until 3 days
ago when she had a similar pain and more BRBPR.  She had nausea
and vomiting x 2 days without hematemesis, coffee-ground or
bilious emesis.  She then presented to the ED.  ROS is positive
for lightheadedness, diarrhea x 3 days, and subjective fevers
and chills 5 days ago.  Prior to [**Month (only) 404**] she has not had this
pain before.  She denies melena.  No recent travel except to
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**] in [**Month (only) 404**].  No sick contacts or any family members
with [**Name2 (NI) 105863**].  Of note, she also reports that her
menstrual cycles have been irregular since [**Month (only) 404**], occurring
twice per month and heavy flow for 3 of 5 days.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.5 BP130/71 HR105 R20 100%RA. NG
lavage with 100 cc NS was without blood.  She was guaiac
negative x 2.  Patient was given morphine 4mg IV x 1, zofran 4mg
IV x 1, protonix 40mg IV x 1.  She was given 2L NS.  GI was
called and planned to see and scope the patient in the AM.  She
had 1 episode of BRBPR at 7pm.  Repeat HCT was stable at 24.8,
down from baseline.
.
On the floor, she complains of [**6-4**] epigastric pain associated
with shortness of breath.  She denies nausea.

Pertinent Results:
EGD ([**2108-5-11**]):
.
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. The
efficiency of a colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed
with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage
of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
moderate sedation. The physical exam was performed prior to
administering anesthesia. The patient was placed in the left
lateral decubitus position.The digital exam was abnormal. Large
skin tag and external hemorrhoid. The colonoscope was introduced
through the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until
the terminal ileum was reached. The cecal sling folds were seen.
The appendiceal orifice and ileo-cecal valve were identified.
Careful visualization of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] was performed as the
colonoscope was withdrawn. The colonoscope was retroflexed
within the rectum. The procedure was not difficult. The quality
of the preparation was good. The patient tolerated the procedure
well. There were no complications.
.
Findings:
Protruding Lesions Small internal hemorrhoids with skin tags
were noted.
Impression: Internal and external hemorrhoids; large skin tag
noted on external exam as well.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
.
Recommendations: No cause of symptoms found.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 22553**] to further assess small bowel.
Return to inpatient hospital [**Hospital1 **].

Brief Hospital Course:
1. BRBPR: Differential initially included lower GI source
including IBD, hemorrhoids, AVM vs. upper GI source given
epigastric pain, including duodenal ulcer.  She does not endorse
NSAID use.  Negative NG lavage and lack of melena makes upper GI
source less likely. GI was consulted in ED and monitored her
overnight in the MICU and she was sent to the floor on the
following day for an upper and lower scope.  She remained
hemodynamicaly stable and never bled again in house.
Unfortunately endoscopy and colonoscopy were unrevealing, save a
small patch of gastritis and a few hemorrhoids.  The plan going
forward is to continue on a PPI and follow-up with GI for a
small bowel capsule study.
.
2. Epigastric Pain: likely gastritis and likely unrelated to
BRBPR or UGIB.

Discharge Diagnosis:
GI Bleeding
Hemorrhoids
Gastritis


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an episode of GI
bleeding.  You were observed in the MICU overnight and found to
be safe and stable.  You underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy
which revealed hemorrhoids, gastritis, possibly something called
"barrett's esophagus" which is a change in esophagus from acid
in the stomach.  It was not clear that this could have caused
all of your bleeding and as such the gastroenterologists would
like you to follow-up with them for a "capsule" study.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
You were started on 40mg of omeprazole twice per day
Please take phenergan as needed for nausea
You will be given three day supply of percocet for pain control

Followup Instructions:
