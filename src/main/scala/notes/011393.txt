RUQ u/s:
IMPRESSION:
1. Shrunken, nodular liver with coarsened echotexture and areas
of heterogeneity, consistent with cirrhosis. Patent umbilical
vein and possible to and fro flow within the intrahepatic main
portal vein suggests portal hypertension. Patent main portal
vein.
2. Large amount of ascites
.
Renal u/s:  IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Large ascites.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. No
pericardial effusion.
.
Chest AP portables:
[**2168-7-16**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-15**], the NG tube
again extends to the body of the stomach. Slightly better
inspiration with the cardiac silhouette now within normal
limits. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion. There is an
area of ill-defined opacification in the right mid lung zone,
worrisome for developing pneumonia. Mild atelectatic changes are
seen at the left base. The right hemidiaphragm is now quite
sharply seen, though there is still some blunting of the
costophrenic angle suggesting some pleural effusion on this side
.
