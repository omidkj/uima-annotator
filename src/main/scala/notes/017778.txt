Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for retroperitoneal bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rt thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
68 yo female with h/o COPD, afib, CAD, DM, CHF who presented to
an OH with cough and shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with
a COPD exacerbation ([**12-8**]). In house, pt started to complain of
RUQ pain. RUQ ultrasound showed non-obstructive cholelithiasis
and moderately thickened gall bladder wall. HIDA scan negative.
It was thought that pt would benefit from an elective lap chole
per surgery and medicine. Transferred to the transitional unit
for coumadin reversal where Pt had drop in hematocrit (29-->25
in 1 hour). EGD showed a hiatal hernia and gastritis in the
antrum. Colonoscopy negative for GI bleed. Pt was guiac
negative. CT abdomen showed large right retroperitoneal hematoma
and extending from the level of the iliacus and psoas to the
right obturator externus muscle and a moderate to large acute
right rectus abdominus hematoma. Bleeds were thought to be
secondary to coumadin (afib) in addition to patient being put on
lovenox while in the transitional unit. A total 11 [**Location **], 8
[**Location 16678**], 30 of cryoprecipitate, and 8 bags of platelets given
to patient during stay in addition to DDAVP x 2 and protamine x
1, 14 L of fluid, in the setting of decreasing platelets and
increasing INR. WBC elevated in the 20's. XCR ([**12-20**]) showed
increasing pulmonary vascular congestion with right LL
infiltrate and pleural effusion. Hemotology consult thought
thrombocytopenia was dilutional. Pt's renal function
deteriorated in setting of hypotension and compromised renal
flow secondary to extrinsic compression by the hematoma.
Transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for aggressive fluid hydration and further
management hypotension.


Past Medical History:
CAD, CHF, COPD, CRF (baseline 1.1-2) (?), Afib, non-obstructive
gallstone disease, gastritis, hiatal hernia, DMT2, spondylosis,
SSS, s/p MI (year?), S/p CabG, osteoporosis

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**2130-12-21**]
R pleural effusion - decreased and minimal.

Abd CT [**2130-12-21**]
Large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right
posterior pararenal space down into the pelvis. Hemorrhage into
the right rectus muscle is also noted.

Echo [**2130-12-21**]
Mild symmetric LVH with normal LV systolic function. Normal RV
size and systolic function. Mildly dilated aorta. Moderately
thickened aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis and mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension

CXR [**2130-12-23**]
Pleural effusion with increasing opacity at the right base,
which may reflect an acute infiltrate.

Renal U/S [**2130-12-22**]
Large retroperitoneal hematoma on the right. Right kidney
displaced anteriorly. Arterial and venous flow within the kidney
is demonstrated. No
hydronephrosis is seen.

IV catheter tip:
STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    >15 colonies.
      CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).    >15 colonies.

Urine cx [**2130-12-21**]:
Enterococcus sensitive to Vanc, but resistant to Levo and
Ampicillin.



Brief Hospital Course:
SOB-Pt clinical picture initially suspected to be COPD with
wheeze on exam, history of asthma and normal EF on TTE with
minimal sign of failure on CXR. Solumedrol was slowly titrated
up to 100mg q8h with poor response, as the pt was diuresed
approximately 1L neg each day for the first 5 days of
hospitalization. On [**12-24**] steroid taper was begun and more
agressive diuresis was begun. Oxygen requirement was weaned over
the next 4 days from 4LNC to 1L and had improved tachypnea with
stable O2 requirement of 1L NC. PE cont to suggests both
intravascular as well as total body volume overload with
anasarca, although MM cont to be dry. TTE had poor windows
although she appeared to have a normal EF but LVH and probable
diastolic HF. Difficult to assess what is rt hrt failure vs left
due to chronic pulm disease. Pt cont to have mild rale on rt of
unlclear source since they worsened with diuresus.  Poor air
movement on PE suggest component of obstructive airway disease
although after discussion with pcp it appeared that she only had
moderate asthma with no PFT's in past. There also appears to be
a component of hypoventilation due to hematoma obtructing
diaphragmatic excursion on rt., along with obesity. CT surgery
was conusulted and were concerned that opacity at rt lung base
on CXR represented hemothorax although repeat CT showed only
effusion with fluid density. She was cont steroid taper now on
20mg prednisone to with plan for 20mg x1 days, 10mg x2days 5mg
x2days with last dose on [**2131-1-2**].  Creatinine remained stable so
will cont to diurese with BUMEX 1mg PO bid along with
acetazolamide for 5 more days as below.

Afib-pt had occasional tachycardia which may be due to
intravascular volume depletion with diuresis despite rate
control with diltiazem and digoxin while being paced.  Diltiazem
was titrated up to 90 tid with HR in 80's. Rate control was
critical in pt with diastolic HF although we did not want to
blunt compensation for volume depletion. We held on
anticoagulation and it will need to be addressed as an outpt.

Retroperitoneal hematoma-Pt abdominal pain improved and Hct
remained stable with actual increase. Pain was thought likely
due to hematoma, although hct was stable for 9 days prior to
dishcarge. No need for intervention if Hct remains stable since
she would be poor surgical candidate per vascular. Risk of
hemorrhage outweighs stroke risk with afib so cont to hold
coumadin. Pt with severe ecchymosis on abdomen from sc heparin
so unclear if pt is hypersensitive.

Acute on chronic RF-Due to HF and possible compresive component
on ureter by hematoma although no hydroureter on CT abdomen. Pt
creat improved close to baseline of 1.2-1.5 now at 1.5.  ABG
revealed metabolic alkalosis with combined respiratory acidosis.
Serum bicarb remains high so acetazolamide was added to help
correct contraction alkalosis to improve breathing drive with
plan for 5 days prior to discharge. Cont Bumex as above.

ID-Pt WBC increased again despite steroid dose stable. Steroids
remains suspected cause since no bandemia or suspected source.
Possible sources incuded VSE grown in Ucx although U/A neg at
the time so stopped vancomycin. Initial CXR showed RLL linear
atelectasis and min change on repeat which may have been due to
compression from effusion and no lg amount sputum production.
Cont to empirically treat for CAP with levofloxacin although CT
showed no clear infiltrate with plan for 10 day regimen.

DMII-Pt con to be better controlled FS likely due decreased
steroids. Will cont on RISS for now down to 30U NPH [**Hospital1 **], but
will titrate down as steroids are weaned.

FEN-diabetic renal diet

Px-PPI, bowel regimen, SC heparin stopped and on pneumoboots
