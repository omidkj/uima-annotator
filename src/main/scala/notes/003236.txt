Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular peritoneal shunt placement [**2106-6-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66 yo male w/ PMHx sig for who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**5-18**] - [**6-9**] for hospitalization related to
a non-aneurysmal SAH with complicated hospital course now
readmitted for altered mental status and CT scan from [**6-24**] that
showed marked hydrocephalus.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-18**] for altered
mental status and gait difficulties.  CTA of the end showed
SAH in the basilar cisterns, with no evidence of aneurysm by CT
and conventional angiogram.  The patient's initial CT scan from
[**5-18**] showed evidence of hydrocephalus that resolved on the
following CT from [**5-19**].  The patients hospital course was
complicated respiratory distress requiring intubation,
pneumonia,
and fluctuating mental status.  Neurology saw the patient and
felt that b/l SDH could be causing the impaired mental status.
The patient then went for b/l frontal burr holes.  Eventually he
was transferred to step down and eventually to a rehab unit.  At
rehab, the patient continued to have difficulty with attention
and orientation.  He had a head CT on [**6-24**] that showed marked
hydrocephalus.  As a result, he was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
planned VP shunt.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2106-6-28**]
1. Interval right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with
persistent unchanged moderately severe hydrocephalus.

2. Minimally larger right frontal subdural collection measuring
up to 10 mm compared to prior 9 mm. Unchanged left frontal
subdural collection.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2106-6-29**]
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg

NECK,SOFT TISSUE US [**2106-6-26**]
Small hypoechoic nodules as described above within the right and

left lobes of thyroid without aggressive features. No definitive
mass seen in the midline region of the neck, underlying region
of palpable concern. If clinical concern persists, recommend CT
of the neck for further evaluation.

Series of CT HEAD w/o contrast:
[**7-2**] IMPRESSION:
1. Increased hypodense bilateral frontal subdural collections,
more prominent on the right with new small amount of blood
layering along the right frontal convexity. These findings could
be related to marked decrease in ventricular size and
re-expansion of bilateral subdural spaces. Close followup is
recommended.

2. Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter in the right lateral
ventricle is unchanged .

[**7-6**] IMPRESSION:
1. Marked interval increase in ventriculomegaly compared to [**7-2**], with
unchanged configuration of the VP shunt catheter in the right
lateral
ventricle.
2. Stable bilateral subdural collection, without evidence of new
bleeding.

[**7-7**] IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent ventriculomegaly with right frontal VP shunt in
unchanged
configuration, compared to [**7-6**], but overall worsened compared
to [**7-2**]. Some narrowing of the suprasellar cistern due to
enlargement of the third ventricle is also unchanged.
2. Stable bilateral subdural collections.
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage.

[**7-9**] IMPRESSION:
1. No interval change since yesterday's exam, with persistent
ventriculomegaly and stable bilateral subdural collections.
2. Unchanged scattered mastoid air cell opacification.

CT CHEST [**7-6**]:
Slightly suboptimal bolus timing. Bilateral small segmental PE,
non
occlusive, predominantly in the left and right lower lobe and in
the right
upper lobe. Mild right pleural effusion, bilateral atelectasis.
  No evidence of right heart strain.
  No other lung parenchymal changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
67M s/p nonaneurysmal SAH and external hydrocephalus presented
from rehab with altered mental status. Outpatient head CT showed
an increase in hydrocephalus and the patient was admitted to the
neurosurgical service for VP shunt placement. VP shunt was
placed without complication on [**6-28**]. Patient was transferred to
the MICU on HD#4 for respiratory distress due to aspiration
pneumonitis. The patient was stable for transfer to the medical
floor on HD#6. Additional hospital course was complicated by
aspiration pneumonia treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Nasogastric tube feeding was initiated. Frequent adjustments to
the VP shunt were made by the neurosurgery team. Heparin IV was
started to treat pulmonary emboli diagnosed on [**7-6**] after
discussing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation with the
neurosurgery team. On [**7-9**] a meeting was held with the primary
medical team, palliative care team (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9305**] [**Name (STitle) 4261**] and
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 501**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23636**], NP), the patient's sister (and healthcare proxy)
and the patient's brother-in-law. We discussed Mr. [**Known lastname 23637**]
strong religious beliefs and advanced directives about
end-of-life care. These preferences were reinforced via
communication with his primary care physician who had spoken
openly with the patient about his beliefs on a prior occasion.
Despite an unclear prognosis, the patient's sister stated
clearly that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would not favor having a gastrostomy
tube placed for a more permanent means of delivering nutrition,
nor would he favor transfer to a rehabilitation facility. His
family stated unequivocally that Mr. [**Known lastname 23637**] preference would
be a comfort-based approach to his care. Comfort measures only
were instituted that day and he was transferred to inpatient
hospice on [**7-10**]. He passed away at 12:24 AM on [**2106-7-11**].
