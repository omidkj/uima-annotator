Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
59 y/o with OSA, asthma, severe pulmonary hypertension, cor
pulmonale on 3-4L home O2 who was admitted after presenting to
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 151**] O2 saturation of 78% in the absence of increased
dyspnea.  She describes several weeks of feeling "heavy", with a
10 pound weight gain and swelling in her thighs.  She went to a
preschedueld appointment with her PCP on the day of admission
and was found to be hypoxic with O2 saturation of 78%, for which
they referred her to the ED.  She was not more SOB than usual
and denies any cough, chest pain, palpitations, PND, orthopnea,
or lower extremity edema.  She denies any change in diet or
increased salt intake, but attributes fluid overload to
medication adjustments associated with recent hospitalizations,
including a change in her diuretic and a recent course of
prednisone.
.
On arrival to ED, VS: 97.2 80 116/71 20 88% on 4L. Exam with
crackles and diffuse wheeze, decreased BS at bases. Given 50mg
prednisone and nebs and lasix 80mg IV x 1 with 100cc UOP.  CXR
with vascular congestion, not much different than baseline. EKG
with RVH and unchanged. Given persistent hypoxia to 87-97% on
4L, pt went to the ICU.  She was treated with 120mg furosemide
x2.  Repeat CXR suggested possible developing consolidation in
left mid lung zone.
.
On the floor, she reports shortness of breath consistent with
her baseline and describes feeling as if much of the extra
weight has been taken off.  Her baseline O2 sat is 92-93% on 3L
at rest and 4L with ambulation, but she notes that it often dips
to 70% without her becomign symptomatic.  She is able to perform
all IADLs at home and go grocery shopping without being short of
breath.  No longer able to walk around [**Country **] Pond.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI.  Also reports increased chronic knee pain and new
aching back pain x3 weeks, which she attributes to carrying
around the extra water weight.  Notes rhinorrhea, congestion
secondary to seasonal allergies.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness. Denies cough, shortness of
breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies
dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

Past Medical History:
- morbid obesity s/p gastric bypass, hernia repair [**6-1**]
- OSA on nocturnal BIPAP (18/15) and 3-4L home O2
- obesity hypoventilation syndrome, baseline bicarb 40s, pCO2
80s
- pulmonary HTN thought from OSA and obesity hypoventilation
- right heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension
- asthma
Last PFTs in [**12-6**]:
FEV1 - 0.54 liters (32% predicted)
FVC - 0.67 liters (29% predicted)
FEV1/FVC - 80.47
Impression: These PFTs are consistent with severe restrictive
ventilatory deficit. Compared to her previous PFTs obtained on
[**2124-7-17**] her FVC has decreased from 0.77 liters and her FEV1 has

decreased from 0.6 liters. Over the past 15 years dating back to

[**2109-12-24**] there has been an overall decrease in her spirometry
with her FEV1 having decreased from 1.86 liters over that
timeframe.

The patient has five children and lives with two her two sons.
Not

Brief Hospital Course:
59yo F with obesity hypoventilation, pulmonary HTN, asthma, and
cor pulmonale admitted with worsening of baseline hypoxia and
weight gain in the context of medication adjustments most
consistent with CHF exacerbation.
.
# Hypoxia: The patient was admitted with SpO2 of 94% on 3-4L,
which is consistent with her baseline. Chest radiograph revealed
vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  The patient was
diuresed with IV furosemide, approximately 640mg over the first
two days, and then switched to po torsemide 40mg TID.
Metolazone 5mg po BID was added prior to discharge. She is a
chronic retainer with baseline bicarb 40s, pCO2 80s.  During
admission, her bicarb and creatinine transiently increased to 43
and 1.3 respectively, likely due to overdiuresis.  She was given
80mg of oral potassium supplementation; potassium remained
within normal limits.  She remained asymptomatic and without
complaints throughout admission.  Discharge weight 118.8 kg.
.
# OSA: She continued to use BiPAP at 18/15, though with some
problems due to lack of humidification on the hospital machine.
.
# Pulm HTN: Her sildenafil was continued at its usual dose.
.
# Asthma: She continued to use albuterol and fluticasone as at
home and also received prn albuterol/ipratropium nebs daily.
.
