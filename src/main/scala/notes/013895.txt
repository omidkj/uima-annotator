History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12536**] is a 53 year old man with hx of HCV-induced
cirrhosis, complicated by grade [**1-9**] esophageal varices and
ascites, refractory hepatic hydrothorax s/p TIPS w/ recent
admission for R hydrothorax MRSA bacteremia secondary to empyema
presenting with hyperbilirubinemia and acute renal failure.
Reports also intermittent shortness of breath, but not
significantly worse than baseline. On routine hepatology
outpatient labs yesterday, he was noted to have elevated Tbili
to 24(from 4.1) and elevated creatinine 2.4 (from baseline 0.9).
Per pt, he denies any fever, chills or sweats. He feels
occasionally SOB with walking at a brisk pace, but denies
worsening of this. Denies cough, chest pain or chest pressure.
He has chronic abdominal pain of 1 year's duration, "always at
[**4-17**]" that is now intermittently at 6/10, described as "a stitch
in my side." Denies any nausea, vomiting, blood or black stools.
He has been having at least [**3-11**] BM's per day. He has noticed
some weight gain says that he was most recently 221lbs, which he
thinks is up 5-7 lbs in the last week. He noticed that he was
more jaundiced over the last 4 days. He says that no medications
have changed, but that he wasn't eating very well since moving
to the new NH at Green Briar in Nashau. He said he was written
for a pureed diet, and it was very unappealing.
Of note, patient was recently admitted [**5-/2131**] with MRSA
bacteremia secondary to empyema. He has a history of refractory
hepatic hydrothorax, had thoracentesis during that admission,
grew out MRSA. Chest tube was placed. Of note, TTE was neg. Pt
was treated with Vancomycin to high troughts. Infectious Disease
was involved who recommended 6 weeks total of IV vancomycin from
the start of negative blood cultures ([**5-5**], planned last day
[**6-15**]). The plan was to switch to Bactrim. However, per clinic
appt on [**6-21**], pt was not yet started on Bactrim. Notes per rehab
from [**2131-6-19**] note NS for 2L, change vanco to q18hr and check
trough. Note from RN [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Liver transplant coordinator
on [**2131-6-21**], that says "was not aware of patients transfer to
your facility. Seen briefly...Should be on Bactrim ID i tab [**Hospital1 **]
for suppression....Please start this today." Discharge notes
from [**6-12**] at Northeast state that "continue IV Vancomycin for
now, at least through [**6-25**] and possibly switch over to
Bactrim for ppx afterwards..." Per notes, it appears that he was
transferred from Northeast to Green Briar given progress, and
for transition to subacute rehab. After speaking with his HCP,
[**Name (NI) **], she was not aware why he was transferred and even that
this occurred at first.

nitrate neg, few bact. Diagnostic paracentesis was done and
peritoneal fluid showed WBC 80, [**Name (NI) 20003**] out SBP. RUQ US prelim
showed patent TIPS, with unchanged flow velocities. Portal veins
also patent with appropriate direction of flow. Colelithiasis
without cholecystitis. Known
cirrhosis. Ascites. Pt was admitted to hepatology for
hyperbilirubinemia and [**Last Name (un) **].
