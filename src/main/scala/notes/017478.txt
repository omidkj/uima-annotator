History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old man with known alcoholism, who had
presented to OSH on [**4-16**] for alcohol intoxication.  He had left
the hospital AMA, but returned to [**Location **] after falling and hitting
his head and developing headaches.  At OSH, he was agitated and
stopped following commands and was intubated for airway
protection.  Head CT showed bilateral SDH.  C-spine CT showed
unstable C6 fracture. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**4-17**]
1. Multifocal subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, as detailed
above,
without significant mass effect. Small left frontal subcortical
white matter hemorrhage, which could be related to diffuse
axonal injury. This appears unchanged compared to prior study,
though note is made that the time interval elapsed was less than
three hours.
2. Subgaleal hematoma at the vertex posteriorly, without
underlying fracture.
3. Extensive periventricular and deep white matter
hypodensities, of
uncertain etiology at this young age, some of which appear
chronic, and others indeterminate in chronicity. Some of the
latter could correspond to
nonhemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury. Mild enlargement of the
ventricles and sulci for age also indicates chronic pathology.
Recommend MRI with and
without contrast for further evaluation when the patient is
stable.

CT C-spine [**2109-4-17**]:
1. No evidence for cervical spine fracture. Findings on the
previous
examination performed at [**Hospital6 3105**] were
secondary to motion artifact.
2. Emphysema, subpleural parenchymal opacities and pleural
scarring in the
imaged upper thorax. If there are no prior studies to confirm
stability, then follow-up chest CT is recommended.

CT Torso [**2109-4-17**]:
1. Lower back hematoma without intraperitoneal or
extraperitoneal bleed.
2. No osseous fractures.
3. Bilateral adrenal lesions are not well characterized in this
not
multiphasic study. They may represent adenomas but associated
hematoma can not be ruled out.

Left Elbow X-ray [**2109-4-17**]:
No definite acute fracture.

right 4th digit X-ray [**2109-4-17**]:
1) No evidence of acute fracture.
2) Soft tissue swelling in addition to possible tiny foreign
bodies in palmar soft tissues the right fourth digit.

CT head [**2109-4-18**]:
1. Increase in degree of subdural hematoma and subarachnoid
blood products.
2. Developing right temporoparietal contusion.
3. Additional periventricular hypodensities as well as volume
loss unexpected for patient's age appears unchanged.

CT head [**2109-4-20**]:
1. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage and stable thin subdural
hematomas, with
interval increase in intraventricular blood products. This may
represent
redistribution rather than new hemorrhage. The ventricles remain
stable in
size, without evidence of developing hydrocephalus.
2. Redemonstration of right temporoparietal parenchymal
contusion.
3. Atrophy and chronic small vessel infarcts, unchanged from
prior study and likely chronic.

CT head [**2109-4-21**]:
1. Stable appearance of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and
subdural
hematomas. Stable appearance of intraventricular blood products.
No new
areas of acute hemorrhage.
2. The ventricles remain stable in size and configuration with
no evidence of hydrocephalus.
3. Stable appearance of right temporoparietal parenchymal
contusion.

CXR [**2109-4-23**]:
In comparison with the study of [**4-21**], the tip of the endotracheal

tube lies approximately 6 cm above the carina and is situated at
the lower
clavicular level. The tip of the Dobbhoff tube extends to the
upper stomach, where it crosses the bottom of the image. Central
catheter extends to about the junction between the
brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
Hyperexpansion of the lungs is again seen without convincing
evidence of
congestive failure or acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service from the ED
after being transferred from an OSH, where he had recently been
discharged and subsequently fell.  He was intoxicated upon
presentation to the OSH.  His head CT showed a right SDH along
the tentorium and a left SDH in the frontal/parietal region.  He
was intubated for agitation and admitted to the ICU.  With
sedation off he was moving all extremities, without eye opening.
 His pupils were sluggish but reactive.  He had +corneal
reflexes bilaterally as well as a cough. The patient was started
on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and he was on Q1 hour neuro
checks in the ICU.

On [**4-19**] he was noted to be hyponatremic to 123. He required a 3%
drip which slowly corrected the problem and he was put on salt
tabs. His sodium was monitored and ultimately salt tabs were
dc'd.
He had been on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and after 2
weeks this was discontinued.  he never had seizure.  he had aso
been on ativan for CIWA scale prophylaxis.
 He was extubated on [**4-21**] but he quickly needed reitubation for
copious secretions and though did not have a pneumonia on CXR,
he did grew out STAPH AUREUS COAG + in sputum on [**4-23**] he was
started on Vancomycin to be continued until [**2109-5-4**]. He had PICC
line placed for IV antibiotic administration. He was also found
to have UTI [**4-30**] and was started on 10day course of Cipro.
His mental status improved on a daily basis and he was moving
all extremities and following intermittent commands. He had a
couple trials at extubation but required re-intubation and
ultimately he was trached on [**2109-4-26**]. He also had PEG placed for
nutrition on [**4-27**]. He was able to be transferred to stepdown
unit on [**2109-4-29**]. He has had issues with hypertension and
medication required titration for control.  Also overnight on
[**4-30**] into [**5-1**] he had an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR
requiring lopressor/diltiazem/digoxin.  A cardiology consult was
obtained for this.  PT/OT/Speech all evaluated pt and felt
appropriate for rehab.  Speech also was able to place a speaking
valve on his trach on [**5-1**] after which he was able to verbalize
that he was in a hospital.  On [**5-2**] he was deemed fit for
discharge to rehab with a hospital level of care and on [**5-3**] was
dischargerd to [**Hospital3 **]
