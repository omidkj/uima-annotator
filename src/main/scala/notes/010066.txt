Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing pleural effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pleurex catheter drainage


History of Present Illness:
77M with history of recently diagnosed metastatic NSCLC and
known malignant right effusion, presenting with enlarging
effusion at rehab, now admitted to MICU with tachypnea and
respiratory distress. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in
[**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital. In [**Month (only) 359**] he developed acute cord compression and had
decompression on [**2145-10-15**]. Discharged to rehab. He was
readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 56568**] for shortness of breath
with new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL
post obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.
During last admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later,
pleurex catheter placement on [**11-17**]. Pleural fluid positive for
malignant cells, AFB smear negative. Also initiated palliative
XRT to RUL. IP did not feel mass was amenable to stenting. Notes
in discharge summary state that patient was DNR/DNI at
discharge.

Patient was discharged to [**Hospital 392**] Rehab. At rehab this morning it
was discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain
pleurex. Had his usual session XRT this AM. He also had CXR
which was read as complete R sided opacification. When arrived
back at rehab, he was sent to the ED due to inability to drain
the effusion.

In the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.
HRs have since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly
accurate. Has been tachypneic to 30s. CXR performed with finding
of interval increase in pleural effusion and R lung base
opacificition. IP saw patient and drained 550 cc fluid from
patient's pleurex catheter. A bedside ultrasound was obtained
showing no pericardial effusion. Patient was given vancomycin
and zosyn. Attempts were made to contact interpreter but this
was not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to
suggest that patient was full code.

In the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter. Notes he
gets dyspneic at times but no different lately. Actually denies
shortness of breath currently. + cough, productive of white
sputum, denies hemoptysis. No CP, no pleuritic pain. Notes
occasional palpitations. No fevers/chills. Endorses thirst and
general poor PO intake. Notes continued numbness and weakness in
his lower extremities since his acute cord compression. +lower
extremity edema x few weeks. + weight loss.

spine
- s/p T7-L1 laminectomy, decompression, fusion, and tumor
debluking and fusion for acute cord compression on [**2145-10-15**]

[**Country 651**]. Previous history of heavy tobacco use (at least 1PPD x 50
years); not currently smoking. No known TB contacts.

Family History:
No family history of malignancy

Studies:

[**2145-11-20**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Systolic
function of apical segments is relatively preserved suggesting a
non-ischemic etiology. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial anterior pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2145-11-20**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:
Peroneal veins not visualized. No evidence of deep venous
thrombosis.

[**2145-11-21**] Chest Xray
There is essentially no change in chest findings with right
upper lobe
complete opacification, right pleural effusion, ground-glass
opacity and
mass-like consolidation in the right lower lobe, nodular opacity
projecting in the left upper lobe and peribronchial
abnormalities in the left lower lobe or due to patient's known
non-small cell lung cancer. There are no new lung abnormalities.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right apical chest
tube remains in place. Spinal hardware is present. There is no
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with metastatic lung cancer and malignant
pleural effusion admitted for pleural catheter drainage.

# Pleurex catheter drainage: He initially presented to the
emergency room after a radiation oncology appointment and
inability to drain pleurex at rehab facility.  Per son, this was
likely due to not accessing pleurex catheter appropriately.  In
total, patient has had approximately 2500 cc of fluid removed
during his stay.  He was initially admitted overnight to the
MICU after experiencing shortness of breath, tachypnea and
hypoxia in the emergency room; however, this quickly resolved.

# Shortness of Breath: He has baseline shortness of breath due
to persistent malignant effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia
secondary to mass.  Resolved with drainage of pleurex catheter.
This should be drained daily after discharge.  Information
provided to nursing director at [**Hospital 392**] rehab by interventional
pulmonary service and video is sent with patient.  Please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**] if any questions or concerns regarding drainage.

# Pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient completed a course for
post-obstructive pneumonia and other than leukocytosis as below
has no other signs or symptoms of infection.  Has been C. diff
negative during this admission.  UA negative, CXR without new
findings, C. diff negative a
