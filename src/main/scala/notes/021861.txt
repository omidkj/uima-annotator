Imaging:
CTA Neck Admission: 1. Minimally displaced type 3 dens fracture.
No evidence for osseous encroachment upon the spinal canal. If
there is clinical concern for ligamentous injury, further
evaluation with MRI could be performed. 2. No evidence for
vertebral artery or carotid stenosis, dissection or aneurysmal
dilatation. 3. Paranasal sinus disease as detailed above.
.
CTA Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1. Liver laceration causing massive
hemoperitoneum and vascular depletion. 2. Suspected recent or
current active extravasation, although IV contrast was witheld
to avoid further decline in renal function. 3. Multiple
right-sided rib fractures. 4. Signs of renal failure, including
delayed contrast excretion from previous study, and vicarious
excretion through gallbladder. 5. Cholelithiasis without
cholecystitis.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT Study Date of
[**2172-10-28**]  1. Patent TIPS with relatively stable velocities. 2.
Massive hemoperitoneum.
.
Right hip x-ray: prelim: mild right osteoarthritis (no
fracture).


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
[**10-27**]: patient was transferred from an OSH, seen by
trauma/neurosurgery, admitted to ICU for liver and spine
injuries.  C collar placed, to be kept on at all times

[**10-28**]: Angiogram for decreasing hematocrit, it did not reveal
any arterial source of bleeding and no intervention could be
performed for the venous bleeding. U/S liver showed TIPS patent,
transfused 3 units PRBC's, 1 unit platelets, 1 cryo, 2 FFP,
given Factor VII, intubated for increasing respiratory distress

[**10-29**]: Central line placed, continued intubated, sedated

[**10-30**]: paracentesis removed 1.6L fluid, lasix gtt started

[**10-31**]: Tube feeds started

[**11-2**]: vancomycin started for VAP

[**11-3**]: extubated successfully, lasix drip stopped, started on
prn lasix IV

[**11-5**]: PICC line placed, central line removed

[**11-6**]: transferred to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] with hepatic encephalopathy
on 4 L NC

[**11-8**]: On [**11-8**], day of transfer to MICU, noted to be
increasingly tachypneic to 30s, O2 req increase f/3LNC to 5LNC.
Concern for PE (had been on hep sq since [**10-31**]), but given hx of
bleed and RF, CTA not performed. Abx coverage broadened to
linezolid/meropenem for [**Hospital 68679**] transferred to MICU.

[**11-8**] - [**11-13**] In the MICU his hypoxia was worked up and it was
felt to be secondary to his ascites. He underwent two large
volume paracentesis during which 14 L of fluid were removed with
improvement in his respiratory status, currently on room air. He
had a few days of low grade fevers, however infectious workup
has been negative. On [**11-12**] he underwent a diagnostic para due
to fever which was bloody, however had no evidence of SBP. The
meropenem and linezolid were stopped and he was placed back on
vancomycin for a 10 day course (which will end on [**11-18**]). His Hct
has remained stable and he has no required transfusions while in
the MICU. He is currently NPO and getting tube feeds.

[**11-14**] - [**11-15**]  [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] -  The patient was transferred back
to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] on RA, and was alert and oriented x 2, although
with some delirium.  He began requiring 1 L of oxygen the next
day and had decreased mental status, likely hepatic
encephalopathy.  His lactulose was increased and he underwent a
diagnostic para which showed no evidence of SBP and a CXR showed
no infiltrate.

Course on Floor:
.
A/P:  54 yo male with PMH of ETOH cirrhosis, DM, and
hypothyroidism was tranferred from an OSH on [**10-27**] after a MVA
complicated by a a dens fracture, a non-weight bearing T8 wedge
fracture, and hemoperitoneum (now stable with medical
management) with continued hepatic encephalopathy since
extubation.
