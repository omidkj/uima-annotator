Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
88 year old female with questioned history of renal artery
stenosis and hypertension, presents with shortness of breath.
The patient went to the bathroom this morning and felt short of
breath. It seemed to improve with rest, but then occurred again
soon after, and she called 911. She denies any chest pain or
pressure, dizziness, or changes in vision during that time. In
the ED her blood pressure was found to be 206/107, HR of 120,
with O2Sa of 88% on RA. She was placed on Bipap with good
results. Lasix 80mg IV was given, morphine 2mg x2 and a nitro
drip was started. There were questioned ST depressions in V4-V6;
cardiology was consulted and believed they were rate related
changes. Troponin was 0.05 and  CK-MB of 3.
.
Patient was brought to the CCU with a BP of 135/57 and O2Sa of
97% on 4L NC. In the CCU, patient stated much improved shortness
of breath and denied chest pain. She had no vision changes or
lightheadedness. She denies any recent changes in her
medications, has been taking them as prescribed except for her
clonidine patch which she has not had since Thursday [**2169-9-21**] but
has supplemented with clonidine PO. Denies recent change in her
diet. She denies nausea, vomiting, change in appetite, fevers,
chills, or dysuria.
.
Patient was admitted in [**Month (only) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] for similar symptoms.
Patient had very elevated BP while at a physicians office,
became dyspnic and was admitted to the ICU with flash pulmonary
edema. She was intubated for 2 days during that stay. Patient
also has history of renal artery stenosis diagnosed
approximately one year ago, although ultrasound done in [**Month (only) **] did
not show any evidence of stenosis.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. Patient does have baseline level of edema on her
lower extremities R>L, and there has been no change recently.

AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There has been marked
interval
improvement in the parenchymal aeration suggesting improving
pulmonary edema.
There is mild residual, right greater than left. Retrocardiac
consolidation
is either atelectasis or pneumonia. There are small bilateral
pleural
effusions.

Marked kyphoscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine and related DJD
is noted.
There is a moderate-sized cardiac enlargement with dense
atherosclerotic
aortic calcifications. Surgical clips are seen in the neck.
