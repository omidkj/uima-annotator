Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o f with h/o dyemyelinating syndrome, restrictive lung
defect FVC 52%, h/o recurrent aspiration pneumonias, s/p G tube
placement c/b gastrocutaneous fistula, s/p J tube placement [**4-19**]
but removed due to intolerance, who was recently admitted and
discharged [**2126-1-9**] after treatment for aspiration pneumonia, now
p/w fever, nausea, RLQ pain, and RL back pain x 4 days.  The pt
states that her RLQ pain is sharp, [**9-24**], intermittent, without
alleviating or exacerbating factors, unrelated to position or
eating. She does not think her back pain is necessarily related
to her RLQ pain.   Her nausea has not been accompanied by
emesis.  The pt states she had a day of watery diarrhea 2 weeks
ago accompanied by lower abdominal pain and alleviated with
defecation.  Over the past 4 days the pt has had a fever up to
107 and up to 103/104 after purchasing a new thermometer.  She
has had a persistent cough ever since her last discharge,
productive of green sputum starting the day PTA.  She also c/o
nasal congestion starting over the past several days; also she
has had decreased po intake x 4 days.  Two weeks ago the pt also
had an episode of vaginal and rectal bleeding; she is followed
by OBGYN Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for her h/o vaginal bleeding. Of note, pt
states she completed her full course of prednisone and
levofloxacin after her last discharge.
.
In the ED initially she was febrile to 102.6, BP 113/60, then
became hypotensive to BP 64/39, not responsive to 4L NS (bp up
to only 86/38), unsuccessful IJ attempt, so R femoral line was
placed, and levophed at 0.15 was started.  With levophed her BP
rose to 130/79, so it was titrated down to 0.1.  She was also
given Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Flagyl, as well as combivent
nebs and Decadron 10 mg IV x1.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
.
CXR on admission:
INDICATION: Dyspnea and abdominal pain.
There is no free air seen under the diaphragm. Some mild
increased interstitial markings are visualized with Kerley B
lines noted. There is some blunting at the left costophrenic
sulcus and increased retrocardiac density suggesting either
atelectasis or pneumonia. Pulmonary vascular markings within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
No free air under the diaphragm. Possible left atelectasis
versus pneumonia in the retrocardiac region.
.
Transvaginal U/S:
1. No evidence of an endometrial abnormality on limited
evaluation.
2. Ovaries not visualized. No adnexal abnormalities identified.
3. Small amount of free fluid.
.
CXR:
chest findings have deteriorated during the last short time
interval now presenting bilateral basal parenchymal infiltrates
most of them located in the posterior segments as seen on the
lateral view.  Comparison is also made with a previous chest
examination of [**1-10**] at which time these infiltrates on the
bases were already noted more marked on the left than on the
right side.  On a more remote examination of [**2125-11-15**],
these basal infiltrates were suspicious for representing
aspiration pneumonias.  Similar cause for the now new developed
basal infiltrates is reasonable.  It is noted that the patient
has been scheduled for chest CT. IMPRESSION:  New bilateral
basal infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
.
CT abdomen:
1.  No focal abscess is identified.
2.  Small amount of free fluid around the liver, without
definite etiology identified.
3.  Stable low attenuations within the liver, too small to
characterize.
4.  Stable low attenuations within both kidneys, too small to
characterize.
