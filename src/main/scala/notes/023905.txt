History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old male in known coronary artery disease,
with prior PCI/stenting. Over the last several months, he had
noticed worsening chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. He denied
symptoms at rest. Exercise tolerance test was strongly positive
for ischemia. Outside cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 **]
revealed severe three vessel disease including in-stent
restenosis. He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac surgical intervention.

[**2119-2-18**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Aortic and coronary artery mural calcification, consistent
with atherosclerotic disease. No evidence of thoracic aortic
aneurysm.
2. 2-mm non-calcified left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. If there
are no risk factors for lung cancer, no further followup is
required. If there are risk factors for lung cancer, followup CT
in one year is recommended.
3. Dense coronary artery calcifications.
[**2119-2-20**] Intraop TEE:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic root. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
8. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77739**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Part of his workup
included a chest CT scan which was remarkable for a heavily
calcified aorta. Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery. On [**2-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed off
pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical
details, please see separate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. Low dose beta blockade was
resumed. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. Experienced some urinary
retention which required Foley re-insertion, and his
preoperative Cardura was resumed. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He went on to experience
atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone and eventually
Coumadin. He otherwise made a good recovery and worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. On post-op day four
he was discharged home with the appropriate medications and
follow-up appointments. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66588**] will follow his Coumadin
and INR.
