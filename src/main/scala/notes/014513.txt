[**2137-4-1**] ECHO
Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen
in the left atrial appendage.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present by 2-D and Color flow.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. There is a prominent eustacian valve.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction without regional changes. The
coronary sinus is enlarged at 1.4 cm.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB: On phenylephrine infusion. There is suture material
present at the level of the interatrial septum. There is no PFO
visible by 2-D or color flow. A bubble study was negative post
repair ( although the study was not captured on the clip
storage. Biventricular function and valvular functions are
unchanged from pre-cpb. The aortic contour is normal
post-decannulation.
