Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital3 635**] hospital

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intra-aortic balloon pump removal
endotracheal tube extubation


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old male with history of HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital on [**6-3**] with substernal chest pain and shortness of
breath. EKG showed 2-5mm ST elevations in inferior leads (II,
III avF), 3mm depression in aVL, 5mm ST depression in V2, V3 and
1-3m depression in V4-V6. Inferior Q waves. He was taken to
CCath which showed 100% proximal LAD stenosis, 95% diffuse
ostial ramus stenosis, 90% proximal circumflex stenosis, 100%
ostial marginal 1 and 2 stenosis and 100% thrombus of RCA.
Cardiac surgery was called, however, he decompensated and
underwent PCI. A thrombectomy was attempted and failed. He
underwent BMS placement to RCA and circumflex. He developed
hypotension and hypoxemia after the RCA stent was placed. He was
intubated for respiratory failure and given IV lasix. His
hypotension was managed with high-dose dopamine. Intra-aortic
balloon pump placement. In the interim, he developed pulseless
ventricular tachycardia which requred CPR with spontaneous
reversion to sinus rhythm. He was given amiodarone bolus and
drip.  His pressors were changed from dopamine to levophed and
neosynephrine. Right heart catheterization showed a wedge
pressure of 35 and mv02 of 70% on FiO2 100%. He was treated with
integrillin and heparin. No beta blocker secondary to
hemodynamic status. He was admitted to the CCU following the
procedure.

Echocardiogram was performed which revealed mildy dilated left
ventricle, severe global hypokinesis, with EF of 20% with trace
MR. Moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction.  CXR
deomonstrated significant e/o CHF.

In the CCU, he was given another bolus of 80mg IV lasix. He was
maintained on levophed in addition to phenylephrine. Peak CK-MB
was 931.2 and Troponin was >120. He had several episodes of
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and accelerated
idioventricular rhythm with some hemodynamic instability. He was
noted to have some oral bleeding and blood in his NG tube so
protonix drip was started.  Labs at OSH included WBC 17.4, Hct
50, plt 313, Na 140, K 3.6, Cl 106, CO2 21, BUN 25, Cr 0.9, Glu
172, HA1c 6.3, Ca 8.7, Mg 2.4.  Total cholesterol 184,
triglycerides 149, HDL 33, LDL 121.  AST 72, ALT 34, Alk phos
60, lipase 135.  BNP 260. Most recent ABG, 7.41 / 36.8 / 90.2 /
22.6.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for LVAD. Around the
time of discharge, his vitals were HR 70-80s, BPs 95/58, SvO2
97%, PAP 44/24, CO 3.7.

Upon arrival to CCU, the patient was stable with balloon pump in
the L groin, PA catheter in R femoral central line, on moderate
doses of levophed and neosynephrine and amiodarone.  The
patient's vitals were: 80, 100/65 (augmented) PA 50/30, 94% 21.

ECHO ([**2138-6-5**]):
Limited images obtained. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to
akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive
apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis. The inferior (abutting
the diaphragm) wall of the right ventricle is akinetic. Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is no
pericardial effusion.

ECHO ([**2138-6-5**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis
of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive severe apical
hypokinesis/akinesis with focal apical dyskinesis. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility (the
inferior wall of the right ventricle is akinetic). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

ECHO ([**2138-6-7**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior
and inferolateral walls, severe apical akinesis, and focal
apical dyskinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 25-30% %). A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Borderline enlarged LV size and wall thickness, with
severe regional LV systlolic dysfunction consistent with
coronary artery disease. No mechanical complications of
myocardial infarction.

ECHO ([**2138-6-11**])
IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormalities as described
above. There is mild to moderate, posteriorly directed mitral
regurgitation li
