Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath [**2137-6-14**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography showed a
right dominant system with two vessel disease. The LMCA had a
distal 80 stenosis. The LAD showed mild irregularities without
flow limiting stenoses. The proximal LAD stent was patent. The
Ramus was without flow limiting stenoses. The LCX had a 60%
stenosis prximally. The RCA was a large dominant vessel with no
flow limitations.
Echo [**2137-6-18**]: PREBYPASS: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal(LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. POSTBYPASS: Preserved
biventricular systolic function. The study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH for
cardiac cath. Cath revealed severe left main disease. She was
started on a Heparin drip and awaited cardiac surgery. She
remained stable for several days, had usual pre-op work-up and
was brought to the operating room on [**2137-6-18**]. She underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see operative report
for surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day one. Beta blockers and diuretics were
started and she was gently diuresed during post-op course
towards her pre-op weight. On post-op day two she was transfused
2 units of PRBCs secondary to anemia with HCT of 23.6. Also
early on post-op day two she had an episode of Atrial
Fibrillation which converted with Lopressor and Amiodarone
Bolus. Over the rest of the hospital course she had several more
episodes of atrial fibrillation. She remained on Amiodarone and
Anti-coagulation was started. She was transferred to the cardiac
surgery step down floor on post-op day three. Epicardial pacing
wires were removed. Beta blockers were titrated for maximum BP
and HR control. Physical therapy followed patient during entire
post-op course for strength and mobility. She remained stable
over the remainder of post-op course. Anti-coagulation was
discontinued after 24 hrs of being in sinus rhythm per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as risks of anticoagulation greater than risk of CVA. At
time of discharge her labs, vital signs, and physical exam were
stable. She was discharged home on post-op day six with the
appropriate follow-up appointments and VNA services.
