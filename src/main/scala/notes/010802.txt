sent to OSH, initial assessment she was moving right side but
not
left side. CT OSH showed large right temporal lobe bleed and pt
was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She was reportedly hemodynamically stable, pupils unequal but
reactive during [**Location (un) **] transfer. Opon arrival in [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
her
pupils are unequal and unreactive.

bilaterally and positive cough.
HEENT: Pupils: L 1mm /R 5mm, both unreactive to light.
Neck: intubated; old trach scar
Lungs: CTA bilaterally.

tremors. No movement of both UE to noxious stimuli; minimal
withdrawal of both LE to noxious stimuli.

Sensation: No movement of both UE to noxious stimuli; minimal
withdrawal of both LE to noxious stimulibilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage centered in the right sylvian
fissure with intraparenchymal extension into the
temporalparietal lobe, most likey a sequelae of ruptured
aneurysm. There is extensive mass effect secondary to the
hemorrhage with resultant subfalcine and uncal herniation.
LARGE HEMORRHAGE CENTERED WITHIN THE RIGHT SYLVIAN FISSURE WITH
INTRAPARENCHYMAL EXTENSION MEASURING 4.1 X 5.5 CM . LARGE
LOBULATED RIGHT MCA ANEURYSM MEASURING 2.7 X 2.1CM.

LOW ATTENUATION LINEAR STRUCTURE IS SEEN IN THE RIGHT
SUPRACLINOID ICA AND EXTENDING INTO THE CLINOID AND CAVERNOUS
PORTION CONCERNING FOR DISSECTION. LINEAR LOW ATTENUATION
STRUCTURE IS ALSO SEEN IN THE LEFT MCA, PROXIMAL TO THE
TRIFURCATION, WHICH [**Month (only) **] REPRESENT DISSECTION. THE DISTAL LEFT
MCA REMAINS PATENT DISTALLY AS ARE THE BILATERAL ACA. DIFFUSE
SUBARACHNOID BLOOD IN THE RIGHT SYLVIAN FISSURE, BIHEMISPHERIC
SULCI AND ALONG ANTERIOR LONGITUDINAL FISSURE, IS NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. THERE IS EXTENSIVE MASS EFFECT AND EDEMA
SECONDARY TO THE LARGE HEMORRHAGE WITH 1.5CM OF LEFTWARD SHIFT
OF NORMALLY MIDLINE STRUCTURES, EFFACEMENT OF THE SULCI/RIGHT
LATERAL VENTRICLE AND BASAL CISTERNS WITH SUBSEQUENT SUBFALCINE
AND UNCAL HERNIATION.
NOTE IS [**Last Name (un) 39247**] OF MILD ANEURYSMAL DILATATION OF THE DISTAL RIGHT
VERTEBRAL ARTERY. THE PCA APPEARS PATENT BILATERALLY, HOWEVER
WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IMPENDING COMPRESSION OF THE RIGHT PCA BY
RIGHT CERBRAL PEDUNCLE. [**Doctor Last Name 7410**] [**Numeric Identifier 7414**]


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Neurosurgery in the SICU for
management of her intraparenchymal bleed and uncal herniation.
CT showed a large R temp hemo/diffuse SAH/uncal herniation and
CTA demonstrated a large aneurysm.  Discussions were made with
the family about prognosis and that surgery was not indicated in
her case.  The husband gave decision making powers to the
patient's and his daughter.  The decision was made as a family
for CMO.  Upon extubation, the patient did not initiate a single
breath and was eventually called dead at 9:57 am.  Breath and
heart sounds were ascultated for for 1 minute for confirmation.
The patient was not an organ donor, the family refused autopsy,
and the Medical Examiner waived the right to examine the
patient.
