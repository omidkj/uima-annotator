Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo m w/ h/o severe persistent asthma recently dc'd following
tx for asthma exacerbation and pna, who p/w SOB.
.
1) sob- tachypneic without hypoxia.  Initially in ED, was
started on continuous albuterol and heli-ox, a diltiazem drip
for management of afib w/ RVR, ativan 1mg x1, magnesium 2mg iv,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. His CXR was negative for
infiltrate/failure. ABGs showed pt. hyperventilating, and he was
admitted to ICU.  ? asthma exacerbation, but CXR and ABG not
consistent with severe asthma exacerbation.  Likely component of
splinting from costochondritis [**3-12**] coughing, with large element
of anxiety disorder.  ENT consult showed normal vocal cord
function, and PE ruled out with d-dimer (low prob by [**Doctor Last Name 3012**]
criteria).  Pt. started on q2-4h albuterol, q4 atrovent, and was
spaced to q4h albuterol, q6h atrovent on discharge.  Throughout
his stay his oxygen saturations were good on 2-4L.  He will be
sent home on home nebulizers.  dfa negative and viral culture
pending as of discharge
.
2) cp- likely msk given tenderness on exam, prev. rib fx. in
area of pain.  chronic. ecg reassuring.
t despite-continued started lidoderm patch, morphine PRN for
breakthrough
-enzymes negative.
.
3) afib with RVR- hemodynamically stable, but started on dilt
gtt in ED, whcih was quickly titrated to PO diltiazem.  RVR
Likely driven by continuous albuterol. Patient has h/o htn (and
PAF) so not lone afib.  Would be candidate for anticoagulation.

-defer anticoagulation to PCP given pt's poor compliance
.
4) substance abuse: urine tox positive for cocaine as well as
opiates (pt has rx for opiates). Pt initially denied then
admitted to cocaine use when confronted, but unwilling to
discuss substance abuse further. MICU team began describing
risks of cocaine use, esp heart, lung effects, but pt adamant
that this was one-time use and additionally that his chronic
narcotic use is only for pain control. SW/addiction counselor
saw patient, but pt. not interested in intervention
.
5) renal insufficiency- likely prerenal from poor p.o. intake
over the last day.  Now improving.  Cr back to 1.0 on discharge
without intercention
.
6) chronic pain: back pain s/p laminectomy maintained on
percocet, pt says he always receives morphine in house as well.
Offered fentanyl patch, which he refused. If he requests any
escalation of dose, will consult pain service to consolidate
regimen. Obviously concern for high doses of APAP with percocet,
but for now he is insisting this regimen is the only that has
worked for him for years.  Received IV morphine in house PRN.
Was discharged with only baseline narcotics however.
