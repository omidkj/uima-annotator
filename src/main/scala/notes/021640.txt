Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Wound erythema, new atrial fibrillation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old man with a history of ischemic R
foot pain s/p recent R fem-AT popliteal bypass with cephalic
vein [**2108-4-27**] who presents to the ED with drainage from his RLE
incision and rapid AF without hypotension, with subsequent
respiratory code in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
The patient was admitted in early [**Month (only) **] for RLE rest pain and
underwent an angiogram which demonstrated R SFA disease, and
subsequently underwent R fem-AT popliteal bypass with
non-reversed cephalic vein on [**2108-4-27**].  His post-operative course
was slightly protracted and complicated by acute on chronic
renal failure (creatinine at the time of discharge was 3.9) and
a reactive leukocytosis with WBC of ~30 during admission.  He
was seen and followed by both the hematology and the nephrology
services during his hospitalization.  He ultimately did well,
however, and was discharged to rehab on [**2108-5-10**].
.
He was doing well at rehab until today by report: he has been
ambulating, moving his bowels, and eating and drinking normally.
 This morning, however, he noted some drainage from the dorsal
aspect of his R foot with some wound breakdown which prompted
his presentation to the [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital ED.  He has not had
fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
Also of note, he has never had rapid atrial fibrillation before.

.
At the Tody ED he had a leukocytosis (WBC 57- baseline is 20-30)
and a HR of 140 with rapid AF without hypotension.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  At the time of
evaluation in the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, he reports mild pain in his R foot but denies other
complaints including chest pain, shortness of breath, and
dizziness.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.2 P 106 BP 102/75 R 14 O2 sat
99% on NC. He was stable and mentating well for ~45 minutes, and
then had an acute respiratory decompensation with neck/chest
pain requiring emergent intubation.  He was talking with his
nurse when he stopped breathing, grabbed his neck, and became
unresponsive.  He was intubated emergently.  He maintained his
pulse throughout the event, and his HR remained tachycardic at
~140 with a SBP>100.  Empiric IV heparin (bolus and gtt) was
begun immediately thereafter.  He was not started on any
sedation.  He was given IV fluids (with bicarb) and transferred
to the floor.
.
On the floor, patient was comfortable.  Intubate but not
sedated.  Denied any active complaints at that time.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2:
General: Intubated.  Alert, arousable. No acute distress

Pertinent Results:
CXR- Retrocardiac opacity, tubes in place
.
CT chest-
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions,
left greater than right.
.
2. Small volume abdominal ascites.
.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease including CAD.
.
4. NG tube and ET tube appropriately positioned.
.
5. No hydronephrosis. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric
stranding. Left upper pole renal hypodensity could represent a
small cyst, too small to characterize.
.
6. Prostatic enlargement. Please correlate with PSA.
.
CT Head- 1. No acute intracranial pathology.

2. Marked periventricular white matter hypodensity, compatible
with small vessel microvascular infarcts. With these findings
the sensitivity for subtle infarcts is diminished, an MRI could
be performed if there is persisting concern for acute infarct.
.
3. Sinus opacification.


Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory arrest:  The pt's initial respiratory arrest was of
unclear etiology. ABG on arrival to the floor- 7.39/43/105/27 on
[**3-28**].  Primary possibilities investigated were pna, flash
pulmonary edema vs PE after his recent surgery. Broad spectrum
antibiotics were initiated, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and
metronidazole to cover for nosocomial pneumonia. The pt was
extubated on [**5-14**]. On [**5-16**] the pt became hypoxemic and CXR
demonstrated evidence of RUQ pneumonia and possible pulmonary
edema. The patient had been diuresed overnight and aztreonam was
added to his antibiotic coverage. On the evening of [**5-16**] the
patient became hypoxemic to the mid 80s after eating.  Repeat
CXR on demonstrated radiographic evidence of increasing
consolidation of the RUQ pneumonia with evidence of a new right
lower lobe process perhaps secondary to an aspiration event.
Broad antibiotic coverage was continued.  The family was
involved in discussions regarding the patients disposition.
With worsening of his respiratory distress, the family decided
to make the patient DNR/DNI and finally comfort care.  The
patient expired surrounded by his family at 17:31pm.
.
Atrial fibrillation:  New onset afib at time of admission,
CHADS2 score was 5.  The patient was placed on a diltiazam gtt
for rate control.  Metoprolol was added on the second day of
admission for better rate control.  On [**5-16**] the patient
developed tachycardia despite diltiazam drip and metoprolol.
His metoprolol was increased to 75mg tid and an amiodarone gtt
was initiated on [**5-17**] for better rate control.
.
Wound infection:  The pt's initial reason for ED visit was for
concern for recent surgical procedure.  He was continued on
broad spectrum antibiotics.  Vascular and Wound Consult were
consulted and recommendations regarding care were followed.
.
Leukocytosis:  The patient presented with underlying
leukocytosis thought to be reactive from prior work up revealing
no evidence of CLL/CML.  Heme onc briefly consulted the team and
suggested restarting the patients home dose hydroxyurea which
had recently been decreased in dose.
.
GI Bleed: The patient had an EGD [**5-15**] which demonstrated 2
nonbleeding cords of grade II varices which were cauterized. The
patient tolerated heparin challenges and drip with no further
bleeds.
.
The patient's statin were held during the admission and he was
placed on his home insulin regiment and BPH medications.
