CXR - Increased right pleural effusion and partial collapse of
the
right upper lung.
.
EKG -  NSR 70, nl axis, nl int, old TWI III, F; old J pointing V
[**3-18**]
.
[**6-16**] CT
CT CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are stable.
There is a small amount of pericardial fluid. No definite
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen. Again
seen is a moderate-to large-sized right pleural effusion. There
has been interval development of moderate amount of
high-attenuation fluid within the effusion consistent with
hemorrhage. Patchy consolidation of the right lung is stable.
Hazy patchy opacities are noted in the left lung field but no
frank consolidation is seen.

CT ABDOMEN: Within the limits of this non-contrast study, the
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys,
stomach, and small bowel loops are within normal limits. There
is colonic diverticulosis most prominent at the hepatic flexure.
There is no free air or free fluid. No mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. An IVC filter is
seen.

CT PELVIS: The bladder is unremarkable. The patient appears to
be status post prostatectomy. The rectum is unremarkable. There
is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: A lytic area is again seen in the L5 vertebral
body but unchanged from prior examination. Several subacute or
chronic rib fractures are identified on the right.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of a moderate amount of hemorrhage
within the right pleural effusion.
2. No acute intra-abdominal abnormalities identified.
.
[**6-14**] Stress MIBI
New moderate and fixed inferior myocardial wall perfusion
defect.
Mild inferior wall hypokinesis. Calculated LVEF 42%.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 74 yo M with lung cancer, DVT, CAD s/p MI presents with
chest pain shortness of breath.
.
# Chest Pain/Ischemia - Patient with history of CAD a/p MI.  Now
with an episode of pain consistent with his anginal equivalent.
No changes on EKG but not in pain at time of EKG.  Patient was
ruled out by enzymes.  He also had a stress test which revealed
an irreversible deficit from his prior known IMI.  Continued on
asa, bblocker, [**Last Name (un) **], statin, plavix.  BP meds held while was
unstable.  ASA, plavix held during hemothorax.
.
# CHF - patient does not seem volume overloaded at this time.
He has no JVD, no edema in legs (other than swelling from DVT).
Last Echo with EF 55%.  Does have increased effusion although
loculated.  Continued on lasix, bblocker [**Last Name (un) **].  BP meds held
while unstable.
.
# Afib - In sinus during admission.  Patients anticoag held
during hemothorax.
.
# Shortness of Breath/loculated Effusion - patient with
increaing loculated pleural effusion.  Has chronic shortness of
breath which has worsened over the past few days.  No sign of
infeciton at this time.  Had thoracentesis by interventional
pumonology on [**2147-6-14**] revealing almost 2 L of serous exudative
fluid.  Patient had improved breathing.  Cytology was negative.
However on [**6-15**] Hct dropped.  CT revealed hemothorax.  All
anticoagulation stopped despite the risk of DVT, afib.  Risk
discussed with family.  Thoracics consulted and chest tube
placed.  Frank blood was taken out.  Patient continued to bleed
in and around the tube.  Patient sent to MICU for observation
after Hct continued to drop.  Patient spontaneously stablized
and output of CT became more serous.  Output resent for cytology
which was pending at time of discharge.  When output became <100
cc the tube was removed.  Patient follwed with serial CXR that
did not demonstrate reaccumulation.  Hct also remained stable.
.
# DVT - patient therapeutic on heparin. Improving clots on LENI.
 CTA neg for PE.  Anticoagulaiton held during hemothorax.
Patient restarted on coumadin and will be discharged on 3mg
coumadin qday.
.
# Lung Cancer - patient currently with no evidence of disease.
s/p neoadjuvant chemo/XRT now s/p surgery.  1st cytology
negative.  2ng cytology pending.  WIll follow up tih outpatient
