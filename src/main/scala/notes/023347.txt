Pertinent Results:
CT Tspine: There are multiple compression fractures throughout
the thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine. The thoracic
compression fractures in aggregate cause marked kyphotic
curvature of the thoracic spine. At the level of T4, there is a
mild vertebral body compression fracture. At the level of T7, T8
and T9, there are severe anterior wedge-shaped compression
fractures. There is a mild compression fracture at the level of
T11. There is a mild compression fracture at the level of L1.
Throughout the thoracic spine, there is no evidence of
retropulsion, bony central spinal canal compromise, or
significant neural foraminal stenosis. There are bilateral
pleural effusions. There are atherosclerotic calcifications
within the wall of the aorta.

Head CT [**2138-5-27**]: There has been mild improvement of the left
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage that measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm,
and the second smaller adjacent parietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage is also slightly improved. The mass effect is
unchanged with persistent compression of the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and
subfalcine herniation. Surrounding associated edema has slightly
progressed from the comparison. Blood is no longer seen in the
lateral ventricles and small left subdural hematoma is unchanged
in size.

EEG [**2138-5-25**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
diffuse and
slowed background rhythms along with generalized bursts of mixed

frequency delta and theta slowing. In addition, the presence of
an
asymmetry with more triphasic waves seen over the right than
left was
also noted. No sharp or epileptiform features were observed.
This EEG
is most consistent with a severe encephalopathy with a question
of
possible midline lesion, as well, given the bursts of
generalized
pattern slowing seen. Common causes of encephalopathy include
medications, metabolic causes, and infectious processes. Note is
made
of an irregular cardiac rhythm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service (ICU) and started on
dilantin with q1 hour neuro checks. Exam on admission- asleep
but arousable; oriented to place and person. Eyes open to
command; PERRL. EOMI.  Follows commands and mae w/ equal
strength.  On hospital day #3 the patient was intubated for
decreased resp effort/mental status.  Repeat Head CT was
unchanged.  Pt was fitted for TLSO brace for thoracic fx which
must be on when HOB>45 degrees or anytime pt is OOB. Pt was
treated for staph areus coag +/ pseudomonas pneumonia with vanco
and cefepime both due to end on [**5-31**].  Pt persistently febrile
and dilantin was weaned and keppra was started.  Please follow
taper up of keppra and taper down of dilantin as directed.  On
[**5-25**] hct down 23-->19 w/ heme (+) stool.  Pt was transfused 2
units red cells at that time with no further episodes.  Trach
and PEG performed on [**5-28**].  Pt weaned to trach mask with good
ABG's.  Last ABG on 40% trach mask was 7.46/42/88/ O2sats 99%.
Current exam-- PERRL 3mm-->2mm.  Eyes open to voice.  Localizes
Left upper extremity.  Withdraws bilateral lower extremities.
No movement RUE.
