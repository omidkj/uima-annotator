Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2151-12-23**] where he underwent left VATs
pleurodiesis for recurrent pleural effusion. Initially he was
kept overnight in the PACU related to retained CO2, and required
CPAP, which was weaned off, and CO2 on ABG was per patients
baseline. The patient also required fluid bolus and albumin for
low urine output which eventually resolved itself. The patient
was transferred to the floor [**2151-12-24**]. Chest tubes were removed
on [**2151-12-25**] without issue. Unfortunately the patient had a foley
catheter placed with prostatic trauma, therefore urology was
consulted and recommended foley placement x 7 days with follow
up in one week. The patient's urine output has cleared.
Of note the pleural biopsy revealed a small amount of
enterococcus sensitive to only linezolid. ID approval was
obtained to discharge patient on such. The patient has adequate
pain control, is on room air, ambulating the halls, has had a
bowel movement, and has been cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
discharge home. The patient will have a CBC and urology visit in
one week, and see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with CXR in 2 weeks. He has
been given written and verbal discharge instructions. He has had
physical therapy home referral as recommended by Physical
therapy.
