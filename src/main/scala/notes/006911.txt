Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p valvuloplasty


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
valvuloplasty, BMS SVG-D1

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 y/o male with PMHx CAD s/p CABG, iCM (EF 35%),
AS who presented to the ED with chest pain, DOE, and a near
syncopal episode prior to presentation.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were Afeb, 68, 134/38, 18, 100%RA. The
patient recieved [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325mg x 1.

On the floors, the patient was kept on his home medications.  He
underwent a cardiac cath which showed 3 vessel disease as well
as severe aortic stenosis.  He was evaluated by Thoracic surgery
for an AVR, however it was decided he would be a better patient
for a valvuloplasty.  He underwent valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**8-3**] where his gradine improved from 65 to 41 mmHg and
increased of CO from 4.39 to 4.8. He also underwent BMS to
SVG-D1. During the procedure he felt abdominal cramps such as if
he were to move his bowels as well as nausea and vomitted x1 a
black material that he reports looked like blood. His blood
pressure decreased from 150/46 to 118/46 mmHg. At some point
during procedure, nurse was concerned for a "seizure", but
patient was awake and with normal exam when physicians evaluated
him. He was transferred to the CCU for monitoring post
procedure.

Urine Cx:  URINE CULTURE (Final [**2161-8-8**]):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         MEROPENEM <= 1 MCG/ML.  Cefepime <=2 MCG/ML.
         sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

TEE: [**2161-8-10**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is
