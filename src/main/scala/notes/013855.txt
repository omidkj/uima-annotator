History of Present Illness:
70 yo M w/ hx lung ca s/p resection, renal ca s/p nephrectomy 7
[**First Name3 (LF) 1686**] ago, now w/ brain and lung mets Dx'ed 2 months ago s/p brain
resection [**2126-9-24**] presents w/ R sided weakness, confusion and
hypoxia.
.
Pt was in USOH until ~ 2 months ago, he presented w/ weakness,
incoordination and inability to walk.  A scan of his head
revealed brain metastases.  He had those resected [**2126-9-24**] and

initial improvement ~ 2 days ago) and incoordination as well as
MS changes.  In the ED he was found to be hypoxic to 80% on RA
-> 100% NRB.  He was hypotensive despite 6L of fluids and
levophed was started.  Dobutamine was started for an SVO2 of
56%.

GAP-18CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST: Within the left posterior
frontal lobe near the vertex, there is an area of hypodensity
just deep to the patient's craniotomy, consistent with
post-operative changes status-post resection of the previously
identified posterior frontal lobe mass. The region of
hypodensity corresponds to the region of increased T2 signal
noted at the time of prior MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute intracranial hemorrhage
is identified. The lateral ventricles are symmetric in size and
nondilated, and appear unchanged in size from the time of MR.
The basilar cisterns are patent. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are otherwise within normal limits. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
differentiation is otherwise preserved, without evidence of
acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct. Bone windows
again demonstrate a craniotomy within the left frontal bone with
metallic fixation devices. The mastoid air cells and paranasal
sinuses are normally pneumatized.

IMPRESSION: Hypodensity within the left posterior frontal lobe,
just deep to the patient's craniotomy, consistent with
post-operative changes following resection of left posterior
frontal metastatic focus. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect identified.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

AP PORTABLE CHEST @ 12 NOON: Comparison is made to prior study
at 10 a.m. There has been interval placement of a right internal
jugular central venous catheter with its tip in the right
atrium. The patient is in gross pulmonary edema with increased
opacification of the right base most likely representing pleural
fluid. No pneumothorax.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 32202**]
Approved: TUE [**2126-10-22**] 9:29 PM

CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Positive study for pulmonary embolism in a right middle and
right upper lobe artery [**Last Name (un) 94110**]. Part of the clot extends into
the right main pulmonary artery.
2. Interval progression of pleural and pulmonary metastasis.
3. Interval increase of bilateral pleural effusions (right
greater than
left). The right pleural effusion appears to be slightly
loculated.
4. Diffuse interstitial lung ground glass opacities sparing the
right apex that could represent pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or
drug reaction.


Brief Hospital Course:
70M w/hx lung CA, mets renal CA (to brain and lungs) s/p recent
resection ago p/w Klebesilla septic shock, PNA, UTI, ARF and
worsening weakness and ataxia. The self extubated in the unit on
[**10-28**] and transferred to the floor.

# Septic shock/Urosepsis ??????He presented with fever, hypotension,
tachycardia, tachypnea w/ elevated wbc and hypoxia requiring
intubation and pressor support.  He was found to have
pansensitive klebsiella sepsis. He is s/p empiric azithro x 5
days (last [**10-24**]). He also received Levo for 3 days and stress
dose steroids.

# Hypoxia: [**12-24**] pulmonary edema, pleural effusion (too small to
tap per IP on [**10-25**]), PE, Vent associated PNA . Self extuabted on
[**10-28**] and has been managed in NC O2.
 He was started on bactrim PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. He contracted a vent
associated PNA so will continue with levo/zosyn/vanc.

# PE: Found on CTA. Was placed on heparin which weas stopped
once the patient's HCT dropped on [**10-30**].

# Brain mets/weakness RUE weakness, [**12-24**] brain met resection. Was
placed on steroids and will continue taper.

# ARF: no hydronephrosis on US; was likely pre-renal, now
resolved

# Renal CA: He has widespread metastis and this is terminal. The
patient was going to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] for further treatment
options but has decided against this.

# Anemia/ GI bleed- likely [**12-24**] chronic dz, The patient had one
episode of coffee ground emesis in the setting of heparin gtt.
Hi HCT was stable after this until [**10-29**]  when he had a 11 point
HCT drop. No BRBPR. He likely has a GI bleed or is bleeding into
his abdominal mass. He was transfused one unit before discharge.


# Care plan: Following the patient's extuabtion he was adamant
that he wanted to go home. he will go home whit hospice. His PCP
was [**Name (NI) 653**] about this ans is in agreeement. the paitnet
understands that he may not have long to live given possible GI
bleed abd oregression of his CA. Heis family is very supportive
about this diecsion.
