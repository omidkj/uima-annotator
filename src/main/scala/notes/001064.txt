Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
R arm numbness/weakness

Colonoscopy with polyp removal


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a  83 y/o RHF with history of multiple TIA's and
bilateral CEA's mos most recent 2 weeks ago for a left CEA after
"TIA's". She comes in today as an OSH transfer for two episodes
concerning for TIA. She states that yesterday she had a sudden
onset inability to get her words out. She states that this
lasted
hours, was not all words, and had no slurred speech, no
inability
to understand speech and she knew which words she wanted to say.
This resolved and then today had another event where she was
suddenly unable to use her right hand. She states she was trying
to use a fork for dinner and was unable to do so. This lasted
about 3 hours and then resolved. During this time those around
her stated that she had a left sided droop and possibly slurred
speech. At this point she feels back to baseline. She is unable
to give me any useful information regarding her previous
"TIA's".

On ROS she denies current HA, language difficulty, vertigo, CP,
SOB, fever or chills, weakness or chances to sensation. She does
however support pain in her low back and hips with walking and
uses support for ambulation.

Imaging:
CT-A [**6-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Small low attenuation in the left caudate head consistent
with an infarct
of indeterminate age, likely chronic.
2. Small area of low density in the left subinsular white
matter, infarct of
indeterminate age.
3. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Status post left carotid endarterectomy with soft tissue
changes and
without evidence of a flow-limiting stenosis in the major neck
vessels.
5. Thrombus in the right proximal subclavian artery.
6. Calcifications of the vertebral artery origin, limit
evaluation for
stenosis.

MRI-HEAD [**6-7**]
IMPRESSION:
Two small foci of bright diffusion signal abnormalities in the
left frontal cortex and left centrum semiovale associated with
FLAIR signal changes likely to suggest recent infarcts without
convincing ADC abnormality. Old lacunar infarct in the left head
of caudate nucleus.
.
.
EEG [**6-9**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG despite the normal
posterior
dominant rhythm during the waking state due to the presence of
bursts
of generalized delta frequency slowing which represents deep
midline
and subcortical dysfunction. There were no epileptiform
discharges or
electrographic seizures seen
.
.
ECHO [**6-9**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious cardiac source
of embolism in a technically limited study. Normal global left
ventricular systolic function. Technically suboptimal to exclude
focal wall motion abnormality. Right ventricle not
well-visualized. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**6-9**]
IMPRESSION: Acute watershed infarction involving the left
cerebral
hemisphere, new since the prior MRI of the brain dated [**2123-6-7**], also
seen on the prior CT perfusion from [**2123-6-9**]. No
hemorrhagic
transformation is seen.
.
CT- HEAD [**6-11**]
IMPRESSION: Evolving left hemispheric watershed infarcts, with
no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. No new acute process is
seen.
.
KUB
IMPRESSION:
1. No obstruction or free air.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.
3. Gallstones.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: STROKE
83 yo RHW with h/o L CEA [**2123-5-25**] presented with transient
episodes of R hand and arm numbness and speech difficulties.
She was initially transferred to the [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] service from
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center in NH. She had a transient episode of
right hand numbness that spread over the right arm and face over
seconds to minutes, followed by difficulty using the right hand,
disorientation and difficulties speaking. This occured on [**6-5**]
and again on [**6-6**].

Neurology was consulted on [**6-7**]. Neuro exam was significant for
right pronator drift and slowness with finger tapping. CTA
showed bilateral carotids had no significant stenosis. The
patient had been started on heparin drip empirically by [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
service. At that concern, neuro team was concerned for hyper- or
reperfusion syndrome s/p L CEA. It was therefore recommended to
keep her blood pressure well controlled (SBP<160) and stop the
heparin drip given risk of edema and hemorrhage. EEG was
performed to rule out seizure.

On [**6-8**] overnight, the patient's neuro exam worsened. On evening
rounds, she had some slowness in right hand fast finger
movements. At 2am, her right arm was flaccid and could not lift
it antigravity. Neurology nightfloat saw the patient, however at
that point it was still unclear whether this episode was due to
developing stroke or seizure secondary to hyperperfusion
syndrome.  The patient's blood pr
