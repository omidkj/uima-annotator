CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2163-5-10**] 9:47 PM

CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C

Reason: please eval AAA size, rupture; please also evaluate for
kidn
Field of view: 42 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old woman with abdominal pain radiating to back, says
she has a known AAA (?size); I suspect renal stone
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval AAA size, rupture; please also evaluate for kidney
stones
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 65-year-old woman with abdominal pain radiating to
back. No abdominal aortic aneurysm.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained with and without the administration of IV contrast
[**Doctor Last Name 360**], with CTA technique.

No comparison.

FINDINGS: Note is made of 5.3-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm with mural thrombus, surrounded by hyperdense fat
stranding and soft tissue measuring up to 46 [**Doctor Last Name **], most likely
representing abdominal aortic aneurysm with impending rupture.
No definite abscess is identified, however, the possibility of
infection cannot be totally excluded. Celiac, SMA, and iliac
vessels are patent. No evidence of active extravasation is
noted. Left kidney is atrophic, with very small left renal
artery. Right kidney is unremarkable.

Note is made of fatty liver. No focal liver lesion. The bladder,
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and the visualized portions of
large and small intestines are within normal limits. No
lymphadenopathy.

PELVIS: Note is made of sigmoid diverticulosis. Otherwise, the
visualized portions of the small intestines are within normal
limits. No ascites. No lymphadenopathy.

In the visualized portion of the chest, note is made of coronary
artery calcification in this patient who is status post CABG.
Note is made of 5-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the left
lower lobe, which needs to be followed in three months. Note is
made of atherosclerotic disease of the thoracoabdominal aorta.

There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal
structures.

IMPRESSION:
1. 5.3-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural
thrombus, surrounded by hyperdense soft tissue and fat stranding
suggestive of impending rupture with hematoma. No definite
abscess is identified, however, superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded. No evidence of active extravasation.

2. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

3. Fatty liver.

4. 5-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule in left lower lobe. Please
follow in three months.

The information was discussed with the ED physicians and surgery
resident, including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in person at the time of
examination, and it was also flagged to ED dashboard.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

POST-PYLORIC FEEDING TUBE PLACEMENT UNDER FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE:
A 120 cm 8
French [**Location (un) 2174**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**] feeding tube was inserted into the
fourth portion of
the duodenum under fluoroscopic guidance. The position was
confirmed by
injection of approximately 10 cc of Gastrografin. No immediate
complications
were seen.

IMPRESSION: Successful post-pyloric feeding tube placement.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
