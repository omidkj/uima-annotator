seizures/status epilepticus

None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17122**] is a 56 year old man with a history of infantile
meningitis, MR, epilepsy and recent diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation, pericardial effusion and chronic hyponatremia, who
was admitted after prolonged seizure yesterday.

According to his mother, she called out to him and he did not
respond.  Upon finding him, he had convulsive movements of his
left side, with his head deviated to the left.  She called 911.
The EMTs administered 5 mg Valium at the home and an additional
5
mg Valium in the ambulance.  Nonetheless, his seizures
continued.
The next time his mother saw him, he primarily had intermittent
left gaze deviation and nystagmus.  This eventually resolved
with
an additional 5 mg IV Valium.  He was then transferred here from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.

Mr. [**Known lastname 56411**] mother noted that he has had a recent increase in
bowel movements, up to 5-6 per day of foul-smelling stool.  She
stated that recent stool cultures were negative for C. diff,
although the ova and parasites evaluation was not yet completed.

Mr. [**Known lastname 17122**] has also had recent difficulties with atrial
fibrillation, pericarditis and pericardial effusion, for which
he
was hospitalized in [**2143-4-21**] and started treatment with
Amiodarone.  He has also recently had a elevated TSH, for which
he is to be treated with levothyroxine.

EEG [**2143-7-4**]:
Abnormal EEG due to the mildly slow background and due to
the relatively frequent sharp features and spikes in the right
anterior
quadrant. The first abnormality suggests an encephalopathy, but
some of
the slowing could come from drowsiness. Excessive drowsiness can
also
be the manifestation of an encephalopathy. The sharp features
and
spikes in the right anterior quadrant indicate an area of
potential
epileptogenesis. There were no simple spike or sharp and slow
wave
complexes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.

CXR [**2143-7-4**]:
The heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour and
width are unremarkable. The lungs are essentially clear. Minimal
atelectasis at the left retrocardiac space is demonstrated. No
sizeable pleural effusion is seen.

TTE [**2143-7-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass or thrombus is seen
in the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**5-30**]
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF  50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral  regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary  artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-5-2**], no
right atrial mass is seen. Review of the prior images suggests
the mass may have been  extrinsic to the heart (e.g., liver) and
is more clearly defined on the  current study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology: Patient was admitted to epilepsy service after
patient had been admitted with recurrent seizures in context of
infectious diarrhea and possible missed medication dose. Patient
had an EEG on HOD which showed generalized slowing with no
epileptiform discharges, consistent with post-ictal state and
valium use. Patient was also noted to be combative that day and
IV access could not be obtained. Later that evening, he was
noted to be acutely hypotensive with SBP 78/56. Emergent PIV
access was obtained and patient was given IVF NS bolus with only
small improvement in blood pressure before PIV became dislodged.
He was transferred to MICU for sustained hypotension and central
line need. Etiology of his hypotension likely dehydration after
history of diarrhea and decreased oral fluids. In the MICU, the
patient had an [**Year (4 digits) 461**] which showed no worsening in
ejection fraction, no pericardial effusion. He received a PICC
line and anti-epileptic medications were given IV until patient
was more awake to take po. The patient returned [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5, the
step-down unit for further monitoring. His blood pressure
remained stable without IVF and he was able to take his Depakote
and dilantin orally with good troughs noted. He continued to
have diarrhea while hospitalized and stool was positive for C.
diff. The patient started on 14 day course of po Vancomycin on
[**2143-7-8**].

Of note, the patient's TSH was noted to be elevated (9.5) and
free T4 noted to be in normal range. The patient's
endocrinologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and no medication changes were
recommended.
