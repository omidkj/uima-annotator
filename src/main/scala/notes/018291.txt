Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for consideration for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 y.o.f. with h/o MVR and HTN who presented
to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2192-2-17**] with acute onset SOB. Per notes
and family, she felt well when going to bed, but later awoke not
feeling well and called EMS. No recent chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath prior to the admitting episode, orthopnea,
or PND. According to paramedic run sheet she was in Afib with
RVR at 130 with BP 240/100. She could only speak in three word
sentences with RR in the 30's, temp was 102. She was given lasix
and nebs during transport. Initial EKG at [**Location (un) **] showed sinus
in the 80's with LBBB and LAD, and review of paramedic strip
showed sinus tachycardia rather than Afib (although ED physician
states initial rhythm was afib). She was 89% on 100% O2 with BP
222/66. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure
and gas on initial intubation was 7.22/72/118. She was given
rocephin and zithromax x 1 and admitted to the ICU. CXR showed
pulmonary edema.
.
Over the course of her ICU stay she was found to have a positive
urine culture treated with cefazolin, and felt to have urosepsis
although no blood cultures were positive. She was hypertensive
and overloaded per notes, and she was diuresed with lasix 80 mg
IV BID. CXR films on disc that came with patient to [**Hospital1 18**] showed
rapid improvement in pulmonary edema after 1-2 days in ICU. ECHO
was performed which showed EF 45% and basilar inferior
aneurysmal formation present on earlier ECHO. She was difficult
to wean from the vent due to tachypnea, hypoxia, and
hypotension. Concern was for LV deterioration causing difficulty
weaning, but repeat ECHO on [**2-23**] was unchanged. Additionally,
there was concern for ischemia or valvular dysfunction during
weaning, but repeat ECHO after 30 min. of spontaneous breathing
trial was also unchanged. A swan-ganz catheter was recommended,
but in the end this was not pursued. Her wean failure was
ultimately felt to be d/t delerium, and she was changed from
versed to propofol and successfully weaned and extubated on
[**2-27**].
.
At some point prior to [**2-23**] her CK peaked at 743 with MB of 11.3
and Trop I 1.05 (ULN 0.4). On [**2-29**] she had a 20-30min episode of
hypotension that resolved on its own, and then again on [**3-2**].
Per nursing, these were in the setting of sitting her upright.
She also had episodes of transient hypoxia, unclear specifics.
On [**2-29**] she developed worsening MS - per daughter-in-law, knew
month after extubation, but since Wednesday has been unable to
recall base orientation.
.
ID was consulted for persistent intermittent fevers during
initial ICU course, but etiology was unclear. She was continued
on treatment for UTI with no other source found, and eventually
these resolved. She had 6 negative blood cultures and a negative
sputum culture. Hematology was consulted for pancytopenia (WBC
11 to 2.8, HCT 40 to 27, and plt 230 to 107) and etiology was
felt to be due to sepsis, and her counts subsequently recovered.

.
Cardiology considered taking her to the cath lab on [**2-28**] to
evaluate for CAD, but felt that she was too unstable to do so,
and therefore was tranferred to BICMC for cardiac
catheterization to assess valve and coronaries.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO: [**3-5**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
