Brief Hospital Course:
75M PMH IDDM, HTN, h/o syncope, originally admitted [**2112-12-10**] for
fever, chills, cough, leukocytosis; found to have R antecubital
fossa cellulitis and S. Aureaus bacteremia ([**Last Name (un) 36**]. pending).  The
patient had recently been admitted to [**Location (un) **] for presyncope
workup, which was negative including head CT and MRI to r/o
posterior circ insufficiency which were both negative.  He was
ruled out for MI, and had PVCs on tele, but no apparent
arrythmia.  He followed up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-6**] and was without
any symptoms, with a plan for a holter monitor.  On the day of
admission, the patient called his PCP for fever/chills, cough,
and malaise for 2 days.  He had no SOB, CP, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, HA, or sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] had noted urinary
frequency without dysuria, nausea, and feeling generally weak
with ambulation.  He was taken to the ED by EMS, who noted him
to have BP 150/80, HR 84, and RR 16, and to be visually unstable
when attempting to stand.  In the ED, he was noted to have a T
102, HR 87, BP 189/100, and RR 28.  He was given Ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for a ? [**Location (un) 1131**] of RML haziness, along with ancef
for the evidence of cellulitis.  WBC was 17.5 and EKG showed new
ST depressions on lateral precordial leads (V5,V6). His exam was
notable only for the RUE cellulitis and mild decreased BS at
bases.  On the floor, he was initially only continued on
azithro/CTX.  RUE u/s showed a R basilic vein thrombosis.  He
was started on IVFs for mild orthostasis and ruled out for MI.
He was also started on a beta blocker.  On [**12-12**] in the afternoon,
he developed SOB desat'ing from 94% on 3L to 87% on 4L; he was
breathing at 22, HR 73, with faint crackles at bases.  He had a
CTA to r/o PE which showed no PE, but a RLL PNA with adjacent
inflammatory changes and small bl pleural effusions.  Tonight,
the NF intern was called for O2 sat 78% on 4LNC, although noted
that pt was not in any distress.  He was started on a NRB with
sats increasing to 90%--ABG 7.52/33/52.  He was given albuterol
nebs without relief, CXR performed showed worsened R sided PNA,
at that time the decision was made to transfer to the ICU.

On floor, pt continued to improve, by problem:

1. Respiratory distress: Pt was continued on Levofloxicin,
Alb/Ipra nebs. A CT revealed a pulmonary effusion, which was
tapped and 1.6L of serosanguinous fluid was drained, which was
transudative by Light's criteria. His pulmonary status improved
as he was advanced from 100% NRB to O2 face mask, and onto Nasal
cannula.  As he received a significant amount of fluid, he was
successfully diuresed prior (approximately 2 L/24 hours) prior
to discharge from the ICU.  Completed course of Levofloxacin in
hospital and on discharge was 95% on RA.

*
2. MSSA Bactermia: Pt had evidence of thrombophlebitis on RUE
U/S, but no abscess was mentioned.  He continued to have
positive blood cultures, which were all positive for MSSA.  He
was continued on oxacillin and had surveillance blood cultures.
TTE was performed, which was negative for vegetations.  On
arrival to floor, pt underwent TEE, which was negative for
evidence of BE. Surveillance cultures remained negative and
patient was discharged to complete seven more days of
dicloxacillin.
