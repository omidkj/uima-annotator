Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-2-6**]: ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement
[**2132-2-8**]: ERCP with prior stent removal, new stent placement,
balloon sweep with extraction of multiple stones
[**2132-2-12**]: Laproscopic cholecystectomy


History of Present Illness:
77 M with history of HTN, HL, CAD s/p CABG, Afib, DMII, presents
with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting.
.
Mr [**Known lastname 10821**] was in usual state of health until lunch yesterday
when he developed poor appetite and nausea that worsened
throughout the day. In the evening he developed acute onset
abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiated to his back. He
had two episodes of non bloody emesis prompting self referral to
the ED.  He denies any fevers, chills, CP, SOB, dyspnea,
diarrhea, BRBPR, melena. He endorses single episode of small of
amount his blood in his urine.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 96.8 92 156/68 18 89%.  Physical
exam was notable for tender RUQ and epigastrum.  Labs showed
leukocytosis to 17.4. lipase of 4050, and elevated LFTs and
bilirubin.  CT scan showed concern for cholecystitis as it
showed distended gallbladder with multiple stones with small
foci of air in nondependent areas.  There was no definitive
evidence of wall thickening, stranding or duct dilation.
Patient then spiked a fever to 101.5.  Surgery and ERCP were
consulted given concern for an impacted stone and cholangitis.
He received a total of 3 L of IV fluids, unasyn 3g IV, morphine
10 mg, and zofran.  Tentative plan is to have INR reversed with
FFP and go for ERCP.  Vitals prior to transfer: 76 108/50 17 95%
2L
.
On arrival to the ICU, initial vitals were: 97.6 82 121/52 95%
RA 17.  He reported 0/10 pain.  He appeared comfortable and was
accompanied by his wife.

IMAGING:

[**2-6**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Central pulmonary vascular congestion with moderate
interstitial edema, concerning for cardiac decompensation.

[**2-6**] CT abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder containing multiple gallstones and gas.
Even with
lack of significant wall thickening, the findings are concerning
for early
cholecystitis. A HIDA examination can be considered if there is
a need for
further confirmation.
2. Multiple hypodense pancreatic lesions likely representing
side branch
IPMNs. MRCP is recommended for further characterization. 3. No
intra- or
extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
4. Large bilateral inguinal hernias.
5. Enlarged prostate.

[**2-6**] ERCP
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep after a
guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
Several 5 mm round stones that were causing partial obstruction
were seen at the common bile duct.
Given gallstone pancreatitis, decision was made to perform a
sphincterotomy.
A careful, limited sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire.
Pus and sludge was noted to extrude from the common bile duct.
Given cholangitis, decision was made to place a stent rather
than stone extraction.
A 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully.

[**2-8**] ERCP
A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was found in the
major papilla - this was removed.
A previous sphincterotomy was seen and the ampulla appeared
open.
There was some mild oozing at the papilla from previous
sphincterotomy - A gold probe was applied for hemostasis
successfully.
Multiple small stones were seen in the common bile duct.
Balloon sweep x 4 was performed with extraction of multiple
stones successfully.
Final cholangiogram was without filling defects.
A 8cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully.
Mutiple large stones were seen in the gallbladder.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 M with h/o HTN, HL, CAD s/p CABG, Afib, CHF, DMII presented
from OSH with abdominal pain concerning for pancreatitis and
cholangitis as a result of gallstone obstruction.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
#. Ascending cholangitis: classic presentation with RUQ pain,
fevers, leukocytosis, elevated LFT (total bili), and evidence of
gallstones on imaging.  ERCP and surgery both consulted
immediately on admission.  Started on ciprofloxacin and flaygyl
initially, then changed to zosyn on hospital day 2.  Coumadin
held and attempted INR reversal with 4 units FFP (however INR
still 3.5) prior to ERCP. ERCP on [**2-6**] showed frank pus coming
from the ampulla, stones in the common bile duct, and evidence
of pancreatitis.  Sphincterotomy performed and stent placed,
however stone still left in the duct. After procedure, pt
developed rising billirubin (max TBilli 9). He had a second ERCP
with removal of several stones in the common bile duct. Prior
stent was removed and new stent placed. Some small oozing of
blood was noted at ampulla which was cauterized. Pt tolerated
procedure well and will have follow up with GI outpatient for
stent removal and elective cholecystectomy.

#. Gallstone Pancreatitis: Lipase to 4050 on admission, ERCP
pancreatogram consistent with active pancreatitis
