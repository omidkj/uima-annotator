Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Theophylline / Fosamax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest discomfort, at OSH ruled in for MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-9-20**]  cabg x3   (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA)


History of Present Illness:
Per transfer note after hand-off from outside hospital:
"87 year old woman with DM, HTN, + CHOL with intermittent chest
discomfort over the past month. Admitted to [**Hospital3 417**]
yesterday with increasing chest discomfort. EKG with evidence of
evolving anterior MI. Troponin peaked at .9 from 6pm last
evening, .58 this morning. No further chest pain. Received
plavix 600mg yesterday, lovenox last evening, Aspirin. No pain
since admission. Transfer direct to cath lab."
.
Accordingly, she was transferred for cardiac catheterization and
echocardiogram, after which she was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service
of [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Per patient, has been having a "few weeks" of being lethargic,
starting to sit down and do nothing more and more. Also having
some chest pain and dyspnea on exertion with increasing
frequency. Chest pain is "pressure across my chest".
.
More distantly pt notes that has had history of falls; children
took away her car more than a year ago.


Past Medical History:
NIDDM, HTN, + CHOL, osteoarthritis
NSTEMI
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current or
history of tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse;
very occasional single drink at social gatherings in past. There
is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or
sudden death.

Family History:
Family history includes mother with heart problems but died at
89; father had MI but died of cerebral hemorrhage; sister died
of lung CA at 55; two other sisters, one has dementia and lives

TELEMETRY demonstrated: 4 beat run of NSVT; 14 beat run of
irregular tachycardia c/w SVT, ?brief a fib.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**9-12**]: "The left atrium is
elongated. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with apical akinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion."

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**9-12**] demonstrated: [formal report
pending, written report in chart:] diffuse 3 vessel disease

[**2130-9-13**] - Carotid Series Complete
IMPRESSION: There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less
than 40% left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries.

[**2130-9-15**] - CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
CONCLUSION:
1. Indeterminate ground glass opacities in both lungs may be
infectious or inflammatory, and can be followed up with a chest
CT in three months to assess stability/clearance.
2. Prominence of pulmonary arteries, with the main pulmonary
artery measuring 35 mm.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease is present in the coronary
arteries and the aorta.
4. Left renal hypodensity is not fully assessed on this
examination.

HEMODYNAMICS: stable while here, some slightly high BPs
