HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular
disease and current tobacco use, who was transferred from an
outside hospital complaining of shortness of breath and
elevated troponin.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
which was performed on [**2103-10-15**].  Please see
catheterization report for full details.

In summary the catheterization showed that the patient had
100% right coronary artery lesion, 99% mid left anterior
descending lesion, 70% diagonal lesion, 90% OM lesion, with
LPDA of 80%.  She had a TEE done also which showed an
ejection fraction of 35-40%, mild mitral regurgitation, and
borderline pulmonary hypertension with mild to moderate left
ventricular dysfunction.  She was referred to Cardiothoracic
Surgery for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting.

The patient was seen by CT Surgery and accepted for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was a pleasant,
morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous
distention.  No bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm without
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Right-hand dominant.
Left [**Doctor Last Name **] test satisfactory.  Neurological:  The patient was
alert and oriented times three.  Grossly intact.  Pulses:
Carotids 2+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis
pedis 2+ bilaterally, posterior tibial not palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.7, hematocrit 32.2, platelet
count 325; sodium 135, potassium 5.1, chloride 100, CO2 27,
BUN 56, creatinine 1.6, glucose 109; PT 12.6, INR 1.1; AST
21, alkaline phosphatase 66, amylase 15, total bilirubin 0.2.

The patient was initially followed by the Medical Service,
and on [**10-18**], she was brought to the Operating Room at
which time she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the operative report for full details.

In summary the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting
times three with LIMA to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to diagonal and OM sequentially.  The
patient's bypass time was 59 min.  Cross-clamp time was 39
min.  She tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient had a mean arterial
pressure of 61 with a CVP of 10, heart rate 84, normal sinus
rhythm.  She had Propofol 20 mcg/kg/min and Insulin 2 U/hr.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative periods.
She remained hemodynamically stable.  She did remain
intubated throughout the evening of the surgical date.

On postoperative day #1, she was weaned from the ventilator
and successfully extubated.  Additionally her Neo-Synephrine
drip was weaned to off.

On postoperative day #2, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  Her chest tubes were removed, and she was
transferred to the floor for continued postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.

Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  With the assistance of the nursing
staff and Physical Therapy, her activity level was gradually
increased.  It was decided on postoperative day #4, that the
patient would benefit from a short-term stay in a
rehabilitation setting.  At that time, arrangements were
begun to have her transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

It is anticipated that the patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation setting on [**10-24**].
