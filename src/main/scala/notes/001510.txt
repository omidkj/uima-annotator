Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: Most likely due to RML/RLL pneumonia. Started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED, continued in the MICU.
No PE on CT-A. No evidence of CHF on exam; TTE with LVEF 50-55%
and likely anterior fat pad vs loculated pericardial effusion
(less likely). Continued baseline nebs for COPD. Legionella
urine neg, sputum/ blood cultures with no growth.  Pt stable on
MICU to floor transfer on 2Lnc. Should have outpatient PFTs to
evaluate for amio-induced lung toxicity. Pt switched to PO
azithromycin and cefpodoxime to complete 10 day course of abx
finishing on [**2112-9-17**].Pt had evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR
consistant with h/o diastolic CHF.  Pt was diuresed with IV
lasix, which improved her respiratory status.  She was given 20
mg. PO lasix upon discharge to move her toward euvolemia.


2. Hypotension: Most likely due to pneumonia-induced sepsis. On
MICU transfer, pt was normotensive and off pressors after fluid
resuscitation since arrival to MICU on HD 1. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was
appropriate, no steroids indicated. Pt had no problems with low
BPs on the floor and was discharged on home HTN meds.

3. CAD: Cycle cardiac enzymes given ST segment changes on
admission EKG. Repeat EKG morning of [**9-9**]. Continued telemetry
until r/o MI complete HD 2. Continued ASA, atorvastatin. Held
metoprolol [**1-18**] recent hypotension and normotensive pressures in
MICU. TTE; LVEF 55%, ant fat pad vs ?loculated peric effusion.

4. Right hip cellulitis: pt with underlying ORIF of R hip,
ultrasound demonstrated only subcutaneous edema consistent with
cellulitis, no evidence of fluid collection.  Pt for Keflex
course 500 QID x 5 days. This was completed prior to discharge.

5. Hypothyroid: pt continued on home synthroid

6. Paroxysmal AFib: pt continued on Amio. Normal sinus rhythm
while in MICU.  Question of lack of outpatient Coumadin in
patient with h/o AF AND pvd AND multiple malignancies; for
followup with primary care physician Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6210**] on this subject.
