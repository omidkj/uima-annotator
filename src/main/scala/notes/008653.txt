Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and back/neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 DM, PAD known severe AS [**Location (un) 109**] 0.9cm2 mean gradient of 20mmHg,
CHF EF 35-40% with regional variation, 3vd cath 1mo ago, RLE
angioplasty/stent for poorly healing TMA now presents with
dyspnea and pain. Last evening around 10pm, she developed
back/neck pain while at rest that subsided somewhat by trying to
sleep/rest, but she awoke at 4am with wheezing, concerning
enough
to call her daughter and present to [**Hospital3 **]. Her sats
were recorded to be in the 70s. She received lasix (20mg IV by
report) with improvement in respiratory status, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her presenting vitals were 99.9, 90/44 HR 113
RR
21 Sat 100% NRB. Her BP dropped to 83/47 lowest recorded, and
she
received a 250cc saline bolus. She was weaned down on her oxygen
to 4L NC. Given her BP, she was admitted to the cardiac ICU for
further monitoring.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of frank
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Urine cx ([**3-3**]): negative
Blood cx ([**3-3**] x2, [**3-5**] x2): NGTD

CXR ([**3-3**]): Interval development of pulmonary edema; repeat PA
and lateral
when clinically feasible may be beneficial.

LE U/S ([**3-3**]): No DVT of either lower extremity.

TTE ([**3-4**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2154-1-28**], global left ventricular systolic function is more
depressed (and apprears global) and the severity of aortic
stenosis has progressed. No discrete vegetations identified
(does not exclude with deformed valves).

CXR ([**3-5**]): In comparison with the study of [**3-3**], the
hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen. The pulmonary vascularity
is less pronounced. These findings are consistent with
decreasing pulmonary [**Date Range 1106**] congestion and pleural effusions.
Some streaks of atelectasis persist, especially at the left
base. There is a vague suggestion of an area of increased
opacification involving the right mid lung laterally. This could
possibly reflect a developing area of consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Was diuresed with
boluses of furosemide (20-60mg IV) with care to avoid
overdiuresis due to her AS and subsequent preload dependence.
TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction and severe aortic
stenosis. Her breathing improved with diuresis and she was
weaned off O2. Her outpatient furosemide was increased from 20mg
once a day to 40mg once a day. She was started on lisinopril
2.5mg daily, which can be uptitrated as tolerated. Metoprolol
was increased from 12.5mg twice daily to 37.5mg three times a
day but her blood pressure could not tolerate and she was weaned
back to metoprolol 12.5mg PO BId. She remained in sinus
tachycardia in the 100-110s range, which per patient and
daughter has been her baseline for at least 40 years. Also, her
blood pressure has not tolerated past attempts to control her
heart rate with medications. Regarding her AS, she was seen by
CT surgery for AVR, and will follow up as an outpatient for this
and CABG.

2) PVD: Status post recent TMA revision with wound vac in place
over R dorsal foot. [**Date Range **] surgery was consulted and felt this
wound was not infected. She was discharged with the wound vac in
place.

3) CAD: Plan is for patient to undergo CABG once her right foot
wound has healed. She was treated with ASA, clopidogrel,
atorvastatin, and metoprolol. She had no evidence of acute
ischemia during her hospitalization.

4) Fevers: CXR did not suggest pneumonia, urine culture was
negative, and blood cultures were negative to date at discharge.
No evidence of leg DVT on ultrasound. Her fever curve trended
down and she had no leukocytosis.

5) Anemia: Chronic and stable. She was transfused 1 unit pRBCs
in case anemia was contributing to her tachycardia, although her
HR remained elevated.

6) DM: Her oral hypoglycemics were held while in house and she
was monitored on RISS. She was transitioned back to her PO meds
at discharge.

Her other chronic medical problems remained stable and she was
continued on her outpatient regimen.
