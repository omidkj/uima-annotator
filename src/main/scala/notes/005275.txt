Brief Hospital Course:
#. Altered mental status: Differential diagnosis was very broad
in this frail patient with several medical conditions, including
intracraneal process, systemic infection, delirium, etc. At
presentation, given x-ray findings this was felt to most likely
represent hospital acquired pneumonia. Patient was initiated on
Vancomycin, add Zosyn and azithromycin for atypical coverage.
Cultures were obtained and after very prompt improvement,
antibiotic regimen was narrowed. After no evidence of infection
was found, antibiotics were discontinued and the patient
continued to improve. It appears this episode of altered mental
status and somnolence was not far from his baseline, currently
there is no evidence of systemic infection.
.
#. Hypotension: On admission, concern for sepsis physiology,
although as above no signs of infection at this time. Patient
also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency, with a normal
cosyntropin stimulation response. Patient placed back on
midodrine at time of discharge, tolerating dialysis well.
.
#. Hypoxia / Hypercarbia: Likely secondary to restrictive
process from intrathoracic stomach. Episode has improved without
further intervention, patient discharged on 2L NC.
.
#. H/O MRSA Bacteremia: Cultures remained negative this
hospitalization, 14 day course of Vancomycin completed [**2133-8-1**],
patient given last dose after dialysis.
.
#. End Stage Renal Disease: We continued HD per outpatient
schedule on [**Month/Day/Year 766**], Wednesday, Friday.
.
#. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during last
admission, completing 14 day course of Abx, currently on PO
Vancomycin x 4 more days.
.
#. Pleural Effusions: Chronic effusions bilaterally, do no
appear to be changed at this time.
.
#. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-7-17**] with EF >55% and
mild mitral regurgitation.
.
#. Atrial Fibrillation: Currently paced, not active issue. We
continued amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **], and did not anticoagulate given
recent history of lower GI bleeding, defer restarting
anticoagulation to primary care team.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: Per OMR, Drug reaction vs MDS. , with HIT
panel negative, not active during this admission.
.
#. FEN: Diet advanced to regular
.
#. Prophylaxis: SC Heparin
.
#. CODE: Patient remained DNR/DNI, clarified with son, [**Name (NI) **]
(HCP)
.
#. Access: Tunneled HD line ([**2133-7-24**])
