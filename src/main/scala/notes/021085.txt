Two radiographs of the lumbar spine demonstrate the patient to
be status post L3-L5 posterior osseous and metallic spinal
fusion and L3-L5 laminectomy, new when compared to [**2130-11-29**].
Vertebral body heights are maintained. There is mild
anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 measuring 4-5 mm (grade I). No
hardware loosening is appreciated. Bilateral hip joints are
unremarkable. Assessment of the sacrum is limited by overlying
bowel gas. Surgical staples are seen in the skin along the
posterior midline.

The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD. A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is
present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right
ventricle. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is unfolded
and ? slightly ectatic. There is minimal upper zone
redistribution and slight prominence of the vessels, without
overt CHF. No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. On the
lateral view, there is some prominence of markings posteriorly.
The possibility of an early infectious infiltrate cannot be
entirely excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77yo woman with h/o HTN, HOCM, PAF s/p DDD PCM, CRI, who
presented for pre-op optimization of fluid status before lumbar
decompresson surgery, c/b leukocytois/fever/AMS, resolved and
underwent surgery.
.
# S/P lumbar decompression:  Pain under adequate control with
dilaudid PCA.  No signs of wound infection. Followed in
conjuction with ortho-spine who recommended followup in 2 weeks.
PT/OT following
.
# Leukocytosis/fever: Asymptomatic without source of infection.
Remained afebrile postoperateively with slow regression of
leukocytosis. No infection found on standard workup including
CXR, U/A, UCx and blood cultures.

# Cardiac:
a) CHF: EF 60% with known diastolic CHF; difficult to diurese as
she begins to have azotemia, hypotension and presyncope.  Was
slightly volume overloaded based on exam, O2 sat but improved
with medical management which included gentle diuresis.
Outpatient regimen of torsemide, metoprolol, spironolactone,
diltiazem continued without change.  Lisinopril restarted
postoperatively but HCTZ continued to be held given
hyponatremia.  Her daily I/O goal was maintained even.
.
b) CAD: Pt with clean coronaries per cath in [**2126**].
- Continued BB, Statin, CCB
- Restarted ASA post-op
.
c) Rhythm: s/p DDD PCM.  Pt with longstanding AFib. She is
controlled on coumadin, Toprol and Diltiazem. Coumadin held  in
anticipation of lumbar surgery and restarted postoperatively.
Needs INR monitoring upon discharge until stable.
.
# Acute on CRI: baseline recently 1.0-1.3, was 1.8 on admit, now
down to 1.3 off lisinopril.  Was likely prerenal azotemia on
presentation from CHF similar to previous episodes, now
resolving. Low dose ACEi restarted on discharge.
.
# DM2: changed glipizide to 10mg qam, 5mg qpm and covered with
insulin scale.
.
# Diabetic PNP: continued Gabapentin
.
# Gout: continued allopurinol, adjusted for renal insuff
.
# Glaucoma: Continued home latanoprost eyedrops at bedtime and
brimonidine eyedrops twice daily
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: continued Simvastatin.
.
# Anemia: continued iron supplementation.
.
# Depression: continued Paxil
.
# Pt discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for continued care.
