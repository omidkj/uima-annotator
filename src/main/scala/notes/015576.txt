C-SPINE (PORTABLE) IN O.R.; SPINAL FLUORO WITHOUT RADIOLOG

Reason: INTRA OP CK HALO PLACEMENT

INDICATION: Intraoperative check of halo placement.

Single intraoperative fluoroscopic spot view of the lateral
C-spine was obtained without radiologist present. Limited view
of C1 through C5 is seen without overlying instrumentation. For
complete details, please see the surgical note.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Sinus rhythm. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Left
atrial abnormality.
Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Probable old anterior wall
myocardial
infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2143-3-8**] ventricular premature beats are new.
Otherwise, no
significant diagnostic change.

Reason: SWELLING LEFT LEG

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with Left ax fem bypass, now with increased LLE
swelling
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O left lower extremity DVT - portable please
HISTORY: 75-year-old man with left ax-fem bypass, now with
increased left lower extremity swelling.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and
waveforms are demonstrated. Intraluminal thrombus is not
identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Moderately
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. Cannot exclude LV
mass/thrombus.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately
depressed with septal and apical akinesis. The lateral wall
moves best. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The aortic root is
mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
