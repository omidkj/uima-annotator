Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of chronic pain on narcotics,
lumbar spinal stenosis, L2 discectomy, chronic venous stasis
dermatitis, chronic R heel ulcer now healed, deconditioning and
recent admit for lower extremity edema, aspiration pneumonitis,
and UTI returning with generalized weakness and RUE swelling.
She was sent in from [**Hospital3 2558**] with nursing noting mental
status changes and lethargy.  Notes point out right upper hand
swelling.  BP at the time noted to be 90/55 with temp 98.5.  Per
report this right hand swelling was of four days duration but
gradually worsened.  Denies erythema, warmth, pain, or prior
swelling like this.  Denies f/c, -n/v/d, -CP/SOB/cough, -abd
pain, -dysuria, -focal n/t/w. No trauma. No exacacerbating or
relieving factors.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97 80 146/76 18 97% RA. Physical
exam with HDS, AAOx3, no evidence of lethargy, mild edema of the
right hand.  Differential diagnosis for her decreased energy and
concern for lethargy in the ED was recurrent common infections
versus metabolic versus electrolyte abnormality.  In regard to
swollen right hand, there are no features to suggest neuro,
motor, vascular deficits, no underlying bony tenderness; they
felt this may be a possible DVT.  Right upper extremity
ultrasound: no dvt.  Labs were notable for an elevated d-dimer
and a lactate of 2.  CXR was done.  CTA was obtained which
identified large right main pulm artery embolus.  She was
started on a heparin gtt.  UA was dirty and concerning for UTI.
Based on prior resistance to cipro and allergies she was given
gentamicin IV x1. Pt was admitted to the MICU based on the
extensive nature of the embolus.

CT OF THE CHEST [**2136-1-6**]: A pulmonary embolism is noted within
the right main pulmonary vessel extending into the right upper
lobe pulmonary vessels.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
Mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet CT size
criteria for pathologic enlargement. The thoracic aorta shows no
evidence of acute aortic injury and dissection. There are
coronary atherosclerotic calcifications. No pericardial effusion
is noted. Mild interstitial changes are noted within the lungs.
The study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Within this
limitation, the upper abdominal structures appear unremarkable.
Visualized osseous structures show multilevel degenerative
changes with no
lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancies.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right main pulmonary vessel embolus extending into the right
upper lobe
pulmonary vessels.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Coronary artery calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F hx chronic pain and multiple prior UTI's presents with
lethargy found to have a UTI and PE.
.
ACUTE
# UTI - Reported burning with urination and had a UA with 61
WBC, few bacteria, and 9 epis. Possibly dirty, but given her
history of recurrent E. coli UTIs in the past, decided to treat
it. She was initially given aztreonam but then switched to one
time dose of fosfomycin (she has extensive allergies and
fosfomycin has worked in the past). Her symptoms resolved.

# PULMONARY EMBOLISM - PE was likely an incidental finding on
CTA of the chest as she had no dyspnea, hypoxia nor tachycardia.
She remained completely asymptomatic in spite of her large R
main PE. No ECG changes were present. She was started on heparin
and warfarin then transitioned to lovenox and warfarin. She will
need followup of INR with cessation of lovenox once her INR is
therapeutic. The etiology of the clot is unclear but may be due
to malignancy given her age.

CHRONIC
# CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME - continued oxycontin and oxycodone.
Continued bowel regimen incl colace, senna, miralax, lactulose

# DM: Metformin held while in house. Restarted no discharge.
Covered with ISS while in hour.

# HTN: continued lisinopril, metoprolol

# HL: continued rosuvastatin

TRANSITIONAL CARE
- INR should be monitored at least twice a week until
therapeutic between a range of [**2-3**]. Warfarin should be adjusted
accordingly. Lovenox should be discontinued when therapeutic.
- Unprovoked clot is concerning for malignancy, though she has
been somewhat sedentary given her chronic pain and
poly-pharmacy. If warranted, search for malignancy should be
pursued as an outpatient.
