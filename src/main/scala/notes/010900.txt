INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderate global LV
hypokinesis. No resting
LVOT gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal
motion consistent with conduction abnormality/ventricular
pacing.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS.
Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.
[Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] LV inflow
pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**11-27**]+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or
electrodes.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. There is moderate-to-severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis
(ejection fraction 30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2141-2-16**], no major change is evident.

[**2141-3-7**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Coronary angiography of this co-dominant system revealed two
vessel
coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery was very
short
in length and had a 30% stenosis in the proximal vessel.  The
LAD had a
40-50% stenosis in the proximal vessel involving the origin of a
large
D1 while the D1 had a 50-60% stenosis.  The LCX had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The RCA had a 70% stenosis in
the
proximal vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed secondary to the

incidence of complete heart block with a previous attempt at
pulmonary
artery catheterization.  The tricuspid valve was not crossed.
Right
sided filling pressures were normal (mean RA pressure was 5 mm
Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 16
mm Hg).
Cardiac index was normal (at 3.2 L/min/m2) (calculated using an
RA
oxygen saturation, assuming no intracardiac shunt).
3.  The aortic valve was evaluated and had a mean gradient of 49
mm Hg
and an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2.


Brief Hospital Course:
74F transfer from OSH s/p embolectomy for R brachial emboli,
h/o severe AS and anemia for cardiac work-up. Pt of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 957**], found to have colonic polyps on colonoscopy for anemia
work-up at OSH. Pt admitted to receive medical clearance for
future procedure. Found to have UTI, with signs of sepsis severe
respiratory difficulty and severe aortic stenosis. Admitted to
MI CU 3/23/5 for respiratory distress intubated on [**2141-2-17**].
Found to have UTI with VRE, and e coli multiresistant. At that
point ID consult was called and recommendations were followed.
Received full course of antibiotic treatment until bc and UC
were cleared. Patient was extubated on [**2-22**]/5. Since then
patient was persistently disoriented, seen by psychiatry
multiple times diagnosis of delirium was made. We minimized pain
medications and pt was placed on Haldol for a couple of days. On
max dose of Haldol he mental status did not improved nor
sedation was archived so Pt was placed on Ativan that met her
sedation requirements. Patient since extubation was placed on TF
to meet her caloric requirements impact with five 3.4
strength.Pt underwent CATH ON [**2141-2-27**] ABORTED FOR AGITATION OF
