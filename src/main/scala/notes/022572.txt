Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male with a history of multiple
myeloma s/p multiple treatments, including numerous chemotherapy
regimens, Autologous transplant in [**3-/2156**], mini-MUD allogeneic
transplant in [**9-/2159**], and DLI x4, most recently on [**2162-9-6**],
presenting from clinic after his bili was found to be
increasing.
.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently admitted for DLI in [**Month (only) 216**], and
during that admission was found to have GVHD of the liver on
biopsy. He was started on MMF and prednisone and was being
managed as an outpatient. However, his numbers continue to rise,
and he now appears to have eye and skin involvement.  He was
recently seen by ophthamology and started on drops for GVHD of
the eye. He has, blurry vision in the left eye, grittiness and

IMPRESSION: Worsening pneumonia in the left lung, now involving
the basal
segments of the left lower lobe. Apparent increase in right
lower lung opacity which may reflect pneumonia. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, possibly increased on the left. Diffuse bony
changes compatible with known multiple myeloma.
