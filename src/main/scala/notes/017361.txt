CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 61-year-old male with numerous
admissions for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbations as well as a history of non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction, who recent completed a course of ciprofloxacin
for dysuria and Zithromax in the beginning of [**Month (only) 956**] for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  The patient was
also placed on a prednisone taper at that time, which he
finished recently.  The patient denied any chest pain or
cardiac symptoms during a home visit by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**], but
did related perpetual shortness of breath even with mild
activity.  The patient is homebound at baseline with O2
saturations 89-90% on room air dropping to 86% with dressing
alone.  Spirometry [**12-28**] revealed a FEV1 of 30% of
predicted, vital capacity of 62% of predicted, and FEV1/FVC
ratio of 48%.

Compared to [**Month (only) **] the FEV1 was reduced by 100 cc, and vital
capacity decreased by 300 cc.  The patient was noted at that
time to be under utilizing his medications and O2.

Patient presented to the Emergency Room today with dyspnea
and severe anxiety.  Arterial blood gas at that time revealed
the following values:  7.23, 67, 89.  Patient was extremely
tachypneic according to the Emergency Room physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
given IV benzodiazepines, Solu-Medrol IV, and was intubated
and sedated with propofol with resultant in decrease in the
systolic blood pressure into the 70s.  The patient was
changed from propofol to Versed.  The patient's heart rate
was high as 135, and returned to the 90s status post 10 mg of
IV diltiazem.

Intensive Care Unit team was consulted at that time for
admission and further management of the patient's further
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient uses
O2 even with mild exertion.  Sats drop to 86% with dressing
and he is at baseline 89% on room air.
2. Reactive airway disease.
3. L1-L2 diskectomy.
4. Myocardial infarction on [**2101-1-25**]:  Anterolateral
T-wave inversions, left ventricular ejection fraction noted
to be 50% with mild apical hypokinesis at the time.  No
clinically significant stenosis on catheterization.  Mild
pulmonary hypertension was noted with a PA pressure of 39/9
with a mean of 23.  Left ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 21, elevated left heart filling pressures.
Echocardiogram on [**4-/2099**] revealed 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, left ventricular wall thickness and systolic
function were normal.  ETT in [**4-/2099**] revealed no symptoms,
nonspecific electrocardiogram changes.  No perfusion defects.
5. Hypertension.
6. Low back pain.

ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS:  7.24, 69, 86 on pressure support of 30,
PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 50%, tidal volumes of 800s, minute
ventilation 11.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit service for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.  It was thought that patient's tachypnea was
due to significant component of anxiety.  It was thought that
due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
the patient needed time to expire and due to the anxiety,
patient would air trap further.

The patient was placed on prn benzodiazepines which helped
with his anxiety, but not significantly.  The patient was
kept on azithromycin for his white blood cell count, and for
his bronchitis.  IV steroids were continued, salmeterol,
Flovent, albuterol, and Atrovent were continued as well.
Patient subsequently ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Beta blockers were held while he was in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare, and his rate subsequently was
brought under control with diltiazem.

Patient continued to do quite well.  Given the repetity of
the patient's hypoxia and his shortness of breath, a CTA was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolus.  CTA was negative.
Patient continued to have episodes of agitation and Versed
and Haldol boluses were given for agitation with good effect.

The patient was subsequently extubated and did quite well for
approximately two hours, but had to be reintubated again, the
thought secondary to laryngeal edema which was visualized by
ENT physicians.  The patient was placed in higher doses of IV
steroids to bring down the edema, and it was thought that
re-extubation could be tried in two or three more days.  The
patient was attempted to be extubated one more time and once
again, the patient was able to remain extubated for 2-3
hours, but became agitated and progressively very dyspneic
with respiratory rates reaching into the mid 30s, and the
patient was subsequently reintubated once again.

At this time, a family meeting was called between the
patient's wife, daughters, and the patient himself.  The
patient at that time expressed a wish to have treatment
discontinued if there was no hope of extubation since he did
not wish to live his life on a ventilator.  The patient's
primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] was consulted at that
time, since he knew this patient quite well.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]
discussed the case at length with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5817**], and it was
thought that patient might benefit from trache placement and
by slow weaning off the ventilator over the next 1-2 months,
and it was clearly made known that if the patient was not
able to wean off the ventilator, that the patient's request
to have the ventilator stopped would be honored.

Patient was to be transferred to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, where he was
to continue pulmonary rehabilitation, and hopefully to be
weaned off the ventilator.  Interventional Pulmonology team
saw the patient and placed the trache without difficulty, and
the patient was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2101-4-9**].

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital **]
Rehab, and was to be weaned off the ventilator over the next
month to two months.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient
