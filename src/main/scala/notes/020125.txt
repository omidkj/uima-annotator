Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis, ?pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid Bronchoscopy
Attempted bronchial artery embolization
Stereotactic Brain Biopsy

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 66 yo male with h/o htn, glucose
intolerance, recent dx of NSCLC who presents as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] for rigid bronchoscopy and possible embolization
for hemoptysis.
.
Briefly, he began coughing up small amounts of bright red blood
roughly three month ago. He started noticing streaks of blood in
his sputum which progressed to about nickel-sized bits of blood.
He was then referred for a CAT scan of his chest which revealed
a large right upper lobe spiculated mass suspicious for
malignancy. He has a history of COPD; however, has not been
severely affected by this and it does not seem to impede on his
daily activites. He has a 100-pack-year history of smoking and
has quit 10 years ago, and lost 25 lbs recently.
.
He was then referred for PET scan which was positive.
Subsequent bronch on [**2175-12-15**] at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed path consistent
with NSCLC.  He tolerated the procedure well, and then on
[**2175-12-19**] he began to develop more hemoptysis.  He decided to
drive himself to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, where he presented in
respiratory distress and was promptly intubated for airway
protection.  He became hypotensive in the setting of intubation
and sedation, and was started on Neosynephrine.
.
He was awaiting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and had imaging that showed
the mass and a RLL consolidation.  He spiked a fever on [**2175-12-21**],
and was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.  He had a left
IJ central line placed.  His neosynephrine was changed to
Levophed.  His levofloxacin was changed to pip/tazo.  His blood,
urine, and sputum were cultured with no growth at the time of
discharge.  There was a question of adrenal insufficiency, and
he was on decadron.  His [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was showed a good response,
so he was stopped today.
.
On arrival, he was sedated and intubated, without communicating
any complaints.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY:
CT Chest ([**12-23**]): FINDINGS: The right upper lobe mass has grown
from 2.8 x 4.2 cm to 4.3 x 5.7 cm, 2:14, with progressive
invasion of mediastinal fat, up to the trachea, esophagus, and
normal calibre, superior vena cava, and new occlusion of the
right upper lobe bronchus, 2:18, 22. The right upper lobe
pulmonary artery is more severely encased by the tumor and
significantly narrowed but not occluded. New right upper lobe
posterior segment consolidation and extensive ground glass
involving most of the anterior segment of right upper lobe might
represent post-obstruction pneumonia. Lingular atelectasis has
significantly progressed, although no endobronchial lesion is
demonstrated, 3:33.
New bilateral moderate nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusion
is accompanied by considerable bilateral relaxation atelectasis.
Heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates normal
liver, spleen, adrenals, tail of the pancreas and upper portion
of the kidney. There are no bone lesions suspicious for
malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant interval progression of the right upper lobe
tumor size, mediastinal, occlusion of the right upper lobe
bronchus obstruction and most likely obstructive pneumonia,
conceivably hemorrhage.
2. New moderate, bibasilar pleural effusion and severe
relaxation atelectasis.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, not significantly changed.
5. Coronary calcifications.
6. Emphysema.
.
CT Head ([**12-23**]): There is a roughly 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of
hypodensity (Hounsfield units 21) in the right medial
cerebellum. This area did not demonstrate FDG avidity on the
recent PET CT. On the current study, although it is difficult to
fully evaluate, there may be an 8-mm ring-enhancing nodule in
the central portion of this larger lesion. For example, please
series 6, image 7. No other areas concerning for enhancing
lesions are identified within the brain. There is no
hydrocephalus. There is no definite mass effect on the fourth
ventricle. The major vascular structures appear unremarkable.
Note is made of calcifications within the cavernous carotid
arteries bilaterally. No osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodensity in the medial right cerebellum, incompletely
evaluated. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium may be valuable
in further characterization.
.
Brain MRI ([**12-24**]): IMPRESSION:
1. 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar
hemisphere, with some perilesional edema, mild mass effect on
the adjacent portion of the fourth ventricle, representing
metastatic focus.
2. Increased signal in the internal auditory canals especially
the left internal auditory canal on the post-contrast sequence
(series 9, image 8) may partly be related to enhancement. Hence,
leptomeningeal enhancement cannot be excluded based on this
appearance. To correlate with LP if necessary and attention to
be paid to this on future followup scans.
3. Significant amount of fluid versus mucosal thickening
involving bilateral mastoid air cells.
.
Bronchial Artery Embolization ([**12-25**]): IMPRESSION: Thoracic
aortogram demonstrates a diffusely enlarged and tortuous aorta.
A selective right bronchial-intercostal arteriogram showed no
abnormal blush or extravasation. Several attempts were made to
advance a microcatheter into this artery, but were unsuccessful

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] was a 66-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of NSCLC
with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, who presented with hemoptysis
and respiratory failure, underwent bronchoscopy with
cauterization, was successfully extubated, and underwent
unsuccessful attempt at bronchial artery embolization [**2175-12-25**]
due to tortuous aorta.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient was previously intubated for
airwary protection at OSH in setting of hemoptysis assumed to be
from his known large lung mass.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
underwent rigid bronchoscopy.  [**Last Name (un) **] showed significant amounts
of clot in R bronchial tree, and he underwent removal of some
clots and cauterization of bleeding areas. He was extubated
[**12-23**].  He was found to have a RUL PNA on CT scan [**12-23**], which
was thought to be post-obstructive, and he was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn).  He continued to have
quarter size amount of hemoptysis with subjective SOB requiring
a N
