Date of Birth:   [**2096-12-5**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Company 191**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male with a history of alcohol abuse, ischemic/alcoholic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 25%
who was recently treated for left lower lobe pneumonia with
Levaquin and clarithromycin as an outpatient who presented to
[**Hospital6 256**] on [**2158-6-10**] for
lightheadedness, presyncope in the setting of diarrhea and
decreased po intake.

The patient had recently been admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] with suicidal ideation early
in [**Month (only) 547**].  He was sent to [**Hospital3 1196**] Inpatient
Psychiatric Unit and then was sent home.  During this time
period he was treated for left lower lobe pneumonia and was
on Levaquin from approximately [**5-15**] through [**5-22**]
and then on clarithromycin from [**5-22**] through [**5-26**].  It is unclear why the antibiotics were switched.  He
presented to [**Company 191**] on [**5-31**] complaining of loose bowel
movements.  At that time, he was requesting Imodium for his
diarrhea.  The physician who saw him at that time was
concerned about possible Clostridium difficile, as the
patient developed diarrhea in the setting of antibiotic use
and instead wanted the patient to give a stool sample.  The
patient refused at that time and began taking Imodium as an
outpatient.  At that time, he stated his cough and previous
pleuritic chest pain had resolved with his prior antibiotic
treatment.

The patient reported to [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Department on [**6-10**] complaining of
lightheadedness.  He was still having diarrhea and was now
complaining of right lower quadrant tenderness.  In the
Emergency Department, he was found to be hypotensive with
pressures in the 80s/50s.  His white count was elevated at
14.2 with 11% bands.  He was anemic with an elevated MCV in
the 110 range.  A urinalysis was negative except for ketones.
His chem-7 was unremarkable and electrocardiogram was without
acute changes.  Liver function tests were all within normal
limits except for an AST of 50.  The abdominal CT showed his
gallbladder to have an enhancing wall and a small amount of
pericholecystic fluid, but there was no intra or extrahepatic
ductal dilatation or stones.  He was started on dopamine,
given levofloxacin, Flagyl and Ativan and 4 liters of
intravenous fluids.  He was then admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  ETOH abuse with a history of multiple inpatient
detoxification attempts which have not been successful.  He
does have a history of DTs.
2.  Seizure disorder, both alcohol withdrawal as well as
epilepsy per patient.
3.  Coronary artery disease, status post non Q-wave
myocardial infarction x2 with a catheter in [**2157-4-7**]
which showed a 60% mid LAD lesion which was stented at that
time.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
5.  Hypercholesterolemia
6.  Suicidal ideation with past inpatient psychiatry
evaluation.
7.  Depression
8.  Multiple episodes of pneumonia in multiple lobes of both
lungs most likely secondary to aspiration events.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q day
2.  Atenolol 50 mg po q day
3.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day
4.  Depakote 1 gm po bid
5.  Zoloft 50 mg po q day
6.  Folic acid 1 mg po q day
7.  Thiamine 100 mg po q day
8.  Combivent
9.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS AN ALLERGY TO SULFA DRUGS WHICH
CAUSES A RASH.  IN ADDITION, THE PATIENT HAS HAD DELIRIUM IN
THE SETTING OF RECEIVING ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF
BENZODIAZEPINES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of tobacco use
approximately one to two packs per day.  He has a positive
alcohol use history, drinking between 0.5 to 1.5 pints of
hard liquor per day and he has no history of intravenous drug
use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.4??????, heart rate 102, blood
pressure 146/82 on 12 mcg per minute of dopamine, saturating
100% on 4 liters.
GENERAL:  The patient is a cachectic male, appearing older
than his stated age who was quite abrasive and uncooperative.
He was in no acute physical distress, however.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Mucous membranes dry.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact and the sclerae were anicteric.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  There were
normoactive bowel sounds.  There was no palpable
hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  They were
warm.  The DP pulses were intact bilaterally.
NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.
RECTAL:  OB+ negative stool per the Emergency Department
exam.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 14.2, hematocrit 33.2, MCV 107,
platelets 153.  Differential showed 11% bandemia.  INR was
1.2, PT 13.2, PTT 26.0.  Sodium 136, potassium 3.7, chloride
96, bicarbonate 27, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8, glucose 93,
calcium 9.5, phosphorus 3.3, magnesium 2.0.  Urinalysis was
negative except for ketones.  ALT was 24.  AST was 50.
Amylase was 43.  Total bilirubin was 1.2.  Lipase was 13.  CK
was 165 with an MB fraction of 2 and troponin was less than
0.3.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with
left axis deviation and T-wave inversions in leads 1 and 3
which were old compared with previous electrocardiogram.
Chest x-ray was performed which showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate which may have slight improvement compared to
prior chest x-ray in [**2158-5-8**].  There was a faint
nodular density in the right upper lobe.  Abdominal CT showed
consolidation in the left lower lobe.  There was no evidence
of acute appendicitis.  There was nonspecific pericholecystic
fluid without evidence of intraluminal stones or intra or
extrahepatic ductal dilatation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit service given his need for pressors at
the time of admission.  Overnight, on the first hospital day,
the dopamine was able to be quickly weaned off and the
patient remained hemodynamically stable after receiving
intravenous fluids.  His hematocrit decreased to 28.7 in the
setting of his hydration and baseline anemia most likely
secondary to his alcohol abuse and he received 1 unit of
packed red blood cells on [**2158-6-11**].  He was transferred
out to the general medical floor on the second hospital day
in stable condition without any specific complaints.

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had a history of a left lower
lobe pneumonia which appeared to be persistent on both the
chest x-ray and the chest CT.  The question of possible
postobstructive etiology was raised given that the infiltrate
has been persistent over several months.  The patient was
continued on the levofloxacin and Flagyl which had been
started in the Emergency Department.  He did not require
supplemental oxygen the entire time he was on the general
medical service and was saturating in the mid 90s on room
air.  He has been stable from a pulmonary standpoint and will
likely need a chest CT done as an outpatient with a possible
bronchoscopy to better evaluate the left lower lobe as well
as the nodular density which has been seen on multiple chest
x-rays and chest CTs over the past year as well.  Given the
patient's history of tobacco use, there was concern for
possible carcinoma.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of coronary
artery disease with low ejection fraction likely secondary to
both ischemic and alcohol cardiomyopathy.  His hypertension
rapidly improved with blood transfusion and intravenous
fluids.  He only required pressors very transiently.  On the
second hospital day, he was taking good po's and did not
require further intravenous fluids.  He at no time manifested
any symptoms of congestive heart failure.  He was continued
on his aspirin and Lipitor throughout his hospital course for
his coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia.  His
atenolol and lisinopril were originally held given his
hypotension.  His atenolol was restarted on
