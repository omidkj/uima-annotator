pain but without chest pain, palpitations, nausea or dizziness.
SOB not ameliorated by SL NTG x2, but did improve with

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2154-11-24**] 3:15 PM

 [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with tissue AVR

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for effusion or infiltrate
Final Report
There is probable background COPD. The patient is status post
sternotomy,
with apparent radiolucent prosthetic valve. The ascending aorta
is prominent.
The hila are prominent, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. There
is upper
zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There are small right
greater than
left pleural effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
consolidation. There is mild wedging of a mid-to-lower thoracic
vertebral body with degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+)

MITRAL VALVE: No MVP. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions
Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
restriction of the posterior leaflet that results in 2+ to 3+ MR
depending on loading conditions. The MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] at one point
worsening to 4+ MR with high PA pressures briefly and then got
back to baseline findings with normal PA pressures and 3+ MR at
worst.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
Post CPB:
The cardiac output is 3.1L/min on phenylephrine gtt with atrial
pacing.
There is moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation with BP 100/50.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position, with a mean gradient of 7mmHg.
The biventricular systolic function is preserved.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
