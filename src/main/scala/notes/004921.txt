Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48M w/ Down's syndrome, ESRD on HD, DM2, SVC sydnrome on
anticoagulation, gallstones transferred from OSH with N/V,
abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and fever, concerning for SIRS and
cholangitis.  His code status was temporarily reversed for ERCP.
 He was electively intubated and had 1 ERCP with temporary
improvement.  However, he again deteriorated and required second
ERCP.  He then became bacteremic with pan-resistant Klebsiella,
thought to be from dialysis line.  This was changed, and the new
line could not function as well as the former because of poor
venous anatomy.  Due to persistent bacteremia, sepsis,
hypotension, and inability to attain further dailysis access,
decision was made to transition patient to CMO.  He subsequently
expired after withdrawal of the ventilator.
