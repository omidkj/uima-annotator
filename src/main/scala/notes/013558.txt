[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   82 year old man with s/p sternal plating
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluation for ptx and effusion
Final Report CHEST
HISTORY: Sternal plating, evaluate for pneumothorax.
AP and lateral views. Comparison with [**2163-5-25**]. There is
continued evidence
of small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. There
is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent with
atelectasis or consolidation as before. The left heart border is
obscured. The heart appears large.
Mediastinal structures are unchanged in appearance. Multiple
surgical clips are scattered about the mediastinum. Four
metallic clips are present in the sternum as demonstrated
previously. A left PICC line can be followed to the level of the
right atrium.
Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant
change.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for sternal drainage following
AVR/CABG. He had been on Coumadin so his INR was corrected and
he was brought to the operating room on [**5-24**] for sternal
debridement and Talon plating with pectoral muscle advancement.
Please see operative report for details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU
after completion. He did well in the immediate post-operative
period and was extubated shortly after arrival. He remained in
the ICU on POD1 to monitor his renal function(CRI-baseline Cr
1.9)creatine rose to 2.8 on day of surgery. By POD2 it was
improving and he was transferred to the stepdown floor. Once on
the floor his post-op course was uneventful. Culture data was
positive for rare growth of PROPIONIBACTERIUM ACNES, infectious
disease service was consulted and he will be treated with
Vancomycin for 6-8 weeks. During hospital stay the patient had a
corneal abrasion , opthamology was consulted and treatment
instituted. Additionally he had periods of intermittant atrial
fibrillation that were rate controlled with Amiodarone and beta
blockers. He was also anticoagulated with Coumadin.
The patient was not started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] or ACE inhibitor for his
heart failure as his BP was not adequate and his elevated
creatinine was still resolvoving. Consider instituting this
therapy as his condition continues to improve.
He worked with physical therapy and on POD8 he was transferred
to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **].
