.
Urinalysis negative on admission
.
EKG 08/[**0-0-**]: Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy. Left
anterior fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block.
.
Xray femur/pelvis, right [**2119-9-12**]:
Minimally displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal
right femur. Prominent multilevel degenerative changes of the
lower lumbar spine
.
[**2119-9-15**]: Video swallow evaluation: Recommended thin liquids
and regular consistency solids.  Assist with feedings as needed,
pills to be given whole with thin liquids.
.
Echocardiogram [**2119-9-12**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size and regional/global systolic function
are normal (LVEF >55%) Right  ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve  leaflets are mild to
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis  (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild valvular aortic stenosis. At least moderate
pulmonary
hypertension with normal right ventricular systolic function.
Preserved
regional/global biventricular systolic function.

[**2119-9-26**] Chest xray:
FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph shows no
significant
radiographic change in bibasilar consolidation over the past
five days.
Right-sided PICC line tubing ends at the level of the mid
superior vena cava.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours including
slightly hazy fullness in perihilar vasculature are unchanged.
There is slight narrowing and leftward deviation of the trachea
at the thoracic inlet, unchanged.  Prominent S-shaped scoliosis
is noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessement/Plan:
[**Age over 90 **] yo blind, Russsian speaking F with HTN and significant hx for
smoking was admitted s/p mechanical fall, suffered a right hip
fracture and underwent right hip [**Age over 90 24785**]. She tolerated the
procedure well requiring 2U blood transfusion, however post op
course was complicated by confusion, agitation as well as
pneumonia/hypoxia requiring transfer to the ICU.  In the setting
of hypoxia/pneumonia she also went into atrial fibrillation,
which has since resolved. Was oxygenated using NRB, did not
require Bipap or intubation. After stabilization, she was
transferred back to the floor, where she remained stable until
discharge.
.
# R hip fracture s/p [**Age over 90 24785**]- R hip incision site was monitored for
signs of infection; did not have drainage or erythema during
duration of hospitalization. The staples were eventually removed
and replaced with steristrips which are to be left in place
until they fall off. Physical therapy was consulted to work with
pt on her strength training, gait and mobility. We provided
adequate pain control for the patient initially with oxycodone
as needed, then standing tylenol as well as Lidocaine patches
were added for the comfort of the patient.  By the time of
discharge she was no longer requiring prn oxycodone.  She was
continued on renally dosed Lovenox throughout hospitalization
for prevention of DVT in setting of hip fracture.  Lovenox will
be stopped on [**2119-10-10**] to complete 4 week post fracture course.
She was discharged to acute rehab for continued physical and
occupational therapy prior to D/C home.  She has follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] scheduled.
.
# MICU course: On [**2119-9-21**], POD #9 [**Name (NI) 24785**], pt was noted to be more
somnolent with an O2 saturation of 82% on RA, she had increased
O2 requirement up to NRB facemask. Her saturations then rose to
97%, however blood gas at 6L NC showed PaO2 of 53. Pt was
transfered to the MICU for further monitoring. She did not
require intubation, however she developed atrial fibrillation
which was rate controlled with Diltiazem. Her therapy for
pneumonia was also continued at this time. Once stable she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for further monitoring.
.
# Aspiration pneumonia/hospital acquired: Sputum grew out gram
negative rods postop and she was started on Levaquin for a 7day
course. However, she decompensated with hypoxia requiring
transfer to the unit before the therapy was completed. She was
started on Vancomycin/Flagyl in addition to Levaquin. Vancomycin
was discontinued after 4days of therapy, however the other
antibiotics were to be continued to complete a 2wk course. Prior
to discharge she was saturating well at 93-94% on room air.
Given her extensive smoking hx nebulizers were administered and
will be continued until post pneumonia wheezing resolves. She
continued to improve as evidence by the decline of leukocytosis,
as well as improvement in her oxygen saturation.
.
# Agitation/delirium: Progressively worsened after hip surgery
in the setting of blindness as well as being Russian speaking
only. Also, age and given that she was in a strange environment,
agitation was to be expected.  She was managed with Zyprexa
initially then small doses of haldol IV, also required a family
member to be at bedside to help orient pt. We also tried to
limit lines and tubes by discontinuing her telemetry and foley
when it was appropriate. At time of discharge, acute agitation
resolved and she was more oriented and according to family close
to her baseline.
.
# Anemia: Most likely related to surgery. Guaiac stool negative
during admission. Required transfusions only in the immediate
post operative phase. There was no evidence of active bleeding
at any time. There was however, a large area of ecchymosis,
?resolving hematoma around area of surgery R hip; did not
increase in size.  Hematocrit remained stable through remainder
of hospitalization.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Developed after [**Hospital **] transfer to the
MICU. Most likely in the setting of pneumonia/hypoxia and s/p
surgery.  EKG did not show evidence of ischemia. Diltiazem was
initially started at 30 QID, then titrated up to 60mg QID.
Changed to long acting diltiazem 240mg daily prior to discharge
to simplify her medication regimen. She remained rate controlled
on this regimen. Given age and fall risk, pt not considered a
good candidate for anticoagulation therapy.
.
# Acute renal failure: Unsure of pt's baseline, however admitted
with Cr 1.6. Worsened slightly in light of surgery, hypovolemia,
and infection however continued to improve during admission. Cr.
is now stable at 1.2 at discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was initially on Lisinopril 40mg on
admission, however, we continued Diltiazem, also for rate
control.  Patients primary care doctor may decide to restart
lisinopril after discharge.
.
#Urinary Retention/Incontinence - developed prior to D/C of
foley.  Prior to admission she had no problems wi
