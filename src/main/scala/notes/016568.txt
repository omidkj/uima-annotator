History of Present Illness:
47 year old male with HTN, DM, ESRD on PD presenting with acute
onset myalgias, fevers/chills, cough since Tuesday, [**1-29**].  He
arrived around 9 am with temp 100.0, HR 96, BP 180s, O2 96% RA.
He was treated with several antiemetics without resolution of
nausea.  Initial CXR in the ED was without infiltrate.  H
received 1 liter normal saline and Influenza dfa ordered.  ECG
showed peaked T V2-V4, K 5.3, Kayexelate ordered.  Patient
unable to tolerate any po, therefore, bed request placed 11:30
am.
He was noted to be spitting up coffee-ground in clear fluid,
complaining of nausea, but not able to vomit. Vitals at that
time; HR 120s, SBP 160, Temp 101.6.  Rectal exam was significant
for strongly guaiac positive green stool. T/S, rpt HCT sent, IVF
increased, IV PPI started and GI contact[**Name (NI) **]. GI fellow
recommended serial HCT, IV PPI, NPO and re-eval in AM, no need
for urgent endoscopy with gastritis vs. [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] as the
leading possibilities.  Further history from patient indicates
vomiting X 10-14 times in last 24-36 hours--clear with small
specks of blood most recently. He was spitting up clear fluid
heavy with dark specks/coffee grounds. After the influenza came
back positive, Tamiflu was ordered at 75 mg/day given renal
insufficiency.  O2 sat checked and found to be 85% on RA, 94% on
3L.  Pt put on monitor, tachycardic to 120s-130s, SBP 160-180.
PCP notified of change.  The patient was then found to be
satting in the mid 80s on 3L, with no change on increase to 5L.
His O2 sat remained 97-90 on NRB and was febrile and
hypertensive to 204/100, cxr showed new infiltrate.   He was
intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, post itubation X ray
showed worsening bilateraly infiltrates.  Patient given 1 gram
vancomycin with plan to follow levels, 1 gram ceftriaxone and
500 mg Azithromycin--ID contact[**Name (NI) **] for abx choice--chosen because
influenza usually complicated by staph or strep.The renal team
was contact[**Name (NI) **] re: peritoneal dialysis. CTA considered, but given
clear alternate explanation, ongoing evidence of GIB and ESRD/PD
requirement, not performed.  OGT placed, pt given tylenol, the
kayexelate (ordered earlier), and tamiflu.  [**Name (NI) 38120**], pt
remained hypertensive, given several propofol doses then 100 mcg
of fentanyl with improvement to SBP 110s. HR remained 110s,
fluid running at 250 cc/hr. Had received 3 liters total prior to
transfer to MICU.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2193-1-31**] 7:49 PM
The ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
passes the diaphragm with the side hole in the proximal stomach
with the tip most likely in the mid distal stomach. A rapid
development of bibasal opacities can be consistent with rapidly
progressing pulmonary edema, or rapidly developing pulmonary
infection which should be considered in giving the clinical
information and normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. No
appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated. There is no
pneumothorax. The upper lungs are clear.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2193-1-31**] 10:54 AM
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There are no pleural
effusions. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
Mild degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
.
Bronchial lavage [**2-7**]:
ATYPICAL.
Atypical epithelial cells in a background of abundant
macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. (See note.)
Note: Few large crowded groups of epithelial cells with enlarged
nuclei and prominent nucleoli are seen. In this patient's
clinical setting , a reactive process is favored; however,
clinical correlation is required.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2193-2-6**] 2:53 PM
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: A new right PICC is seen with its tip
terminating just below the cavoatrial junction.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is slight interval
improvement in bibasilar patchy opacities, right greater than
left. No sizable pleural effusion is seen. There is no
pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures stable.
IMPRESSION: Right PICC terminating just below the cavoatrial
junction. Interval improvement of bibasilar parenchymal
consolidation reflecting improving aspiration or pneumonia.
