Pertinent Results:
[**2140-10-17**] Intraop TEE
PRE-CPB:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15
%). After an epinephrine infusion was started, the EF increased
to 20 %.
4. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
9. There is a small pericardial effusion.
10. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.

POST-CPB:
On infusions of phenylephrine, epi. AV pacing. Well-seated valve
in the aortic position. No AI. Preserved systolic function from
pre cpb on inotropic support. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2140-10-17**] Ms.[**Known lastname 87874**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent Aortic Valve Replacement (#[**Street Address(2) 6158**].[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent
Mechanical Valve Replacement) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please refer to
operative report for further details. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and
sedated requiring inotropic and pressor support. She awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty. She
transferred to the floor on [**2140-10-19**] in stable condition.  On
[**2140-10-21**] she was transferred back to the CVICU for hypotension,
hyperkalemia and Cre 1.5.  PA line, foley and low-dose milrinone
started.  Echocardiogram revealed EF 20-25%, no tamponade, AVR
well seated, with moderate TR/MR.  Over the next few days she
titrated off inotropes, tolerated low-dose ACE and
beta-blockers.  She was transferred back to the floor on
[**2140-10-27**].

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive
spirometer and ambulation she titrated off oxygen with
saturations of 97% RA.

Cardiac: beta-blockers were titrated.  She remained in sinus
rhythm. ACE was started on [**2140-10-20**], transfer to CVICU on
[**2140-10-21**].  On [**2140-10-23**] episode of Atrial Fibrillation 140's
amiodarone bolus and beta-blockers IV converted to sinus rhythm.
 Inotropes was titrated off, carvediolol and ACE were titrated.

GI: H2 blockers and bowel regimen

Nutrition; tolerated a regular diet

Renal: ATN briefly secondary to hypotension and hyperkalemia,
peak Cre 1.8 base 0.9-1.0 resolved once hemodynamics improved.
She was gentley diuresed with good urine output.  Electrolytes
were repleted as needed.

Heme: Heparin bridge to coumadin was started [**2140-10-20**] for
mechanical aortic valve replacement with INR Goal 2.5 - 3.0. INR
was followed daily.

IV access: Right Brachial PICC placed [**2140-10-27**].

Pain: IV pain medications converted to PO with good control

Disposition: followed by PT who deemed her safe for home.  She
was discharged on [**10-31**] and will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and PCP for further coumadin
management.
