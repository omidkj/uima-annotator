Active Diagnoses:

1. Acute blood loss anemia with acute GI bleeding: There are
likley two sources of bleeding in this patient. One upper
(possibly AVM or Dieulafoy's lesion) that is the likely cause of
her melanotic stools, and one lower, possibly diverticular
disease. Colonoscopy, which was only completed to the
mid-transverse colon, showed multiple diverticula of the
descending and transverse colon. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable while on the floor and was restarted on
all her home medications prior to discharge.

2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: While pt's home metoprolol was
being held [**2-4**] concern for masking tachycardia she went into
A-fib with RVR. Metoprolol was restarted and she has been in NSR
since.

Chronic Diagnoses:

3. HTN: Pt was normotensive initially, but became hypertensive
on the floor. Her home medications were all restarted.

4. DM: Held glyburide but was restarted on discharge

5. HL: Home simvastatin was continued

Transitional Issues: Pt will be discharged home with close
follow up with her PCP and GI. She was restarted on her home
meds prior to discharge. She lives with her husband and is fully
