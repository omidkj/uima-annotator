History of Present Illness:
78 year-old woman with hypothyroidism, hypertension, diastolic
CHF, liver disease, history of colitis and diverticulitis
transferred from OSH for GI bleed and new ascites. Patient has a
3 month history of nausea,vomiting and diarrhea (3 times a day
for 3 months) with occasional blood in vomit and stool. Also
progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. No sick contacts,
no recent antibiotics or travel. No abdominal pain. Also
distended abdomen over last few days. Per family and patient,
liver disease is new but per GI note from OSH past work-up for
liver disease ([**2169**] at [**Hospital1 1774**]).
.
Pt went to referring institution on [**10-25**], found to have Hct of
24, acute renal failure and elevations in LFTs.  Per verbal
report and notes, patient had intermittent bright red blood per
rectum.  She received at least 4 units of packed red cells with
hematocrit remaining stable. EGD showed only esophagitis. Tagged
RBC scan unrevealing. She was administered and IV proton pump
inhibitor and octreotide drip.  Lactulose started for altered
mental status and high ammonium. Creatinine came down from up to
4 to 1.5 with IV crystalloid and blood. Abdominal CT revaled
ascites. Paracentesis was performed and peritoneal fluid showed
no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Family requested
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care on [**10-30**].
.
On transfer, she was hemodynamically stable but actively
bleeding from below. Octreotide drip was running at 5 mcg/hr.
.
ROS: On admission, she denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
chest pain, abdominal pain, dizziness. Otherwise positive as
above

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old woman with transferred from outside hospita; for GIB
and new ascites.  Initially admitted to medical ICU and
transferred to liver service on [**2172-11-3**] for further management
of liver disease.
.
# Gastrointestinal Bleed: Presented with bright red blood per
rectum and thought to have an upper GI bleed.  However, she
subsequently had several episodes of melena during the
hospitalization in the MICU.  At OSH received 4 units of PRBC's
for a hematocrit of 24.  At [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent inpatient EGD
and which revealed portal hypertensive gastropathy, a hiatal
hernia, schatzki's ring, and NO esophageal varices. Colonoscopy
revealed sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of bleeding.
Once on the medical floor her hematocrit remained stable.
.
# Liver disease / cryptogenic cirrhosis
Patient had prior work-up at [**Hospital1 1774**] which concluded possible iron
overload versus alcohol-induced hepatic cirrhosis.  At the
referring institution she underwent diagnostic paracentesis
which reportedly showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.  On exam she was icteric, had asterixis and
fluctuating mental status consistent with hepatic
encephalopathy. Iron studies were consistent with iron overload.
 Hemochromatosis gene study was sent and is pending at the time
of this note.  Hepatitis panel was positive for hepatitis A
antibodies but negative for hepatitis B or C exposure.  [**Doctor First Name **] /
AMA / Anti-smooth antibodies were negative.  On the liver
service she was started on lactulose and rifaximin.  For her
ascites, she was started on spironalactone and furosemide.  For
her varices she was started on low dose nadalol.  On the liver
service paracentesis on was repeated on [**2172-11-5**] and was not
consistent with SBP. Her INR remained elevated and platelets low
but stable for both.
.
#Septic Shock- On Hospital day 7, patient was noted to have
decreased urine output, hypotension to a nadir of 50s-70s
systolic at which time she was transferred to the MICU for
further management. A right internal jugular venous line was
placed emergently for fluid resuscitation as well as
administration of pressors. She was intubated for respiratory
distress. Putative sources of sepsis included pulmonary
(nosocomial vs. aspiration pneumonia), urinary and
gastrointestinal (given recent procedures and possible bacterial
translocation). She was started on vancomycin,
piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole to cover for these
potential sources.  Despite maximum doses of four pressors her
blood pressure continued to remain low.  Blood cultures came
back positive 4/4 bottles for gram negative rods. Urine culture
grew 10,000-100,000 gram negative rods. Peritoneal fluid culture
demonstrated no growth.  Despite aggressive resuscitative
measures, she demonstrated progressively worsening hemodynamics,
tissue hypoxia and end-organ dysfunction. She was made DNR. She
expired on [**2172-11-7**] following cardiopulmonary arrest.
