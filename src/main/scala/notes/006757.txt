Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year-old male with a history of NSCLA lung cancer
with brain mets, known pontine lesion, who presents with hypoxia
and worsening L sided weakness (arm, leg and facial droop).
Patient was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the ED by his wife after she noted
worsening left sided weakness on the am of admission that has
been progressing over the last week. When she was unable to get
him out of bed, she called EMS.
.
Of note, patient was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2152-9-7**] for left arm
weakness and reported coughing episodes with liquids. During
that visit, his PCP noted more slurred speech and was suspicious
for aspiration. An outpatient MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 93516**] his known pontine
lesion was scheduled for the day of admission and an outpatient
speech and swallow was planned. His wife noted that he had a
persistent cough w/sputum production last week which she feels
is improved over the past few days. There have been no fevers or
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He has urinary frequency at
baseline.
.
In the ED, VS T 99 HR 77 BP 99/67 RR 20 POx 87% on RA which
improved with NRB to 100%. A Head CT was negative for acute
change.  A CTA demonstrated multifocal PNA for which he received
a dose of cefepime and levofloxacin. It was negative for PE.
.
ROS: The patient [**Last Name (Titles) **] any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, headache, rash or
skin changes.

Pertinent Results:
=========
[**Month/Day (1) **]
=========

Ct head [**9-14**] - IMPRESSION:  1. No new focus of edema or other
acute intracranial abnormalities
identified.
2. The known right pontine lesion is better visualized on MRI.
MRI is more
sensitive in the detection of mass lesion.

CTA chest [**9-14**] - IMPRESSION:
1. New air space consolidation involving the right upper and
left lower
lobes. As these findings were not present on [**2152-8-17**], this
findings are
most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
2. Stable emphysema and post-surgical changes of right lower
lobectomy.
3. Right upper lobe nodules, not changes, suggestive of small
airways
infection.

hip x-ray - no evidence of acute fracture

forearm x-ray - IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or
dislocation

[**9-14**] chest x-ray IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe patchy opacity
concerning for pneumonia. Second ill-defined focus in the right
upper lobe may represent a second focus of infection.

Brief Hospital Course:

# LLL PNA/Aspiration - Per wife, multiple coughing episodes with
liquids over last 2 weeks, though believes cough worst last
week. Likely etiology of aspiration in the setting of
progressive neurological decline. Patient was on levofloxacin
and flagyl for a few days, but stopped on [**9-17**] when CXR
demonstrated a rapid resolution of right sided opacity unlikely
to be consistent with infectious etiology. Patient was not
febrile and did well without antibiotics. He passed his speech
and swallow evaluation, and no specific dietary restrictions
were given.
.
# Nonsmall cell lung cancer with known pontine mass: New left
sided weakness, slurred speech, multiple neurologic
abnormalities concerning for worsening metastatic disease. MRI
did not demonstrate worsening disease. Patient was kept on
steroids in house and discharged on steroids to be followed up
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26981**] to discuss steroid taper as an outpatient.
.
# Oral Thrush: Likely [**1-29**] long-standing steroids. Continued on
nystatin swish and swallow.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Off from baseline at 77. INR 1.1. DIC labs
negative. No transfusions were necessary during hospital stay.
Platelet count trended up until discharge to 171.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued outpatient regimen of thyroid
replacement.
.
# Depression/Anixety: Continued paroxetine and held Clonazepam
given confusion.
.
# CAD s/p CABG [**2139**], EF of 20-30% [**3-4**] by echo: No evidence of
chest pain or volume overload. Dig level therapeutic and digoxin
was continued. Held aspirin in setting of thrombocytopenia, but
restarted at discharge. Continued propanolol while in house.
.
# H/o Non sustained VT: Continued Amiodarone and monitored on
telemetry without event.
.
# Code:  DNR/DNI
