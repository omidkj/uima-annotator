Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
bilateral arm paresthesias

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
81 yo F w/ HTN, DM, chronic constipation, hyperchol, p/w
bilateral arm pain. In ED had CTA which ruled out dissection.
While getting scanned became increasingly SOB and hypoxic to
60-70%s; n/v with possible aspiration vs. flash pulmonary edema.
 Pt was intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia and sent
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; had a difficult intubation. Was given lasix o/n for
possible flash pulm edema and abx for aspiration PNA.  In the
[**Name (NI) 153**], pt was diuresed for pulmonary edema, CE were checked and
she ruled in (peak tnt=0.72, peak CK=524); enzymes are now
trending down.  Pt with possible ST elevations in precordial
leads, and TTE showed EF=60%, moderat PE systolic HTN, and could
not exclude focal wall motion abnormalities.  Pt was seen by
cardiology who recommended non-invasive cardiac testing as an
initial evaluation. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] (extubated,
doing well from respiratory standpoint) for pharmacologic stress
test.  Other important events in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] included sputum
positive for MRSA (pt now on Vanco) and Hct drop (?unexplained).


On admission to [**Name (NI) 196**], pt denies any symptoms at this time; no
cp/sob/n/v/f/c; she does not remember much of her course in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/whether she had chest pain at any time.  She does state
that she has a cough, non-productive.  Pt transferred to floor
for P-mibi and possible intervention based on the results of
this test.

[**12-8**]:
P-MIBI:.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild, reversible apical perfusion defect. 2)
Normal wall
motion.  Comparison is made to prior study of [**2113-3-30**]. The
apical defect does not appear significantly changed in the
interval


Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1. Resp failure: pt initially intubated in ED following episode
in CT scanner.  CXR c/w asymmetric pulmonary edema vs. PNA, so
pt was started on aggressive diuresis and covered w/ ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  Respiratory failure felt to be secondary to
acute onset pulmonary edema from bolus IV contrast injection.
Following admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] patient remained relatively
hypotensive, requiring pressors and volume support to defend
blood pressure.  Weaned off pressors on HD1, but remained on
vent, undergoing active diuresis. Received significant amounts
of fluids during hypotensive episode and was net 3L positive on
[**12-6**].  Has been undergoing active diuresis, responding to Lasix
40mg IV.  On the morning of [**12-6**] the patient self extubated,
but has done well from a respiratory standpoint since that time.
 Upon transfer to the floor, diuresis was continued with IV
lasix prn, with goal of 500-1000cc negative per day.  Her NC O2
was weaned as tolerated, and she had no complaints of shortness
of breath.  Lasix should be continued at 40 mg QD, and volume
status should be maintained as negative.  Lung exam should be
monitored to ensure that she is not developing increased
crackles on exam/pulmonary edema.  The lasix should be continued
until she follows up with her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] that she is on lasix,
her electrolytes should be checked and repleted as necessary.
2. Subendocardial ischemia: following bolus of IV contrast dye
in the CT suite, the patient developed significant anterior ST
depressions and subsequently evolved troponins, peaking on [**12-3**]
at 0.72.  Cardiology was consulted and felt that the event was
diastolic HF leading to ischemia as opposed to a primary ACS,
since the patient had been having symptoms for 24 hours prior to
admission and had not produced positive cardiac enzymes.  Pt
received 48 h of heparin via gtt, but was dc'd secondary to drop
in platelets, nadiring at 119 on [**12-5**] (HIT cked and was
negative).  She was continued on ASA/BB/Statin.  On [**12-6**],
secondary to ongoing elevated bp, the patient was started on
captopril and both her ACEI and BB were titrated up.  On [**12-7**],
the patient was started on norvasc for additional BP control and
for the beneficial effects of Ca channel blockade on systolic
HTN.  Metoprolol, amlodipine, and lisinopril were titrated up as
needed for goal SBP 140-150.  Her blood pressure should continue
to improve as cardiac/respiratory issues continue to resolve.
BP meds should not be titrated up further.  P-MIBI was unchanged
from prior study in [**2115**], and cardiology did not feel that she
need further workup/intervention.  She is discharged on beta
blocker/ACE/ASA/statin.

4. MRSA [**Name (NI) **] unclear if CXR really c/w PNA, but given high risk
and positive sputum culture for PNA felt that patient would
benefit from 10d course of Vancomycin.  Day 1 was [**12-3**], so
vancomycin should be continued to [**12-14**]. Tip of left subclavian
catheter was also sent for culture when the line was removed on
[**12-9**], and was negative (but pending) at time of discharge.  If
culture becomes positive, [**Hospital 100**] rehab will be notified.

5. DM: initially started on insulin gtt, stopped [**12-5**],
maintained on SS.  Started on low dose Glargine for improved
control w/ goal of bs 120.  On the floor, her glyburide and
metformin were restarted, glargine 10 qhs was continued, and she
was covered with sliding scale.  Her blood sugars remain high on
discharge, but they should improve (oral hypoglycemics restarted
day of discharge).  She should have fingersticks QID at rehab
and covered with sliding scale reg
