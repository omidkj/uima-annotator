Brief Hospital Course:
70 YO male with hx of pancreatic cancer since [**12-12**], s/p
multiple CBD stents, admitted to Geriatric Medicine with
abdominal pain and N/V. His abdominal pain was considered to
likely be multifactorial from pancreatic ca, ischemia/SMA and
partial gastric outlet obstruction by tumor. Repeat CT showed
enlarged mass encasing hepatic artery and SMA. Patient went for
EGD/duodenal stent placement on [**9-2**] complicated by
post-procedure SOB and abdominal pain concerning for
perforation.  He then underwent exploratory laparotomy where no
perforation was identified and a feeding G-J tube and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 53961**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
drain were placed.  Please see OP report for details.

Post-operatively the patient remained intubated for low O2
saturations and was admitted to the SICU.  He was empiracally
treated with Levofloxacin/Flagyl and his pain was
well-controlled.  Patient was extubated on the evening on POD 1
and did well.  He was started on tube feeds.  On POD 4 he was
transferred to the floor.  His O2 sats were intermittantly low
in the 80s-90s on nasal cannula, consistent with his severe
COPD.  He tolerated tube feeds at goal and was able to be
discharged to rehab on POD 6.
