Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath / Transfer for Percutaneous Cardiac
Intervention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2200-5-21**]:
COMMENTS:     1. Initial angiography in this right-dominant
circulation was limited to the left coronary artery. The LM was
normal but short.  The LAD stent was widely patent and the LAD,
diagonals all had mild luminal irregularity. The LC had
extensive diffuse proximal and mid vessel disease up to 90-95%.
The ostium of OM2 had a 95% focal stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure of
136/32.
Right heart cath pressures as noted. C.O was 4.5
3. Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal and mid LCx with

overlapping 2.5x28,2.5x28 and 2.5x12mm mini -vision stents
respectively in the mid,mid and proximal Lcx. Successful poba
ofthe OM2 ostium. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis in the lcx, 40% residual in OM2, no angiographically
apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. The patient left the lab
intubated and in unchanged clinical condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful ptca and stenting of LCx
3. Successful POBA of the OM2

Cardiac Cath:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful ptca and stenting of LCx
3. Successful POBA of the OM2
.
Surface ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferior,
inferolateral, and anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with normal wall motion. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital course by systems as outlined below:
1) Cardiovascular:
The patient was admitted intubated from [**Hospital **] Hospital for
percutaneous cardiac intervention.  She underwent
catheterization on [**5-21**] and received a bare metal stent to the L
circumflex artery and balloon angioplasty to the obtuse marginal
II artery.  Following the intervention she was chest pain free
but showed persistant ST-T abnormalities on ECG. She is
discharged on medical regimen with ASA, plavix, statin, beta
[**Last Name (un) 26914**] and ACE-Inhibitor. See above for cath and ECHO reports.

.
2) Respiratory failure: We were able to extubate patient with
aggressive preload and afterload reduction with increased
BBlocker, nitro drip, morphine, lasix and non-rebreather mask.
Upon discharge patient was weaned off nitro drip and
supplemental oxygen. We also treated her for Klebsiella
pneumonia. She will need to finish a 14-day course of
levofloxacin. Patient is afebrile.
Patient tends to develop flash pulmonary edema in setting of
uncontrolled hypertension. She had several episodes of acute
dyspnea which were treated with IV morphine, nitro, and lasix.
Therefore, tight blood pressure control is essential for her
respiratory status. Her blood pressure medication can be
increased as tolerated. Renal funtion monitoring prior to
increasing lisinopril.
.
3) Anemia: Hematocrit stable here between 27-30. Will need more
work-up as outpatient.
.
4) Renal failure: likely intrinsic etiology. Creatinine now
trending down. Monitor renal function.
.
5) Nutrition: Patient seen after extubation by speech and
swallow service. Recommendation: nectar consistancy to avoid
aspiration. [**Month (only) 116**] re-evaluate in ~ 2 weeks.
.
6) Access: PICC line.
