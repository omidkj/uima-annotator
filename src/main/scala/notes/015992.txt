History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 33561**] is an Arabic only speaking man with a PMHx of HTN,
dCHF, stage 5 CKD not on HD and history of urosepsis who was
admitted last evening from PCP's office with low grade temps,
leukocytosis.  He had presented there with complaints of 2 days
of severe heartburn, minimally responsive to maalox/ranitidine
as well as urinary incontinence, hematuria, polyuria, malaise
and weakness. Per his wife he was "not himself." Per daughter
this was similary to prior presentations where he was admitted
with urosepsis.  No recent diarrhea, sick contacts, recent
antibiotics. No known flu exposures. On presentation to the ED
he was afebrile initially at 98.6 with temp increasing to 100.9
HR 106 BP 116/66 RR 22 100% RA.  He had blood and urine cultures
taken.  His UA had bacteria, blood, tr leuks and some epis.  His
CXR did not show any infiltrate, there was a question of a right
pleural effusion.  He was given levofloxacin and tylenol in
setting of leukocytosis to 21.5 and low grade fever. His ECG
showed sinus tach with some rate related ST depressions.  CEs
flat.  He was admitted to the medicine service for further work
up and monitoring; with a plan for continuing the levofloxacin
apparently for a ? + UA and ruling him out.
.
At approximately 4am the evening of admission he was triggered
with temp to 104.2 with rigoring, tachypnea to 38 and
tachycardia in the 130s.  He was inially sating in the mid-high
90s on RA but desatted to mid to high 80s, was placed on NC 4L
02.  He was given 250cc NS on the floor. The patient's wife was
at bedside, also Arabic only speaking, his daughter was called
and acted as interpreter.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes the patient complained
of L breast pain as well as "pins and needles coming and going".
 Per phone discussion with daughter as well as patient and wife,
pt who was initially documented as DNR/DNI reversed his code
status to FULL and was agreeable to invasive access and
intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o male with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney
disease, prior admissions for urosepsis, VRE carrier who was
admitted to the MICU status post septic shock/respiratory
failure for emphysematous gall bladder, presently awaiting
cholecystectomy on IV antibiotics.

# Sepsis/leukocytosis ?????? pt presented with high fevers, rigors,
tachypnea, WBC initially 21, and rising lactate to 4.3.
Abdominal CT showed air in gallbladder wall, bedside
percutaneous gallbladder drain placed by IR [**5-29**]. MRCP showed no
surrounding fluid collection or ductal dilation. Bile output
with various GNR and GNC, also with prevotella bacteremia [**5-29**]
with many negative blood cultures in subsequent days. Initally
started on daptomycin (hx of VRE), cefepime, flagyl, and cipro.
Completed 6 days of daptomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. Biliary
fluid was positive for pan-sensitive Enterococcus. As such, ID
recommended d/c'ing all previous Abx and simply using zosyn. Pt
did also have one positive blood culture for prevotella. He was
transferred to the floor on zosyn. Lactate and t. bili corrected
throughout his stay. Surgery has been following and the overall
plan is for cholecystectomy in several weeks. Abx to continue up
until surgery.

Pt's WBC peaked at 24, but was wnl (5.9) on discharge. A CT of
his abdomen was performed [**2166-6-8**] for concern for increasing
distention. It showed the the cholecystotomy tube was no longer
in the gallbladder. The cholecystotomy tube was replaced and
pt's abdomen became less distended.

# Respiratory Failure - pt was intubated throughout his sepsis.
Was weaned without difficulty and was on minimal NC upon
transfer. On the floor he was weaned from oxygen and currently
has oxygen saturations >92% on room air.

#Altered Mental [**Name (NI) 13115**] Pt found to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status consistent with delerium from his cholecystitis.
Pt was quite somnolent on several occasions. Of note, pt has
unequal pupils at baseline. ABG, blood sugar and vital signs
were all within normal limits while somnolent and pt improved in
the presence of a family members.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - at presentation, pt was stage
IV-V CKD. His Cr stayed near 6.0 throughout his MICU stay. He
was oliguric with a UOP of about 20-30 cc/hr initially, but
responded to lasix gtt and diuril with good diuresis. He
underwent IR guided non-tunneled hemodialysis line on [**2166-6-4**] for
temporary HD. HD was discontinued on [**2166-6-11**] and HD line
discontinued on [**2166-6-17**]. Pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**]. Pt is
discharged without diovan or phoslo, which may be added back in
follow up.

# ?[**Name (NI) 33562**] Pt developed elevated lipase 1234, without
pain, in the setting of increased inflammation in the
gallbladder/ductal system. Pt's lipa
