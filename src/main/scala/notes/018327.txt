Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 1007**], J before
surgical incisioin.

Post Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
All other findings similar to prebypass.
Intact thoracic aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
Catheterization revealed a 95% left main lesion and 50% RCA
stenosis.  Surgical intervention was requested and he was taken
to the Operating Room that day for bypass surgery. See operative
note for details.

He weaned from bypass on a Propofol infusion in stable condtion.
 He remained stable, awoke intact, was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated.  Beta blockade was resumed as well as
diuresis begun.

He transferred to the floor on POD #1 where Physical Therapy saw
him for mobility and strengthening.  CTs and temporary pacemaker
wires wre removed according to protocol.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was diuresed toward his preoperative
weight.  He was cleared for discharge to rehab on POD # 3.
