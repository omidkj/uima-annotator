Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, hypotension, sepsis

Femoral line placement.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old woman with long history of COPD, CHF, HTN,
recent LUE DVT, presenting from rehab with acute onset of fever
to 102.4 and productive cough. She has been in rehab since an
extended hospital stay in [**11-25**]. During that hospitalization she
was admitted with concern for STEMI, but had a cath with
nonocclusive CAD and only vasospasm. She also was treated for
pneumonia (vanc/zosyn) and for CHF and COPD.
.
She first began to feel unwell about 3-4 days ago, when she
developed mucus in her throat and cough productive of white
sputum. She has felt worsening shortness of breath since that
time. She was noted to have a temp of 102.4 on Friday and was
brought to the ED. She denies CP, abd pain, N/V/D, dysuria.
.
In the ED, VS: 99.3, 110, 105/53, 98% on 4L nc.
She was in the ED for ~18h while waiting for a bed. She was
initially given levofloxacin, albuterol, and atrovent. Though
the morning she had intermittent fevers and some transient
hypotension (as low as 76/40, asymptomatic, and with good UOP)
which was fluid responsive. She received her home verapamil dose
around 4:30pm. Around 10-11pm she became more persistently
hypotensive. Vancomycin and zosyn were given. A femoral line was
placed (patient could not lie flat due to SOB s/p fluids) and
levophed was started. Patient was put on CPAP for hypoxia and
increased work of breathing. CTA of the chest showed no PE, but
did show a mural thrombus in the thoracic aorta. Cardiac surgery
was consulted and recommended medical management with continuing
anticoagulation.
.
On transport to the MICU hypoxia had improved and during
transfer  she was on O2 by NC and breathing comfortably on
arrival to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU: T: 99.6 BP: 98/34 P: 99 RR: 29 O2 sats:
96% on 4L nc.  Influenza DFA was positve for Influenza A.  She
was started on Tamiflu.  CXR showed LLL consoldiation concerning
for PNA so Vanc/cefipime were started to cover superimposed PNA.
 Resp Distress was treated as a COPD exacerbation with IV
steroids, nebs, home inhalers.  BP recovered and she was weaned
off pressors.  On [**2-1**] Resp distress and BP had stabilized and
pt was called out to the floor.

Pertinent Results:
[**2161-1-30**]: Blood Cx x2 - Pending. Urine Cx - Genital flora.
Influenza A (+) by DFA.
.
CTA Chest [**2161-1-30**]:
IMPRESSION: 1.  No pulmonary embolus. 2. 1.2 cm mural thrombus
at mid descending thoracic aorta. 3. Extensive volume loss with
mucoid impaction demonstrated in the left lower lobar bronchi;
no definite endobronchial obstructing lesion is seen. 4. Nodule
in the right upper lobe redemonstrated; follow up in [**12-21**] months
is recommended.
.
CXR [**2161-1-30**]:
Cardiac size and mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and
unchanged.  There is no focal airspace opacification,
significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild
basilar atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal
limits.  There is stable appearance to an anterior wedge
compression fracture of the mid-thoracic spine. IMPRESSION:  No
acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CXR [**2161-1-31**]:
There is no appreciable change since the prior study.  The lungs
are
hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is mild biapical
pleural
thickening.  There is atelectasis or consolidation of the left
lower lobe. There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angle
suggestive of scarring.
There is mild atelectasis at the right lung base. IMPRESSION:
Left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
.
CXR [**2161-2-1**]:
Since prior study, there has been interval worsening, with
increased left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
consolidation.  The right lung is relatively clear with only a
small right-sided pleural effusion.  IMPRESSION: 1.  Increased
left pleural effusion, increased left lower lobe consolidation.
2.  Very small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 73 year old female with long hx of COPD, CHF, HTN,
recent LUE DVT and anterior STEMI/vasospasm s/p cath, admitted
for a COPD exacerbation with fevers, influenza A(+) and found to
have a large aortic mural thrombus. Pt subsequently developed
hypotension and sepsis in ED, was given vanco/zosyn and was
transferred to MICU on levophed, tamiflu and vanco/cefepime. In
the MICU she improved significantly, was weaned off levophed but
subsequently developed a LLL pneumonia. She was transferred to
the floor where she continued to improve on tamiflu and
vanco/cefepime.
.
# Sepsis/hypotension
Likely due to LLL pneumonia seeding vs influenza-induced sepsis.
Much improved over her MICU course and responding to
vanco/cefepime vs tamiflu. Since her transfer to the floor, her
BPs have been stable in the 130s. She was switched to
cefpodoxime on [**2161-2-3**] in anticipation of discharge, and should
continue on that regimen until [**2161-2-9**].
.
# LLL pneumonia
Patient developed increasing consolidation in the left lower
lobe with L pleural effusion on CXR. Likely due to bacterial
pneumonia from chronic bronchiectasis vs influenza pneumonia or
atelectasis. Improved significantly throughout her hospital
course with cefepime and tamiflu. Cefpedoxime should be
continued until [**2161-2-9**].
.
# Thoracic aorta mural thrombus
Etiology unknown. Cardiac surgery is aware and recommends
medical management with INR goal 2.5 - 3.0. Patient arrived to
the floor with a supratherapeutic INR of 4.9, coumadin was held
and restarted, currently INR = 2.7.
.
# C. difficle colitis:
On [**1-8**] pt developed diarrhea.  C. Diff was suspected and assay
was positive.  Pt was treated with po flagyl, and continued on a
10 day course on discharge.
.
# CAD, hx anterior MI
Found to have mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease
during last admission on cardiac cath with no significant
blockages; MI likely induced by vasospasm. No signs or symptoms
of cardiac ischemia on this admission.

# COPD e
