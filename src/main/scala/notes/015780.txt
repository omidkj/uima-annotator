No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
thrombocytopenia, concern for consumptive process, as well as
hematuria/epistaxis/bleeding from new EJ site


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-12**] right PICC placement
[**2-20**] dialysis cath placement

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with metastatic melanoma (V600E B-Raf mutant)
who has been partially response to experimental treatment, now
presented with spontaneous bleeding in the setting of new
thrombocytopenia. Patient has been treated as part of a phase I
clinical trial with chemo using a PI3-Kinase inhibitor and MEK
inhibitor with good response.
.
Patient was on vacation in [**State 108**] and off study drug for 10
days when he reports spitting up bloody sputum and mucus when
blowing his nose, starting 7d prior to admission. Pt drove to
[**State 108**] from [**Location (un) 86**] directly. Pt was scuba diving to 15m. He
noticed very dark urine and reported to a local hospital where
he was noted to have a platelet count of 20K (normal bun and
creatinine). Pt denied any fevers, chills,  SOB or chest pain.
He had a mild cough that he attributes to GERD. he also had
severe R hip pain, which he attributed to sciatica. By report,
the OSH ED performed a CTA chest to evaluate for pulmonary
embolism, which was negative. He also had an ultrasound of his
right hip and thigh, which did not show any clot. Patient then
flew up to [**Location (un) 86**] today and reported directly to the outpatient
oncology clinic. There, patient noted continued nose and gum
bleeding but now also reports maroon colored urine and mild
nausea. His labs were drawn, and given his continued bleeding,
Pt was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and likely
inpatient admission.
.
Per Onc notes, pt was first diagnosed with metastatic melanoma
in [**2130**], with excision of primary 1.7mm lesion on left flank in
[**2123**] w/ lymph node dissection showing metastasis. Pt underwent
several rounds of various chemotherapies that were not
successful. Pt developed a new 1.4cm L basilar lung nodule in
[**2130**] and underwent VATS resection in [**2130-10-10**]. Pt then had a
new lesion in L lower lobe lung nodule in [**2131-7-10**]. Pt started
current chemotherapy in [**2132-7-9**], and per [**2133-1-12**], onc
clinic note, Pt has been doing well w/ partial remission of
disease except for a left lingular nodule that has been getting
larger.
.
In the ED inital vitals were 98.1, 86, 156/86, 18, 95% on RA.
Labs were significant for platelet count of 30 and fibrinogen
<35, INR 1.8, PTT 43.9, PT 19.2. Hct 34.4 from a baseline of
39-41. WBC 10.9 (74% N, 4% bands), Creatinine 1.1, Uric acid
5.0, LDH 1215, LFTs otherwise normal (Tbili 0.6, Dbili 0.2). Of
note, patient's platelets were last 146 on [**2133-1-12**], and his LDH
has always been in the 200s. In the ED, patient had L EJ placed,
and was given 2units of cryoprecipitate and 1 unit of platelets.
Admitted to ICU for concern of thrombocytopenia vs. DIC vs.
TTP-HUS. On transfer, VS were 94, 97% RA, 119/76, 10 rr, 99.5%.
.
On arrival to the ICU, vitals were:
36.7C, HR 93, BP 118/71, RR 12, Sat 94% on RA.

Review of systems:
(+) bloody mucus and sputum, mild cough, L elbow effusion, R hip
pain, maroon urine. Reports mild nausea and constipation x 5
days, which he states is a side effect of his chemo.

tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies, shortness of

melanoma; no hemosiderin-laden macrophages suggestive of
hemophagocytosis

Studies:
CXR [**2133-2-12**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest read in conjunction with CT
scan of the chest, [**2-9**]: Nearly cm rounded opacity in the
left mid lung has developed from what was previously a 2-cm wide
opacity with surrounding hemorrhage in the lingula on the chest
CT performed [**2-9**]. The CT also shows patient has had a

fluid collection in the left major fissure. Differential
diagnosis of the lingular lesion includes abscess or aggressive
tumor. Right lung is clear. Heart size is normal.
