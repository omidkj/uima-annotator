Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 50171**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH notable for atrial
fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, annulocalcific
mitral valve disease, chronic kidney disease with recent
creatinine of 1.78 ([**2170-6-6**]) who is transferred from OSH for
management of fluid status and possible aspiration pneumonia.
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 28728**] Center. She
initially presented to OSH on [**2170-6-17**] with hematuria in the
setting of supratherapeutic INR (5). Urology was consulted who
recommended holding her coumadin briefly (later bridged with IV
heparin) with IV ceftriaxone X 3 days and her hematuria
resolved. She underwent cystoscopy on [**6-22**] which demonstrated
diffuse cystitis without active bleeding. She was found to have
a citrobacter UTI with sensitivity to zosyn and patient
completed a course of zosyn X 7 days (finished [**6-26**]). She was
transfused one unit prbcs. Cardiology was consulted on [**2170-6-27**]
(Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Houzen) due to intermittent episodes of dyspnea
thought to be multifactorial from acute on chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure superimposed on a aspiration vs.
hospital acquired pneumonia/pneumonitis.
A CT scan was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia as well as a
5x6mm nodular filling defect within the trachea at the carina
level. In addition to IV solumedrol and lengthening of zosyn
course to 10 days for possible pneumonia, patient had received
multiple doses of IV lasix (anywhere from 40-80mg IV boluses)
due to vascular congestion. Her weight on admission was 131 lbs
which dropped to 128.6 with diuresis (weight was 125lbs on
[**2170-6-6**] office visit). In the setting of her diuresis, her
creatinine has risen to 2.5 from a baseline of 1.8-2.0. Of note,
she has chronic lower extremity edema at baseline. Her
lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide were on hold in the setting
of renal failure.
On the floor, patient reports that she continues to feel short
of breath and is complaining of a nonproductive cough with
associated fits. She denies fevers, chills, nausea or vomtiing,
She denies pain or problems with swallowing. She has a foley in
place and denies any problems moving her bowels. She is
compliang of some right sided chest pain that is located under
her breast which has been hurting since a fall prior to her
previous admission.

Imaging:
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2170-6-30**] 1:37
AM
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2167-4-20**].
There is a left-sided pacemaker with distal lead tips in the
right atrium and right ventricle.  There is unchanged
cardiomegaly.  There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
markings suggestive of mild fluid overload.  This is within a
background of baseline interstitial lung disease.  No confluent
areas of opacity are seen.  There are no pneumothoraces.

Radiology Report RIB UNILAT, W/ AP CHEST RIGHT Study Date of
[**2170-6-30**] 1:20 PM
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**6-30**] at
1:43 a.m.
Heart size is enlarged but stable.  There is a dual-lead
left-sided pacemaker with the distal lead tips in the right
atrium and right ventricle which have intact leads.  There are
again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which
may represent an element of fluid overload.  Underlying
infection is not excluded.  Markers have been placement at the
right lower ribcage.  At this location, there are no displaced
rib fractures.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2170-7-2**]): There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker
with lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle,
unchanged. There is stable cardiomegaly. There is improved
aeration and improvement of the airspace opacities throughout
both lung fields. There remains some coarsening of the
bronchovascular markings bilaterally, mostly in the perihilar
region and at the lung bases, likely represent some fluid
overload.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2170-7-2**]):
1. Bilateral patchy airspace opacities with prominent with
interlobular
septal thickening may be related to congestive heart failure
versus a
multifocal pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended. No
definite
evidence for interstitial lung disease is identified.
2. Calcification along the pleura suggests prior granulomatous
disease.
3. Emphysematous changes in both lungs.

(TTE) ECHO: [**2170-7-3**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mi
