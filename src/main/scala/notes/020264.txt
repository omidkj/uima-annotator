History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41399**] is a 60 year old female with multiple medical
problems including end-stage renal disease on dialysis. She has
had excruciating neck pain since she was a teenager,
progressively getting worse. The last 2 years, she has had
intolerable back pain. The pain occurs every time she is moving
her neck. Bending, rotating, and lifting objects. It radiates
across her shoulders, left more than right. She was diagnosed
with neuropathy in the hands and the legs due to her diabetes.
She has difficulty opening and closing bottles and difficulty
with grasping objects.

Social History:
The patient lives in a nursing home.  She does not drink.  She
used to smoke many years ago, but quit over 30 years ago and she
is disabled.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Admission PE: Motor is full throughout. Sensory is slightly
better on the left
compared to the right. Reflexes are 2+ symmetric. No abnormal
reflexes. No tenderness on palpation of the neck, but she does
have pain on rotation.

At Discharge: She has a cervical collar with staples at the
posterior cervical spine. She has bilateral LE amputations. She
has UE peripheral neuropathy.


Pertinent Results:
MRI of her cervical spine was reviewed.
Significant for severe DJD of the cervical spine and cord
compression due to disc herniation and ligamentous hypertrophy
at
C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.

CHEST [**2104-3-11**]
A semierect portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The
heart
is moderately enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular congestion
and severe
pulmonary interstitial edema. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions and a retrocardiac opacity likely representing
atelectasis. There is no
pneumothorax. Surgical clips overlie the mediastinum and
orthopedic hardware is noted within the cervical spine. No
osseous abnormalities are identified.

CHEST [**2104-3-16**]
Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement
suggests cardiac
decompensation, but there has been improvement since [**3-11**]
and there is no pulmonary edema. I see no consolidation to
indicate atelectasis or
pneumonia and no pleural effusion. Left subclavian line ends in
the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.

Shoulder X-ray [**2104-3-11**]
No fracture or dislocation. Probable calcific
tendinitis/bursitis.

ECHO [**2104-3-12**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global
systolic function (LVEF>50%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline
normal free wall function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year old female with multiple medical issues
presents for elective posterior cervical laminectomy and fusion.
She went to the OR on [**3-10**]. The surgery  was uncomplicated and
she was transferred to the PACU for recovery. Medicine was
consulted for management of multiple medical pathologies. She
was scheduled to go to dialysis and renal was consulted to see
patient. On post op exam, patient was full strength except for L
deltoid [**3-29**], limited by pain. On [**3-11**], patient's exam remains
unchanged. She was observed to be 88% O2 sat on 5L NC. A CXR was
ordered and she was sent to dialysis. CXR showed atelectasis,
mild bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderately large
silhoute of the heart. Her lung sounds improved on [**3-12**].
Medicine asked to stop her clonidine. She was screened for rehab
per PT. Her shoulder X-ray final report mentions tenditnitis and
bursitis. Ice was ordered.

She was transported to dialysis on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 in the early morning
of [**3-13**]. The patient reported diffuse abdminal pain and
tenderness while on dialysis. She was seen by the renal fellow
who sent a lactic acid which was 0.9 and requested a KUB as she
was constipated with signs of an incarcerated ventral hernia.
This imaging was ordered stat and her dialysis was aborted with
about 1 hour remaining. This was cleared by the renal fellow.
The ACS service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to eval for possible surgery. By
hospital protocol this was then referred to the transplant team
due to her end stage renal disease. She was taken to the OR with
instructions by the Neurosurgery team that her collar should
remain in place at all times.

On [**2104-3-13**] she underwent exploratory laparotomy, colectomy,
ileostomy and repair of recurrent ventral hernia. See Dr [**Name (NI) 41400**] operative note of the same date for details.
Post-operatively, she was taken to the ICU intubated. She was
extubated the following morning (POD4/1) without difficulty and
was oxygenating well on a 50% mask. She remained in the ICU for
several days because of her high oxygen demand, then was
transferred to the floor on POD7/4. Her diet was sequentially
advanced while monitoring her ostomy for production. By POD [**8-29**]
(HD9), she was tolerating a regular diet with minimal oxygen
requirement. Her ostomy was functioning well with 0.5L output
per day. Throughout her hospitalization, she continued
hemodialysis using her left radiocephalic AVF, taking off
approximately 3L ultrafiltrate per session.

On the day of discharge, she was tolerating regular diet with
pain well controlled on [**2-28**] oxycodone per day. Her neck incision
staples were removed by neurosurgery. Her abdominal laparotomy
incision was clean, dry and intact with staples in place. She
was provided with instructions for follow-up and was given
instructions for her care facility.
