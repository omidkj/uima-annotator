Urine cx [**2129-12-28**]: <10,000 organisms/ml

CXR [**2129-12-28**]: No acute intrathoracic process. No definite
fractured ribs are noted

CT maxillofacial [**2128-12-28**]:
1. Fractures of the nasal bones, bilateral maxilla, right
zygomaticotemporal arch, bilateral lateral orbital walls, and
bilateral pterygoid plates suggest Le Fort type III on the right
and a Le Fort type II fracture on the left.
2. Partially imaged nondisplaced type 2 dens fracture.

ECHO [**2129-12-29**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable mild inferolateral hypokinesis. There
is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Variable LVEF.

L tib-fib XR: no fracture or malalignment

ECHO [**2129-12-30**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

CT neck [**2129-12-28**]:
No retropharyngeal hematoma is seen. Mottled secretions layering

within the nasal and oropharynx are present.

CTA chest [**2129-12-30**]:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral subsegmental lower lobe atelectasis.

CT head [**2129-12-30**]:
1. No acute intracranial process. Likely chronic internal
capsule and
subinsular lacunar infarcts.
2. Known facial bone fractures.

CT C Spine [**2130-1-5**]
1. Known type 2 dens fracture, which remains nondisplaced.
2. Acute nondisplaced fracture involving the posterior spinous
process of C5.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
detailed above, resulting in anterolisthesis of C4 on C5.
4. Known facial bone fractures and hematoma within the paranasal
sinuses and nasopharynx

Head CT [**2130-1-5**]
1. No acute intracranial process, with no evidence of
intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Known facial bone fractures

Aspiration of nectar and penetration of honey and puree


Brief Hospital Course:
The following hospital course as follows during his ICU course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery intensive care
unit for monitoring.

Plastic surgery saw the patient and recommended:
- head of bed elevation
- sinus precautions (no drinking through straw, sneeze with
mouth open, no swimming)
- recommend Unasyn X 1 week
- clear liquid diet only; would not advance given occlusion
- repair recommendations to be made following discussion at
conference

Orthopedic surgery saw the patient and recommended:
- [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar for 6 weeks
- Follow up in [**3-29**] weeks for possible C2 fixation with [**Doctor Last Name 1352**]

ENT saw the patient on hospital day one for muffled voice and
posterior and pharyngeal edema.  Recommended:
- Decadron 10mg IV q8 x 3 doses for uvular edema
- Airway watch
- Humidified O2 at all times

- [**12-28**]: Admitted to TICU. Fiberoptic exam by ENT for muffled
voice and posterior pharyngeal edema revealed substantial clot,
but no laryngeal edema/evidence of airway compromise. Started on
Decadron per ENT (x 3 doses).

- [**12-29**]: Started on clear liquid diet. Suboptimal echo. Cardiac
enzymes were negative x3. Episode of agitation in the evening
with confusion.  This initially improved with Haldol, but he
suffered a repeat episode with hypoxemia and bradycardia that
progressed to asystole. A code blue was called.  The patient was
intubated and given epinephrine 1mg x2 and chest compressions
with return of sinus rhythm. CT head/CTA chest were
unremarkable. Transfused 1 pRBC for hct 26.

- [**12-30**]: Ventilator was weaned to CPAP 5/5. Cards consult was
called. Repeat ECHO showed grossly preserved function with EF
55%.

- [**12-31**]: 27 beat run of VTach. HDS, self-limited; electrolytes
WNL. On CPAP 5/5, low RSBI, but no cuff leak.

- [**1-1**]: Minimal air leak. The patient was given IV lasix 40mg AM,
20mg PM.  Cardiology recommended aspirin daily, Lopressor PRN,
outpatient stress test, and restarting home statin.

-[**1-2**]: Extubated. Changed PO metoprolol to IV Lopressor 10mg Q4H
prn. Started clears after passing bedside swallow. Made NPO as
concern for coughing and choking. Speech and swallow eval was
ordered.

Upon transfer to the regular nursing unit:

He was evaluated by Cardiology for his atrial fibrillation and
several recommendations were made pertaining to adjustment of
his beta blocker and baby aspirin.

Discussions took place with Plastics and OMFS as to whether or
not repair of his facial fr
