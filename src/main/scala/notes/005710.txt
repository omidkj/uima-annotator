History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year old female with chronic restrictive lung
disease, OSA, hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension
and left & right sided heart failure who is brought him by
family for increased lethargy. The patient is on home O2 and
BIPAP. She is also a chronic CO2 retainer with CO2 usually in
the 70's to 90's. Two weeks ago, her daughter visited her home
and found her unresponsive and EMS was call. When EMS arrives,
the patient woke up and dismissed the EMS team. Over the next
two weeks leading up to this admission, she was getting
progressively more lethargic and difficult to arouse by family
members who visit her. She was reported to be constantly
sleeping even in the daytime with her BIPAP machine. Yesterday,
on her way to her routine Bingo game, she fell. She was with a
friend and the family is unable to give details of her fall. It
did not seem like she lost consciousness, as she proceeded to
play Bingo and then go home. The family is alarmed that she fell
and convinced her to go to the ED today.
.
In the ED, her presenting vitals were: 99.1, 79, 101/57, 20, 80%
on 4LNC. She was 93% on NRB. BIPAP was ordered but did not
tolerate. ABG was done: 7.27, 103, 62 (not intubated, but
unclear at what supplemental oxygen). She was then intubated and
treated for presumed CHF exacerbation with lasix 80mg IV and a
nitro gtt. She was then sent to MICU for further care.

Admission CXR: FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph is
obtained. Cardiomegaly is again noted, though evaluation is
suboptimal on AP radiograph. No large effusions are present.
There is no definite evidence of airspace consolidation, though
evaluation of the left lower lobe is limited. Pulmonary hila
appear unchanged. There is no definite evidence of CHF.
Evaluation for pneumothorax is somewhat limited due to patient
position, though none is seen. Visualized osseous structures are
intact.
IMPRESSION:  1. Cardiomegaly, unchanged. No evidence of
pneumonia or CHF.

[**7-27**] AP PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. Large pulmonary artery contours
is again noted. Pulmonary vascular congestion is not
significantly changed. There is interval slight worsening in
left lower lobe opacity. No evidence of pneumothorax.IMPRESSION:
1. Interval slight worsening in left lower lobe opacity. 2.
Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.

2 Abdominal supine films showed nonspecific bowel gas patterns
with no clear obstruction


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
56 year old female with chronic restrictive lung disease, OSA,
hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension and left &
right sided heart failure admitted for respiratory failure.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: She has many reasons for respiratory
failure: chronic OSA, hypoventilation syndrome (chronic CO2
~80), restrictive lung disease (by PFTs), asthma (from old
notes) and CHF (both left and right heart). At the ED, her ABG
was 7.27, 103, 62, suggesting a primary respiratory acidosis
consistent with her chronic CO2 retention and compensatory
metabolic alklosis with bicarb chronically ~45. She was
intubated on assist control Fi02 50%, 500x14, and her gas
initially was 7.45, 62, 80.  While she has some signs of CHF,
she does not seem floridly overloaded. She only has basilar
rather than diffuse crackles; her peripheral edema is better
than usual; her weight (278lbs) is lower than her last discharge
weight (283lbs) in [**2122-4-28**]; her CXR does not show that much
pulm edema, and her BNP is not higher than what she is
chronically at 5000. She did not have a fever or leukocytosis to
suggest a concomitant pneumonia. CXR did not show infiltrates.
During her hospitalization she was able to be weaned to BiPap at
night only, which she uses at home. Her settings at discharge
were 14/10 with 5 liters of oxygen.  It was noted that her home
BiPap machine was not working properly, so she should arrange to
have appropriate BiPap as an outpatient while she is at rehab.
Continue Nebulizer treatments as prescribed.
# CHF: Diastolic dysfunction with EF of 60% and LVH. She also
has moderate pulm htn on echo and PA pressures of 54/34 on cath
in [**2121-2-26**]. Her weight on admission is 278.3 pounds, which is
down from her "dry weight" of 283 calculated during her last
admission in [**2122-4-28**]. Currently, she does not seem dramatically
volume overloaded. She was diuresed while in the hospital with
net -7322cc off during the hospitalization.
# PULM HYPERTENSION: She was following Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital **]
Clinic. At home, she takes sildenifil 20mg TID. The etiology of
her pulm htn is thought to be from OSA and FenFen use.
Continued sildenifil 20mg TID while in hospital.
 # OSA: She follows Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Sleep at clinic.  Will
probably need another sleep eval while at rehab, and follow-up
regarding BiPap as above.
# S/P FALL: She fell while walking to Bingo but she proceeded to
finish her games and went home by herself. The family is unable
to give details of her fall.  No signs of injuries by physical
exam; no evidence of trauma during this h
