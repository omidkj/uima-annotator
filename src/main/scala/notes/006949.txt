CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ABD PAIN HTN, RENAL FAILURE. ? INFECTION
Field of view: 32

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man with hypertension, new renal failure, abd pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
enlarged aorta? evidence of infection? not able to take PO
contrast and no IV vontrast b/c arf
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: elevated cr

INDICATION: 86-year-old man with hypertension and new renal
failure and abdominal pain. Please evaluate for aortic pathology
or evidence of infection.

No comparisons available.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases
to the pubic symphysis with no IV or oral contrast
administration. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were
then obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of
the lung bases demonstrates panlobular emphysema. No pulmonary
nodule, parenchymal opacity, or pleural effusion is noted.
Dependent atelectatic changes are noted at both lung bases. The
aorta is diffusely ectatic and contains calcification. The heart
has normal appearance.

The liver contains a small hypodense lesion within its dome
measuring 6 mm which is too small to characterize. The
gallbladder contains multiple stones. The common bile duct is
not dilated. The pancreas has normal appearance. The adrenal
glands, stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel and large
bowel appear normal. Both kidneys contain multiple hypodense
lesions which most likely represent simple cysts. Both the left
and right renal midpoles contain 15mm round, hyperdense lesions
measuring [**Doctor Last Name **] 50-80, which have the appearance of hyperdense
cysts. No hyronenephrosis is noted. No free air or fluid is
noted within the abdomen and pelvis. No pathologically enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal node is noted.

The descending thoraco-abdominal aorta is tortuous and ectatic
throughout; however, there is a focal area of aneurysmal
dilatation at the level of the infrarenal aorta measuring 29 x
28 mm. There is apparent aneurysmal dilatation of the celiac
artery at its origin which also shows some foci of
calcification. Diffuse calcification is noted throughout the
course of abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries.

CT of the pelvis with no contrast: The urinary bladder has
normal appearance. The distal ureters are also normal. The
prostate gland is massively enlarged and its markedly
hypertrophied median lobe protrudes into the base of the bladder
measuring 5.3 x 4.6 in a transverse dimension and 7.2 cm in
craniocaudal dimension. The part of the prostate gland that
protrudes into the base of the bladder demonstrates multiple
round hyperdense foci, suggesting hemorrhage; no blood is seen
to layer dependently within the bladder. No free air or fluid is
noted within the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or
inguinal nodes are noted. The rectum and sigmoid colon have
normal appearance.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely calcific and tortuous abdominal aorta with
infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.9 cm,
with no evidence of intramural hemorrhage or perianeurysmal
leak.

2. At least three larger and two smaller hyperdense cysts are
noted within both kidneys. In this setting of renal failure and
numerous cysts, the differential diagnosis favors hemorrhagic
(or superinfected) cysts, or less likely, primary renal
malignancy. Further characterization (as cystic rather than
solid) by US may be useful.

3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.

4. Diffusely enlarged median lobe, prostate gland which
protrudes into the base of the bladder and contains hemorrhagic
foci. Of note, the bladder appears smooth-walled with no free
clot,and there is no hydronephrosis.

5. Diffuse panacinar emphysema.

6. 8-mm hypodense lesion within the dome of the liver which
cannot be further characterized.

COMMENT: Please note that son[**Name (NI) 867**] may be helpful for further
evaluation of hyperdense renal cysts, prostate gland with
hemorrhage and bladder PVR, and evaluation of the liver lesion.

===============================================================
Stress-MIBI:INTERPRETATION: This 86 year old man with a history
of renal failure
and CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
The
patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4
minutes.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the
patient
throughout the study. There were no ST segment changes during
the
infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with occasional
isolated
vpbs and apbs. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the infusion.
The
dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2161-2-11**]

PERSANTINE MIBI

Reason: 86 YEAR OLD MAN WITH HYPERTENSION, NEWLY DEPRESSED EF,
INFER OLATERAL HYPOKINESIS

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
10.9 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2161-2-11**]);
33.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2161-2-11**]);
HISTORY:
86-year-old man with a hsitory of HTN referred for evaluation of
a newly
discovered cardiomyopathy with depressed systolic function and a
wall motion
abnormality on echocardiography

SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
mg/kg/min. He had no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes.

METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Tracer was
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.

Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous
dipyridamole,
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi
was administered
intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 45
minutes following
tracer injection.

Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
