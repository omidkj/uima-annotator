Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Washout of L prosthetic hip
Washout of L knee x 2.
Debridement of epidural abscesses.

History of Present Illness:
55 yo F s/p L hip replacement 3 years ago now transfered from
[**Hospital6 **] with MSSA bacteremia with evidence of
infection of L hip, possible L knee, lumbar spine, urine, blood,
and emboli to brain.
.
Pt states she was in her USOH until [**3-5**] when she drove her son
to college. States she began having left lower back pain
radiating to L leg. Per her husband she had not previously been
on narcotics, but was given several prescriptions after a few ED
visits, neurology visit, and PCP visit in the past few weeks for
this pain. She states that leading up to [**3-22**] she had noticed
some chills and nausea. She also had a severe headache and some
neck stiffness. Her family states she was not eating or drinking
much at all. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence but states
sometimes she would have to cough to get her urine stream to
start. States over the 3 weeks she felt her legs getting weaker
L>R. On [**2130-3-22**] pt drove to [**Hospital3 **] for a bone scan
that had been ordered by her neurologist. Her WBC count had been
elevated and there was concern for myeloma vs. infection.
However, she only finished the 1st half of the scan and then
drove home. She was found on the front step of her house by her
neighbor struggling to get in the front door with altered mental
status. It was not known how long she had been sitting there.
She complained of bilateral leg weakness with pain in her left
lower back that radiated down her L leg. EMS reports her BP was
low at 90/68 and initially improved with NS but then decreased
again. At [**Hospital3 **] she was found to have rhabdomyolysis with
a CK of 3738 and a WBC of 16. Na was 119 and Cl was 87. Cr was
elevated at 3.8 (baseline 1.1) and UTI was diagnosed. CXR showed
bilateral infiltrates. Ddimer was positive but V/Q scan was low
prob for PE. She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin as
well as hydrocortisone for the hypotension. Head CT showed
embolic disease. She began spiking fevers and blood cultures and
urine culture grew out MSSA. She complained of back and L hip
pain and a fluid collection was seen in the hip and aspiration
showed 66,000 WBC's and grew out MSSA as well. Lumbar MRI
possible epidural abscess L2-4. Troponin was initially 0.04 but
then became elevated and peaked at 17.19 on [**3-24**]. This was felt
to be an NSTEMI in the setting of demand from septic shock. She
was started on aspirin and beta-blocker. Renal failure resolved
with fluids.
.
On admission to MICU pt c/o severe lower back pain radiating
down L leg. States L knee is very painful and she cannot move
the L leg much [**2-10**] pain. Pt states her MS was initially poor but
has since cleared and she is now at baseline with regards to
mental functioning.

not had any back pain since then until [**3-5**].)

-h/o Barrett's esophagus in the distant past.

Pertinent Results:
Studies from Caritas [**Hospital6 5016**]:
.
CXR [**2130-3-22**]: diffuse infiltrates suspected for pneumonia.
.
Pelvis AP view [**2130-3-22**]: multiple surgical clips noted. Possible
LN dissection. Prosthetic L hip and acetabulum.
.
2 views of L shoulder [**2130-3-23**]: normal.
.
V/Q scan: low prob for PE.
.
Renal ultrasound [**2130-3-24**]: normal.
.
CT chest without contrast [**2130-3-24**]: patchy streaky densities in
the lung bases posteriorly on both sides probably small zones of
atelectasis or scarring. Some minimal thickening of the pleura
posteriorly especially at the R lung base. No pleural effusions
or confluent consolidations.
.
TTE [**2130-3-24**]: LVEF 60%, mild hypokinesis of RV infervior wall. 1+
TR, borderline pulm HTN. No vegetations seen.
.
MRI head [**2130-3-24**]: Wet read: multiple old [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] infarcts. R temp and
occipital cortical infarcts - acute. No enhancement.
.
MRI lumbar spine: DJD L2-3, [**3-12**], [**4-13**]. Marked stenosis of L3-4.
Large cyst in R hemipelvis - ?R ovarian cyst. s/p hysterectomy.

.
CXR [**2130-3-25**]: Streaky bilateral basilar atelectasis.
.
MRI c/t/l spine [**2130-3-26**]: Wet read: C-spine - unremarkable.
T-spine: enhancing lesion (intraderual, extramedullary) upper to
lower thoracic spine with anterior displacement of the spinal
cord, suspicious for tumor vs. infection vs. vascular
malformation. L-spine: extension of the enhancing lesion in the
dura to the upper lumbar spine. Multilevel DJD most prominent at
L3-4 with central canal stenosis.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast and CT guided aspiration of L
hip joint [**2130-3-25**]: Mild to moderate ileus - no acute
intra-abdominal abnormalities. CT guided biopsy performed.
.
MRI TLS spine [**4-3**]: T spine limited by movement, 1.
Spondylodiscitis at the L2/L3 through the L5/S1 levels with
large epidural
abscesses extending from the L2 to the S1 levels causing mild
canal stenosis at the L1 and L2 levels and moderate-to-severe
canal stenosis at the L4 and L5 levels. This appears not
significantly changed since [**2130-3-24**].
2. Extensive right psoas muscle and left erector spinae muscle
abscesses which are worsened since [**2130-3-24**].
3. Leptomeningeal enhancement of the conus and well as the
pachymeningeal enhancement of the thecal sac, as before,
concerning for subarachnoid vs subdural abscesses.
