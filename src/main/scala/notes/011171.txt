Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-3-17**] Urgent coronary artery bypass graft times 6; left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery;
saphenous vein graft to diagonal artery.  Saphenous vein
sequential graft, obtuse marginal I and II.  Saphenous vein
sequential graft to left and right posterior descending artery

History of Present Illness:
This 51 year old male has a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia,
COPD, and GERD, had atypical chest pain for the past month which
usually occurs after dinner.  He has a history of ETOH abuse and
was admitted to MWMC in [**11-18**] with atrial fibrillation.  He
stopped drinking and has not had any further atrial
fibrillation.  He was admitted to MWMC today and his cardiac
enzymes were negative.  His EKG showed new subtle inferlateral
ST depressions. He had a persantine ETT which showed a dilated
left ventricle with an EF of 53% and anterior septal ischemia.
He then became acutely ill with diaphoresis, chest pain, and
shortness of breath and underwent cardiac catheterization which
a proximal 99% stenosis of the LAD with thrombus and he had a
thrombectomy and POBA with residual 40% stenosis.  An IABP was
placed and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2162-3-17**] Echo: Pre-CPB: The study was limited by poor gastric
windows. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Left ventricular cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic [**Month/Day/Year 5236**] are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There is an IABP visualized to the arch,
recommend pulling back 1-2cm. No aortic injury seen. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is A-Paced, on no inotropes. Preserved
biventricular systolic fxn. No AI, trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**]. Again
the gastric views are liimited in quality so LV dimensions could
not be reliably obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 1391**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
follow cardiac cath at MWMC which revealed severe three vessel
disease and LAD thrombus. A IABP was also placed at time of cath
and upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] he was medically managed and
remained stable without chest pain. He underwent appropriate
pre-operative work-up and the following day, [**2162-3-17**], he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent an urgent
coronary artery bypass graft x 6 (left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending artery; saphenous vein graft to
diagonal artery.  Saphenous vein sequential graft, obtuse
marginal I and II.  Saphenous vein sequential graft to left and
right posterior descending artery). Please see operative report
for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically [**Month/Day/Year 5235**]
and extubated. On post-op day one his IABP was removed and he
was transferred to the step-down floor. Beta-blockers and
diuretics were started and he was gently diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. On post-op day two he had episode of atrial
fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and
beta-blockers. He eventually was started on Coumadin for Atrial
fibrillation. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He worked with physical therapy during his
post-op course for strength and mobility. He continued to make
good progress and on post-op day # 6 he was discharged to home
with VNA services and the appropriate medications and follow-up
appointments were advised.

[**Hospital 197**] clinic at [**Hospital **] medical group (via PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
will follow his INR and Coumadin.
