Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year-old female with a history of macrocytic
anemia, MDS, possible seizure disorder, multiple falls who
presents with chest pain.
.
Of note, she was just recently admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital from
[**Date range (1) 16384**] for lethargy and hypoglycemia. She was found to have
elevated INR as well as elevated transaminases and severe
hypoalbuminemia, attributed to possibly underlying liver disease
as well as malnutrition. She was noted to be disoriented
initially with visual hallucinations. Her mental status cleared
with holding of psychoactive meds. Abdominal ultrasound showed
mild hepatic steatosis but no acute abnormality. She declined
rehab at discharge.
.
On the morning of this admission, she reports a general feeling
of malaise and a sense that she should go to the hospital. When
her VNA arrived, she asked her to call EMS and was brought to
the ED. In the ambulance, pt developed onset of pins and needles
sensation that started in her left hand and radiated up the arm
to her shoulder. She then noticed pleuritic chest pain starting
at the left chest and moving across to the right as well as up
her left neck. The pain also occasionally radiates in a
band-like fashion across her upper abdomen. She has had
associated nausea and diaphoresis as well as SOB. Also complains
of a migraine HA, similar to her usual. Denies fevers, chills,
vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T98.6, HR 148, BP 100/60, RR 17,
85% on 2L. While in the ED, her BP occasionally dipped to the
80s but quickly came back up to the 90s without intervention.
She remained tachycardic in the 110-120s. EKG showed sinus tach.
Trop was elevated to 0.03 but flat. Because of risk for PE and
poor IV access it was decided to perform VQ scan. However, there
was a prolonged wait for VQ during which the patient spiked a
temp to 101.8. CVL was eventually placed for access. Pt was also
noted to have a UTI and was given ceftriaxone. In addition, she
received 1700cc NS and 1g tylenol. Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is very anxious and says
that she is having a "panic attack". She feels nervous because
she does not know what is going on. She continues to have pain
at her L chest, under her breast, and L shoulder as well as
migraine HA. Also feels SOB.
.
ROS: +HA, intermittent band-like abdominal pain, CP and SOB as
above. +coughing up green-white phlegm x 1 day. The patient
denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, orthopnea, PND,
lower extremity edema, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

RADIOLOGY:
VQScan [**11-27**]:  Multiple bilateral areas of subsegmental defects,
indeterminate scan.
Chest CT [**11-28**]
1. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli in both main pulmonary
arteries, every
lobar artery, and multiple segmental arteries with no signs of
right
ventricular strain.
2. Trace right pleural effusion.
3. Bibasilar and lingular atelectasis. Left lateral costophrenic
angle
opacity could be atelectasis or early infarct, should be
followed in three to six months.
4. Unchanged 3 mm nodule since [**2181**], does not warrant further
followup.
Abd/pelvic CT [**11-29**]:  No evidence of Retroperitoneal bleed.
Pelvic ultrasound and transvaginal:  Nabothian cyst, simple
fluid in pelvis, small amount
.
ECHO [**11-28**]

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function, without echocardiographic evidence of "right heart
strain". Mild pulmonary hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:


# Pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis: CT Chest
significant for bilateral PEs.  LENI revealed right common
femoral DVT. Her ECHO did not show evidence of right heart
strain, and she had only a short period of hypotension which
responded to fluids.  She did have an IVC filter placed on [**11-29**]
given clot burden. She was started on heparin and coumadin.  Her
Hct dropped on the day of initiation of heparin, but workup did
not reveal a GI bleed or a retroperitoneal bleed.  Her
hematocrit was subsequently stable.  She was transitioned to
lovenox on the day of discharge for more predictable
anticoagulation.  She was also started on coumadin.  She should
have a daily INR and an overlap of 48 hours with lovenox after
her INR is > 2.
.
This was an unprovoked large PE.  She will require age
appropriate cancer screening, including endoscopy, colonoscopy,
and mammogram, as well as a hypercoag
