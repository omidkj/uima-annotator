EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 82. Delayed precordial R wave
progression, probably normal variant. Borderline low voltage. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Lower ext doppler [**3-29**]:  No evidence of DVT.

CXR [**3-31**]:
ET tube tip is in standard position 3 cm above the carina. NG
tube tip is in the stomach partially coiled in the stomach.
Cardiomediastinal contour is obscured by the parenchymal
abnormalities. Diffuse airspace consolidations have worsened in
the left lower lobe and lingula. There is no pneumothorax or
sizable pleural effusions.

TTE [**3-31**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

CXR [**4-5**]:
Interstitial edema which worsened over the preceding two days
has nearly resolved, though pulmonary vascular congestion
remains and the heart is still mildly to moderately enlarged.
Small right pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20825**] was admitted to the antepartum service for bacterial
pneumonia.  She was initially febrile, her WBC was 11.9 with 12%
bands, and her initial CXR showed acute interstitial or
peribronchial thickening that could represent atypical
pneumonia.  She was initially started on PO Azithromycin.
.
FWB was reassuring with BPP [**9-20**], AFI 17, EFW 2543g (55%).  Her
T1DM was initially very well controlled on her insulin pump.
.
On admission, she was noted to have a high blood pressure of
150/90.  She denied headache, visual changes, or RUQ pain.  She
did, however, have 3+ pitting edema to her knees bilaterally
(bilat LE US neg for DVT).  Serum pre-eclampsia labs were
normal.  A 24 hour urine collection revealed 4,456mg protein.
She had known baseline proteinuria with 1796mg at 26 weeks and
[**2028**] mg at 33 weeks GA.
.
On the night of HD #1, she was transiently transferred to the
ICU for relative hypotension with SBPs in the 120s and concerns
for early sepsis.  IV Ceftriaxone was added to broaden her
antibiotic regimen.  She improved with IV fluids and tylenol and
was called out of the unit on the next morning.
.
On the night of HD #3, she was noted to have an episode of
respiratory distress with tachypnea in the 30s-40s, with O2sat
89-90% and ABG 7.36/31/81 on 70% FM. CXR at the time showed
significant interval progression of the right lower lobe
consolidation as well as worsening of peribronchial opacities in
the rest of the lungs consistent with progressing infection.
She was started on high dose IV prednisolone q24h.
.
On HD #4, she became more dyspneic with walking and had another
episode of respiratory distress with O2 sat 90% on 70% Face
Mask.  WBC increased to 18.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia with
RBBB. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and intubated. Vancomycin
was added to her antibiotic regimen.  She was started on an
insulin gtt.
.
On HD #5 ([**3-31**]), she had a primary LTCS at 34w5d for worsening
maternal status.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20825**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] 34 weeks pregnant with
hypoxia felt to be secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
