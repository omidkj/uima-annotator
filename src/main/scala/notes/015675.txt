Pertinent Results:
[**2155-2-13**]
Prebypass:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area
0.5-0.6cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results.
Postbypass:
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. There is a
well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. No AI is visualized. The MR now appears mild. The TR
now appears moderate. Remaining study is unchanged from the
prebypass exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted after catherization after IV hydration.  On
[**2155-2-13**] she went to the operating room where she underwent an
aortic valve replacement with size 23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic tissue
valve.  See operative note for full details.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Low dose beta blocker was initiated but
then stopped due to hypotension with a SBP in the 80's. The
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes were split due to high drainage and
mediatinal chest tubes were removed with subsequent removal of
left pleural chest tube once drainage had decreased. She was
anticoagulated with Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #7 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound
was healing well and pain was controlled with Tylenol only due
to somnolence with Ultram.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **] in [**Location (un) 246**] in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.First INR check day after discharge.
Target INR 2.0-2.5 .
