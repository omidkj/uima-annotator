Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to TSICU from ED for neurological checks while on the
ventilator.

Hospital course by systems:

NEURO: Initial CT head demonstrated traumatic SAH/SDH with 2mm
midline shift, which did not increase on subsequent scans
throughout her hospitalization.  Off sedation, she opened her
eyes spontaneously and does some tracking.  She does not follow
commands, however.  She was initially placed on dilantin for
seizure ppx, but this was changed to keppra.

CV: Hemodynamically stable throughout her admission, she did
have intermittent tachycardia related to pain and anxiety.  An
Echo on [**7-17**] demonstrated LVEF 20%, which was markedly lower
than her prior LVEF of 55% on admission.  There was also
evidence of RH strain and she leaked troponins, which was
thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of failure and
tachycardia.

PULM: Trached enroute to [**Hospital1 18**], pt remained ventilated despite
being off sedation for many days.  After one week, a
tracheostomy was placed to facilitate weaning off ventilation.
She remained on high pressure support and PEEP and her wean was
not successful by the time of discharge.  Her poor respiratory
reserve was complicated by VAP for which she received a 5 day
course of antibiotics.

GI: A dobhoff was placed for tube feeds and after failure to
wean from ventilation, a PEG was inserted at the same time as
the tracheostomy was placed.  Tube feeds were advanced to goal
and she tolerated these without problem.

HEME:  SC heparin was started on HD7 per neurosurgery
recommendations.  Vascular surgery did not feel it was warranted
to place IVC filter at this time.  Initial thrombocytopenia,
from inadequate resuscitation, resolved by HD7.  She had no
bleeding events.  PE was suspected on [**7-21**], but CTA chest was
negative for embolism.

ENDO:  Pt maintained on home diabetic regimen, but sugars
remained elevated.  Prior to discharge, a DM consult was
obtained to assist with insulin regimen.  She will be discharge
on this current regimen.

ID: Afebrile through the first part of her hospitalization, pt's
respiratory status diminished on HD5 and CXR demonstrated a L
lower lung field opacity concerning for pneumonia.  SHe was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cipro/cefepime) and
sputum cultures were sent.  Cultures did not grow any organisms
and antibiotics were stopped after a 5 day course.
