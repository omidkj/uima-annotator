Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty [**2119-8-22**] -- Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88yoF with a h/o severe AS, Afib on coumadin,
HTN, HLD who was transferred from OSH with acute pulmonary edema
requiring intubation and hypotension requiring pressors.
Patient is unable to provide a history at this time so details
obtained by family and note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in OMR.  Pt recently
saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2119-8-16**] for evaluation for AVR.  Per
his note, she had a syncopal episode approximately 5 mos ago.
She also c/o occasional SOB but this had recently improved.  Her
most recent echocardiogram of [**2119-7-19**] showed severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**]
0.47cm2, mn 37) with normal systolic function (LVEF 60%).  She
was scheduled for elective AVR on [**2119-9-21**] with anticipated
pre-admission for IV heparin and routine PATs.
.
Per the family, on the day of admission she developed acute SOB
at home and called her neighbor, who is a nurse.  Her daughter
had visited her only 30 minutes prior, and states that she did
not appear SOB at that time.  Her neighbor called EMS and the pt
was brought to [**Hospital6 33**]. There she was intubated for
poor responsiveness and started on dopamine gtt for BP 70/40.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On transfer to ED, she was intubated and on dopamine gtt.
Vitals afebrile with HR 140, BP 97/64, RR 22 O2sat 95%. BP
decreased to 71/57, started on levophed and neosynephrine gtt
and BP stabilized 90s/60s. Received IV lasix 40mg x1. Dopamine
gtt was d/c'd.  EKG showed Afibb with RVR. LIJ and arterial line
placed. (RIJ attempted but c/b blood clot.) DCCV attempted but
she remained in afib. She was admitted to CCU for respiratory
and pressure support.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):

   Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2119-8-23**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
      Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2119-8-23**] 2:45PM.

Imaging:
CXR [**2119-8-21**]: New left internal jugular line terminates in the
proximal
SVC. Endotracheal tube has been retracted, and now terminates 3
cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has also been retracted,
with side port just beyond the gastroesophageal junction, and
tip in the stomach. There is no
pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion is
unchanged, vascular congestion and moderated pulmonary edema are
worse.

CXR [**2119-8-23**]:
1. Progressive asymmetric focal opacification in the right lower
lobe raises concern for infection.
2. Endotracheal tube 1.8 cm above the carina.

[**2119-8-21**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.

[**2119-8-23**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate, eccentric mitral
regurgitation. Small posterior pericardial effusion. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-22**], aortic valve
gradient is lower. The severity of mitral regurgitation is
reduced, although image quality is technically limited. The
heart rate is slower. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is
reduced. The estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower.

[**2119-8-22**] Cardiac Catheterization:
Patient was brought to the cath lab on ventilator and
inotropic support. Vascular access was secured through the right
femoral
artery and vein. Selective coronary angiography was performed
using 4 Fr
JL 4 and JR 4 diagnostic catheters. A 5 Fr Pigtail catheter on a

straight 0.035 wire was used to cross the aortic valve.
Hemodynamic
parameters were measured and an Amplatz 260 cm Extra stiff wire
with
floppy 7 cm tip shaped like a pigtail to avoid injuring the
ventricle
was delivered to the left ventricle through the pigtail
catheter. The
pigtail was withdrawn. A temporary pacing cath
