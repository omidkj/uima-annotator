PARAESOPHAGEAL LN (C11-27422J)

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Lymph node, Level 8, dissection (A):  One lymph node with no
malignancy identified (0/1).

2.  Esophagus and stomach, esophagogastrectomy (B-Q, V-X):

- Well-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma with treatment
effect; see synoptic report.

- High grade dysplasia in a background of Barrett's esophagus.

3.  Lymph node, Level 7, dissection (R):  Two lymph nodes with
no malignancy identified (0/2).

4.  Esophageal donut, excision (S):  Segment of esophagus with
unremarkable squamous mucosa.

5.  Gastric donut, excision (T):  Segment of stomach with
unremarkable fundic type mucosa.

6.  Fundus, stomach, excision (U):  Segment of stomach with
unremarkable fundic type mucosa.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive
esophagectomy.  He tolerated the procedure well and returned to
the SICU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics
and his pain was well controlled.  His rhythm varied between SB,
Afib and ST.  (Prior to induction his rate was in the high 30's
with a normal BP and he was asymptomatic.)

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His Lopressor and digoxin were given IV post op
and generally he remained in NSR.  His tube feeding were started
on post op day 3 and cycled over an 18 hour period.  His blood
sugars were in the high 170's - 200 and he required sliding
scale insulin coverage.  A HgA1C was 7.3%.  A barium swallow was
done on [**2163-5-26**] and demon started no anastomotic leak and he was
subsequently started on full liquids (diabetic diet) which he
tolerated well in small amounts.  He will be advanced to soft
foods in [**3-11**] days.

His port sites were healing well and he was able to effectively
use his incentive spirometer.  He did require occasional
nebulizers to help him cough up secretions and his oxygen is
still being weaned.  He will need to continue tube feedings
until he can demonstrate a consistently adequate oral intake.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will re evaluate this in a few weeks.  In the interim
he is being transferred to rehab to increase his mobility,
endurance and continue tube feedings.

He was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service and they
recommended a short stay at rehab, for which the patient was
discharged to the [**Location (un) 8545**] facility.
