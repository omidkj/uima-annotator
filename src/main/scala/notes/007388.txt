History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo WF with a PMHx of advanced [**1-27**] progressive MS,
chronic indwelling foley, h/o pe on coumadin who p/f personal
care home with AMS
.
The patient's last admission was [**2196-5-22**] who was admitted for
AMS and acute on chronic lethargy.  They dx her with toxic
metabolic encephalopathy [**1-27**] to UTI and mrsa follicullitis (she
had a dermatomal rash).  She was treated with vancomycin, she
improved was transitioned to orals bactrim and doxycycline and
was d/c.
.
The following history was obtained from an LPN named [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 3073**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3074**].  She states that since the patient
prior admission she never returned to her baseline.  The patient
seems to have a waxing and wanning mental status.  She denies
seeing the patient have twitching movements or signs of
infection such as recent diarrhea, fever or cough.  Temps at [**Hospital1 1501**]
ranged from 99.2-99.4.  The patient recently history is notable
for non-compliance both when she is oriented and when she is
not.  She refuses UA evalaution and also refuses suprapubic
care.  It is not clear when the last time her supr-pubic cath
was changed.  Starting the day of admission, the patient was
incoherent, was unable to swallow her pills and was salivating.
she was deemed usafe to be at her home and was sent to the ED
and [**Hospital1 **].
.
The patient arrived to the ED and was intially minimally
responsive.  Per the ED reports she improved while there from a
MS perspective.  They did an I and D of the area around her SP
cath and it was sent for culture which showed GPC in  pairs and
GPR.  BC and Urine cultures were sent.  The patient HCT showed
nothing acute and her CXR was wnl.  The patient was given
levofloxacin and sent to the floor.

Relevant labs:
[**7-20**] Skin biopsy:
Focal spongiosis, focal follicular neutrophilic parakeratosis,
sparse superficial perivascular dermatitis with rare
eosinophils, and mild papillary dermal edema.  The changes are
mild and non-specific.  The finding of neutrophilic
parakeratosis at a follicular ostium (slide L1-2) is suggestive
of seborrheic dermatitis.  While the anatomic site is somewhat
unusual, a seborrheic dermatitis-like drug eruption is possible.
 Seborrheic dermatitis may occur more frequently with some
medical disorders including epilepsy.  PAS stain is negative for
fungi.  Clinical-pathologic correlation is recommended.

Microbiology:

[**2196-7-9**] 1:30 pm URINE   FROM CATHETER
   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2196-7-12**]):
      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Piperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing confirmed

reported if
      present. Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa
