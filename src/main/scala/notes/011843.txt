Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Vasotec / Cortisporin / Ciloxan / Atenolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement [**2168-3-4**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 year-old woman with a history of CAD, HTN,
CHF, DM, and recent hospitalizations for NSTEMI/CHF exacerbation
([**2168-1-22**]) and generalized weakness ([**2168-2-10**]), who now presents
with increasing dyspnea on exertion and weight gain x 2 days.
The patient was discharged from rehab 4 days ago.  She states
that she felt well over the weekend but noticed increasing
swelling in her legs over the past 2 days.  VNA noted a 7lb
weight gain over the past 2 days.  The patient reports fatigue
and shortness of breath with minimal exertion (walking a short
distance to the bathroom) since this morning.
.
She denies chest pain, chest pressure, fever, and chills. She
notes a baseline cough that has not changed.  She denies dietary
indiscretion (including canned soup, [**Location (un) 6002**] meats, fast food,
excess salt) and reports compliance with all medications.  She
does think that her furosemide dose is lower than it was before
the last admission.  She was was on 40mg TID prior to the
[**2168-2-10**] admission but was discharged on 40mg daily and
continues to take this lower dose.  Per her family, the patient
has not been herself ever since the [**Month (only) 1096**] admissions.  They
note that she has been fatigued and less active.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted on [**2168-1-22**] for hyperkalemia.
While inpatient, she was found to have an NSTEMI.  Cath showed
non-intervenable two vessel disease, which was managed medically
with beta blocker, aspirin, plavix, statin and blood pressure
control.  She was also treated for CHF exacerbation.  The
patient was admitted again on [**2168-2-10**] for fatigue and
generalized weakness, thought to be due to a combination of poor
glycemic control, orthostasis, and deconditioning.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T: 96.5 BP: 135/33 RR: 22 O2Sat: 95% RA.
Patient was given 40mg IV lasix, 15mg kayexalate, and 2gm IV
ceftriaxone.  CXR showed intestitial edema and a small right
pleural effusion.  ECG showed sinus bradycardia, no peaked T
waves, unchanged from priors.
.
Currently, the patient is sitting in bed comfortably.  She
denies SOB at rest.  She complain of thigh pain (chronic issue).

CXR [**2168-3-1**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-1**], there is
increasing
opacification involving portions of the right, mid and lower
lung zone,
consistent with pneumonia. A small area of opacification in the
retrocardiac region on the left could represent a second focus
of infection. The pulmonary vessels are not well defined,
raising the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in
this patient with persistent enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F with h/o history of CAD, HTN, CHF, DM, and recent
hospitalizations for NSTEMI/CHF exacerbation presents with
increased DOE, leg swelling and weight gain.
.
# Respiratory Distress/Pneumonia: Patient was admitted with
shortness of breath, and LE edema. She was found to have
significant expiratory wheezes on exam and was started on
Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer treatments and as well as IV Lasix
with some improvement of her shortness of breath. CXR
demonstrated R sided opacities c/w pneumonia and she was started
on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia
coverage. On hospital day 2, her dyspnea progressed and she had
some chest pain with EKG changes and was transferred to the CCU.
There, the patient required high flow O2 and her antibiotic
coverage was expanded to include Levofloxacin. Her oxygen
requirement persisted so Pulmonary was consulted. They
recommended chest CT, which demonstrated bilateral infiltrates
concerning for aspiration pneumonia and tracheobronchomalacia. A
video swallow evaluation did not support a diagnosis of
aspiration and she slowly improved with broad spectrum
antibiotics in the context of a negative flu swab and negative
blood cultures.  Her O2 was weaned to 2L of NC and she was
discharge to rehab after completing a 10 day course of
Vancomycin/Cefepime. She was discharged on Levofloxacin (day
[**10-21**]), bronchodilators, and close Pulmonary follow-up.
.
# NSTEMI: On hospital day two, patient developed [**9-20**] substernal
chest presure, consistent with prior epsiodes of angina. This
was associated with shortness of breath. An EKG demonstrated
sinus rhythm with ST depressions in V2, V3 and V4. ASA 325mg PO
and sublingual NTG were given with relief of chest pressure and
resolution of EKG changes. Later in the morning, she became
hypoxic (86% on 4L NC) and was placed on a venti mask. Repeat
EKG showed recurrence of the anterior ST depressions.  She was
given an additional dose of IV lasix
