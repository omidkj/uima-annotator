History of Present Illness:
70 y/o M with ESRD [**1-15**] DM, s/p transplant [**2180**] on double
immunosuppressive therapy, CHF, CAD,  afib on coumadin,
hypertension, who presented to the ED today with 1 episode
nausea, 3 days dry heaving. Had URI three weeks ago, did not
take prescribed zpack since resolving. Over last two weeks has
appreciated 14 pound weight gain. Went to daughter's wedding on
[**Hospital3 4298**], denies liberalizing diet, stuck to <2g Na
daily. Notes with weight gain now having SOB on climbing 1
flight of stairs, no orthopnea.

ROS Denies chest pain, pressure, palpitations, cough, fevers, or
chills. He has been gaining some weight. He does urinate, but is
unclear as to whether or not the amount of urine he produces has
changed. He has a diabetic right foot ulcer, which was recently
debrided by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**], vascular surgery recommended but deferred
by patient given history dye alllergy (kidney failure).

Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **]-[**2189-6-14**] for
acute kidney injury and volume overload. His presenting
creatinine was 3.5, and he required two dialysis sessions to
stabilize his renal function and volume overload. His renal
failure was ultimately felt to be multifactorial, including
issues with volume and medication effect. This hospitalization
was also notable for GI bleeding in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR; anticoagulation was held then eventually
restarted prior to discharge.
Full 10-system review otherwise negative except as noted above

In the ED intial VS were T 02: 95%RA BP: 80/60 transiently to
140/78 without intervention. T:97
