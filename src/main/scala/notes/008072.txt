Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, Fever, Hypotension, Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Access, [**2158-11-29**]

History of Present Illness:
89 year old male with recent gastrointestinal bleeds attributed
to gastric ulcer, status post mechanical aortic valve
replacement on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease, history of
NSTEMI in [**7-11**], who presented from [**Hospital **] rehab with fevers and
anemia. Of note, patient has a history of GI bleeds of unknown
etiology, so receives periodic transfusions at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Earlier this week, he was noted to have HCT of 21. He was given
2u PRBCs over 2 days on [**1-23**] and [**1-24**]. On [**1-28**] he had a T
101.8 with dry, non productive cough. On morning of admission, T
99.6, HR 96 BP 80/60 RR 24. 95% on RA. He became tachycardic
with HR 147 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 P 147 BP 89/57 RR 32 O2 99%
on RA. Patient became febrile to T 101, BP in 70s, HR in 150s.
This persisted for 2 hours despite 1.5L IV fluids. There was
some delay in transfusing the patient given crossmatching
requirements. Once the patient received 1u PRBCs, BP normalized,
as high as 160s. HR came down to 100s. Patient was notably
guaiac negative.
A CT Abdomen was performed to eval for mesenteric ischemia,
which was negative. The patient was given Vanc, Levo, Flagyl
empirically with concerns for sepsis.
A R IJ was placed in the ED.
.
After receiving 1.5L IVFs and 1u PRBCs, patient sounded slightly
fluid overloaded on exam. He was given 40mg IV lasix, and put
out 400cc urine.
.
Vitals prior to transfer were HR 105, BP 117/54  RR 22 O2 100%
on 5L nc.
.
On the floor, patient says that he feels weak. Denies pain. But
cannot provide further history.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest
pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.

Microbiology:
Blood Cx: pending
Urine Cx: pending

Studies: Interstitial abnormality in the right lung including a
central bronchial cuffing and basal septal thickening is
probably pulmonary edema though heart is normal size and there
is no pleural effusion. The patient has had a cardiac valve
replacement, probably aortic.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 yom with history of GI bleeds, presenting with anemia,
hypotension, tachycardic episode in the ED, concerning for
septic shock.
.
# Hypotension, Tachycardia: patient had SBPs in 70's, with HR in
150's, along with documented fever at rehab and in the ED,
initially concerning for septic shock. The most likely source
was thought to be pneumonia given tachypnea and fevers; however,
there was no clear initial infiltrate on chest x-ray. CT abdomen
was performed evaluating for additional source of infection but
was negative. Patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for
HCAP and Tamiflu for possible H1N1 infection. A nasal pharyngeal
aspirate was obtained for flu and was negative. Tamiflu was
discontinued. Urine legionella Ag was also obtained and was
negative. Cardiac enzymes were cycled, trended upward and
rapidly declined without MB fraction change, attributed to
likely demand ischemia. Patient received 1 unit of PRBC's for
demand ischemia. Patient was transiently started on pressors for
BP support but was quickly weaned off on day 2. By day 3, BP was
stable 110's and patient remained in NSR in 80's. ECHO was
performed to evaluate Aortic Valve which was unremarkable.
.
# Macrocytic Anemia: HCT 21. Patient has h/o of melanic stools,
though with recent Colonoscopy, EGD, and capsule study without
obvious source. Guaiac negative in the ED. Other etiologies that
were entertained included hemolysis [**3-6**] mechanical valve vs.
auto-immune process, vs. MDS. Initial haptoglobin was < 5.
Patient also had h/o hemolysis [**3-6**] amoxacillin. Patient
initially presented with pancytopenia which was felt to result
from MDS. SPEP, UPEP were performed. Coombs test was performed
and was possitive, suggesting auto-immune process.
.
# Aortic mechanical valve: patient on coumadin as outpatient
which was held for concern of bleeding. At the time of
discharge, INR remained therapeutic and Coumadin remained held.
.
# Respiratory status: Patient hypoxic in the ED in the setting
of IV fluids and PRBCs. CXR was consistent with mild fluid
overload. Patient was tachypneic, though denied discomfort. JVP
not obviously elevated, no crackles on exam. ABG in ED within
normal limits. Patient was diuresed with several boluses of IV
lasix with good output. Patient maintained good oxygen sats and
was saturating at 96% on RA at the time of discharge.
.
# CAD s/p NSTEMI: CP free. However hypotension and tachycardia
could be in the setting of new ischmic event. Cardiac enzymes
were cycled.  Troponins initially increased but quickly
decreased not accompanied by MB fraction.  This was thought to
have resulted from demand ischemia.  Patient was continued on
outpatient statin and metoprolol.
