HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
female, status post aortic valve replacement in [**2147**], and
[**2157**], with severe mitral stenosis referred for
catheterization because of worsening dyspnea.  In [**2147**], she
underwent a porcine aortic valve replacement at [**Hospital6 **]. She was well until [**2157**], when she had again dyspnea
and severe paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.
Catheterization revealed severe aortic insufficiency and she
underwent aortic valve replacement with St. Jude valve.

She did well until she suffered again dyspnea.  An
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55 to 60%,
increased right ventricular size, severe mitral stenosis, MPA
of 0.9 cm2, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, 1+ pulmonary regurgitation, and an ETT
revealed no electrocardiographic changes or chest pain and a
fixed inferolateral defect and no signs of ischemia.

In [**2167-4-16**], catheterization laboratory procedure revealed
pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery pressure of
67/18 and 1+ aortic regurgitation and significant mitral
stenosis and calcification of the mitral valve annulus.  On
[**2167-6-2**], she was catheterized at the [**Hospital1 190**]  and found to have severe mitral stenosis and
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  She was brought back to the
catheterization laboratory in 08/00, where she had a
successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty.

She presented to the [**Hospital 31429**] Medical Center with shortness of
breath and congestive heart failure, general body aches.  She
ruled in for a myocardial infarction that day with positive
troponin and a Cardiolite scan revealed a very large area of
fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior myocardium
which extends into the septum and lateral myocardium. No
reversible defects were seen.

In [**10-22**], an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
40%, anteroseptal akinesis, moderate and severe mitral
stenosis, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency,
no significant gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve,
3+ tricuspid regurgitation and 1+ pulmonary insufficiency.

She is unable to walk more then fifteen steps currently and
she states she has occasional palpitations.  She denies
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication,
dizziness, light-headedness on this admission as of [**2168-12-20**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Ex-smoker.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Cerebrovascular accident with residual left eye
blindness.
6.  Mitral stenosis.
7.  Pulmonary hypertension.
8.  Colon polyps found on colonoscopy two years ago.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  In [**2147**], aortic valve replacement with porcine valve.
2.  In [**2157**], St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve replacement.
3.  Status post hysterectomy.
4.  Status post cholecystectomy.
5.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amaryl 2 mg q.d.
2.  Glucophage 500 mg t.i.d.
3.  Avandia 4 mg q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.
5.  Cozaar 50 mg q.d.
6.  Coumadin 2 mg for two days and 4 mg the third day,
rotating.
7.  Toprol 25 mg q.d.
8.  Lasix 20 mg q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  As of [**2168-12-16**], INR was 3.0.  Complete
blood count revealed white count 5.3, hematocrit 40.3, and
platelets 168,000.  Chem7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 5.3,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 27, blood urea nitrogen 35,
creatinine 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic
surgical unit and the decision was made to take the patient
to the operating room on [**2168-12-26**], for a mitral valve
replacement, #27 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**], for the diagnosis of severe mitral
insufficiency.  Postoperatively, the patient was transferred
to the unit in atrial fibrillation and she was intubated.
She was on pressors and insulin drip as well as sedation.

The patient, [**2168-12-28**], postoperative day two, was off her
pressors and was transferred to the floor without
complications after successful extubation in the unit.  She
had a chest tube in place as well as her wires.  On [**2168-12-29**],
she was placed on a low Heparin drip to begin anticoagulation
in addition to her Coumadin and rehabilitation again seeing
her.  Her wires were taken out on [**2168-12-30**].  On [**2168-12-31**], her
chest tube was discontinued.  Unfortunately, her intravenous
access was less than ideal and she was started on Lovenox and
the Heparin was discontinued until she was over 2.0 for the
INR.  On [**2169-1-1**], her INR reached 2.9.  The Lovenox was
discontinued and she was given Coumadin only.  On discharge,
the patient is in excellent condition, [**2169-1-1**], and ready
for discharge on [**2169-1-2**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin titrated for an INR of 3.0 to 3.5.
2.  Calcium Carbonate one gram per day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Magnesium p.r.n. as needed.
5.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Avandia 4 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9.  Amaryl 2 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Percocet p.r.n. for pain.
11. Fleets enema.
12. Dulcolax p.r.n.
13. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
14. Regular insulin sliding scale of 150-200 three units
subcutaneous, 201-250 six units subcutaneous, 251-300 nine
units subcutaneous.

She should continue Lasix until such time as she reaches a
weight less than her preoperative weight, ideally ten days.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   The patient was discharged in good
condition.  Her physical examination reveals that any
serosanguinous drainage that might have occurred over her
incision has stopped.  Post chest tube chest x-ray shows no
pneumothorax.  The patient is doing well.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P:  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] after
rehabilitation, as well as her primary care physician and her
cardiologist.
