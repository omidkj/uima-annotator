Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amitriptyline / Norvasc

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy x 4-5 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Intubation [**2146-2-17**]
- Extubation [**2146-2-18**]
- PICC placement [**2146-2-18**]
- PICC removal [**2146-2-21**]


History of Present Illness:
67 y/oM with PMH CAD, afib, DM, spinal cord atrophy who
presented to the ED with lethargy x 4-5 days and was found to be
hypoxic with presumed multifocal PNA and afib in RVR.

For the past 4-5 days, patient has been complaining of fatigue
with decreased PO intake.  Also developed wet cough productive
of clear sputum.  On the day prior to admission, his caregiver
found him unable to get off the commode and tilting to the left.
 Today, he was too tired to get out of bed so his partner [**Name (NI) 4662**]
him to the [**Name (NI) **].

In the ED, initial VS: 13 98.8 104 139/98 32 86% 4L NC.  He
triggered for hypoxia and was placed on 100%NRB with sats rising
to 100%.  CXR revealed multiple patchy opacities in left lung,
blood and urine cultures were drawn and patient was given dose
of vancomycin/ levofloxacin.  Neurology was consulted given
trunchal ataxia on exam and did not feel that presentation was
consistant with an acute intracranial event, recommending
treating underlying illness.  ED course c/b development of afib
with RVR with HR in the 160-180s.  Despite 50mg total of
diltiazem IV, HR did not improve significantly.  Given
hemodynamic instability, patient admitted to the ICU for further
monitoring.

Imagings
CXR ([**2146-2-7**]): Markedly limited study. There is suggestion of a
dense
consolidation of the left lower and mid lung zones. This may
represent
pneumonia. If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views
in the
radiology suite for better characterization.

CT Head ([**2146-2-7**]):
1. Prominent ventricles, non-[**Last Name (LF) 61910**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent normal
pressure
hydrocephalus in the appropriate clinical setting. Clinical
correlation
recommended.
2. No other acute intracranial process identified.

TTE ([**2146-2-9**]): Mild symmetric LVH with normal regional and
global biventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**2146-2-10**]): Worsening right upper lobe and left mid and
lower lung opacities, consistent with worsening pneumonia.

CXR ([**2146-2-18**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
minimal
improvement of the pre-existing mainly perihilar and left
lateral parenchymal opacities. The extent of the retrocardiac
atelectasis, potentially combined with a small pleural effusion,
is unchanged.  On the right, the parenchymal opacities have
apparently decreased in extent.  No evidence of newly appeared
parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
Unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric
tube.
