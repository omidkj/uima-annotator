HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48587**] is a 74 year-old
male with a significant cardiac history who presented for
elective cardiac catheterization after having progressive
anginal symptoms.  He has experienced increasing dyspnea on
exertion and left chest pressure at rest and exercise
tolerance test with imaging in [**2176-12-15**] showed a fixed
anterior and inferior defect.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2159**] and [**2161**].
2.  Tachybrady syndrome status post pacer placement.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Status post cerebrovascular accident times two.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
7.  Peripheral vascular disease.
8.  Depression.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg po q.d.
5.  Cartia XT 120 mg po q.d.
6.  Amiodarone 200 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.
8.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
9.  Pletal 100 mg po q.d.
10.  Insulin NPH 50 units subq q.a.m., 10 units subq q.p.m.
11.  Nitro patch 0.4 micrograms per hour from 8:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m.
12.  Prozac 20 mg po q.d.
13.  Alphagan 0.15% two drops OS q.d.
14.  ................... 0.1% solution one drop OU b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a heart rate of 62,
blood pressure 120/70, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room
air.  General, the is alert and oriented times three.  There
were no carotid bruits and no elevation in his JVD.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was benign.
Extremities had no edema.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  CBC showed a white blood cell count of
8.6, hematocrit 41.2, platelets 186.  Panel 7 was significant
for a BUN of 28 and a creatinine of 1.6.  Electrocardiogram
showed ventricularly paced rhythm at 60 beats per minute with
left axis deviation and left bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient
received intravenous hydration and Mucomyst in preparation
for his coronary catheterization.  Coronary catheterization
revealed a normal left main coronary artery, left anterior
descending with a 50% mid and total occlusion of the D1 with
left to left collaterals, left circumflex with 70% and 90%
obtuse marginal one lesion, and right coronary artery with a
total occlusion with left to right collaterals.  The 90%
obtuse marginal one lesion was intervened on and stented
successfully.  He was brought to the floor in stable
condition and rehydrated with 2 liters of fluid.  Over the
course of 12 hours the patient had very little urine output
and may have missed some of his antihypertensive medications.
At midnight the patient awoke from sleep with severe
tachypnea and dyspnea.  He was noted to be hypertensive with
systolic blood pressures in the 200s and hypoxic with oxygen
saturations only reaching 80% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.

He was tachypneic in the 40s and an arterial blood gas at the
time demonstrated a pH of 7.16, PCO2 76 and PO2 of 64.
Electrocardiogram showed no acute ischemic changes in the
presence of his baseline left bundle branch block.  Physical
examination demonstrated crackles throughout and he was
treated with 16 mg of intravenous Lasix, nitroglycerin drip
and morphine with little improvement in his clinical status.
Chest x-ray was done and the patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further care on BIPAP ventilation.
Chest x-ray demonstrated pulmonary edema.  The patient's
nitroglycerin drip was titrated upward for a better blood
pressure control.  With BIPAP ventilation, the patient's
arterial blood gas improved with the following results:  pH
7.28, PCO2 58, PO2 130.

The patient's antihypertensive medications were restarted,
and with better blood pressure control the patient's
pulmonary status improved.  The etiology of the pulmonary
edema was thought to be severe hypertension causing flash
pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction.  Serial cardiac
enzymes were drawn and the patient ruled in for myocardial
infarction with a peak CK of 5/74.  This was thought to be
due to demand and not an acute coronary syndrome.  On the day
following the acute hypoxic event the patient was weaned off
of his BIPAP and maintained good oxygen saturations with face
mask.  He was quickly weaned to room air and had no further
episodes of hypertension or pulmonary edema.  An attempt was
made to simplify his medication regimen.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary edema.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Status post obtuse marginal stenting.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Obstructive sleep apnea.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. times nine months.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q.d.
4.  Atenolol 75 mg po q.d.
5.  Atorvastatin 20 mg po q.d.
6.  Digoxin 125 micrograms po q.d.
7.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
8.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
9.  Imdur 30 mg po q.d.
10.  Cilostazol 100 mg po q.d.
11.  Insulin NPH 50 units subq q.a.m. 10 units subq q.p.m.
12.  Fluoxetine 20 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient should follow up with his
primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] within one week.  He
should discuss his medications with his primary physician.
