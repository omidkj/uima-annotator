Pertinent Results:
Prebypass

1. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

2.There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

3.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

4.There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine and epinephrine.

1. LV systolic function is mildly depressed ( LVEF 45- 50 mmHg)

2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. Peak gradient is 36
mm Hg across the aortic valve.

3. Moderate mitral regurgitation persists.

4. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**4-24**] for further treatment of colitis and pre-op
workup. GI consult done. Cipro and flagyl continued per GI
recommendations for diverticulitis. On [**5-3**] Ms. [**Known lastname 82390**] went to
the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
x 2 (saphenous vein grafted to the obtuse
marginal/Post.descending artery)/Aortic Valve Replacement (#21mm
St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] [**Hospital1 599**] porcine)/Septal myomectomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass
time =97 minutes/Cross clamp time =77 minutes. Please refer to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] operative report for further details. She was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on  epinephrine and
propofol. She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated the
following morning. All lines and drains were discontinued in a
timely fashion. Beta-blocker was optimized per blood
pressure/heart rate tolerance. POD# 3 she was transferred to the
floor for further monitoring and progression. The remainder of
her postoperative course was essentially uneventful.  She
continued to progress. POD# 5 she was ready for discharge to
rehab for increase in strength, endurance and increased daily
