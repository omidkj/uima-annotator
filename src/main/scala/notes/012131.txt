Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Electrophysiology study
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
65 y/o M w/ CAD s/p DES to LCx [**9-7**] and recent [**9-/2137**] admission
for lateral NSTEMI medically managed, HTN, DM2, HL, and 50 pack
year smoking history, transfered from OSH s/p cardiac arrest.
Per OSH reports, arrest was witnessed by a friend who performed
CPR until EMS arrived. EMS arrived on scene within 10 minutes,
and per EMS report, pt was pulseless and apneic on kitchen
floor. CPR was administered, pt was noted to be in V-fib, was
shocked 3 times, and then found to be in asystole so he was
intubated in the field, given Epi and Atropine and started on
amiodarone drip + 300mg IV bolus. CPR was continued until
arrival to OSH where BP found to be 85/palp and sinus tachy 110.

At OSH, EKG showed diffuse ST depressions (V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,
Lead I along with ST elevation in aVR. Pt was started on heparin
drip. Prior to transfer, BP 160/87, HR 90s on assist control
vent with TV 600, PEEP 4, FiO2 100%.
.
Pt was tranferd to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent urgent cardiac cath.
Cardiac Cath revealed patent coronaries, preserved LV function,
markedly elevated filling pressures, pulmonary HTN. They
recommended CTA to rule out PE and echo.
.
Unable to obtain ROS since pt is intubated and sedated ,

CT head without contrast: [**2137-11-13**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect
or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and in
configuration. The mastoid air cells are clear. There is
circumferential mucosal thickening as well as inspissated
secretions seen in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoidal air cells
bilaterally and in the imaged portions of the maxillary sinuses.
The frontal sinuses are hypoplastic.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Bilateral paranasal sinus disease as above.
.
Echo: [**2137-11-14**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA chest: [**2137-11-15**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No indirect signs
of PE.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis. Bilateral basal right more than
left
additional parenchymal opacities which could be caused by
aspiration or early infection.
.
CT C-spine: [**2137-11-15**]
FINDINGS: There is no fracture or traumatic malalignment. The
craniocervical junction is intact. There is no prevertebral soft
tissue swelling, but note is made that the patient is intubated.


There are severe extensive multilevel degenerative changes
throughout the
cervical spine, as described below.

At C2-C3, there are mild degenerative changes with no spinal
canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

At C3-C4, there are posterior osteophyte formation and bilateral
facet
hypertrophy. No spinal canal stenosis is noted. There is mild
bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing, right more than left.

At C4-C5, there is a large posterior osteophyte formation. There
is moderate spinal canal stenosis. Bilateral facet hypertrophy
is noted with mild-to- moderate neural foraminal narrowing.

At C5-C6, there is large posterior osteophyte formation with
possible
concomitant calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament
(2:51 and 401B:22), which is causing severe spinal canal
stenosis and indentation of the thecal sac. Bilateral facet
hypertrophy is noted with bilateral mild neural foraminal
narrowing.

At C6-C7, there is posterior osteophyte formation and facet
hypertrophy
bilaterally. Mild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing is noted.
There is
moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the left. There is no
significant
neural foraminal narrowing on the right.

IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Multilevel extensive degenerative changes throughout the
cervical spine, which is more severe at C5-C6 with severe spinal
canal narrowing which is indenting the thecal sac.

Cardiac and chest MRI [**2137-11-18**]
Findings:
Structure and Function
There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium
appeared to have homogenous signal intensity. The pericardial
thickness was normal. There were no pericardial or pleural
effusions. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal. The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
enlarged. The right and left atrial lengths in the 4-chamber
view were mildly enlarged. The coronary sinus diameter was
normal.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.
The end-
diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 58% with normal
global systolic function. There was borderline
inferior/inferolateral wall hypokinesis. Cannot exclude mild
hypokinesis at the junction of the mid anterior septum and
anterior wall. The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall
thicknesses were both mildly increased. The left ventricular
mass index was normal. The right ventricular end- diastolic
volume index was normal. The calculated right ventricular
ejection fraction was normal at 61%, with normal free wall
motion. The aortic valve was tri-leaflet with normal valve area.


Quantitative Flow
There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow
demonstrated mild aortic regurgitation. The calculated mitral
valve regurgitant
