[**2156-10-27**] CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC R
CONCLUSION:

1. Multiple pelvic fractures as described above, fractures are
also seen
through the head of the right fibula, distal right tibia as well
as the right
calcaneum. Although not included in the scan suspected fractures
are also
seen in the bones of the hands as described above and dedicated
radiographs
would be helpful for further evaluation.

2. No vascular injury in the pelvic or the lower extremity
vasculature.

The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 1 p.m. on
[**2156-10-27**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

[**2156-10-27**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
CONCLUSION:

1. Small bilateral pneumothoraces, along with scattered
ground-glass
opacities likely representing a combination of aspiration and
pulmonary
contusion.

2. Linear lucency in the right lobe of the liver suggestive of a
laceration
as well as multiple linear lucencies in the right kidney, again
suggestive of
Grade II laceration.

3. Multiple vertebral body fractures as well as fractures of the
sacrum and
the iliac bone as described above. There is a prevertebral
hematoma along the
thoracic spine and also along the sacrum.

[**2156-10-27**] CT C-spine
FINDINGS: The vertebral alignment is unremarkable. There is no
fracture
seen. The prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. The
visualized lung
apices are unremarkable.

CONCLUSION: No acute bony injury.


[**2156-11-12**]   Radiology UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus of the right internal jugular
vein. No
deep vein thrombosis identified in the right arm.







Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedic, Spine and
Vascular surgery were consulted given his injuries. There was
concern for vascular injury in his right leg and he underwent a
CT angiogram which did not reveal any acute injury; upon exam he
was neurovascularly intact. He was taken to the operating room
for right tube thoracostomy and washout, debridement open tibia
wound to bone, arthrotomy with debridement of ankle,
intramedullary nail tibia fracture and closed reduction of the
humerus fracture with manipulation. There were no intraoperative
complications. He was later started on Lovenox per orthopedics
recommendation and will remain on this until discontinued by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Postoperatively he remained in the Trauma ICU sedated
and vented. He did have periods of agitation and was started on
Clonidine. He also required transfusion with packed cells early
during his stay for falling hematocrit and hemodynamic
instability. His last hematocrit was 28.7 on [**11-15**].

Spine surgery was consulted for his spine fractures, these were
nonoperative. He was fitted for a TLSO brace and this will need
to be worn at all times while he is out of bed. He will follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] in 4 weeks.

He was difficult to wean from the ventilator and the decision
was made to perform an open tracheostomy. He was eventually
weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to the regular
nursing unit. He was evaluated by Speech and Swallow and was
eventually placed on a regular diet. His tracheostomy was
removed at bedside on [**2156-11-17**] without any difficulties.

Because of his injuries there were some pain control issues; he
initially required IV narcotics and was later changed to
Methadone and Oxycodone which appear to be controlling his pain
adequately at this point.

He developed right arm swelling and there was concern for a
thrombus. He underwent ultrasound of his upper extremity which
revealed non-occlusive thrombus of the right internal jugular
vein but no deep vein thrombosis was identified in the right
arm. The swelling remains but has diminished.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and has
been recommended for acute rehab following his hospital stay.
Social work was also closely involved with patient and his
family throughout his course here as there were some reported
legal matters that the family was dealing with.
