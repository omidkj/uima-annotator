Evaluation for liver transplant

History of Present Illness:
64 yo M with h/o alcoholic and ?HCV cirrhosis transferred from
[**State 792**]Hospital for decompensated liver failure. Pt was
admitted to OSH [**2165-12-26**] for an elective TIPS procedure for
refractory ascites. Pt underwent TIPS on [**2165-12-26**] complicated
by liver laceration and massive hemorrhage requiring
transfusion. He subsequently underwent IR embolization of
superior medial liver segment via the right superior
subsegmental branch (segment 8). Following  embolization on [**12-27**]
the pt was transferred to the SICU, and on [**2165-12-28**] pt
underwent TIPS revision by IR using a covered endograft stent
extending the TIPS shunt slightly further into the main portal
vein, excluding part of the left portal vein and right portal
vein branches in an attempt to stop bleeding felt to be
originating at either the extracapsular portion of the shunt or
possibly a right posterior and inferior portal vein branch. Pt's
mental status continued to be poor following TIPS revision, and
lactulose was started for hepatic encephalopathy. He was finally
intubated on [**2166-1-3**] for worsening mental status and hypoxia.
Pt was treated for sepsis with broad spectrum abx and ?PNA, now
only being treated with zosyn. During the last week patient was
been more stable, weaning on his pressors (currently on
vasopress in only) and is being transferred for urgent
transplant evaluation. According to [**Location (un) **] pt had an episode
of seizure activity on transfer, for which he received 2mg of
ativan and this resolved.

Imaging:
CXR [**2-10**]:
Some air is now present within the left lung, though a large
left hemothorax is still present with mediastinal shift.
IMPRESSION: Some re-expansion of left lung. Mediastinal shift
persists.

CT OF THE CHEST: There is a large left pleural effusion,
distributed in
almost entire left hemithorax, leading to right-sided
displacement of
mediastinal structures. The remnant le
