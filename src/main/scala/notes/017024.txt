Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Referral from OSH for Aortic Stenosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, CVA, GI bleed, AS,
iron dificiency anemia who presented to an OSH s/p fall and on
TTE was found to have aortic stenosis.
.
The patient reports he was trying to get up from the toilet and
fell and hit the back of his head sustaining a laceration. He
reports that he believes that while standing he felt
light-headed which caused him to fall. He believes he had
transient loss of consciousness after the fall. He denied CP,
palpitations, melena, hematochezia at the time. He does report
shortness of breath that has been worsening over time. He is
unsure of how far he can walk, b/c he simply does not walk
frequently anymore, limited by generalized fatigue. He reports
he is on 2L oxygen at home.
.
At the OSH, he was initially admitted for managment and
evaluation of mechanical fall and failure to thrive. A chest
xray revealed bilateral pleural effusions. He subsequently had a
CT of the chest which confirmed significant bilateral pleural
effusions with compressive atelectasis, old granulomatous
disease and an enlarged heart. A thoracentesis was performed
under ultrasound and 1050 cc of clear yellow fluid was drained
consistent w/ transudate effusion. Gram stain and culture of the
pleural fluid were negative. It appears there was discussion
whether the patient could be in failure. A BNP reportably was 29
around the time of admission. Cardiology was consulted
(Papgeorgio). He was diuresed approximately 2.5 Liters w/ IV
lasix 30mg q12 hs. A TTE demonstratd aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation. Arrangements for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] were made for
w/u for possible AVR.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were 97.5 108/60 96 18 98%
on 3L. He was comfortable and denied CP, shortness of breath at
rest.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denied exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations.

IMAGING:
[**2120-5-4**] CXR: FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but
there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Moderate pleural
effusions persist bilaterally, right greater than left, with
adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Mild-to-moderate gastric distension is seen in the upper
abdomen.
.
[**2120-5-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial injury.
.
[**2120-5-3**] TTE: LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely

regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

evidence of a stenosis. There was aspiration with thin barium as
well as penetration with all consistencies of barium
administered.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin barium and penetration with all

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, history of
stroke (CVA), GI bleed, aortic stenosis, iron deficiency anemia
who presented to an OSH status post fall and was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.  He was felt
not to be a surgical candidate due to poor nutritional status.
