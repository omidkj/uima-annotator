Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted for same day surgery and underwent aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  He
received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics. On  [**6-27**] he
went to the Operating Room where aortic valve replacement was
preformed.  He remained stable and transferred to the ICU where
he awoke, was hemodynamically stable on extubated.

Postoperatively he was very confused and disoriented.  He
moaned, called out and was somewhat uncooperative.  Haldol and
Ativan were given and over the course of several days he
improved and cleared neurologically returned to baseline.

He was restarted on propafranone, but atrial fibrillation
developed and persisited. CTs and pacing wires were removed per
protocol.  He was begun on Coumadin and after two days of 3mg
the INR rose to 2.4.  Coumadin was held for a day and the INR
fell to 2.2 and 1mg of Coumadin was given on [**7-4**]. The INR was
1.8 on [**7-5**] and he should receive 1 mg again with a target INR
of 1.8-2.

The ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation was 110 for
several days despite 50 mg of Lopressor three times daily.  BP
was low at 95, although he felt well.  He received a 1mg total
load of Digoxin and Lopressor was decreased to [**Hospital1 **]. 0.125mg of
Digoxin daily was then begun and the ventricular rate decreased
to 60-80 for the most part and the BP was ~100 systolic.

On [**7-5**] he felt well, his exam was unremarkable and he
transferred to [**Hospital **] Nursing and Rehab for further recovery.
