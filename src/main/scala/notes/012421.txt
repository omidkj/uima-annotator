Service:  Trauma Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
male with a significant past medical history who is status
post a rear-end motor vehicle collision.  The patient was a
restrained driver with positive airbag deployment, and no
loss of consciousness.

The patient was taken to an outside hospital where it was
determined per head computed tomography that he had a left
subarachnoid hemorrhage and an INR of approximately of 2.9;
however, the patient was neurologically intact.

At the outside hospital, the patient was transfused 2 units
of fresh frozen plasma and then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].

The patient was alert and oriented and hemodynamically stable
on transport; refusing to wear a neck collar.  In the trauma
bay, the patient was complaining of some neck stiffness as
well as a headache.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy (with catheterization in [**2167-8-29**] shown no coronary artery disease but an ejection
fraction of 28%; and a repeat echocardiogram done in [**2168**]
showed an ejection fraction of 40% to 50%).
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Supraventricular tachycardia/ventricular tachycardia
fossae; status post ablation on [**2168-2-22**].  Now with
automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Hiatal hernia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Lasix 40/20 mg by mouth every other day.
 4.  Diovan 80 mg by mouth q.p.m.
 5.  Coumadin 5 mg by mouth q.p.m.
 6.  Nexium 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Spironolactone 12.5 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Coreg 6.25 mg by mouth twice per day.
10.  Doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice per day (for 10 days
of every month).

ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN (which causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a smoker, but he quit
tobacco 17 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
[**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale was 15.  His temperature was 95.7, blood
pressure was 133/68, heart rate was 74, respiratory rate was
18, and oxygen saturation was 96%.  On general physical
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Tympanic membranes were clear.  There
was a small abrasion noted on the forehead and the nose.  The
face was stable.  Neck examination revealed the trachea was
midline with no crepitus.  There was a noted left
subclavicular incision with automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator, and the incision was well healed.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  It was
stable with no crepitus.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  The abdomen was obese, soft, and nontender.  FAST
examination was negative.  Rectal examination revealed normal
tone and guaiac-negative.  No extremity deformities were
noted.  No edema was noted.  The neurologic examination was
nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed coagulations with a prothrombin time of 20.3,
partial thromboplastin time was 27.3, and INR was 2.7.
Otherwise, laboratories were unremarkable.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no
widening of the mediastinum or pneumothorax.

Pelvic films showed no fracture.

A computed tomography of the cervical spine showed no
fracture.

A head computed tomography showed a small subarachnoid
hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure without any midline
shift, and no fractures were noted.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained
neurologically intact despite the subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Given that the INR was originally 2.7, fresh frozen plasma
was infused and vitamin K was administered.

Neurosurgery was consulted who recommended fresh frozen
plasma to get the INR less than 1.3, as well as INR checks
every four hours, and keeping his blood pressure less than
140 systolic, as well as repeating a head computed tomography
in the morning.

The patient was infused with a total of 4 units of fresh
frozen plasma and vitamin K times three days.  The INR
progressively decreased to 1.3 by hospital day two.  The
repeat head computed tomography done on hospital day two
showed a stable subarachnoid hemorrhage with no change, and
again no midline shift.

The patient's covering cardiologist saw him during this
hospitalization on day two.  After an evaluation, the
cardiologist recommended continuing his current cardiac
medications; and therefore keeping his blood pressure at less
than 140 systolic, and agreed with the reversal of
anticoagulation for the subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient remained stable from a cardiac standpoint as
well; without developing any chest pain, or difficulty
breathing, or hypoxia during his hospital stay.  The patient
blood pressures did at times creep over the 140s; however, on
hospital day three, the patient's blood pressures were very
stable with a systolic of around 110.

On hospital day three, the patient remained stable both
neurologically and from a cardiac standpoint.  Therefore, the
decision was made that the patient was suitable for discharge
to home with close Neurosurgery followup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Status post motor vehicle collision.
 2.  Left subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 3.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
 4.  History of congestive heart failure.
 5.  Atrial fibrillation; now in sinus rhythm.
 6.  History of supraventricular tachycardia/ventricular
tachycardia fossae; status post ablation with automatic
internal cardioverter-defibrillator.
 7.  Hypertension.
 8.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 9.  Hypercholesterolemia.
10.  Hiatal hernia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:

2.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.

every month).

The patient's Coumadin was to be held for approximately one
week.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Neurosurgery in
approximately one week.
2.  The patient's Coumadin was to be held until the patient
follows up with Neurosurgery; at which time the decision will
be made whether or not to restart the Coumadin.
3.  The patient was to follow up in the Trauma Clinic within
two weeks.
4.  The patient was to follow up with his personal primary
care physician/cardiologist within the next one to two weeks.
