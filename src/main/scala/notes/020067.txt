CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted for plasmapheresis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 13916**] is a 78-year-old
woman with a history of plasmacytoma of her left anterior
third rib, status post radiation therapy one year prior, who
underwent a bone marrow biopsy on [**2127-8-3**] which
demonstrated increased plasma cells.  She was also noted to
have a creatinine of 2.6 from her baseline value of 0.5 to
0.8 and was admitted for further treatment with
plasmapheresis to hopefully prevent further kidney damage.

Of note, the patient had a recent non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction in [**2127-5-24**] at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital with positive
enzymes and electrocardiogram changes in the inferior and
lateral leads.  Post infarction, she had a stress test which
reportedly showed no reversible ischemia.  A transthoracic
echocardiogram at that time confirmed an ejection fraction of
55% to 60%.  She also has a history of some pulmonary edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Plasmacytoma of the left anterior third rib.
2.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2120**].
3.  Anterior myocardial infarction in [**2127-5-24**].
4.  Congestive heart failure (with an echocardiogram
demonstrating an ejection fraction of 55% to 60%); presumed
diastolic dysfunction.  Left internal carotid artery stenosis
of 60% to 80%, right internal carotid artery stenosis high
grade.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Fibromyalgia.
8.  Spinal stenosis; status post surgery.
9.  Corneal transplant.

ALLERGIES:  CIMETIDINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **]
tobacco.  No alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is notable for father with
diabetes and daughter with cancer of the lung.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 60, blood
pressure was 122/50, respiratory rate was 24, and oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  In general, awake and alert,
in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed left eye with corneal transplant.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The
oropharynx with moist mucosal membranes.  The neck revealed
carotid bruits bilaterally.  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper
sternal border.  Pulmonary examination revealed crackles at
the left base.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  No bruits.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal
active bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  Skin examination revealed no rashes.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times
three.  Sensory and motor examinations were grossly within
normal limits.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 8.2, hematocrit was 31.6,
and platelets were 311. Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.8,
chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was
60, creatinine was 2.4, and blood glucose was 98.  Urine
protein to creatine was 5.3.  Creatinine clearance was 18.
Albumin was 3.8.  Calcium was 9.4 and phosphate was 5.4.
Prothrombin time was 13.1, INR was 1.2, and partial
thromboplastin time was 21.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  Ms. [**Known lastname 13916**] was admitted
for plasmapheresis for treatment of her kidney myeloma.  The
patient was given gentle fluid hydration for her acute renal
failure.

The patient underwent plasmapheresis on [**10-9**].
Treatment with medfalan and prednisone for her myeloma was
planned.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  On [**10-10**], the patient
developed her first episode of chest pain and shortness of
breath with electrocardiogram changes consistent with
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes demonstrated a creatine kinase of
158 and a troponin of
