Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the right
coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69500**] is 53 year old man with heavy smoking history and
chronic pancreatitis but no other cardiac risk factors who was
admitted to the CCU with a STEMI. Patient reported left arm pain
over the past week. Friday he was evaluated in the emergency
department for left arm pain, CT abdomen completed and was
unremarkable and EKG reassuring. Patient carries a diagnosis of
chronic pancreatitis. Given negatve work up and normal EKG
patient was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis/"gas pain" and
discharged home. Left arm pain continued intermittent and waxing
at first and without other associated symptoms and denying chest
pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, or DOE. He notes the
pain became more constant on friday night into morning of
admission. He reports the pain worsened, he developed heart burn
sensation, shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion Friday
night into the morning. Morning of admission he returned to [**Location **]
with worsening, constant left arm pain and heart burn symptoms.
EKG in the ED revealed ST segment elevations in leads II, III
and aVF (III>II) with also lateral V5, V6 ST segment elevations.
Patient was taken for emergent cardiac catherization. Cath
revealed occlusion of RCA which was stented.

In the cath lab, patient was Plavix loaded with 600mg, he had
already received 325mg PO Aspirin, Heparin and Integrillin drips
were started for continued left arm pain. Cath also revealed
proximal LAD disease and high Diag vs Ramus disease. He remained
hemodynamically stable and course was uncomplicated. right groin
was closed with angioseal.

On arrival to the CCU, patient appeared comfortable and in NAD.
He had residual left arm pain and symptoms of heart burn and so
patient was started on nitro drip. Hemodynamically stable with
SBPs in 130s and Hrs in 60s.

On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems was notable for current absence of
chest pain, no recent history of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
without
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis. The LAD had a
30%
proximal and 40% mid-vessel stenosis. The LCx was without
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis. The RCA had a
95%
mid-vessel and 40% distal stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
arterial
hypertension with transient bradycardia and hypotension resolved
with
0.5mg atropine. Left-sided filling pressure was mildly elevated
with
LVEDP of 24 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic arterial hypertension.
3. Elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 24 mmHg.

FINAL  -

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior
free wall,
