Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 26527**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
COPD, prostate cancer, CVA, s/p colostomy for bowel perforation
[**1-21**] C-Diff colitis.  He was transferred here for further
management of his intrabdominal infection and his myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**].  The night of admission on [**2157-6-11**], he was noted to have
grown progressively more weak and there was concern for
myasthenic crisis. Of note the patient was being tapered off
prednisone to promote wound healing at this abdominal incision.
The patients weakness progressed such that he had difficulty
moving the legs.  Given concern for respiratory depression, peak
flow was attempted and was 100.  It was decided he would need
closer monitoring for myasthenic crisis in an ICU setting.  ABG
prior to transfer pH 7.48 pCO2 38 pO2 82 HCO3 29.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU on [**2157-6-13**] for weakness and
monitoring for myasthenic crisis.  He failed a swallow eval on
[**2157-6-13**] and was also seen by surgery for evaluation of his
ostomy and remaining stay sutures.  The neuromuscular team also
evaluated him and followed him throughout his hospital course-
he had a 5 day course of IvIg from [**Date range (1) 27450**].  On the morning of
[**2157-6-14**] he was intubated for respiratory failure.  He finished a
course of broad spectrum antibiotics for his intraabdominal
infection.  His respiratory status improved and he was able to
be extubated on [**2157-6-21**].  He was able to clear secretions and was
out of bed to chair and had a stable respiratory status until
[**2157-6-28**] when he required BiPap for increased work of breathing.
On [**7-4**] he was reintubated.  During this time [**Date range (1) 23495**], he
became febrile and found to have GNRs in his blood and sputum
and developed VAP/pneumosepsis.  He was found to have resistant
pseudomonas and put on a 14 day course of Meropenem.  He
improved over the next week, with reassuring SBTs, and was
extubated on [**7-14**] but then reintubated later that night for
increased work of breathing.  He had a tracheostomy performed on
[**2157-7-20**].  During these weeks he received nutrition through a
[**Last Name (un) **]/oro-gastric tube, as a procedure for a percutanous gastric
tube was thought to be technically difficult and risky given his
anatomy and health status.  Briefly, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital/ICU
course by problem:

# Respiratory failure: Pt had tracheostomy performed on [**2157-7-20**]
after multiple re-intubations after failing extubation trials in
the setting of infection, generalized weakness, and myasthenia.

# Infection: Finished broad spectrum antibiotics, including
vancomycin, linezolid, flagyl, and fluconazole for peritonitis.
Treated for disseminated Pseudomonas infection with Meropenem,
s/p 14 day treatment.

# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Plastic Surgery and wound care nurses
have followed him for a stage 4 sacral decub.  Pt is s/p bedside
debridement on [**2157-7-18**]. Continue to do wet-to-dry dressings and
consult nutrition for maximization of nutrition for wound
healing.

#  Pain: Chronic pain unchanged, comfortable on fentanyl patch
plus morphine for breakthrough pain.

# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: Pt had course of IVIg in the hospital.
Cellcept held per neuromuscular recommendations in the setting
of disseminated infection. Neuromuscular states no need to
restart cellc
