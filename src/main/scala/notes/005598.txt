Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Upper GI bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy [**2186-2-11**]


History of Present Illness:
Original H & P is as per the ICU team
.
This is a 87 year-old female with a history of afib on coumadin
who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with 4 days of abd pain,
one episode of melena yesterday, and coffee ground emesis this
afternoon. Hct 18, INR >10, elevated LFTs esp alk phos, and
slightly elevated amylase and lipase. The ED there was unable to
pass an NG tube for lavage but an Abd CT for associated abd pain
and distension showed a mass vs fluid collection, suspicious for
blood, arising from the duodenum at the sphincter of Oddi,
compressing the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilatation. She
received 2 units PRBCs, FFP, vitamin K 10mg IV, and nexium 40mg
IV. She was reportedly hemodynamically stable and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] at the request of Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] (Surgery) for further evaluation
and treatment.

In the ED, she has been stable. Seen by surgery, who recommended
stabilization of any intra-luminal GI bleeding and correction of
anemia and coagulopathy prior to any operative management, and
also by GI, who agreed with ICU admission and plan to scope from
above tonight. Current VS 98.6, 120, 150/88, 26, 99% 2L. Has (3)
18G PIVs, Protonix gtt running.

ROS: Positive for mild jaundice, early satiety, constipation and
also pale stools for several weeks, intense pruritis at night
for 1-2 weeks, gradual 20 lb weight loss over the last year. She
had a spider bite on her left knee about a week ago. The patient
denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache.

ECG: Atrial ectopic rhythm at 125, nml axis, nml intervals, TWI

Imaging:
CXR (prelim read): Marked prominence of interstitial markings at
lung bases of unkown chronicity. Difficult to exclude airspace
consolidation at left lung base. Radiodense round foci
projecting over right upper lung may be external, though this is
unclear.

CT Abd/Pelvis (report from [**Location (un) 620**]): fluid collection vs mass
around duodenum suspicious for blood, ? arising from sphincter
of Oddi, with CBD dilatation as well as marked intra- and
extra-hepatic duct dilatation.

EGD:
Impression: Blood in the duodenum. Diverticulum in the second
part of the duodenum. Mass in the proximal second part of the
duodenum (injection). Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
87F with afib on coumadin presents with upper GI bleeding and
mass at the duodenum with dilated CBD.  EGD showing compressive
mass around duodenum highly suspicious for malignancy.

# Acute blood loss anema/Upper GI Source: Melena followed by
hematemesis is c/w upper GI bleeding; unable to pass NGT for
lavage at [**Location (un) 620**], but CT scan demonstrated a large mass vs
fluid collection, density suspicious for blood, involving the
duodenum with compression of the CBD with intrahepatic ductal
dilatation; an underlying malignancy may have eroded into a
vessel, bleeding both intraluminally and out of the lumen. INR
supratherapeutic >10 at OSH which likely precipitated the large
bleed. She had been given IV Vit K and FFP at the OSH and her
INR was < 2 by arrival here.  Treated with IV PPI, now changed
to po bid.  EGD done showing mass compressing 2nd part of
duodenum highly suspicious for malignancy. It was not biopsied
during the EGD due to concern for her bleeding risk.  There was
a question of this possibly being a pancreatic mass that was
impinging on the duodenum.  Upon discussion with her about
pursuing a diagnosis she expressed a wish for palliation and did
not wish to aggressively pursue diagnosis.  She said that she
would not want to pursue surgery, chemo or radiation.  The ERCP
team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt she could benefit from bile duct
stenting if she desired.  The patient remained asymptomatic
without abdominal pain.  She had received a total of 4 units of
PRBC (last ordered on [**2-12**]) and her Hct remained stable the rest
of her hospitalization.

# Bile duct dilitation: Likely cause of her elevated alk phos.
EGD as above.  CA19-9 was elevated to 4936.  CEA was negative.
Patient advised of possibilities including palliative
biliary/duodenal stenting vs. biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
Patient decided not to pursue aggresive testing.

# Atrial fibrillation: Held anticoagulation [**2-27**] active bleeding
and held diltiazem initially given bleeding which was restarted
day after admission.  She was restarted on diltiazem as her Hct
and SBPs have been stable.  the risks and benefits of
anticoagulation were discusssed with the patient.  The patient
decided that she would want coumadin at this time to prevent
CVA.  She understood that she may start to bleed again and that
this will need to monitored closely.  She will be discharged on
a lower dose of coumadin as she came in supratherapeutic.
