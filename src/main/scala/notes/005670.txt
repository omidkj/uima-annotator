Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 y.o. male nursing home resident who was
febrile to 103 and hypotensive to 80/56 on the morning of [**3-9**];
he had no specific complaints at that time.  On arrival to an
OSH ED, he remained febrile (104) and hypotensive (80/56).  He
was given IV fluids, started on vasopressin, and was sent to the
ICU.  In the ICU, peripheral dopamine was added; he then
achieved a BP of 105/49.  He was awake, alert, and complaining
of abdominal pain.  His exam was notable for mild LLQ pain with
a palpable mass; there was no rebound or hypoactive bowel
sounds.  His labs showed WBC of 9000 with 41% PMNs and 51%
bands, Hct 28% (from 30 earlier this month), lactate 2.8, AST
233, ALT 164, alk phos 767, total bili 2.8, direct bili 1.1,
amylase 45, creatinine 2.4 (baseline 1.7 earlier this month),
and Troponin-I 0.71.  His U/A was unremarkable save 150 mg
protein/dL.  A bedside RUQ U/S was of limited quality due to
patient movement but did show CBD dilatation (12 mm).  He was
given aztreonam [**2132**] mg IV, metronidazole 500 mg IV, vancomycin
1000 mg IV, levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and hydrocortisone 100 mg
IV.  Blood cultures were drawn and promptly grew gram negative
rods in 4 out of 4 bottles.  He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
Here an incomplete KUB showed a non-obstructive bowel gas
pattern; the lower abdomen and pelvis were excluded from view.
CXR showed increased interstitial markings bilaterally and no
pleural effusions.  A retrocardiac density was though to
represent atelectasis, but a focal area of consolidation was not
excluded.


Past Medical History:
1. bipolar disorder/depression with psychotic features
2. diabetes mellitus type 2
3. hypothyroidism
4. chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.7)
5. BPH

Brief Hospital Course:
An ERCP done yesterday (after two units of FFP were infused)
showed no evidence of choledocholithiasis.  The CBD was
cannulated and opacified with contrast; no large stone or
biliary tree strictures were seen.  There were no evidence of
extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no large
filling defects.  The cystic duct did not fill, due to either
obstruction or the use of low pressure contrast injection.  A
biliary stent was placed.
.
A post-ERCP right upper quadrant ultrasound shows gallstones and
a contracted gall bladder but no other abnormalities.
.
Serial CXRs have shown the evolution of moderate pulmonary edema
that has been stable for 24 hours; there are also small
bilateral pleural effusions, greater in the left, that are also
stable.  The left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity persists.
.
Clinically, the patient was weaned off of vasopressors on the
day of arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He has remained hemodynamically
stable, and his urine output has been excellent.  He has been
vigorously hydrated with IV fluids.  He was treated with
vancomycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole on
admission.  Once the gram-negative rod was identified as a
quinolone-resistant E. coli, his ciprofloxacin was stopped
(yesterday afternoon); Stress-dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100
mg IV q8h) as well as his baseline fludrocortisone were started
on admission and have been continued.
.
He currently feels tired from being disturbed all day but
otherwise denies focal complaints.  In particular, he denies
headache, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, n/v,
diarrhea, myalgias, or arthralgias. After meeting with patient
and family patients plan of care was changed to comfort measures
only. Plan to transition to hospice care at [**Hospital1 1501**].
