Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year old
female with a history of right upper lobe bronchiectasis.
She had a distant history at the age of 25 of aspirating some
vinegar which subsequently required hospitalization for
treatment of chemical pneumonitis.  Since then the patient
has had progressive respiratory problems.  Initially it
started with an active cough and eventually resulted in
chronic bronchitis and recurring infections.  These episodes
of recurring bronchitis started approximately ten years ago
and required intermittent antibiotics in the past three
years.  She has been on a constant stream of rotating
antibiotics for three weeks and off for one week.  The
patient reports that during the week that she was off of
antibiotics she began to feel sick, sleepy and developed a
fever which promptly went away when she reinitiated
antibiotic therapy.  The patient usually develops fever with
persistent cough building to episodes of bronchitis.  She has
never been admitted to the hospital for pneumonia but was
admitted two years ago with shortness of breath versus
pulmonary function course.  The patient denies any chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion or hemoptysis.  The patient has
been treated with Prednisone in the past but reports that it
did not help her and she wants to avoid it for fear of what
might happen to her with chronic steroid use.  The patient
uses inhalers occasionally but reports that they are of
minimal utility.

Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the floor.
Chest tube was discontinued on postoperative day #1.  On

the epidural was capped and the patient was started on
Percocet and Ibuprofen.  The patient reported very poor pain
control without the epidural and later in the day of
postoperative day #2, the patient's epidural was restarted
with straight local anesthetic with good effect.  Chest x-ray
on postoperative day #2 revealed no pneumothorax.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient's pain control was much
improved with local epidural which was later on in the day
discontinued and the patient was again started on Percocets
and Ibuprofen with moderate pain control.  In addition, the
