Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Mitral valve prolapse, coronary artery disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting with the saphenous vein
graft to the left anterior descending artery and to the
first obtuse marginal artery.
2. Mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm [**Doctor First Name 7624**]
pericardial model 2600 valve.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 82-year-old female with a history of dementia who was
noted dyspneic on exertion to the point where she is almost
wheelchair bound. She had work-
up which showed coronary artery disease involving the left
anterior descending artery and the first obtuse marginal artery,
as well as severe mitral regurgitation with valve segments of
the both the anterior and posterior leaflets. She also has
moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

After discussion with the patient and her family, it was felt
that she would benefit from mitral valve replacement, as well as
bypassing the coronary artery stenosis. The risks were explained
to the patient and her family, and they agreed to proceed.
