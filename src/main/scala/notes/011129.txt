Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 83761**] hospital for HD access and possible
need for TIPS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled right subclavian hemodialysis line placement


History of Present Illness:
43 yoM with EtOH liver disease and recent initiation of HD, who
is being admitted from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for poor venous access in
the setting of coagulopathy and possible TIPS procedure.  He was
was admitted on [**10-30**] after his HD catheter "slipped out" while
sleeping and had some bleeding.  On [**11-1**], he had a tunneled HD
cath placed by IR on the right, which was subsequently removed
for bleeding.  HD was attempted on [**11-2**] but could not be
comleted due to poor flow thorugh the line.  The line was
heparinized and then had some oozing requiring "multiple units"
of RBC, plts, FFP and DDAVP.  The catheter was removed and a
suture was placed on [**11-3**]; the bleeding subsequently stopped.
He was hypotensive with SBP to the 60's around this time for
which he was transiently on phenylephrine.
.
Prior to transfer on [**11-4**], he had two units FFP at 8 am for INR
1.9. He has not had HD in 8 days, though he has been stable on
room air and has had stable electrolytes.
.
On [**11-3**], he was started empirically on ceftazidime for possible
SBP (no tap done; benign exam always; added to vanco that was
previously started for for line infection; numerous blood and
urine cultures have been negative).
.
Of note, he had blood cultures from HD drawn on [**2168-10-22**] that
grew MRSA and was started on vancomycin.  At a clinic
appointment on [**2168-10-24**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10285**], he reported low BP and
temp to 103; he was started on a z-pack, though subsequently had
blood cultures that grew out MRSA. He was changed from lactulose
to rifaximin 400mg TID at this appointment given the degree of
his diarrhea.
.
Note that WBC noted to be 30.2 in an OMR note from GI on [**10-26**]
(this is from outside labs drawn at HD).
.
Also of note, patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 83762**]
with acute EtOH hepatitis and hematemesis, at which point he was
started on HD (though does have some residual urine function).
EGD showed [**Last Name (un) 27191**], erosive esophagitis and portal gastropathy
but no varices.

(#) EtOH abuse with h/o seziures ? during intoxication
(#) EtOH Liver disease-- acute EtOH hepatitis in [**8-26**] (was not
started on corticosteroids due to GI bleed, UTI and [**Last Name (un) **]); was

course from [**2168-9-26**] (last day [**2168-10-24**]); negative hepatitis A and
B serologies, as well as a hepatitis C serology
(#) Hemodialysis dependent-- since last admission, dx
multifactorial with ATN +/1 NSAIDs +/- HRS; getting HD through
tunneled line (until this admission) with HD MWF
(#) Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
(#) Seizures in setting of heavy alcohol consumption, seen by a
neurologist who did not feel that it was a primary seizure
disorder (first [**12-27**])

fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
43 yoM with EtOH liver disease and coagulopathy, on HD with no
access currently [**12-21**] line dysfunction and inability to replace
prior to transfer from OSH on [**2168-11-4**].

#. HEMODIALYSIS-DEPENDENT: Throughout hospitalization, legs
remained edematous but was breathing and speaking comfortably on
room air and electrolytes remained stable. Right subclavian
tunnelled line was replaced by IR on [**2168-11-7**]. There was some
slight oozing around the site, but hematocrit remained stable
s/p 2 units total PRBC during hospitalization. Patient last had
HD on [**2168-11-9**], next dialysis planned for Saturday [**2168-11-12**].
Continued on nephrocaps, Epogen. Held sevelemer on discharge.
Pentoxyfilline also stopped as no further indication for use per
renal (had finished one month course).

#. Elevated WBC: WBC had been elevated for several weeks now;
slightly hypothermic on admission although no localizing
symptoms and line had been pulled for a few days on admission.
Nonfocal exam; Ceftazidime was started empirically at OSH which
was not continued. He was otherwise afebrile and HD stable
throughout hospitalization (note his SBP's were in low 90's and
asymptomatic during his stay, likely his baseline). On
discharge, WBC was 11.3, patient asymptomatic and afebrile. He
has a blood culture from [**2168-11-4**] that is still pending and
should be followed up as outpatient.

#. MRSA BACTERMIA: Per blood cultures from hemodialysis line on
[**10-22**]; has been on vanco HD dosing starting in early [**Name (NI) 1096**]
(unclear exactly when). Line now pulled and completed 14 days of
Abx. Vancomycin was discontinued on discharge.

#. ETOH LIVER DISEASE: Also with h/o GIB (portal hypertensive
gastropathy and erosive esophagitis on recent EGD's; no
varices). Appeared to have slight encephalopathy on exam this
admission. No indication for TIPS acutely. Cont PPI, lactulose,
rifaximin.
