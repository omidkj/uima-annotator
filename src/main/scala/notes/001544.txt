Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Bactrim Ds

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
40 M with HIV (CD 4=664 in [**2169**] and 189 on [**2170-11-5**]) but no
history of opportunistic infections who presents with 2 days of
fevers to 102 for which he took tylenol. He had a cough
productive of clear sputum and back pain secondary to a deep
cutaneous abscess. He presented to the ED on [**2170-11-5**] with fever
and abscess. The abscess was I&D'd and he was given fluids for
tachycardia and oxacillin for abscess. He then abruptly dropped
his BP to 60's, a sepsis protocol was initiated and a total of 5
L fluid were given. A central line was placed, vanc, ceftriaxone
and dilaudid were given in the ED. Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring of hypotension and tachycardia. Blood cultures
from [**2170-11-5**] grew MRSA x 2. Surgery following. ID consulted for
antibiotic therapy and ?indications for propylaxis given low
CD4.

Past Medical History:
1. HIV: diagnosed in [**2158**], on ZDV/3TC/nevirapine (per OMR note
but patient denies ever being on HAART), currently no meds,
followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**]
2. Seasonal allergies
3. Right hand tendonitis
4. s/p T and A
5. Right knee cellulitis (MSSA, [**3-21**])
6. H/o strep pharyngitis, HSV, skin abscesses (per OMR)

Pertinent Results:
MRI [**11-19**]: Essentially stable appearance of soft tissue
edema/inflammation
without evidence of osteomyelitis or drainable abscess
collection. Slightly
heterogeneous signal within the dependent portions of the iliac
bones is non-
specific, and most likely represents hematopoietic marrow.

CT abdomen [**11-18**]: No intra-abdominal fluid collections.

CT chest [**11-14**]: Multiple nodular and focal patchy opacities
bilaterally of different sizes, many of which show evidence of
cavitation. The largest of these within the
right upper lobe although all lobes are affected. These findings
are
consistent with septic emboli. 2. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm. Tiny right-sided pleural effusion which is
layering posteriorly. 3. Gastric varices.

MRI Pelvis [**2170-11-7**]: No evidence of intraosseous infection.
CXR [**2170-11-7**] AP: Increased right pleural effusion with right
lower lobe atelectasis vs. PNA. Increased pulmonary edema vs.
diffuse infection.
CXR [**2170-11-6**] AP: Left upper lobe, right upper lobe infiltrates
suggestive of PMA. Diffuse intersitital opacities suggestive of
pulmonary edema vs. infxn

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  sacral abscess - Abscess was incised and drained in the ED.
Surgery consult obtained, and this was felt to be subcutaneous
abscess rather than pilonidal cyst.  Wound cultures grew out
MRSA.  Pt placed on vancomycin, ultimately for a 4-week course.
Wound vac was placed, with surgery following and doing dressing
changes.  Wound vac discontinued prior to discharge per surgery
team; wet-to-dry dressings were performed, and eventually dry
gauze dressings.  No evidence of further infection, with abscess
appearing to be healing well by discharge.  Pt will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in surgery in 4 weeks.

2.  MRSA sepsis - Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ED on a
non-rebreather mask, hypotensive on a levophed drip which was
weaned off and the patient remained stable, transferred from
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the floor on [**2170-11-8**].  On arrival, pt's CVP continued
to be low ([**4-23**]), with further fluid resuscitation resulting in
adequate BP.  Levophed drip was stopped 48 hours later, and BP
remained stable throughout rest of course.  Pt had multiple
further blood cultures for surveillance purposes, which were
negative.  Last positive blood culture was on [**11-5**].  Pt on
vanco for 4 week course after first negative blood culture.
Vancomycin trough levels were persistently low, with continual
uptitrating of the dose, up to 1750mg IV q12, and then
ultimately was 1000mg IV q8h with a therapeutic trough level.

3.  pneumonia - Pt noted to have multiple patchy opacities on
CXR and chest CT, some of these lesions were noted to be
cavitating.  ID was involved early in the course of [**Hospital **]
hospital stay.  3 AFB smears were negative, PCP via sputum
induction was negative, Legionella urinary antigen was negative,
Cryptococcus negative.  A PPD was placed, which was negative, as
well.  CXR showed right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. This was evaluated with U/S probe and
it was determined that the fluid collection was too small to be
tapped.  Findings on CT scan were consistent with septic emboli,
so a TTE and then TEE were performed, both of which were
negative for any vegetations.  Per ID, it is thought that these
are septic emboli, likely of MRSA, from some intravascular
source but not valvular vegetations.  The appearance of these
nodules, in their cavitations is consistent with Staph
pneumonia, possibly from hematogenous spread.  Pt was placed on
4 week course of vanco, and he continued to improve overall,
feeling well by the time of discharge.  He maintained good O2
sats and showed no respiratory distress.  A followup CT scan was
arranged prior to discharge, and pt will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic
to determine if the vancomycin may be discontinued.

4.  fevers - fevers persisted even with the vancomycin on board.
 Pt's cultures were consistently negative and no changes noted
on repeat chest imaging.  Pt clinically was well-appearing in
the last week
