(Amended ICU admission HPI)
..
Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] is a 69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF (EF
60-70%, 3+ MR) and GAVE who presents following an episode of
hematemesis and maroon stools at home. She was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-17**] - [**2-22**] after developing "dark" BM that were guaiac
positive. At that time, she was found to be more anemic than
usual and was given IVF and 2u pRBC in the ER, after which she
developed flash pulmonary edema and required intubation and a
short stay in the MICU. She was then scoped and underwent an
Argon plasma coagulation procedure after which she did very
well. Hct upon d/c on [**2-22**] was 31%. At that time, the plan per
GI was to repeat EGD on [**2154-3-7**]. Of note, during her last
hospital stay, she was noted to have lateral TW depressions and
+ troponins which were felt to be due to demand ischemia.
..
Reports that she felt well after discharge until this past
Monday ([**2-25**]), when she reports she had to be taken off of her
dialysis treatment b/c she didn't feel well. She states that she
first felt tingling and pain in her fingers and toes, to the
point where she was unable to put her feet on the ground. She
felt generally weak and tired following dialysis and needed to
be assisted back to her apartment. She spent the evening and
most of the next morning in bed. Her nurse came to assist her
the next day and offered her an oxycodone which she took, but
then vomited what she described as brown liquid w/ white specks
in it. No nausea prior to her vomiting. Her nurse said that it
looked like blood, but denied that it was coffee ground emesis.
After vomiting, Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] immediately felt better. The nurse
then called the pt's PCP who advised the pt to come to the ER.
15-20 mins later, Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] then felt the sudden urge to have a
BM and had a liquid maroon stool which was guaiac positive. She
denies any abdominal pain associated w/ the BM. At that point,
EMS arrived and transported her to the ER. On ROS, Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13230**]d any lightheadedness, dizziness, CP, SOB, or diaphoresis.
+ persistent burping, but that has actually decreased in
frequency since her last admission. Between her last discharge
and now, she had been eating normally and having normal brown,
formed stools. She has never had an episode of hematemesis
before.
..
In the ED, she was tachycardic but normotensive. Her NG lavage
showed brown fluid that cleared with 200 cc and her rectal exam
revealed guaiac negative brown stool. Her Hct on admsiion was
38% and she received lL of NS and 1u pRBCs. She also received
Anzemet 12.5 mg IV X 1 and pantoprazole 40 mg IV X 1. She was
evaluated by GI and taken for an EGD which showed findings c/w
GAVE. Her angiodysplasias were coagulated w/ an argon laser and
the pt was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring of fluid status
and serial Hct's. She remained hemodynamically stable in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] w/o any further episodes of hematemesis or melena, and her
Hct remained stable, so she was transferred to the medical floor
for futher monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF and h/o UGIB/GAVE, now
presenting with hematemesis and melena.
.
# UGIB: Her NG lavage in the ER was positive, but cleared with
200cc. She was placed on protonix IV for UGIB and 2 large bore
IVs were placed. She was given 1L NS as well as 1u pRBCs. An EGD
was performed which showed bleeding in gastric antrum, likely
due to GAVE. The angioectasias were cauterized with Argon laser
and she had no further episodes of bleeding. Her Hct remained
stable at 36. She was discharged with plans for a repeat
elective EGD and Argon laser cauterization on [**2154-3-7**].
.
# THRUSH: Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] has thrush, but it appeared improved since
her last hospitalization. She was continued on nystatin swish
and swallow.
.
# CAD: Ms. [**Known lastname 13224**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13231**] has CAD, given that she had a stress
MIBI that showed EKG changes but no perfusion defects at normal
workload. She has no h/o of MI, but does have elevated troponins
at baseline. During her last admission, she experienced lateral
TW depressions as well as a troponin leak felt t
