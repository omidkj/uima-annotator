Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic Blood Loss Anemia, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with banding
blood transfusion


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 75806**] is an 81 y/o F with a history of dCHF (EF 50-65%
in [**2133**]), afib, and chronic blood loss from GAVE syndrome who
presented today for elective EGD under MAC anesthesia. Per
endoscopy report, the findings were consistent with known
diagnosis of nodular gastric antral vascular ectasia. Mild
sponaneous oozing was noted. Band ligation was performed for
homeostasis. After the procedure the patient was complaining of
shortness of breath. She reports that she has been chronically
short of breath for 11 years, however she does not require any
oxygen at home. Of note the patient had not taken her lasix the
morning of the procedure and received 800cc of lactated ringers
during the endoscopy. She denies chest pain, cough, wheeze, or
leg pain. No known history of COPD or asthma. She reports that
her bilateral leg swelling is no worse than baseline (documented
to be 3+ edema in recent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]).
.
On arrival to the medicine floor she was desatting to the low
80s on nasal cannula and was placed on 5liter facemask. Her
blood pressures were in the 90s systolic which is slightly below
baseline according to outpatient records of 100s-110s systolic.
Heart rates 90s in afib. Diuresis was not initiated on the floor
because of concern for low blood pressures. The patient was
therefore transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. VS
prior to transfer were 87/57 87 20 99% on 5liter facemask. EKG
showed Atrial fibrillation with rate of 96, NA/NI no majors
change compared to prior.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient denies any chest pain. She
reports shortness of breath is improved while wearing the
oxygen.
.

Pertinent Results:
.
[**Location (un) **] hosp records:
- Echo  [**2130**]: EF 60%, RV enlarged with preserved systolic
function, biatrial enlargement, mild AS with valve area 2.2,
moderate MR, severe TR, mildly elevated pulm artery systolic
pressure 29 plus estimated right atrial pressure.
-On [**10/2136**] admitted to [**Hospital **] hosp seen for SOB and pedal
edema, given lasix diuresed from weight 73->70 Kg . On initial
presentation during that admission, she was satting 96% on 2L.
BP 125/65. HR 48.Cr 1.4, D-dimer 0.4. They transfused her 1 U
PRBC on [**11-12**], discharge HCT 31. Sent out on lasix 40mg PO
daily. (of note, in past: Was on amiodarone 200mg daily in
[**2130**].)
.
[**Hospital1 18**] REPORTS/LABS-
[**12-20**] EKG-
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage throughout. Non-specific T wave
abnormality in the lateral leads. Abnormal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**12-20**]:
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Prominence of right
cardiac border could reflect enlarged right-sided cardiac
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**] or adjacent pericardial abnormality such as a
pericardial cyst or prominent fat pad. Attention to this on
standard PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the
patient's condition permits. No focal areas of consolidation are
present within the lungs. Questionable small pleural effusions,
which could also be more fully address by standard PA and
lateral chest radiographs.
.
EKG [**12-21**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage throughout. Abnormal tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment abnormalities are
resolved.
TRACING #2
.
ECHO [**Hospital1 18**] [**2136-12-20**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild
systolic dysfunction. Normal global and regional left
ventricular systolic function. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CXR [**2136-12-20**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
[**12-21**] LENI:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower
extremities.
.
VQ SCAN [**2136-12-21**]
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate some accumulation of tracer in the large airways.
Matched defects in the right lung base, is likely due to pleural
effusion.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show >2 mismatched
segmental defects in the right upper lobe and superior segment
of the right lower lobe.
Chest x-ray shows a small right pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly.
The above findings are consistent with a high likelihood ratio
for pulmonary embolism.
IMPRESSION: High likelihood ratio of pulmonary embolism in the
right upper lobe.
.
Renal u/s [**12-22**]:
1. Limited study showing no evidence of hydronephrosis and no
direct evidence of venous clot.
2. Suggested reversal of diastaolic flow in the left renal
artery. The
significance of this is unclear given the limitations noted, and
may be
related to a high-resistance system including acute tubular
necrosis, or might be artifactual. If vascular thrombus is still
of concern, noncontrast MRV of the renal veins may be of use to
confirm patency.
3. Small bilateral kidneys, consistent with chronic medical
renal disease.
.
EKG [**12-22**]-
Significant baseline artifact precludes an accurate
interpretation of the
rhythm. No clear P waves are seen suggesting possible atrial
fibrillation.  Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 of unclear
significance. No other interpretation is possible based on this
tracing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-12-20**] a
