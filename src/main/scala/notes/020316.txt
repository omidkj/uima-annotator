Allergies:
Claritin / Nsaids

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stent to R common carotid artery

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is an 81 y/oF with h/o cerebrovascular
disease/carotid stenosis including occlusion of left ICA and h/o
CEA on right ICA, COPD, CHF, AF, CAD s/p PCI with h/o Cypher
stent in [**2110**], RA/Sjogren's who is transferred from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital with evaluation of syncope.
.
She was admitted there on [**2115-4-11**] after syncopizing at home and
brought to the hospital by EMTs. She was talking with Cardiology
Transfer RN at [**Hospital1 18**] when she suddenly stopped talking, and RN
called EMS. VNA came at around the same time and found the
patient unconscious on the couch, and was present when EMS
arrived. She was noted to spontanesouly regain consciousness. HR
in the field was 68 and BP was 110/p, FSG of 150.
.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient was ruled out for MI. She was reversed
with vitamin K 5mg x1. CT head there demonstrated mild
generalized atrophy with small vessel ischemic changes, no e/o
acute ICH. The patient had tiny calcification sseen in the
brain.
.
She was transferred for further management.
.
Further history:
In talking with the patient's family via telephone, son reports
that she has had several episodes lately where she stops talking
and slumps in her chair, but quickly comes to without
post-ictal-like period; these have been attributed to percocet
in the past because of close temporal relationship. She has
restless leg syndrome and has had shaking legs for many years.
.
Family and patient also report that her handwriting became more
coarse and almost illegible on Tuesday ([**2115-4-9**]). She also
reports symptoms within the last 3 weeks that sounded like TIA,
with pt reporting "left arm was wood and my face was twisted."
.
CTA on [**2115-4-9**] for work-up for these previous episode prior to
this admision showed densely calcified plaque involving origin
of [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with complete occlusion beyond the point of extracranial
ICA with reconstitution via circle. She has h/o right CEA in the
past.
.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] on [**2115-4-13**] and
transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit after going for vascular
catheterization and getting a stent of her right common carotid
artery.
.
On admission,
(+) Visual changes; needs glasses (over weeks)
(+) Headaches
(+) Constipation
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Pt reports sleeping up on 2

pillows; pt reports 3 days of calf edema.

This was negative after 24h and prior to discharge, returning

LENIS
No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.

BRAIN MRI?MRA
1. Absent flow signal in the left internal carotid artery could
be due to occlusion in the neck. Small right distal vertebral
artery could be variation. For evaluation of both these
abnormalities MRA of the neck or CTA can help for further
assessment. Otherwise, no abnormalities on the MRA of the head
in the remaining arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.

EEG: Normal awake and drowsy EEG. No focal lateralizing or
epileptiform features were seen.

CAROTID CATHETERIZATION
 1.  Access via right femoral artery with 6F sheath.
2.  Peripheral angiography with non-selective pigtail catheter
revealed
a Type 2 aortic arch with moderate calcification and tortuosity.
 We
then enganged the carotid arteries selectively with a
