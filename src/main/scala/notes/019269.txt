Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Hemothorax.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.      Hemothorax.
2.      Sternal dehiscence.
3.      Status post sternectomy and omental flap.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old
male who underwent coronary artery bypass graft with MDR on
[**2107-11-22**] for coronary artery disease.  His postoperative course
was complicated by atrial fibrillation.  He also had
bilateral lower extremity edema in the postoperative area
which has progressively worsened since the surgery according
to the patient.  On [**2107-12-3**] he was discharged to home.  His
primary complaint since then was persistent bilateral lower
extremity edema, dyspnea, productive cough, inability to lie
flat.  On the day prior to admission, the patient visited his
cardiologist for a previously scheduled appointment and had a
chest x-ray and was subsequently to an outside hospital.  Of
note, the patient had decreased breath sounds with a large
pleural effusion on chest x-ray.  He was transfused two
units of red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25, given
phytomenadione intravenous for an INR of 9.0 and ceftriaxone
for superimposed pneumonia on chest x-ray.  Patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further care and management of his possible hemothorax,
worsening congestive heart failure and possible nonunion of
his sternum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   1) Coronary artery disease, status
post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2102**].  2) Status post
coronary artery bypass graft [**2107-11-22**] with MDR.  3) Chronic
atrial fibrillation.  4) Diabetes mellitus.  5) Hypertension.
6) Gastritis.  7) Status post right parotidectomy.  8)
Hypercholesterolemia.  9) Peripheral vascular disease.
Approximately 30 pack year history of smoking.

ALLERGIES:  To morphine and codeine?

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1) Amiodarone 200 mg q.d., 2)
warfarin 7.5 mg q.o.d., 5 mg q.o.d.  3) Simvastatin 40 mg
q.d.  4) Protonix 40 mg q.d.  5) Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d., 6)
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d.  7) lasix 40 mg b.i.d.  8) Dilaudid
p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is an middle aged elderly man
in no acute distress.  Vital signs: 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate 86, blood pressure 99/41, respirations 14.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat atraumatic, normocephalic,
extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round, reactive
to light, anicteric.  Throat is clear.  Neck is supple and
midline with no masses or lymphadenopathy.  Chest is
significant for diffuse rhonchi on the right and
significantly decreased breath sounds on the left.  Decreased
resonance to percussion on the left.  Cardiovascular is
irregularly irregular without rub or gallop and a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the base.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended without mass or organomegaly.  Chest
shows clean surgical sternotomy incision with mild mobility
of both sternal edges.  Extremities are warm, not cyanotic,
with 3+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema to the knees
and 2+ edema from the knees to the waist.  Neurologic is
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION FROM OUTSIDE INSTITUTION:  CBC
16.9/28.6/520.  Chemistries
131/5.0/93/26/39/1.7/192/8.8/2.9/5.1.  INR is 2.65, PTT 44.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for evaluation of
his dyspnea, left sided pleural effusion.  Cardiothoracic
surgery was consulted for possible placement of chest tube.
A large #32 French chest tube was placed under conscious
sedation and approximately 2.5 liters of serosanguinous fluid
was returned.  Follow up chest x-ray showed significant
improvement of the left pleural effusion.  Patient
subsequently managed on the medical service and aggressively
diuresed.  For the next several days of his hospital course
patient had no significant complication and was transfused
one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.6.
Patient continued to complain of persistent chest pain
without much relief.  Echocardiogram demonstrated normal wall
performance of mitral valve.  Chest tube was placed to water
seal on hospital day number five for chest tube output of
approximately 150 cc of a 24 hour period.  Patient was also
begun on Levaquin for tracheobronchitis.  Cardiothoracic
service was prepared to sign off on hospital day number six,
but the patient had continued chest pain and on hospital day
number seven was observed to have dehiscence of the sternal
incision.  Additional consultation per plastic surgery was
obtained on hospital day number eight and the decision was
made to take the patient to the operating room for repair of
his sternal dehiscence.  This was done with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
conjunction with plastic surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2491**].  A sternectomy
and omental flap procedure was performed.  Patient tolerated
this well and was admitted to the CSRU postoperatively for
close monitoring.  He continued to have atrial fibrillation
with a controlled rate.  Patient had two [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains
in place per plastics and was otherwise doing well.  Patient
was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number
three and did very well.  The sternal wound looked good and
was followed by plastic surgery throughout.  On the floor,
the patient's primary issue was only pedal edema and
ambulation.  He was appropriately diuresed and [**Male First Name (un) **] hose were
applied with good results.  The patient was restarted on his
Coumadin and subsequently discharged to home on postoperative
day number seven.  He was tolerating a regular diet and had
adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications and satisfied
with his level of pedal edema at that time.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DIET:  Cardiac.

INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to record daily [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
output. He received [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] training in-house.  He is
to follow up with [**Hospital6 407**] and INR checks
twice weekly and have the levels transmitted to the [**Hospital 197**]
clinic for adjusting of his Coumadin dosage.  He should also
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks for possible
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] removal as well as wound check.  Should follow
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.  Close follow up with his
cardiologist is recommended to adjust the need for diuresis
and adjust his cardiac medications.
