History of Present Illness:
76 year-old male with history of severe COPD requiring
intubation, trach, and multiple hospitalizations in the past.
On day of admission, he knew "something wasn't right."  He felt
chills and began having shortness of breath.  He used his
inhalers (Advair and Combivent), without relief.  He called 911

had a pneumonia, because his symptoms were so similar to his

symptoms.  At his baseline he uses Combivent 4 times a day and
Advair twice a day.  He does not have oxygen at home.  He can

ECG [**2185-4-16**]: Sinus tachycardia, conduction defect of RBBB type
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Since previous tracing, inferolateral ST-T wave changes

ECG [**2185-4-16**]: Sinus tachycardia, Right bundle branch block
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - are in part primary and cannot
exclude in part ischemia.  Since previous tracing of same date,
no significant change.

ECG [**2185-4-17**]:Sinus tachycardia.  Right bundle branch block.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - are in in part primary and
cannot exclude in part ischemia.  Since previous tracing of
[**2185-4-16**], no significant change.

Admission CXR:
The heart, mediastinum, and pulmonary vessels are within normal
limits. Emphasematous changes are present in the lungs. There is
an interstitial opacity in the left lower lobe, which appears
nonspecific and, in an appropriate clinical setting, may
represent pneumonia.

CXR [**2185-4-19**]:
1) Slight improvement in left lower lobe opacity, likely
improving pneumonia.
2) Continued cardiac failure, with cardiomegaly, increased
pulmonary vascular markings, and bilateral small pleural
effusions.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for worsening failure, lll pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with history of COPD, LLL pneumonia, now
increased oxygen requirement from previous
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for worsening failure, lll pna
INDICATION: Followup pneumonia.

There are changes of emphysema with bullous disease in the upper
lobes. The heart is normal in size. The infiltrate posteriorly
appears somewhat improved since [**2185-4-21**]. Mediastinal contours
are normal. There is no effusion or bone destruction.

IMPRESSION: Emphysema with improvement in the appearance of the
chest over the past three days.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2185-4-25**] 2:46 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: Evaluate for PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with COPD, resolving pneumonia, continues to
have persistent tachycardia and hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: COPD and resolving pneumonia. Persistent tachycardia
and hypoxia. Assess for PE.

COMPARISON: Chest x-ray of [**2185-4-24**].

TECHNIQUE: CT angiogram of the chest before and after the
administration of Optiray nonionic contrast due to fast bolus
technique. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There is no sign of filling defect
within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is a high-grade stenosis within the left subclavian
artery. There is diffuse severe emphysema bilaterally. Focal
areas of consolidation are noted on the right, some of which are
slightly mass like. Attention to these areas on followup is
recommended after treatment. There is no pleural or pericardial
effusion. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is no
axillary lymphadenopathy. A small upper mediastinal node
measuring 7 mm in greatest short axis dimension is noted. There
are dense calcifications within the aortic arch and within the
coronary arteries. Small left hilar lymph nodes are also seen.

Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate dense
calcifications within the aorta and branches. No other gross
abnormality is appreciated.

BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes within the spine
including a thoracic kyphosis.

IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Diffuse emphysema. Right-sided consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Follow up chest CT in 6 weeks after treatment is
recommended to ensure that these changes resolve. Attention
should be paid to several more nodular opacities on the right.
3) 8-mm anterior superior mediastinal node as well as small
lymph nodes in the left hilum. Attention to these regions on
followup is recommended.
4) High-grade stenosis of the left proximal subclavian artery.
Clinically correlate.


Brief Hospital Course:
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 7173**] is a 76 year-old male with a history of severe
COPD requiring intubation, trach and multiple hospitalizations
in the past.  On the day of admission, he called 911 and was
brought in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by EMS for increased dyspnea.  He
became febrile earlier that day with chills.  He denied GI/GU
symptoms, cough and chest pain.  He was given albuterol and
atrovent nebs in the ambulance without improvment.

    In the ED he was found febrile to 103.1 and tachycardiac.
His RR was in the 40's, with O2 sats in the low 80's.  He was
intubated for acute respiratory distress.  His WBC count was
11.2, with 80% neutrophils and 6 bands.  A CXR revealed a LLL
opacity.  He received levofloxacin and IV steroids for COPD
exacerbation.  Enzymes revealed a troponin leak, though ECG in
the ED showed only tachycardia and RBBB.  He was then admitted
to the MICU.  Vancomycin was added for MRSA coverage, given
history of hospitalizations at VA with MRSA.  He was weaned and
extubated on [**2185-4-14**] and transferred to the floor [**2185-4-15**].

    Once extubated, levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued.
He was on scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer
treatments every 4-6 hours and he continued to use his home
Advair inhaler.  He was switched from IV steroids to 60mg of
prednisone.  On [**2185-4-16**] he continued to have tachycardia.
Subsequent ECG's revealed inf
