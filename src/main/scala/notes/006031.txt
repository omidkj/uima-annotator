Chief Complaint:
Mixed respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
CVL

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant
for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] now admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The
patient was found by her family this morning in her bedroom
confused after possibly falling.  At that time, she was
disoriented and looked short of breath with a "glassy look in
her eyes."  Her VNA arrived later this morning and then called
EMS.  Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 4256**]
for hypoxemia of unclear etiology with hospital course
complicated by aspiration pneumonia. She has since followed up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Pulmonary with suspicion for chronic mixed
respiratory failure, possibly from neuromuscular disease,
pulmonary hypertension from dCHF and elevated left-sided
pressures, and kyphoscoliosis.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 96.3 120 120/77 20 97%
10L with SaO2 of low 80s in triage.  Initial labs were notable
for a BNP of 4238, and the patient was placed on NIPPV. She was
then noted to be persistently hypoxemic and then became
hypotensive, and so was intubated. A RIJ CVL was placed, and the
patient was placed on levophed. Cardiology was consulted for
question of NSTEMI given a TnT of 0.04, who felt that the
patient was not in over cardiogenic shock or having a plaque
rupture. She was then admitted to the MICU for further
management.


Past Medical History:
- Hypoxemia, chronic hypercarbia felt to be secondary to
restrictive physiology from possible neuromuscular deficit.
- History of asthma, but has not been treated with any
medications.
- Hypertension.
- Osteoporosis.
- History of uterine cancer resected in [**2077**] without
recurrence.
- History of kidney stones.

Patient lives with her husband and her son.

TTE
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction, most
c/w diffuse process (toxic, metabolic, etc).


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant
for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure with
hospital course complicated by fevers, atrial fibrillation with
RVR, and inability to clear secretions upon extubation.

1. Mixed respiratory failure/Goals of care: A-a gradient of 145
on admission in setting of likely dynamic hyperinflation with
NIPPV. Patient has a chronic element of CO2 retention with a
HCO3 in the 30-40s since [**2081**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] concerned about a
neuromuscular disorder.  In addition, she has K-S on CXR and
signs of elevated filling pressures with an estimated TRG 45 in
1/[**2102**].  The patient was treated broadly with vancomycin,
cefepime, levofloxacin, and oseltmavair, which were discontinued
when cultures and Influenza DFA returned negative.  Patient was
ultimately extubated on [**3-10**], but was noted to be unable to
clear her secretions. The following day, she was noted to have
likely lobar collapse from mucus plugging. After extensive
discussions with the patient's family, the decision was made to
change her goals of care to DNR/DNI with focus on comfort
without escalation of care. All non-essential medications were
held and she expired shortly thereafter with her children at the
bedside.
