Addendum to previously dictated discharge summary.  Detailed
hospital course from [**2191-2-26**], until [**2191-3-3**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained relatively stable from
a medical standpoint during this portion of the hospital

1.  Psychiatric - History of bipolar disorder/paranoid
schizophrenia.  On [**2191-2-25**], the patient had an episode of
agitation.  At this time, his regular one to one sitter was
changed to a security sitter.  He was started on Trilafon 8
mg p.o. twice a day for increasing agitation.  However, after
the onset of this medication, the patient was also noted to
his mood did stabilize quite well.  The patient was also
noted to have mild cogwheeling by psychiatric resident and
was started on Cogentin 0.5 mg p.o. twice a day which he
tolerated well.  However, Trilafon was discontinued on
[**2191-3-2**], secondary to potential side effects of orthostatic
hypotension.  See details below.

2.  Orthostatic hypotension - The patient was doing well,
however, on [**2191-3-1**], the patient had an episode of
orthostatic hypotension posthemodialysis.  The patient had 2
kilograms of fluid removed at this hemodialysis as he was
noted to have a significant weight gain between hemodialysis
treatments.  This weight gain was slightly questionable as
the patient had clearly been having decreased p.o. intake
secondary to his fatigue and perhaps weight gain was
associated with a scale error.  Posthemodialysis, the patient
was noted to have a blood pressure systolic of 60.  The
patient was given back some fluid, rested and subsequently
had no further symptoms of orthostasis.  The patient had a
repeat blood pressure in the one teens and was sent back to
the floor.  However, the patient attempted to get out of bed
to chair and had some light-headedness.  In addition, he also
went to the bathroom and on his way back, felt quite
light-headed and fell to the floor on his knees and
subsequently hit his head and had a potential
vasovagal/orthostatic hypotensive event.  The patient had a
blood pressure of 50 at this time.  A code was called.  The
patient was placed in Trendelenburg position.  The patient
was given two liters of intravenous fluid hydration
immediately at which time his blood pressure gradually
increased back to final blood pressure of 118 systolic over
doppler.

After the patient was stabilized, he had a head CT to rule
out any evidence of acute bleed or fracture.  The patient's
head CT was negative. Enzymes and EKG were not suggestive of
myocardial injury.

This event was thought to be a combination of potential
orthostatic hypotension in association with medication
Trilafon, in addition with fluid shift during hemodialysis,
which responded well to intravenous fluids.

The patient had orthostatic vital signs checked on [**2191-3-2**],
and in the morning, he still had evidence of orthostasis.
However, the patient was unable to ambulate with walker and
assistance to the bathroom and had no light-headedness or
dizziness.  Subsequently, the patient had medical workup
which included complete blood count, CK, troponin,
electrocardiogram and blood cultures, all of which were
stable and showed no evidence of acute bleed, infection or
cardiac event of potential related etiology of this episode
of hypotension.

It is recommended that the patient have orthostatic vital
signs checked daily.  The patient was stable post
hemodialysis on [**2191-3-3**], and was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] for management of his acute psychiatric needs as
well as medical management of his acute renal failure.
