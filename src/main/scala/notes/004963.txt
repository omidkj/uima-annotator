CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2110-8-6**] 11:17 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pulmonary embolism with no CT evidence of associated
right heart strain.
2. Extensive ground-glass opacity with more focal areas of
consolidation in the right lower lobe along with a moderate
right-sided pleural effusion. Aspiration, atelectasis,
infection, or possible infarct from embolism are in the
differential.
3. 5-mm right middle lobe ground glass nodule, 4-mm right upper
lobe nodule, and 1.9- cm peripheral left lower lobe
consolidative opacity.
4. Right lower lobe segmental bronchi obstructed - consider
aspiration, mucoid impaction. Bronchoscopy could be considered
if findings do not resolve over time, once more acute issues are
dealt with, as this can be a cause of fever and leukocytosis.
4. Mildly dilated loops of mid small bowel distally decompressed
small bowel. Contrast passes freely into the normal-appearing
colon. Findings are suggestive of ileus. Early or partial
small-bowel obstruction cannot be entirely excluded but is felt
not likely.
