Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillin G

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Code Stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of CAD, high
cholesterol, hypertension, now presenting as a code stroke.  The
patient is a poor historian and unfortunately has few notes to
confirm his medical history.  His son provides the details of
the
event.  The patient awoke this morning at 4:30 am and went about
his daily routine.  He was talking and interacting with the son.

Around 7 am, the patient began to wash the dishes and the son
left to walk to the corner grocery store.  When he returned
around 7:30 am, his mother informed him that his father had
fallen to the ground.  He walked into the kitchen to discover
the
patient lying on the floor, not moving his left side and
slurring
his speech.  He was following simple commands  The son activated
EMS and he was taken to an OSH.  A head ct did not reveal any
evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.  There he was found to be in
afib, they decided against iv-tpa and started him on heparin.
He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.  He arrived here
at
1:56 pm, a code stroke was activated at 2:01 pm.  I arrived at
the bedside within 3 minutes.

ROS:  no recent fevers, chills, or urinary problems (according
to
the son who observes him on a daily basis)

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There is hypodensity of the right
caudate nucleus and right putamen, extending into the subinsular
white matter on the right side. The right caudate nucleus is
enlarged compared to the left side, and the contours of the
hypodensity suggest edema consistent with recent infarction of
this tissue. Furthermore, there are areas of relative [**Name (NI) 99906**]
compared to the normal brain parenchyma within the hypodense
infarct, raising the possibility of small areas of hemorrhage
within the infarct. There is no evidence of extra-axial
hemorrhage. There is no shift of the normally midline
structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
with involutional change. There is a small rounded hypodensity
within the left cerebral peduncle, likely representing either a
vascular space or an old lacunar infarction, and there is
lacunar infarction in the inferior right cerebellum. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
There are dense vertebrobasilar and carotid calcifications.

There are densities at the periphery of the left globe, probably
indicating scleral banding. Soft tissues are otherwise
unremarkable, as are osseous structures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Recent infarction of the right caudate, putamen, extending
into the subinsular white matter on the right side. Correlate
with clinical history.
2. Isodense areas within the infarcted tissue, which may
represent small areas of hemorrhage or spared brain parenchyma.

The findings of acute infarction and possible hemorrhage within
the infarcted tissue were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14944**] at the
immediate conclusion of the exam.

[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with dyspnea and hypoxia, CVA, AFib. Evaluate
for edema or infiltrate.

CHEST, PORTABLE: Prior studies obtained at an outside office are
not available for comparison. The heart is enlarged. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is
haziness of the pulmonary vasculature with more patchy opacities
throughout the left lung. Sternal wires are identified from
prior cardiac surgery. There are no large pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with CHF. The patchy opacities
throughout the left lung likely represent asymmetric pulmonary
edema. Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia
superimposed on CHF and followup after treatment is recommended.

MRI OF THE BRAIN: Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate a large
area of restricted diffusion corresponding to the right middle
cerebral artery territory, including the right basal ganglia,
insular cortex and portions of the right frontal, parietal, and
temporal lobes. The apparent infarcted tissue occupies a much
larger region than seen on the head CT scan of the prior day.
There is susceptibility effect noted within the right putamen
and the infarcted tissues are slightly effaced. There is no
shift of the normally midline structures. There is mild mass
effect on the right lateral ventricle.

There is a smaller rounded area of restricted diffusion at the
left temporo- occipital junction region. There is elevated T2
and FLAIR signal at this locale, suggesting a more subacute
small infarct.

There are small foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the
cerebral periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia.

MRA OF THE BRAIN:

TECHNIQUE: 3-D time-of-flight imaging of the distal vertebral
and internal carotid arteries were obtained, including the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. 3-D reformatted images are provided.

MRA OF THE BRAIN: As expected in this case of right middle
cerebral artery infarction, no flow is seen within the right
middle cerebral artery beyond the M1 segment. In addition, no
flow is visualized within the distal left vertebral artery,
nearly to the junction point with the basilar artery. A small
amount of residual flow is seen within the superior-most lef
