History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 73794**] is a 22yo F with extensive psychiatric history (3
previous suicide attempts, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety,
bipolar, borderline, alcohol abuse), transferred from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]
MICU with ARDS after multidrug OD at friend's house.  She
normally has meds delivered by VNA, however apparently accessed
her med box while at a friend's house.  She then called 911 on
[**12-22**] reporting she had attempted suicide with 24x clonazepam
0.5mg, 10x benadryl 25mg, 20-30x Topamax 25mg, 6x ibuprofen
800mg, 10x Effexor 150mg, 10x Loratadine 10mg (although she may
also have taken abilify and other home meds as listed below).
Upon presentation to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NGT was placed and she
received charcoal.  Serum tox screen was negative for
salicylate, acetaminophen, ethanol, and barbiturates, benzos
(however urine benzo tox was positive), and TCAs.  Shortly
thereafter, she was intubated for airway protection after
becoming increasingly sedated.  She was noted to have prolonged
QTc (to 490 on admission H+P) thought [**1-21**] Effexor which, by
report, had resolved prior to transfer.

From the ED, she was admitted to the ICU.  On [**2162-12-24**], per
transfer note "attempted to wean from respirator--failed SBT."
On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2163-12-25**]) she had a leukocytosis
of 21.5 and she spiked temp to 103.3.  In this setting, she
desatted to 76-84% at which time FiO2 was increased to 1.0
(settings unclear prior to this).  CXR at that time reportedly
demonstrated B/L infiltrates and clinical picture was concerning
for ARDS.  She received vancomycin, cefepime, solumedrol, and
therapeutic dose of enoxaparin presumably for empiric rx of
possible PE.  She also received furosemide 100mg IV and excreted
2-3L.  She was initially placed on AC Vt 500, PEEP 7.5, FiO2
75%, with ABG 7.25/56/63.  This was then adjusted as follows in
the setting of her desaturation:
(1) Vt 360x32, PEEP 10 or 14 (unclear), FiO2 90%: ABG
7.25/51/65.  On this settings, pt desatted to 86%.
(2) Vt 450x28, PEEP 14, FiO2 100%: ABG 7.32/52/165/26.

Just prior to transfer, O2 sat was documented as 99%.  She has
been transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for ARDS and further
ventilation management.

IMAGING:

[**2163-12-29**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination of [**12-26**], [**2163**], there is no major change. The endotracheal tube has
been removed, the lung volumes, however, have not decreased. The
nasogastric tube and the central venous access line are in
unchanged position. In almost unchanged manner, multifocal
bilateral lung consolidations are seen, they predominate at the
left lung base. No pneumothorax, no evidence of larger pleural
effusions.
IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2163-12-26**], status post
extubation. No other relevant radiographic changes in the
interval.

[**2163-12-26**] LLE U/S: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right
or left lower extremity.

[**2163-12-26**] CTA: Overall, findings are most compatible with extensive
aspiration pneumonia. Suboptimal evaluation of the distal
pulmonary artery branches. No evidence of central pulmonary
embolism.


Brief Hospital Course:
22yo F with h/o multiple psychiatric pathologies, admitted with
respiratory failure and fever. Intubated with ARDS secondary to
overdose.
 .
# Respiratory failure/ARDS: Ms. [**Known lastname 73794**] was intubated on [**12-22**] for
airway protection as she became increasingly sedated in the
setting of multidrug ingestion during a suicide attempt. While
intubated, she developed fevers and bilateral infiltrates on
CXRs at OSH. She was also increasingly hypoxic on the day of
transfer ([**2163-12-25**]) with P/F ratios consistently less than 200 w/
clinical picture concerning for ARDS. She received
cefepime/vanco, solumedrol, and furosemide in this setting.  In
this context, her labs more likely reflected acute respiratory
acidosis with metabolic compensation over the past several days.
Given hypoxia and morbid obesity (although probable infiltrates
on CXR), patient ruled out for a PE by CTA and BLE LENIs also
negative. Patient was extubated successfully on [**2163-12-30**] and
transfered to the medical floor on [**2164-1-1**], to continue her
course of antibiotics.
.
# Pneumonia (VAP): As mentioned above, Ms. [**Known lastname 73794**] developed a
temperature to 103.3 with bilateral opacities seen on CXR at the
OSH, 2 days post intubation. She also had an elevated WBC in
this setting. Given the time course, it seemed unlikely that is
was aspiration prior to intubation causing pneumonitis. CXR upon
admission here showed bilateral haziness, although it was
difficult to interpret given very low lung volumes and body
habitus. She was treated for presumed VAP with a 14 day course
of Vancomycin and Zosyn (although sputum cultures here were
negative). Final culture from [**Hospital6 12112**] showed
rare growth of MSSA.
.
# Psychiatric: Ms. [**Known lastname 73794**] has a h/o schizophrenia, depression,
anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder,
