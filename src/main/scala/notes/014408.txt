Studies:
CXR [**2153-5-8**]:
The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 6.6 cm above the
level of the carina. The nasogastric tube tip is in the stomach.
The lungs are clear. There is no vascular congestion or pleural
effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.
Tortuosity of the aorta is noted. The remainder of the
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  1) Standard position of support
devices. 2) Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta.
3. No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
.
CT TORSO, NONCONTRAST [**2153-5-8**]:
1. Lobulated mass extending from the pylorus, into the first
portion of the duodenum; however, it is unclear whether this
mass originates from the pylorus, or the duodenum. No
obstruction to oral contrast transit.
2. Numerous regional lymph nodes, none of which necessarily meet
CT criteria for enlargement, but the number of these nodes is
concerning for local metastatic disease. Slight stranding of the
adjacent mesenteric fat. No signs, however, of distant
metastatic foci, although solid organs, such as the liver, are
limited in evaluation.
3. Cardiomegaly, coronary artery disease, and aortic
atherosclerosis.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2153-5-9**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality study. Left ventricular
function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. At least moderate tricuspid
regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
EGD [**2153-5-8**]:
Contents: Coffee ground heme was seen in the fundus and stomach
body. Food was found in the stomach body and fundus.  Protruding
Lesions A large fungating mass of malignant appearance with
friability and stigmata of recent bleeding was found at the
pylorus. The scope traversed the lesion easily. Cold forceps
biopsies were performed for histology at the pyloric mass.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Impression: Blood in the fundus and
stomach body Food in the stomach body and fundus Mass in the
pylorus (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the
duodenum
Recommendations: Mass with stigmata of recent bleeding. No blood
or bleeding post-pylorus. F/u bx results. Cont supportive care w
blood and INR reversal. Suggest CT scan and surgical consult.
.
PYLORIC MASS BIOPSY [**2153-5-8**]:
Adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, arising in a background
of low and high grade dysplasia.  Note: No submucosal tissue is
present.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6311**] stain is negative for H. pylori.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a pleasant [**Age over 90 **]yo male with a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, diastolic heart
failure, who was transferred from OSH with a large volume GI
bleed, attributed to a bleeding pyloric mass identified as
adenocarcinoma.  THe patient was discharged with general surgery
and oncology follow-up to discuss further treatment plan.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UPPER GI BLEED/PYLORIC ADENOCARCINOMA:  He initially presented
to OSH with weakness and fatigue and was found to have a
hematocrit of 15.5.  He had further hematemesis in their ICU and
had a minimal hematocrit response to 5 units PRBC. He was
hypotensive on pressors and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where he
maintained his hemodynamic stability and pressors were weaned.
He was intubated for airway support prior to EGD. His admission
hematocrit was 20.1.  He received 4 units PRBC with an
appropriate rise.  He was continued on IV PPI infusion and did
not require pressors.  GI team performed upper endoscopy which
revealed a large fungating pyloric mass with stigmata of recent
bleeding, and retained food products in the stomach sugges
