Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening cough, abnormal chest CT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2115-5-18**]
Platelet transfusion of two units [**2115-5-18**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53 year old with history of refractory lymphoma
status post matched unrelated non-myeloablative allogenic stem
cell transplant, who presents with worsening cough and CT chest
findings.
.
He has had a dry cough and hoarse voice over the last several
weeks, and completed a course of azithromycin approximately one
week ago, at which time a CT of the chest was completed. He
presented to clinic on [**2115-5-17**] for Rituxan therapy, and was
noted to have worsening of his cough. Pulmonary function tests
and a repeat chest CT were obtained as noted below concerning
for 'infectious etiology'. He has not had any sputum production,
fevers, or shortness of breath. Based on CT findings and concern
for worsening infectious process, he was admitted for
bronchoscopy to guide further management and treatment.
.
Review of systems:
ROS:
No fevers, chills, sweats. He has had a dry cough for
approximately 3-4 weeks, as noted above. No chest pain,
palpitations, difficulty breathing, dyspnea on exertion, PND,
orthopnea, hemoptysis, headaches, congestion, sore throat,
difficulty swallowing. Hoarseness of his voice as improved. No
N/V/D/C, abdominal pain. No GU symptoms. Weight has been stable;
his appetite has been "fair."

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Patient underwent matched unrelated non-myeloablative allogenic
stem cell transplant with fludorabine and Cytoxan on [**2114-11-15**].
He was diagnosed with grade II follicular lymphoma in [**2112**] after
presenting with lymphadenopathy of the neck. His lymphoma was
resistant to multiple courses of chemotherapy, and he then
underwent transplant in [**2114**].
.
His post-transplant course was complicated by tooth abscesses
requiring extractment. While on antibiotics after extractment,
he developed rashes, which were felt to be secondary to GVHD or
drug-related. He also had several bouts of CMV viremia with
colonic involvement causing diarrhea, which improved with
Valcyte, however he had difficulty tolerating this medication
secondary to reduced cell counts. He has had repeated difficulty
with rashes, and had another skin biopsy in [**3-/2115**] that finally
confirmed GVHD of the skin. Over this time, he has been treated
with steroids and had improvement of his rashes, however again
has had recurrences of his CMV. He was most recently admitted
last month for fevers and worsening cough, work-up for which was
unrevealing.
His primary oncology team has been using PUVA treatment for this
while attempting to taper his steroids.
.
Other Past Medical History:
1. Follicular lymphoma as noted above.
2. CMV viremia, colitis
3. GVHD of skin and liver
4. Left inguinal hernia
5. Borderline positive Hepatitis B core antibody
6. Hypertension
7. Hyperglycemia while on steroids

Patient is married and has three children. He formerly worked as
an electrician. He does not smoke or drink alcohol.

There is no family history of lymphoma or other hematologic
diseases.

CT Chest [**2115-5-17**]:
MPRESSION:

1. New infection predominantly involving the right lower lobe
and the right middle lobe, but with some involvement of right
middle lobe and left lower lobe, radiologically consistent with
mycoplasma haemophilus influenza or viral infection.

2. Right apical and upper lobe findings which might represent
post-radiation changes, correlation with clinical history is
recommended.

3. Subpleural right upper lobe nodule, series 4, image 75, 4.5
mm in diameter, stable since [**2114-11-7**]. Several adjacent
smaller subpleural pulmonary nodules are seen, 4:76, 4:79, all
stable since the same period of time.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old male with past medical history of refractory
follicular lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant
complicated by GVHD of the skin and CMV viremia, who presented
with worsening cough and CT findings.
.
# Cough, CT chest findings: Given the CT chest findings and his
long-standing immunosuppressive therapy, there was concern for
infectious process, or GVHD of the lung. He was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, and had recently completed a course of
azithromycin, so no antibiotics were started until after the pt
could undergo bronchoscopy. This procedure was performed and an
in doing so the pt became transiently hypotensive, hypoxemic and
tachycardic. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring where
his hemodynamics improved with supportive care. Cultures from
his BAL demonstrated MSSA and Pseudomonas. The pt was treated
with vancomycin and Zosyn, then transitioned to Zosyn only based
on sensitivities. With antibiotic therapy his condition rapidly
improved. He will complete a total of a 14 day course. B-glucan
and galactomanan were sent and were negative.
.
# GVHD: Patient has known GVHD of both skin and liver. He was
continued on his home immunosuppressives of prednisone and
neoral [**Hospital1 **]; prednisone was decreased to 20 mg daily. The pt will
have outpt follow-up for further skin care.
.
# Lymphoma: Patient is on maintenance Rituxan therapy as
outpatient. His home prophylaxis with posaconazole was
continued. He receives pentamidine as outpatient monthly.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's home antihypertensives were held after
he became hypotensive; these were able to be restarted prior to
discharge.
.
# History of borderline HBV: Viral load on [**5-15**] was negative.
Valganciclovir dose was reduced to 450 mg given his neutropenia;
lamivudine was continued.
