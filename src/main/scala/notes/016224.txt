History of Present Illness:
78 year old woman with history of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin and h/o CVA (residual mild right hemiparesis),
presented initially to OSH with syncope and bradycardia. She was
found sitting on the floor without recollection of the events
preceeding. Denied preceeding chest pain, lightheadedness or
diaphoresis. Upon waking, had new right shoulder and right hip
pain as well as a new ecchymosis on right forehead.
.
At the OSH ([**Hospital **] Hosp), she was found to have a small right
frontal parietal subcutaneous hematoma, CT head was without
acute intracranial pathology. ECG showed afib with inferolateral
scooping ST depressions. INR was therapeutic at 2.4. She was
hemodynamically stable despite brief epsisodes of bradycardia
into the high 30s. Her neurological exam was at baseline. Xrays
of right hip and right shoulder were negative. ASA 325mg and
nitropaste were administered and she was transferred to BIMDC
for further workup. She received nitropast and aspirin prior to
admission.
.
Her daughter left the hospital prior to patient arriving on the
floor thus the history is somewhat abreviated. Per report from
the caridology fellow who saw her in the ED, she was recently
confused and was aggressive towards her daughter which is
unusual.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 99.8 67 148/57 18 97% 2l. Labs notable
for trop 0.07, Creatinine 1.4, BUN 33, Digoxin 2.2, WBC 10.9,
HCT 29.9 with MCV 93, INR 2.5, K 3.6. ECG showed depressed
scooped ST segments in I, II, avF and V3-V6. Most recent set of
vitals: 97.6 63 (in & out of afib with episodes of bradycardia
to the 30's not causing hemodynamic or subjective compromise)
141/57 22 98% RA.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, HR ranged from 33-70s without
symptoms or evidence of AV block. She denies chest pain, SOB,
palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness. No vision changes or
color changes in field of vision. She does not recall todays
morning events (cannot remember waking up or eating breakfast).
No paresthesias or weakness above her baseline. She has
intermittent diarrhea, last occured 1 week prior to admission.
Poor appetite recently.

PERTINENT STUDIES
# CXR [**11-20**]
There is moderate cardiomegaly. There is mild vascular
congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis are larger on the right side.
There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
.
# CT noncontrast [**11-20**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage or recent
infarction. Regions
of hypodensity in the left frontal, parietal, and occipital
lobes as well as in the right parietal love (2; 23) represent
sequelae of prior infarction; these appear similar to prior
exam. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There
is no edema or mass effect. Prominence of the ventricles
reflects age-related atrophic change. Subtle periventricular
hypodensities represent chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
The mastoid air cells are clear. The visualized paranasal
sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening of the sphenoid
sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Sequelae of old infarction but no evidence of
hemorrhage or
recent infarction.
.
# ECHO (TTE) [**11-21**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical
aneurysm/dyskinesis and near akinesis of the anterior wall and
distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction (mid-LAD distribution) and apical
aneurysm. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
# Carotid series [**11-21**]
IMPRESSION: On the right, minimal plaque with less than 40%
carotid stenosis. On the left, possible ICA occlusion; however,
no confirmatory study. Please review information above.
.
# CXR PA/LAT [**11-22**]
The left-sided pacemaker has been placed with its tip
terminating in the
expected location of the right ventricle. There is no
substantial change in the cardiomegaly. There is substantial
interval improvement up to complete resolution of pulmonary
edema. Still present small bilateral pleural effusions are
noted. There is no definite pneumothorax seen, but minimal
amount of apical pleural air cannot be excluded.




Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o woman with atrial fibrillation on coumadin and h/o CVA,
who was transferred from OSH s/p syncope and was found
bradycardic.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Digixin toxicity: Pt presented with bradycardia in 40-50s,
with occasional drop to 30s.  Although the cause of bradycardia
is likely multifactorial, digoxin toxicity was
