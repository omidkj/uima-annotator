CTA HEAD [**4-7**]:

1. Focal stenosis of the right internal carotid within the
petrous bone could be consistent with either underlying
atherosclerotic disease, a previous traumatic injury, or acute
dissection. Close clinical correlation is recommended.

2. Extensive, severe bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions, with
multiple areas of subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage. No mass
effect.

3. Probable longitudinal fracture of the left temporal bone with
adjacent opacification of the mastoid air cells.

4. A small foci of air within the subcutaneous tissues of the
left parietal skull could represent deep laceration.

EKG [**4-8**]:

Sinus rhythm, rate 88. Technical artifacts are seen. The Q-T
interval is
borderline prolonged. Minor ST-T wave abnormalities are present.

TRACING #1

[**4-7**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild
aortic regurgitation.

[**4-8**] MRA Neck:
CONCLUSION: Narrowing of right internal carotid artery in its
petrous segment perhaps due to dissection. No change since the
CTA of [**2147-4-7**].

[**4-10**] Carotid US Neck:
40-50% stenosis of L ICA on wet read.  Official report P.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the SICU from the ED for intracranial
hemmorrhage secondary to fall with question of syncope.  Shge
had a serum alcohol content of 196.  Patient initially had GCS
15 upon presentation and her cspine was cleared in ED by trauma
attending, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (clinically).  Pt was maintained on
q1h neuro checks and given dilantin loading dose then 100mg tid
with monitoring after CT head was performed showing interval
developement of bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions.  No aneurysms
were visualized.  Subarachnoid blood was seen mostly within the
frontal sulci.  She underwent a syncope workup and
EKG/Echo/Carotid US results were as above.  Pt was maintained on
a regular diet since admission.  Pulmonary toilet was good and
pt remained stable on room air.  Patient was able to void on her
own throughout her course.  Pt had electrolyte repletions of
sodium, potassium, and magnesium throughout her course.  She was
maintained on a RISS for glucose control.  Her blood pressure
was initially in the 150-160s systollically and adequate control
was achieved through prn dosing of hydralazine and labetalol prn
>140.  Neurology stroke was consulted regarding the narrowing in
the petrous portion of the right ICA and recommended follow up
imaging studies since anticoagulation was not possible due to
intracranial bleeds.  She was transferred to the floor on HD 3
without event and maintained no change in mental status or
neurological exams.  PT was consulted on [**4-10**] and did not see
any need for inpt or outpt PT and cleared the patient to go
home.  Social work also saw patient and gave recommendations for
alcohol abuse treatment.  Pt had potassium repleted on [**4-10**] as
it was 2.8 and rechecked and discharged home on [**4-11**] without
complaints.
