Brief Hospital Course:
64M w/ CHF/MR, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney dz,
and Asperger's syndrome admitted for right cerebellar/medullary
infarct complicated by cardio-respiratory arrest x 2, resp
failure.

1. Right cerebellar/medullary infarct: Pt initially presented to
ED after fall w/ CT evidence of acute/sub-acute right cerebellar
infarct. Initially planned for neuro ICU but transferred to MICU
following cardiac arrest. The etiology of infarct felt most
likely to be embolic. He does have known history of afib (for
which had not been anti-coagulated secondary to reported GIB),
had a bubble study which was negative for pfo/asd. Carotid u/s
unrevealing for significant dz. However, CTA of head/neck did
show evidence of thrombosis within right vertebral artery at
junction of basilar artery. Furthermore, there was evidence of
significant cerebral vascular dz on the left vertebral system.
Initially, pt followed with serial head ct's that demonstrated
no evidence of edema or hemorrhagic transformation. Blood
pressure maintained with systolics in 140's. Pt started on
aspirin and statin and following head CTA on [**4-18**], was initiated
on heparin gtt for anticoagulation. There was discussion with
neurology and MICU team regarding the risk for bleeding on
heparin. The MICU team unable to find documentation of severe
GIB and given the severity of cerebral vascular dz and
consequences of further thrombosis, elected to anti-coagulate
with iv heparin. The duration of anti-coagulation has not been
established but intitial discussions with neuro indicate that
indefinite anti-coagulation is preferred if clinically
tolerates. His PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may provide further insight with
regards to the risk for bleeding. We started him on coumadin
with no complications.  Coumadin was held [**5-6**] due to elevated
INR.  **INR should be rechecked on [**5-7**] and coumadin restarted
(at lower dose than 5mg).  Coumadin should be titrated for a
goal INR of [**3-1**]. Finally, CT did show evidence of both
cerebellar/right medullary infarct. It has been postulated
(althought not entirely clear) that difficulty in weaned vent
(secondary to apnea) may be result from neurological insult. At
any rate, pt has received a trach and PEG. Currently, he is
responsive to commands and is able to move all extremties,
athough does have weakness on right side.

2. Cardiac Arrest: First cardiac arrest in ED where pt had fell
down after agitation and noted to have no pulse. Pt given
epinephrine as part of PEA algorithim and then developed
pulseless VT requiring defibrillation. Pt was started on amio
gtt and cardiology was consulted. There was some debate as to
whether amio should be continued given his first VT episode may
have been in the setting of epinephrine. Later in his MICU
course, pt noted to have vfib arrest in the setting of self
extubation and respiratory arrest. Pt required epinephrine and
defibrillation x 2. At this point, EP has recommended continued
amiodarone load (400 [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, beginning from [**4-19**]).  He is
now on amiodarone qd as per ep.  Will need a formal EP study as
outpatient in [**1-28**] months.

3. Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated in the setting of
reported PEA arrest during ED course. Course has been notable
for difficult wean off vent mostly secondary to apneic episodes.
The etiolgoy of apnea not entirerly clear. He has not been
overventilated. As mentioned above, there has been speculation
that apnea may be related to medullary infarct interfering with
resp center. Unfortunately, extent of infarct not assessed by
MRI seconary to pacer. In addition, not clear that this would
account for intermittent apnea. Attempts have been made to wean
sedation to r/o other potential etiology of apnea. Given that
patient did have another arrest following self extubation on
[**4-19**] and due to slow progress of wean, ultimately had trach
placed on [**4-26**].  Due to his apnea, which may be triggered by
respiratory alkalosis, theophylline was started.  Target levels
being [**11-15**].  Since then patient has had periods of apnea
lasting about 25 secs and so was placed on MMV, with a backup
rate of 8.

4. Ventilator Associated PNA: Pt did develop fevers and
increased sputum production on the vent several days into MICU
course. Pt empirically started on VAnc and Ceftaz and sputum
subsequently grew Pseuomonas sensitive to Ceftaz. Finished
course of Ceftaz x 8 days for VAP. Then was found to have a line
infection from picc with coag neg staph. PICC d/c'd. Started
Vanco on [**5-2**] to complete 14 day course. Day [**6-9**].  Continue
vancomycin for 14 days.  Follow blood cultures.

5. CHF: History of CHF presumably secondary to moderate to
severe mitral regurigation. F/u echo during hospital course
indicated preserved systolic function with only mild MR. Pt was
persistenly positive on fluid status for nearly week into course
and CVP elevated at over 20. With more flexibility in blood
pressure management, he has been diuresed w/ iv furosemide. Goal
should likely be 500 to 1 liter negative. He has been started on
low dose beta-blocker and restarted on diovan. We also resumed
him spironolactone and today, converted him to standing
diuretics.

6. Afib/pacer: History of afib not anticoagulated in the past
secondary to gib. As mentioned above, now being anticoagulated
in the setting of infarct. He has been ventricular paced during
his coure. He has now been starte
