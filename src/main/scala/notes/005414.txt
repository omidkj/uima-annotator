History of Present Illness:
55F with PMH significant for alcohol abuse, asthma, and seizure
disorder who was admitted from the ED with PNA and ETOH
withdrawal transferred to MICU after an acute episode of hypoxia
to 65% and hypotension.  She was in her usual state of health
until the morning of [**2169-7-29**] when she awoke feeling SOB. She
reports that she felt SOB at rest and with exertion. In
addition, she had cough productive of green and yellow sputum
without hemoptysis. She is unaware if she had any fevers at home
but reports that it was elevated at the OSH. She is unaware of
any sick contacts but reports that she did lose consciousness
and possibly vomited during this time in the past week. The
patient also reported a sore throat, chest pain with coughing.
Denies abdominal pain, nausea. Mild diarrhea.  In the ED, the
pt's VS were 101.1 125 106/50 21 92% RA. Pt was found to have a
left lower lobe PNA on CXR. She received ceftriaxone 1 mg IV x1
and azithromycin 500 mg PO x1 in the ED. Pt also starting to
withdraw in the ED. On the medical floor, she was kept on
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and clindamycin. Her oxygen
saturations on the morning of transfer were 86% at 0600, 90% on
RA at 1000. The patient walked to the bathroom and became
acutely short of breath. She was placed on a NRB 100% with a
100% oxygenation and transferred to the MICU

Past Medical History:
1. ETOH abuse: Pt reports that she drinks 1 pint of vodka per
day. Has been through rehab in the past but always drinks again.
Has had multiple seizures while withdrawing. Reports that her
last drink was 1.5 days ago.
2. Tobacco abuse
3. [**Name (NI) 8134**] Pt reports that this was recetly diagnosed and she
uses her inhalers at home.
4. Seizure disorder- Per pt, her seizures occur in the context
of her coming off ETOH. Her last seizure was two weeks ago.
5. S/P tracheostomy 20 yrs ago for "coma"


Social History:
Pt lives with her mother. She has smoked 1 pack perday for
approximately 40 years. She drinks 1 pint of vodka per day.
Denies drug use. Denies any IV drug use in the past. Pt reports
that her PCP is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location 17065**].

Chest CT: Focal consolidation right lower lobe, concerning for
infectious pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass opacities, concerning
for pneumonia complicated by ARDS. Underlying diffuse lung
disease with organizing fibrosis and foci of pulmonary
ossification, a finding that can accompany chronic interstitial
fibrosis.  Background emphysematous change. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, likely representing hyperplastic nodes in the
setting of diffuse lung disease

Echo: EF 60%. The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was initially
admitted with a left middle and right lower lobe PNA on CXR and
was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On the medical
floor, the patient became acutely short of breath while
ambulating to the bathroom and had an oxygen saturation of 85%
on RA. Her CXR revealed progressive diffuse alveolar infiltrates
concerning for ARDS. She was transferred to the MICU and
intubated.  A bronchoscopy revealed watery secretions.
Immunofluorescence for PCP was negative.  A Chest CT revealed
diffuse ground glass opacities, suggesting pneumonia complicated
by ARDS. The patient was weaned from the ventilator and was
extubated despite being minimally sedated for alcohol withdrawl.
The patient did well off of the ventilator for several hours,
but subsequently became acutely tachycardic and hypertensive
with decreasing oxygen saturations. She was reintubated and a
CXR at that time revealed acute pulmonary edema. She eventually
received a tracheostomy tube ([**2169-8-8**]) and was weaned to a trach
mask at the time of discharge. The etiology of the acute episode
of pulmonary edema was thought to relate to tracheal stenosis
seen on bronchoscopy complicated by negative inspiratory
pressures which with agitation causing tachycardia and
hypertension resulted in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On day of
discharge, she was tolerating minimal ventilatory support on
trach collar, communicating via writing, and afebrile. Given
tracheal stenosis (from prior intubation), patient will need to
be evaluated by interventional pulmonary following discharge.

2. Hypotension: On transfer from the medical floor to the ICU,
the patient was hypotensive to 80/p. The etiology was considered
to be likely septic shock. The patient was briefly on pressors
and started on steroids for a borderline low response to
cosyntropin testing. An echocardiogram revealed no heart
failure, making cardiogenic etiology less likely. She was
started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and clindamycin for concern
for aspiration pneumonia, which was discontinued after
completing a 2 week course.  She continued to experience
episodic periods of hypotension at night likely related to her
tegratol given decreased BP and no corresponding increase HR
related temporally to tegratol dosing, which was discontinued.
On [**2169-8-11**] she became febrile and hypotensive, for which she was
transiently on pressors. This episode was believed to be
secondary to a ventilator-associated pneumonia, given new RLL
infiltrate visualized on CXR, for which she completed a 7 days
of vancomycin/Zosyn. At time of discharge, her blood pressure
remained stable.

3. Alcohol withdrawal:  The patient has a long history of
alcohlism with multiple episodes of withrawal symptoms.  She had
symptoms of active withdrawl including hypertension, tachycardia
and tremors while in the ICU. She was continued on an aggressive
valium CIWA scale while hospitalized. As noted previously, her
weaning from sedation was complicated by her symptoms of alcohol
withdrawl and agitation. For this reason, she was given both
valium and haldol, which were weaned to off. The patient is
currently stable off benzodiazepines.

4. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient initially had a non
gap metabolic acidosis. The two main possibilities considered
were agressive NS repletion versus RTA (positive urine AG
suggestive of type 1 or 4 RTA) This resolved prior to discharge.

5. Seizure disorder:  Per the patient, she has a history of
seizures after sustaining a SDH after fall but may also have
occurred in context of EtOH withdrawal.  Alcohol withdrawal was
managed as indicated above. She was initia
