Admission Date:  [**2197-4-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-4-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-1-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  C-MED

ID:  A 69-year-old female status post syncopal episode.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft x4
in [**2180**], congestive heart failure (diastolic), diabetes
mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency with a
creatinine baseline of 2, renal artery stenosis, status post
stent placement in [**2197-2-3**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
status post cardioversion in [**2196-12-6**], pulmonary
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia who presents status post
syncopal episode at approximately 12 noon the day of
admission.  The patient reports "not feeling well" about one
hour after taking all her medications that morning with some
nausea and dry heaving, as well as unsteadiness, but no
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, chest pain, fevers or
chills.  Sometime before noon, the patient's visiting
caregiver arrived and then witnessed her syncopal episode.
She was sitting in a chair and then just loss consciousness.
The patient denies any warning signs.  She denies any
palpitations, loss of bowel or bladder control or shaking
limbs.  They are unsure of how long she was unconscious.

The patient was then taken to [**Hospital6 2910**]
with electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation/flutter
with a heart rate in the 50s and a blood pressure in the 90s.
The patient had sustained a chin laceration which was
sutured.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] due to lack of telemetry beds
at [**Hospital6 2910**].  Chest x-ray there had shown
some congestive heart failure.  In the [**Hospital1 **]
Emergency Department, the patient felt fatigued, but denied
any other symptoms at that time.

The day prior to her admission at [**Hospital6 649**], the patient was at [**Hospital6 1322**] in the Emergency Room for urinary incontinence and
started on Detrol.  The Monday prior to the patient's
admission, she was discharged from the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital6 14475**] for a six week stay for
rehabilitation.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 9.1, hematocrit 33.6,
platelets 220.  Sodium 135, potassium 5.4, chloride 95, HCO3
28, BUN 95, creatinine 2.8, glucose 144.  Calcium 9.4,
phosphate 4.6, magnesium 2.4, albumin 3.8.  PT 14.4, INR 1.4,

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with
slow ventricular response, normal axis, no acute ST or T-wave
changes, compared with [**2197-3-10**] which showed atrial
fibrillation with normal ventricular response.  Chest x-ray
([**Hospital6 **] [**4-6**]) revealed some congestive heart
failure.  Head CT revealed no acute bleed or abnormal
pathology.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 69-year-old
female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2180**], congestive
heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post
cardioversion in [**2196-12-6**], diabetes mellitus type II,
chronic renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis, status
post stent and hypertension who presents status post syncopal
episode transferred from [**Hospital6 2910**] for
telemetry observation.  It was thought that her syncopal
episode was likely cardiac in origin given her history and
possibly related to her antihypertensive medical regimen of
Lopressor and hydralazine.  The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction by serial CKs.

The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure on
chest x-ray at [**Hospital6 **] and on exam.  The patient
was gently diuresed.  Her creatinine was elevated at 2.8.
The patient currently appeared to have total body fluid
overload, but was intravascularly dry.  The patient's
telemetry also revealed atrial flutter with variable AV
block.  The initial plan involved discontinuing her
hydralazine, continuing her Lopressor and starting an
amiodarone load.  In addition, anticoagulation with heparin
and Coumadin was started given the patient's atrial
fibrillation/flutter.

On the night of [**4-8**], the patient had an episode of
bradycardia/hypotension with heart rate in the 40s and
systolic blood pressure in the 80s requiring 1 mg of Atropine
x2 and then returning to baseline stable condition, but with
sinus bradycardia.  Then, on the morning of [**4-9**],
approximately 7:30 a.m., the patient had another episode of
bradycardia and hypotension with a heart rate as low as 26
and a systolic blood pressure in the 80s requiring 1 mg of
atropine.  The patient was then in sinus bradycardia in the
40s to 50s.  Her blood pressure at the time was in the 110s.
In addition, the patient had vomited dark black
vomitus/coffee ground emesis x1.  In addition, the stool was
trace heme positive.  It was also noted that the patient's
mental status was somewhat changed and she was somewhat
lethargic.  Her telemetry the night before had recorded a
three second pause.  The patient's morning hematocrit at that
time was 25.8 down from 28.3.  The day prior, her hematocrit
was 33.  The patient then began a 2 unit packed red blood
cell transfusion.

The CCU team came to evaluate the patient for her episodes of
bradycardia/hypotension and it was decided that the patient
would be closely observed while on the floor.  It was thought
that her hypotension and bradycardia was likely due to her
initial amiodarone load and the amiodarone and Lopressor were
discontinued.  The EP fellow was also notified and a
temporary pacing wire or a pacemaker at this time was not
deemed necessary given that her bradycardia responded to
atropine.  The patient's heparin and Coumadin had been
stopped given the patient's coffee ground emesis that a.m.
The patient's INR was 2.0 and 10 mg subcutaneous vitamin K
was given as well as 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and agreed on holding any
nasogastric lavage given vagal stimulation may result in
further bradycardia.  Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started and they
agreed with reversing the anticoagulation.  Any further
gastrointestinal work up including esophagogastroduodenoscopy
will be held off until patient stable from a cardiac
standpoint.

In addition, that morning, the patient's mental status had
changed.  In order to rule out possible intracranial bleed,
head CT was performed which was negative.  Mental status
ch
