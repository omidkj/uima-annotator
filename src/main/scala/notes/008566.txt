This is the discharge summary from [**2153-6-14**] to [**2153-6-27**]. The discharge instructions and medications will be
dictated at the time of discharge.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral hand discoloration of fingers and
pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old
gentleman who was seen at the [**Hospital **] Clinic today by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 45636**] for a nonhealing left transmetatarsal amputation site
and ecchymotic painful fingertips bilaterally. The patient
with known peripheral vascular disease. He was initially
evaluated in the emergency room and admitted to the vascular
service for continued care. The patient had a femoral-
dorsalis pedis bypass at [**Hospital 792**]Hospital on [**2153-1-31**]. This was complicated by an explored dehisced vein
graft, a helix amputation and a resulting transmetatarsal
amputation on the left which has not healed. The patient has
noticed that the right hand has been bruised and discolored
for the last month.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included Coumadin 5 mg q.d.,
Cardizem 180 g q.d., Lopressor 200 mg b.i.d., Lasix 80 mg
q.d., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Lantus 18 units b.i.d., Humalog 8
units before meals, Epogen 10,000 units q Monday, Imdur 30 mg
q.d., Prevacid 30 mg q.d., Lipitor 40 mg q.d., Niferex 150 mg
q.d., Renagel 800 mg t.i.d., Percocet and IV Zosyn 2.25
grams.

ILLNESSES:  Included type 1 diabetes with triopathy,
hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, history of
coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction in [**2152-1-24**], peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal
insufficiency.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As listed in History of Present
Illness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies alcohol use or tobacco use. He is
married and lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 99.1, 95, 18, 115/70.
General appearance is a comfortable white male, nontoxic
appearing. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is
unremarkable. The neck is supple without carotid bruits. The
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is
irregular irregular rhythm. Abdominal examination is
unremarkable. Extremity examination shows on the left the
radial pulses are 2+, femoral pulses are 2+, popliteals are
1+. The dorsalis pedis is questionably palpable. The
posterior tibialis is absent. On the right the radial is 1+,
the femoral is 2+, the popliteal is 1+, the pedal pulses on
the right were Dopplerable signals. The upper extremity shows
motor and sensory to be intact bilaterally. There are
ecchymotic changes of fingertip 1 and 2 on the right with
multiple petechial lesions all over the digits. On the left
he has multiple petechial lesions on the lower extremities.
The right heel is with a dry eschar consistent with pressure
skin changes. On the left a VAC is over the transmetatarsal
amputation site. The heel shows gangrenous changes and there
is a granulating wound over the vein graft.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room where vascular surgery was consulted. Initial
treatment was determined by the vascular service. The
patient's white count on admission was 17.6 with a hematocrit
of 27.3 and platelets 733,000. BUN 61, creatinine 3.7,
potassium 4.2. INR was 2.6. The patient underwent PVRs of the
lower extremities which showed absent pulse recordings in the
high thigh. The forefoot metatarsal was read as 10 mm but
flat lined on the right. No distal pressures were measured on
the left. The [**Last Name (un) **] service continued to follow the patient
during his hospitalization and manage his glycemic control. A
duplex of the left femoral dorsalis pedis graft did not
identify any flow within the graft. Renal was requested to
see the patient because of persistent trending upward of his
creatinine to 3.7. The medical service as consulted regarding
the patient's cardiac status. Off site studies shows an
ejection fraction of 20% and cardiac catheterization at the
time of the myocardial infarction showed left anterior
descending coronary artery and right coronary artery disease.
At that time the patient was treated medically. This was
complicated by acute renal failure secondary to contrast
induced with underlying chronic renal insufficiency.
Recommendations were that the patient should have PMIBI
before any further evaluation is done and hold off on any
contrast studies and renal consult. Renal saw the patient on
[**2153-6-18**].

The myocardial perfusion study done on [**6-18**] showed no
myocardial perfusion defect and an ejection fraction of 43%.
MRA studies of the right lower extremity and right arm were
obtained on [**2153-6-19**]. The abdominal pelvic MRA
demonstrated a focal narrowing of the origin of the right
renal artery with a stenotic segment measuring 7 mm. The left
renal artery was normal. There was normal flow seen in the
distal aorta, common iliacs and external iliac arteries.
There was disease present in the common femoral artery
extending into the superficial femoral artery on the left
side. There was also noted on the left side severe focal
areas of moderate stenosis in the mid and distal superficial
femoral artery and moderate focal stenosis present below the
knee popliteal artery. There was diffuse disease in the
tibial peroneal trunk and anterior tibial artery. The
posterior tibial artery has severe disease and occluded in
the proximal portion. There was severe proximal peroneal
artery disease with occlusion in the mid calf. There was no
flow at the ankle. There was normal flow in the anterior
tibial artery and proximal dorsal pedis on the left. On the
right side there was diffuse right superficial femoral artery
disease with a focal high grade stenosis at the adductor
canal. There was mild diffuse disease at the anterior tibial
trunk and peroneal trunk. There was severe disease in the
proximal posterior tibial with segmental reconstruction at
the proximal portion but without flow distally to mid calf.
There was severe disease in the proximal and mid portions of
the peroneal artery with occlusion at the mid portion. There
was no flow in the peroneal artery distally. There was normal
flow in the anterior tibial and visualized portions of the
dorsalis pedis to the mid foot. Also demonstrates normal
flow. The right upper extremity was studied from the aortic
arch to the right elbow. This showed the right brachial
cephalic and subclavian arteries were normal in caliber.
There was a moderate degree of stenosis with any one 1 cm
segment of the right axillary artery. The remainder of the
vessels to the level of the elbow are unremarkable.
Vasculature distal to the elbow could not be evaluated.

Renal discussed the patient's renal status and high risk for
recurrent renal injury with contrast. Recommendations to IV
hydration and a Mucomyst sodium bicarbonate protocol. The
patient was begun on a Dilaudid PCA for analgesic control and
his Lipitor was increased for his hyperlipidemia. He
continued to be followed by [**Last Name (un) **]. His medications all were
renal dosed. The Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the cardiology service was
requested to see the patient for perioperative risk
assessment on [**2153-6-21**]. The stress test was negative for
ischemic changes. The patient was essentially at moderate to
high risk for surgery but we could proceed.

On [**2153-6-21**] the patient had mental status changes with
an elevation in his white count to 35.5. Blood gases were
7.39, 29, 158 and 151, -9. Dopamine was started.
Electrocardiogram was obtained which was without acute
changes and enzymes were requested. The PICC line was
discontinued and a central line was placed for access. The
patient was transferred to the SICU for continued hemodynamic
monitoring. The patient had fever work up consisting of
blood, urine cultures and chest x-ray. The urine cultures
were no growth. Blood cultures were no growth. Catheter tip
from the PICC line was no growth. Rectal and nasal swabs for
MRSA screen were obtained which were negative for MRSA. A
rectal swab for Vancomycin resistant
