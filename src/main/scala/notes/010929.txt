Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 50 M with a past history of diabetes, chronic lower
leg pain, COPD, obesity-related hypoventilation syndrome, past
history of respiratory failure, chronic pain on opiates, DMII
.
Pt has had several MICU admissions for AMS and hypercarbic resp
distress; most recently [**Date range (1) 27183**]. During these admissions his
presentation has been attributed to a multifactorial etiology
including hypoventilation, pulmonary HTN from OSA, COPD
exacerbation. During his most recent admission 4 days ago, he
was placed on BiPAP and briefly intubated. His BiPAP settings
and psychiatric medications were adjusted, psych was consulted
and reduced his medications to seroquel 300mg PO daily,
risperidone 3mg Daily and diazepam 1mg PO QID. Pain service was
also consulted and were able to lower his pain regiment to
oxycontin 40mg PO Q8H and oxycodone 10mg PO Q6H:PRN and Topomax
25mg PO Daily. Plan was ultimately to further lower his diazepam
dose in the outpatient setting.
.
The patient presented to the ED via EMS, as his mother had been
concerned about increased lethargy. On presentation, he was
drowsy but appropriate. The patient's mother stated that she
maintains control of his narcotic medications and that he is
unlikely to have overdosed.  The patient states that one of his
home care nurses has been forgetting to split his diazepam
tablets and has been giving him 2mg tablets in the place of his
usual 1mg dose.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
98.2 100 99/50 8 98% 10L
Labs notable for Na 130, K 5.3, Cr 1.5, AST 143 bu Ap 55, [**Female First Name (un) **]
0.4, lipase 22. ABG: pH 7.24, CO2 69, O2 80, HCO3 31, consistent
with a resp acidosis. lactate 1.5. Urine positive for benzos.
.
The patient was placed on BiPAP and had gradual improvement of
mental status. He was given an initial dose of levofloxacin in
case of COPD exacerbation.  At the time of transfer to the MICU,
BiPAP was discontinued, and he was saturating well on room air
and comfortable.

CXR Portable [**2204-11-24**]:
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette size
remains top
normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with
calcification of the aortic knob. There continues to be minimal
patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect
atelectasis. No pulmonary vascular engorgement is definitively
noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present, but no
pneumothorax is identified.

IMPRESSION: Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases with possible
small pleural effusions. No evidence for pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
50M with h/o OSA, COPD, obesity hypoventilation, and chronic
pain on narcotics, who was admitted with AMS and hypoventilation
likely [**12-20**] polypharmacy.
.
Active Issues:
.
# AMS: Likely [**12-20**] respiratory acidosis in setting of
polypharmacy with accidental benzodiazepine overdose. He was
initially admitted to the MICU due to his h/o requiring
intubation with episodes of respiratory failure.  His sedating
medications were held overnight and his AMS resolved, and he was
transferred to the floor.  Per pt's mother, [**Name (NI) 269**] did not realize
she needed to split his alprazolam pills and he was receiving
twice his prescribed dose.  Home meds initially held and then
were resumed at his prescribed doses on HD#2.  He remained alert
and oriented, although continued to request higher doses of his
pain medications.  We reviewed his prescribed doses of his
medications with both the patient and the patient's [**Name (NI) 269**].  His
alprazolam dose was changed from 1mg Q6H standing to 1mg Q6H
prn, and he was strongly encouraged to only take it as needed.
He is scheduled to follow up with his PCP and in the Pain Clinic
as an outpatient for continued titration of his medications.
.
# Respiratory acidosis: Likely [**12-20**] hypoventilation in setting of
AMS, as above.  His respiratory acidosis resolved once his AMS
cleared.  On discharge he was breathing on room air.
.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission was 1.5, up from
baseline 0.9  This resolved by HD#2 with IV fluids, suggesting
likely pre-renal etiology.
.
# Fever: Pt had an isolated temperature to 100.8 overnight on
HD#2.  He was asymptomatic, and had no evidence of infection on
lab data or imaging.  Since he felt well and the fever did not
recur, it was felt that he could be safely discharged home with
outpatient follow-up.  If he develops focal s/sx and/or if fever
recurs, would recommend pursuing infectious work-up.
.
Chronic Issues:
.
# Chronic Pain on Narcotics: Pt has debilitating chronic pain
[**12-20**] bilateral hip avascular necrosis. Oxycontin/oxycodone
recently decreased during previous hospitalization. He was
continued on his current regimen of oxycontin 40mg PO Q8H with
oxycodone 10mg Q6H:PRN as well as Topomax 25mg Daily with
holding parameters.  He was discharged home with PT services.
.
# Schizophrenia: Stable. Pt and pt's mother denied that pt could
have intentionally overdosed since his medications are managed
by [**Month/Day (2) 269**] and his mother.  His psychiatric medications were
reviewed, and he was continued on buspirone 15mg qAM and 30mg
qPM, seroquel 300mg qhs, risperidone 3mg qhs.  Alprazolam dose
was changed from standing to PRN as above.  He is scheduled to
follow up with his PCP and may require
