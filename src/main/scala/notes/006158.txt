Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
66M with hx of CHF
(EF10%), CRF (baseline 2.6), CAD s/p CABG, AAA, bilateral renal

artery stenosis s/p stenting and COPD who presents from outside

hospital with acute renal failure and CHF exacerbation. Pt
initially presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**3-15**] with chief
complaint of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea associated with
fevers.
On evaluation, pt was thought to be dehydrated given his history

and creatinine of 3.1, up from his baseline of 2.6 so he was
given IVF in the ER. The following day, the creatinine had not
improved and a CXR showed evidence of CHF so pt was started on
lasix. The creatinine continued to rise over his hospital stay
and renal was consulted who thought that his renal failure was
pre-renal [**12-22**] his cardiomyopathy and poor forward flow. He was
started on a lasix drip which was titrated up. His urine output

remained poor and his BUN and creatinine cont to rise, peaking
at
5.6. The renal team discussed dialysis with the patient which he

was very reluctant to start. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation of his worsening renal function and heart
failure
.
Other issues included fever, bacteremia and elevated liver
enzymes. On admission, pt spiked to 101.6 and he was started on

rocephin prophylactically. When blood cultures ([**2-21**]) from
admission grew out Enterococcus casseliflavus, he was started on

vanc on [**3-16**] which was changed to ampicillin on [**3-19**] when
sensitivities returned. ID was consulted and recommended TEE to

rule out vegetations. TEE showed no evidence of vegetations but

did show an EF of [**9-3**]%.He was found to have an elevated
bilirubin and alk phos (to 3.9 and 358 respectively) so the
patient had a workup including GI consult, EGD, ERCP and
ultrasound. ERCP showed normal CBD with no stones and ultrasound

showed enlarged liver and two "suspicious" lesions in the
pancreas possibly adenomyoma vs malignancy. An abdomen/pelvis CT

was also done which showed moderate ascites and gallstones.
.
On admission to the CCU, pt denied any chest pain, shortness of

breath, fevers, chills. His only complaint is that of
constipation.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Pt was afebrile at 96.1. Blood pressure was 113/51 mm Hg while
seated. Pulse was 70 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was
18 breaths/min and 100% on room air. Weight 65kg on the
bedscale.  Generally the patient was well developed, well
nourished and well groomed. The patient was oriented to person,
place and time. The patient's mood and affect were not
inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 14cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were slightly labored and there were

no use of accessory muscles. The lungs had crackles at the bases
to 1/2way up bilaterally. There were also crackles anteriorly.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI was not able to be
located. There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The
heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There
was a soft [**12-26**] early systolic murmur heard best at the LUSB
.
The abdominal aorta was not able to be palpated. There was no
hepatomegaly. The abdomen was soft nontender but moderately
distended with a possible fluid wave. The lower extremities had
no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema and were both warm. There
were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or

palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 1+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+


Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated paced rhythm with occ PVC. No acute changes
when compared to EKG from [**3-15**]
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: paced beats
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2103-1-16**] (at [**Hospital1 18**]) demonstrated:

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by

2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There

is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. The delay between

left ventricular and right ventricular ejection is 62 ms (nl
<40ms). Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There

is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end
diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial

effusion.
.
TEE at OSH [**2103-3-22**]:
1. Mitral annulus is calcified, mild to moderate MR
2. Aortic valve is tricuspid and sclerotic
3. Mild TR with estimated RV systolic pressure of 52mmHg based
on
estimated RA pressure of 10mmHg suggesting pulm HTN
4. LV enlarged [**Last Name (un) **] 6.1cm at end diastole
5. LV is globally hypokinetic with estimated EF of 15%
6. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 40004**] at 4.6cm
7. RV enlarged
8. no ASD or PFO
9. no pericardial effusion
.
no ETT in system
.
no CARDIAC CATH in system
.
[**2103-3-26**]: Renal U/S:
1. Patent main renal arteries bilaterally with good arterial
upstrokes. Increased echogenicity within the renal cortical
parenchyma is consistent with change related to chronic renal
disease.
2. Ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
66M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
10-15%),
BiV pacer and AICD, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with enterococcal
bactermia, unclear source, elevated LFTs, bilirubin, acute on
chronic renal failure with oliguria and CHF exacerbation.
.
1. CHF: EF known to be 10-15% seen on TEE from OSH. Initially,
the patient was thought to be dehydrated in the setting of his
viral gastroenteritis and given fluid at the OSH (unclear how
much). His BNP on admission was markedly elevated at 23,000 and
his JVP is elevated with what appeared to be ascites on exam.
However, he had no oxygen requirement and his lower extremities
were without edema. These findings
pointed towards right heart failure.  His beta blocker was held
in the setting of acute exacerbation as well as his isordil to
give more room for BP.  He was started on dobutamine gtt to
improve pump function and was titrated to UOP>100cc/hr.  The
patient autodiuresed without additional lasix. He was placed on
a low salt diet, daily weights, 1.5L fluid restriction.  Patient
had a significant UOP and became >2L negative over his initial
stay.  He was
