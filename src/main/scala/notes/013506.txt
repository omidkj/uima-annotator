Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**]
Chief Complaint:
code stroke
minimally responsive

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57 yo woman with a negative previous medical
history, obesity, who presents [**2119-11-21**] after being found in the
parking lot with R hemiparesis.
The patient was in her usual state of health, with her sister on
the morning of presentation. The ED neurology resident was able
to talk with her sister over the phone.  Patient had left for
work in the morning and was seen normal at 3.15PM.  At that time
she went out to her car for lunch.  Time passed and at 4.30PM or
so her coworkers decided to go out and look for her.  She was
found in the drivers seat, car off, with emesis, not following
commands.  EMS was called and the patient was found not moving
the right side, still not following commands, with pupils
reactive, FSG 233, BP 184/120.  Her speech was slurred and she
was able to do a weak grip with the left hand.  There was no
movement on the right side.  There were no meds in her purse.
Sister was able to tell us over the phone that she has no known
HTN, no HL, no meds, no OCP, no smoking/ETOH or drugs.

Past Medical History:
No known history to patient or family

Social History:
Lives alone, works in health care administration. No tob, no
etoh.

Family History:
HTN and high cholesterol in family; however, sister admits that
nobody in her family goes to doctor.

Physical Exam:
VS:    T:    BP:   hard to measure - then 170 to 260 over palp
P: 120's    RR:      O2 sat:  80's to 70's RA
General: patient actively vomiting and airway being protected by
primary team.  Moving towards intubation at time of arrival at
5.25pm. Appears overwght, well perfused, with no spontaneous
movemnts on the right.
MS: not answering any questions, no discernible speech, even
when
not having emesis, looks at my facewhen I am on the left side of
bed for a second to command, but she also has a L gaze
preference, so it is not entirely clear if she is following my
command.  Able to squeeze L hand for a second to command.  No
midline commands.  CN exam with PERRLB 3.5->3mm bilaterally and
right facial droop.  Remainder of exam limited by precipitous
intubation.
.
Exam in ICU on propofol - very limited.  Corneals present,
pupils above, w/d to noxious stimuli on left, minimal vs
extensor posturing to stimuli on right UE.
.
Exam upon discharge:
awake, alert, following simple commands, non-verbal, but seems
to understand well
PERL, limited tracking, R-facial droop, severe dysphagia
Dense R-hemiplegia; able to move L side spontaneously
Sensory exam intact to noxious (localized on L; withdraws some
on R)

CXR [**11-20**]:
An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip at the lower margin of
the clavicles. There is diffuse bilateral alveolar airspace
opacification. There is no pneumothorax. An NG tube is seen
extending below the diaphragm with its coursing off the edge of
this radiograph. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
ET tube at level of the inferior clavicle. Diffuse bilateral
airspace opacification may represent edema, infection, or ARDS.
.
Initial CT [**11-20**]:
FINDINGS: There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
centered in the left basal ganglia which measures 6.2 x 2.5 cm.
There is also blood within the bilateral lateral ventricles and
also a small amount of blood within the third ventricle. There
is no evidence of hydrocephalus and the ventricles are of normal
size. There is minimal shift of the midline structures to the
right side. There is no evidence of uncal herniation or
herniation of the tonsils. There is calcification of the right
vertebral artery. Examination of the bone windows demonstrates
normal aeration of the visualized portions of the mastoid air
cells and paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of the left
basal ganglia, with intraventricular extension.
.
MRI/A BRAIN [**11-23**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is a large acute hemorrhage likely centered
in the left lentiform nucleus with effacement of the left
lateral ventricle and minimal shift of normally midline
structures to the right. No nodular enhancement is identified
around the hemorrhage. Of note, there is a linear focus of
hemorrhage in the left anterior temporal lobe consistent with a
developmental venous anomaly. Susceptibility images are
remarkable for innumerable foci of susceptibility in the
cerebral and especially cerebellar hemispheres. While some of
these foci likely represent subarachnoid blood, many foci appear
intraparenchymal. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures
are unremarkable.
TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
reconstructions.
FINDINGS: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent. No aneurysms are identified and no area of significant
stenosis is seen.
IMPRESSION: Large acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage likely
centered in the left lentiform nucleus. Numerous foci of
susceptibility, especially in the cerebral hemispheres,
consistent with micro-hemorrhages. Overall, these findings are
suggestive of a hypertensive etiology. However, given the
presence of a developmental venous anomaly in the left temporal
lobe adjacent to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the presence
of multiple cavernous malformations is a consideration.

.
ECHO [**11-28**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably low  normal.
.
CXR [**12-4**]:
1. Improved pulmonary edema.
2. Worsening bibasilar opacities, most likely due to a
combination of atelectasis and effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 56 year old woman with "no past medical
history" because she had not seen a doctor in years, presented
with L subcortical ICH.  She had gone to lunch around 3pm, and
was found in her car about an hour later with emesis and right
sided weakness. She was admitted to the Neurology service.
.
ICU course:
Dilantin was loaded for ?shaking in ED, intubated at time
(preintubation NIHSS score was 22).  She was initially very
hypertensive "220s/palp", started on labetolol gtt and then
later propofol. Then in the ICU around 10pm she became
hypotensive to 60's -> 90's with IVF and head down; started
pressors.  At the time, her exam demonstrated: pupils 1.5->1mm
bilat, + corneals, no dolls, postures right arm, triple flex
right leg, withdraws on the left.  Repeat head CT showed slight
worsening of L-ICH.  Drop in pressure was either sepsis-related
(with aspiration pna) or related to damage of insula and
autonomic instability.  EKG was sinus tach.  PE not considered
likely given good sats (later dropped sats but responded to
suctioning.)  On [**11-21**], BP had stabilized and the pt was off
pressors; CXR had demonstrated pulmonary edema, widened
mediastinum thought related to volume overload/
