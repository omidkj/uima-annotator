Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented to the trauma bay on [**2158-11-1**]. The pt was intubated
on arrival due to agitation. Studies on admission were as above,
showing R small ICH into Meningioma; R femur Fx, R max
sinus/orbital floor & nasal Fx, R femur fx, occluded SFA.  Pt
was admitted to the Trauama SICU.  2 units PRBCs were given.
Orthopedics, Plastic surgery (covering face), Neurosurgery, and
vascular surgery were consulted.  In [**11-2**] the pt had open
reduction of her femur fracture with external fixation.  Per
Vascular recs, angiography of the lower extremities was
performed to evaluate for decreased pulses and ABI of 0.2.
Angio was unremarkable.  Opthalmology was consulted and found no
evidence of entrapment or globe injury.  A head CT was repeated,
showed no change from admission.  A left axillary a-line was
placed and a R subclavian central line was attempted
unsuccessfully.  The pt was started on prophylactic Unasyn for
her facial fx.  On [**11-3**] a spinal CT was obtained, showing T11,
L1,L3 compression fx. On [**11-4**] 2 more units PRBC were given for
persistently low hct (23-25). On [**11-6**] the pt had a right IJ
line placed successfully.  The pt was taken to the OR by
orthopedics for internal fixation of the right femur.  On [**11-7**]
the pt was started on Lovenox.  Neurosurgery stated the small
ICH into her meningioma was nonoperative in nature and signed
off.  On [**11-9**] the pts persisten anemia was evaluated by
hematology, who determined the pt has Anti-E and Anti-Jkb
antibodies causing a persistent low-grade hemolysis and mild
transfusion reactions.  On [**11-10**] the pt recieved 2 more units
PRBCs.  The pt remained stable until [**11-14**] when weaning from the
vent was attempted unsuccessfully.  1 additional unit PRBC was
given. Unasyn was stopped (day 13).   On [**11-15**] an echocardiogram
was obtained showing EF >75%, thickened MV, dilated LA.  On
[**11-16**] the pt was taken to the OR for tracheostomy and PEG tube
insertion.  Optho signed off the pt, diagnosing a traumatic
right 6th nerve palsy that can be followed as an outpt.   On
[**11-17**] the pt was started on tube feedings.  On [**11-20**] the pt was
noted to be febrile with infiltrates on CXR.  A bronchoscopy was
performed with BAL.  BAL gram stain showed gram neg rods and the
pt was started on Levofloxacin.  The following day the bacteria
was identified as Pseudamonas and ceftazidime was added.  Also
on [**11-21**] flex/ex films of the c-spine showed no ligamentous
injury.   On that day Heme/Onc left formal recommendations
stating that the pt has what is likely a chronic though
non-classic hemolytic anemia with poor marrow response of
unknown origin.  They due to the presence of alloantibodies,
they reccommended transfusing crossmatched blood only when
needed.  The also recommended maintaining Hct in the 25-26
range. On [**11-22**] sensitivities showed the pseudamonas showing her
pneumonia to be sensitive to imipenem, which was started.  A
Passey-mask was placed.  On [**11-23**] a swallow eval showed the pt
to be cleared to take soft solids and advance slowly.   On the
same day a psych consult was called for agitation and auditory
and visual hallucinations.  Psychiatry made a diagnosis of
multifactorual delerium and recommended standin orders for IV
Haldol.  On [**11-24**] the pt had a PICC line placed and her central
line was removed.  On [**11-26**] the pt was transferred to the floor.
She remained stable on the floor until [**2158-11-29**] when she was
discharged to an acute rehab facility.
