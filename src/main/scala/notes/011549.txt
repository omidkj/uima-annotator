Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion with leukocytosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
55m with mental retardation, seizure d/o, recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**]
([**Date range (1) 56409**]) for seizure and aspiration pna where found to have
elevated Tn and low EF, subsequent admit to BIDN ([**Date range (1) 15037**]) for
chest pain and palpitations where he was diagnosed with
pericarditis, pleural effusion, and atrial fibrillation who
presented to BIDN on [**4-29**] with recurrent chest pain and was found
to have a larger effusion, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation. His mother says that he was scheduled for a
MIBI today but had felt poorly over the weekend, with fevers and
chest pain. They called the cardiologist who told them to go the
ED instead of stress test. At BIDN, he had blood cultures drawn
and was treated with zosyn and vancomycin for his WBC of 20, and
a TTE showed increased effusion. At [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] echo was
performed showing no evidence of tamponade, improved EF from
[**Month (only) 958**] and early [**Month (only) 547**]. He came to the ED in sinus rhythm but had
a run of atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate in
160's-170's, but converted back to sinus after 12.5mg of
metoprolol; he remained hemodynamically stable and had pulsus of
8. When seen on the floor, he denied any chest pain or dyspnea,
though seemed to be slightly tachypneic to mid 20's, satting 93%
on room air.

Past Medical History:
-Meningitis as an infant
-Mental retardation
-Seizure disorder
-Hyponatremia of unclear etiology (query anti-epileptics)
-Cardiomyopathy: unknown, though possibly ischemic etiology, EF
30-35% but estimated pcwp < 12 per tte doppler, no CHF sx
-Possible CAD: no prior cath or stress, but upon [**3-/2143**] admit
for aspiration pna and sz, found to have elevated Tn (0.73) and
MB-index, multiple WMAs seen on TTE
-Right atrial mass: seen on [**3-/2143**] TTE, unknown etiology, not
seen on subsequent TTEs
-OSA

[**2143-4-29**] CXR:
Lateral view is nondiagnostic. The cardiac silhouette is
moderately enlarged. Increased interstitial marking and hilar
congestion and enlarged heart consistent with presence of frank
heart failure and underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**2143-4-30**] TTE: EF 45%
An echodensity is seen in the right atrium which appears to be
contiguous with the RA free wall (?fatty infiltration of RA
wall). The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There
appears to be mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, although views are limited on the
current study and the patient is currently in rapid atrial
fibrillation. The remainder of the walls contract well. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion . The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-4-9**],
structure in the right atrium is not as well seen and the
pericardial effusion is larger. There is no echocardiographic
evidence of pericardial tamponade. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appears slightly improved.
.
[**3-/2143**] TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. A 2x1.5cm echogenic "mass" is
seen within the wall of the right atrium c/w ? Hematoma vs.
intramural thrombus vs. ??. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral and anterolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract well.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral
and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function,
and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There is focal basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Left
ventricular cavity enlargement with extensive regional left and
right ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel
coronary artery disease. Right atrial wall thickening as
described above. If clinically indicated, a chest CT may be able
to better derine the abnormality of the right atrial free wall.

.
[**2143-4-29**] TTE (BIDN): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.(35% mitral
variation and 45% tricuspid variation in E flow).
Mild increase in amount of pericardial fluid from study of
[**2143-4-29**]. There is also increase in phasic variation in
tricuspid and mitral flow and increase in IVC diameter.
.
[**2143-4-29**] CXR: Impressive cardiomegaly with interstitial edema,
possible small left pleural effusion, no obvious infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
55m with Mental retardation and seizure disorder admitted as a
transfer from [**Location (un) 620**] for persistent chest pain thought to be
secondary to pericarditis.
.
1) Chest pain/Pericarditis -- He was admitted to BIDN and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] starting [**4-29**] for chest pain and concern of
worsening pericarditis.  There was thought initially that this
could be consistent with a Dressler's syndrome given the
positive cardiac enzymes [**Date range (1) 56409**](Patient was seen by
cardiology and HCP refused cardiac catherization despite peak
trop 0.73).  However, per cardiology fellow, Dressler's was
thought to be less likely given that there was question if the
patient had a transmural infarct.  Regardless patient was
treated at [**Location (un) 620**] and here with indomethacin and had
improvement of his symptoms.  Additionally follow up
echocardiograms were performed that showed improvement of the
pericardial eff
