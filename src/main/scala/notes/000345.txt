Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS

1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.

2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is borderline normal
(LVEF 45-50%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. The ascending aorta tube graft appears abnormal with a
supravalvular obstruction which may represent a kinking of the
aortic root (homograft root) and ascending aortic tube graft
connection. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Motion of the aortic valve prosthesis leaflets/discs is abnormal
with one leaflet prolapsing into the LVOT and the other two
leaflets are calcified and fairly immobile. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets are thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis ?supravalvular(area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

5. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

6. There is no pericardial effusion.

7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
during the surgery on [**2146-4-20**] at 1156

POST-BYPASS:

The patient is in sinus rhythm and on infusions of
phenylephrine, epinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min, and vasopressin
3units/hour

1. Biventricular is mildly depressed in the immediate post
bypass period. The function normalized by the end of the surgery
(on vasoactive infusions). Overall LVEF 50 to 55%
2. A new mechanical aortic valve is present is good position
with good leaflet motion and appropriate washing jets. The peak
velocity through the valve is approximately 3 m/s with a peak
gradient of 37 mmHg (C.O 6 l/min]

3. A new aortic tube graft has replaced the previous one and
relieved the supravalvular obstrucion.
4. Mild MR and trivial TR.
5. Intact thoracic aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**4-20**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please
refer to separate operative note. Extubated the following
morning and suffered a single seizure.  Neurology was consulted.
CT of the head revealed no bleed, and multiple old granulomas.
EEG did not reveal evidence for seizure.  The patient developed
compartment syndrome of right lower extremity.  He was
reintubated for surgical fasciotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after
right calf swelling noted on POD #1. Extubated again on POD #2.
He awoke neurologically intact without further seizure or
neurological complication.  Wound vac was placed to fasciotomy
sites.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued in the
usual fashion without complication.  Coumadin was started.  He
was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
post-operative strength and mobility.  The patient noted
difficulty with [**Location (un) 1131**] comprehension, so neurology was
re-consulted.  MRI/MRA of the head and neck were performed and
results are pending at the time of discharge.  Postop course was
otherwise uneventful and the patient was discharged home with
appropriate follow up instructions as well as VNA services on
POD 5.
