Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2155-8-22**] Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4, left internal

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with hyperlipidemia s/p NSTEMI after initial
presentation to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2155-8-9**]. He initially
noted SOB, and after a troponin >2.0 and CPK 300, he underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed 3 vessel CAD (ulcerated
90% mid LAD and 80% D1, 70% prox OM1, 40% mid RCA)and an EF of
35%. He had been given Plavix and was awaiting a "washout"
pre-operatively, but was then noted to have progressively longer
runs of ventricular tachycardia. By report, he had an episode of
MMVT 6 minutes in duration at OSH.  He was started on amiodarone
and lidocaine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical management.
He also reportedly had no hemodynamic or neurologic compromise
at the time.

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-8-15**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%

[**8-22**] Echo: Prebypass: A mass is seen in the wall of the right
atrium. It appears to arise from the anterolateral wall of the
right atrium and measures 4.5 cms. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex,
apical and mid portions of the inferior and inferoseptal walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2155-8-22**] at 900am. Post bypass:
Patient is V paced and receiving an infusion of Norepinephrine,
Epinephrine and Milrinone. LVEF= 35%. Mild mitral regurgitation
persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation. The mass in the
wall of the right atrium is still present

DIAGNOSIS:

Right atrial mass:
Mature adipose tissue with entrapped cardiac myocytes consistent
with lipoma.
Clinical: CAD
Gross:
The specimen is received fresh in one part in a container
labeled "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]", the medical record number and "right
atrial mass".  It consists of two fragments of yellow-white
somewhat myxoid soft tissue measuring 0.8 and 0.3 cm,
respectively.  The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette A.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after STEMI (found to have 3
vessel coronary artery disease) with numerous episodes of NSVT
progressing to sustained V-tach. He was admitted to the CVICU on
[**8-15**] for monitoring on amiodarone/lidocaine drip for VTach
suppression. EP was consulted and made recommendations.  He had
a chest CT with contrast to evaluate dilated aortic root.  He
underwent plavix washout over the next few days and subsequently
went into acute renal failure over the wkd.  Nephrology
consulted.  Felt most likely contrast induced nephropathy.  This
would resolve, and creatinine would return to normal levels.
Carotid ultrasound revealed <40% stenosis bilaterally.  Wound
care was consulted for intergluteal cleft ulcer.
Recommendations were made, wound healed and there were no
further complications of this.
The patient received a PICC on [**2155-8-19**].
The patient developed hematuria, urology was consulted and
heparin discontinued.  Urology re-placed foley.
He developed a phlebitis which was treated with ancef.  Bactrim
was given for pre-op Klebsiella UTI.  Sleep medicine was
consulted for sleep apnea/CPAP recommendations.
The patient did go to the OR with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**8-22**] for CABG x
4 and biopsy of left atrial mass (which would prove to be lipoma
on pathology).  He was transferred to the CVICU on epinephrine,
milrinone and levophed.  On the morning of POD 1 he developed
pulseless VT requiring cardioversion.  EP was re-consulted and
the patient did receive an AICD on [**2155-8-29**].
The right lower extremity was found to be swollen and cool with
dopplerable pulses.  DVT was ruled out by ultrasound.
The patient made progress and was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further physical therapy and recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  ICD was interrogated after PICC was discontinued
on [**2155-8-30**].  The patient was discharged to rehab on [**2155-8-30**] with
appropriate follow-up instructions.
