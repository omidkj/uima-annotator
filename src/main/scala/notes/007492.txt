Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for elective pleurx catheter placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bronchoscopy
2. Thoracentesis (diagnostic and therapeutic)
3. Transesophageal echocardiogram
4. PICC line replacement
5. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter resiting


History of Present Illness:
64 y/o F, with a PMHx significant for severe COPD, diastolic
CHF, AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) on coumadin, s/p MRSA sternotomy wound
infxn, DM2, ESRD on HD, and a fib, who was sent from [**Hospital1 15554**] for elective thoracentesis and pleurx catheter
placement for persistent left sided pleural effusions, likely
from CHF.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 56642**] with a
complicated hospital course which included:
-intubation for respiratory failure (likely CHF + COPD)
requiring trach and PEG
-high grade bacteremia and concern for prosthetic valve
endocarditis (neg TEE)
-PEA arrest (?mucus plug vs hypovolemia)
-ARF->anuria->HD dependent
-left pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis
-left parietal hemorrhage [**2-21**] heparin gtt
-c. dif colitis requiring flagyl and po vanc

At [**Hospital1 **], she has not made any significant advancement in
weaning from the vent.  She developed fevers during HD in [**Month (only) **]
[**2130**] and CXR demonstrated left pleural effusion.  She was
pancultured and found to have high grade serratia bacteremia
present in BCx from HD cath and PICC line.  Decision was made to
treat with 3 weeks of abx and not change her lines.  She
deferevesced and had surveillence BCx demonstrating clearance of
infection.  Unfortunately, due to her coumadin, she was unable
to have the left pleural effusion tapped.

Since [**Month (only) 404**], her left pleural effusion has not significantly
changed with fluid removal at dialysis.  She is therefore
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pleurx drainage placement.  She has been
off coumadin for days with stable heparin gtt.

ROS: pt denies any SOB, CP, paliptations, fever, chills, N/V,
rigors.

Past Medical History:
1. Diastolic heart failure
2. ESRD on HD
3. aortic valve replacement (st. [**Male First Name (un) **])
4. paroxysmal a fib
5. Thrombocytopenia
6. COPD
7. MRSA + sternotomy wound infxn ~2year ago. Treated with
~1years of IV Vanc at [**Hospital1 2177**] (per daughter)
8. MRSA Bacteremia s/p 4 weeks of vanc [**Date range (1) 56643**]
9. h/o PEA arrest
10. left parietal CVA
[**37**]. persistent hyperphos
12. Type II DM
13. recent serratia bacteremia (as above)
14. Anemia of chronic dz
15. chronic sacral decub
16. necrotic right toes

      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity available on request.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

TEE [**3-5**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Left ventricular cavity size is normal with abnormal
septal motion. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aort
and in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A bileaflet aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion. No vegetation is seen,
but an echoluscent 3 wide extending 8mm around the posterior
aortic root with systolic expansion and minimal color Doppler
flow consistent with an aortic annular abscess. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen
[may be normal for this prosthesis]. The mitral valve leaflets
are
mild-moderately thickened but without discrete vegetation. Mild
to moderate([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared to the TEE study of [**2130-10-26**] (tape reviewed) the
posterior aortic root space is NEW and consistent with an
abscess cavity. The severity of mitral regurgitation is also
increased, but mitral valve morphology is similar. Ventricular
septal function is similar.
