Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Presented with unresponsiveness and mental status change.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**2170-3-29**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of hypertension who
presented on [**3-29**] after being found unresponsive by her
caregiver at home.
.
As per MICU notes, the patient "was found by her caregiver this
morning around 9 am unresponsive. Had last been seen by her
caregiver the night before, 6 pm, in her usual state of health."
Per her niece, the patient had been more lethargic over the past
10 days and had seemed short of breath. No other complaints
noted.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were 99.6, 117/91, 92, 16, and
97%RA. She was unresponsive to sternal rub and had no gag
reflex. She was intubated for airway protection. She was sedated
with propofol (unclear why as unresponsive?) She then became
hypotensive to the 80s/50s and propofol was turned off; she got
a bolus of one liter and her blood pressure responded to 130/47.
Her ECG showed new TWI in II, III, and aVF, and her troponin was
positive at 0.21. She was given solumedrol 125 mg, ceftriaxone 2
grams, vancomycin 1 gram, and aspirin 600 mg pr. She had a
lumbar puncture and a head CT which were unremarkable. Her CXR
showed kyphoscoliosis and borderline cardiomegaly but no acute
lung process.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, her niece reported that the patient is
DNR/DNI and would not want invasive procedures. She stated that
the patient would want to be extubated, so patient was
extubated.  Upon discontinuation of the propofol, the patient
was awake, alert, and oriented."

As per report, she denied any complaints, including no chest
pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain.
.
An echocardiogram obtained yesterday, [**3-30**], demonstrated a
dilated RV with RV hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension, an
underfilled LV cavity with LVH and hyperdynamic LVEF and a small
ASD with
bidrectional flow at rest. Findings are suggestive of RV strain
(PE?) and intracardiac shunting.
.
The MICU team has had extensive discussion with the patient and
her family and decision has made to pursue comfort measures
only.
.
She is transferred to the floor at this time.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
Cardiac ECHO ([**2170-3-30**]):
Dilated RV with RV hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension.
Underfilled LV cavity with LVH and hyperdynamic LVEF. A small
ASD with bidrectional flow at rest. These findings are
suggestive, but not diagnostic for RV strain (PE?) and
intracardiac shunting.
.
CT head ([**2170-3-29**]):
1.  No acute intracranial process.  2.  Moderate global atrophy,
with chronic bilateral basal ganglia lacunes.  3.  Possible
acute-on-chronic inflammatory changes involving the maxillary
and ethmoid sinuses and right mastoid air cells.
.
Chest Xray ([**2170-3-29**]):
1)  ET tube tip roughly 3.7 cm proximal to the carina, likely in
satisfactory position.  2)  Marked thoracic kyphoscoliosis and
right chest wall deformity related to multiple rib fractures, as
before.
3)  Linear scarring and atelectasis involving the right lung,
but no definite consolidation. 4)  Borderline cardiomegaly
without CHF.
