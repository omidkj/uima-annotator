CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise and chest discomfort.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
male with coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft in 12/99, with peripheral vascular
disease, chronic renal insufficiency and congestive heart
failure, who is admitted with left sided chest discomfort
today, status post taking Lopressor 50 mg for an episode of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was in his usual state of
health until today when he visited with a visiting nurse who
noticed an irregularly irregular pulse.  The patient went to
congestive heart failure clinic at [**Hospital6 15291**] where he normally goes.  He was found to be in
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate in the
160s.  He was given Lopressor 50 mg, Coumadin 5 mg and
advised to discontinue his Plavix.  He took the Lopressor of
50 mg at 5:00 p.m.  At 6:00 p.m., he developed chest
tightness, neck tightness and left sided chest pain two out
of ten.  EMS found him with a heart rate of 72 and regular,
blood pressure 60/palpable.  He was brought to the Emergency
Department where he received a bolus of normal saline 500 cc
times one and was placed on a Dopamine drip.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Procainamide with
gastrointestinal symptoms, Amiodarone caused agitation and
confusion.  Intravenous dye caused acute renal failure.  The
patient is allergic to shellfish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] has a past tobacco history and quit.  He has a history of
recent increase in his alcohol consumption, three to five
drinks per day.  His primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 30186**].
Cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30187**] and his nurse practitioner [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30188**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies fever, chills, no
cough, no shortness of breath, no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, no orthopnea, no lower extremity edema, no angina,
and positive lower extremity cellulitis.  The patient says
this chest pain is the first chest pain he has had in at
least one year and denies any chest pain prior to his
myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was resting
comfortably in a bed, complaining of mild headache.  Vital
signs revealed pulse 84, blood pressure 95/48 on 5 of
Dopamine, respiratory rate 24, saturating 96% on two liters
nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed moist mucous membranes.  The neck was supple without
jugular venous distention.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular - regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, decreased carotid upstroke and
jugular venous pressure six centimeters.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing with minimal
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, the patient had white count
8.2, hematocrit 39.9, platelets 258,000.  Sodium 138,
potassium 4.9, chloride 102, bicarbonate 16, blood urea
nitrogen 73, creatinine 3.9, glucose 131.  INR was 1.1 and
partial thromboplastin time was 27.4.  The CKs initially was
34 and increased to 38 and troponin was 0.3 increasing to
1.4.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per
minute with right bundle branch block as well as left
anterior fascicular block, Q wave V1 through V3 and ST
depressions 1.0 millimeter with T wave inversions in V1
through V6 which are old.

OTHER PREVIOUS HISTORY:  The patient has a history of an
ejection fraction of 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation, status
post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**] and aortic valve
replacement [**1-/2135**].  Coronary artery bypass graft anatomy was
left internal mammary artery to the D1, saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
OM1 and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
artery.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 77 year old with coronary
artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status
post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve
replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dilated
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% and 3+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, pulmonary
hypertension with multiple admissions for right greater than
left sided heart failure, status post a recent admission
[**8-12**], to the [**Hospital1 882**] for osteomyelitis complicated by a
bacteremia on a six week course of antibiotics, recently
discontinued two weeks ago, now admitted with hypotension,
chest pain in the setting of a beta blocker, treatment for an
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation [**2136-10-10**], and likely a
hypovolemic state.

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient has known coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction, coronary artery
bypass graft, no angina, with prior myocardial infarction,
aura at home over the last year, presents now with complaints
of chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation and
hypotension, may be related to atrial fibrillation symptoms
or demand ischemia related to decreased blood pressure.
Troponin and CKs were negative on admission.  Troponin
eventually increased to 3.7 possibly consistent with a non Q
wave myocardial infarction secondary to a demand ischemia
from hypotension.

His electrocardiogram was unchanged.  His hypotension may be
secondary to hypovolemia consistent with diarrhea as well as
increasing diuretic dose as well as a beta blocker dose given
yesterday.  The patient is now in normal sinus rhythm.
Quinidine dose was within normal limits at the [**Hospital6 8866**] Clinic yesterday.

The plan is to continue Aspirin and Heparin until rule out
myocardial infarction, titrate off Dopamine as blood pressure
improves with normal saline boluses, hold his ace and
diuretic while hypotensive, continue Quinidine, hold Coumadin
if remains in normal sinus rhythm, consider echocardiogram to
evaluate for any worsening of function to explain worsening
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms and weight gain,
continue Zocor.

2.  Pulmonary - Pulmonary hypertension reportedly increased
right greater than left sided heart failure symptoms.  The
lungs are clear.  Saturation within normal limits in room
air.

3.  Renal - Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine
around 2.0 at baseline.  Recently worsening secondary to
possibly Vancomycin treatment or Torsemide.  Acute renal
insufficiency on admission here could be consistent with
hypotension in the setting of a prerenal state.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient has a history of chronic
osteomyelitis of the right toes complicated by recent
bacteremia.  No active infection evident at this time.
Hypotension may also represent possible sepsis if infection
inadequately treated.  Will send blood cultures, urine
cultures.  Hold antibiotics at this time.

5.  Gastrointestinal - Epigastric discomfort likely secondary
to gut edema, abdominal distention from right heart fail
