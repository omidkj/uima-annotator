HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18 year old
female who was transferred from an outside hospital status
post motor vehicle accident in which the front end of her car
impacted with a truck.  She did not sustain any head trauma
or loss of consciousness, but she did hit her abdomen against
the steering wheel.  When she presented to the outside
hospital, she was complaining of abdominal pain.  Her CT scan
of her abdomen at the outside hospital showed a liver and
splenic laceration, and her hematocrit at that time was 35.0.
She was given one unit of packed red blood cells at the
outside hospital and then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical examination at [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department showed
vital signs with temperature 98.5, heart rate between 103 and
112, blood pressure 112/60, respiratory rate 12, oxygen
saturation 100 percent.  The patient was in no acute distress
with moist mucous membranes.  The pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Tympanic membranes clear bilaterally.  No neck
tenderness.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
crepitus.  Heart tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs
heard.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, tender to palpation
throughout.  Positive voluntary guarding.  Rectal tone
normal, guaiac negative.  Back - no pain to palpation.
Neurologically, moving all four extremities, 5/5 strength
throughout and normal sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No past medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No past surgical history

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  No home medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol or tobacco use.

LABORATORY DATA:  When the patient presented to [**Hospital1 346**], her pertinent laboratories include
white blood cell count 27.3, hemoglobin 10.5, hematocrit 30.6
down from 35.0 at the outside hospital, platelet count
351,000.  Urinalysis negative.  Blood urea nitrogen 14,
creatinine 0.5.  Initial liver function tests showed ALT 543,
AST 504, alkaline phosphatase 36.3, amylase 30, total
bilirubin 0.4, lipase 14.  Toxicology screen negative.
Chemistries showed glucose 155, sodium 141, potassium 3.8,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 29, lactate 1.4.

The patient had an initial CT of her spine which was negative
and abdominal CT which showed a grade II splenic laceration
and a grade III liver laceration and a small left
pneumothorax.  She had a negative chest x-ray and a negative
pelvis x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2132-1-25**], to
the trauma service and was given a bed in the trauma surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient remained stable in the
Intensive Care Unit with unchanged abdominal examination and
stable hematocrit, and she was transferred to the surgical
floor on [**2132-1-27**].  On [**2132-1-29**], the patient spiked a
fever to 101.0.  Chest x-ray at that time showed a right
lower lobe consolidation, and she was started on Levaquin.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable.  Her abdominal
examination improved and her liver function tests steadily
decreased.  During the hospital stay, the patient did have
consistent tachycardia usually ranging between 100 and 110
but occasionally going up to the 120 to 140 range.  The
patient had electrocardiograms done which showed sinus
tachycardia but unchanged from the baseline electrocardiogram
on admission.  On [**2132-1-31**], a cardiology consultation was
obtained.  The cardiologist felt the tachycardia was
consistent with the patient's activity and given the setting
of the liver and splenic lacerations with a pneumonia, the
sinus tachycardia was consistent with an increased adrenergic
state post injury.  A TSH was checked and the patient was
continued on antibiotics.  She was discharged on [**2132-1-31**],
to home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Grade II splenic laceration.

Grade III liver laceration.

Small left pneumothorax.

Pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. daily times
seven days.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow-up in the Trauma Surgery
Clinic in two weeks.  She will follow-up again in the Trauma
Surgery Clinic in two months for a repeat abdominal CT.
