Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement, left hip reduction

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 yo F with a PMH of asthma, HTN, AV nodal ablation
with PCM placement, PVD, and other medical problems who presents
with hypotension and hypoxia. The patient was feeling unwell for
the past 2 weeks, with rhinorrhea, and cough productive of green
sputum and streaked with blood. She has noted increasing
shortness of breath over the past several days, but no increase
in her lower extremity edema. She also denies PND or nocturia.
She has been increasingly using her albuterol nebs several times
a day for the past several days. She notes that her theophyline
was discontinued in [**Month (only) 359**]. She has been taking her lasix as
instructed, but notes some dietary indiscretion with the recent
holidays. She also notes some increased wheezing, but denies any
chest pain, palpitations, or fevers. Of note, pt also had a
mechanical fall out of bed this AM, landed on her hips, and now
complains of bilateral hip pain.

In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 97.2 HR 70s BP 80-101/31-49, R
15-20, Sat 95% 5 LNC. She was noted to have a possible LUL
infiltrate on CXR so she was given clindamycin 600 mg IV x 1 and
levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1. She also was given Lasix 100 mg IV x1
for concern of pulmonary edema on exam. Due to her SBP of 80, a
femoral CVL was inserted and she was started on dopamine at 10
mcg/kg/min. She was then transferred to the floor for further
management.

Past Medical History:
1. Asthma.
2. Hypertension.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. Atrial fibrillation status post amio toxicity,
status post ablation of the A-V node and pacemaker placement
in [**2138-12-26**].
5. PVD
6. Anticoagulated.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Lower extremity cellulitis with MRSA.
9. Venous stasis disease.
10. Left hip fracture in [**2129**] with multiple complications.
11. DVT.
12. Bell's palsy.
13. Left heel ulcer.
14. Left total knee replacement.

Micro: [**12-7**] blood cultures: [**2-26**] with strep pneumo, sensitive to
ceftriaxone, R to PCN. [**12-8**] blood NGTD (4 bottles). Legionella
neg.
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**12-7**]):
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ONE VIEW: Heart size is moderately
enlarged. There is a focal airspace opacity in the left upper
lung zone, which may represent an area of infectious infiltrate.
There is no overt CHF. No definite pleural effusions are seen.
Single lead pacer with tip terminating in the right ventricle is
unchanged. Osseous structures are mildly demineralized,
otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal airspace opacity in the left upper lung may represent
pneumonia.
2. Cardiomegaly.
.
EKG: V paced, no change from prior
.
ECHO [**2144-12-7**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-24**], a
pacing wire/catheter is now clearly seen in the RA/RV. There is
no pericardial effusion. LV function and mitral regurgitation
are similar. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal on the current study.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75 yo F with a PMH of asthma, HTN, AV nodal ablation with
PCM placement, PVD, and other medical problems who presents with
hypotension and hypoxia, found to have LUL PNA on CXR and Strep
pneumo septicemia.
.
# Strep pneumo pneumonia/septicemia: Admitted to MICU.  Was
hypotensive requiring fluids and pressors (initially on
phenylephrine, norepi, dobutamine then weaned to dopa) initially
in MICU.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  When
culture data returned, antibiotics were trimmed down to
ceftriaxone.  With her hypotension, also evaluated for adrenal
insufficiency and had [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test, which was normal.  Became
afebrile and leukocytosis improved.  Weaned off pressors and
transferred to the floor.  No further issues with hypotension.
Completed a 14 day course of ceftriaxone.
.
# Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress: History of asthma; now with
new pneumonia. With hypotension/shock required a lot of fluids.
Resp status was likely a combination of underlying chronic lung
disease/asthma with pneumonia and volume overload/CHF. On ABGs,
has had mild to mod hypercarbia. [**12-12**] AM she triggered for
hypoxemia to low 80's on 2.5 L NC. Received one day of steroids.
Improved daily with nebs, diuresis. Weaned off O2 and remained
stable on room air.
.
# CHF, systolic dysfunction, acute exacerbation: She received a
lot of fluids as above due to shock.  Echo done in the MICU was
limited but with EF 40-45% (previous in [**2144-6-24**] was 45-50%).
BNP was elevated even in the ED, prior to fluid resuscitation.
Once hemodynamically stable, she was diuresed with improvement
in volume status and respiratory status.  Beta blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and
diuretics were continued when BP allowed.
.
# Finger pain and swelling: noted to be slightly red and swollen
in setting of other fingers/hand being swollen with overall
volume overload.  However, this persisted despite diuresis and
became painful.  On [**12-17**] vancomycin was started given concern
