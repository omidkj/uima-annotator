Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
64F with longstanding history of poorly controlled HTN and s/p
hemorrhagic stroke presumably from HTN emergency at [**Hospital1 2177**], CAD s/p
MI, CHF witH EF 35%, DM A1c 7.3%, who was seen at PCP's office
with chest pain and intermittent 'gasping' over the last few
days. Notes has had chest and back pain (cardiac equivalent in
her) on and off for several days, as well as "gasping"
particularly bothersome at night. Stable 2 pillow orthopnea.
Shortness of breath and headache progressed over the past day,
prompting her to keep a scheduled appt with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her
visit earlier today, SBP found to be 220-235 and she was sent to
the ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 96 97 189/62 18 100% RA. CXR showed mild
volume overload. She was given po hydral and metoprolol with no
effect and started on a nitro gtt. She also received lasix 40mg
iv once without much UOP. Her pressure came down to the 150's on
the nitro gtt and it was decreased as goal bp 160-170. Her labs
were remarkable for trop<0.01 and negative CK with creatinine at
baseline. EKG showed sinus rhythm with TWI in the precordial
leads. She denied any chest pain while in the ED and refused
ASA. CT head wet read showed no evidence of any acute
intracranial pathology but showed a large region of
encephalomalcia in the right hemisphere suggestive of old right
MCA infarction.
.
CXR final read showed engorged pulmonary hilar vasculature, with
diffuse pulmonary vascular congestestion, no effusion.
.
On evaulation on the floor patient reports CP and SOB have
resolved, HA present, but improved. She notes she has not been
taking her diovan as prescribed, but maintains compliance with
her other medications, including her beta blocker, hydralazine,
coumadin, and CCB.
.
On review of systems, she notes some back pain and left-sided
pruritis. Reports recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**] for "dizziness,
feeling like she was going to black out." Denies any prior
history pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, diarrhea black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for positive features as
above. Denies any current chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations,
or syncope.

LABS/STUDIES
[**6-7**] EKG: Sinus at 66 bpm. TW normalization in leads I, II, AVF,
V4-6 compared to prior in [**5-1**].
.
[**6-7**] CT HEAD: Encephalomalacia in the region of the right middle
cerebral artery territory compatible with the sequela of old
infarct. No evidence of any acute intracranial pathology.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**4-/2117**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, and
posterior wall. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
ETT: [**4-/2117**]
This was a 63 year old DM woman with a known history of CAD/CHF
(MI's, stents '[**13**]/'[**16**]) who was referred to the lab from the ED
after negative serial cardiac enzymes for an evaluation of
increasing
shortness of breath and chest discomfort with exertion. She
exercised for only 3.5 minutes of a Modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol
(~1.7 METs) and had to stop due to fatigue and shortness of
breath. This represents a limited functional capacity. She
denied any chest, arm, neck or back
discomfort throughout the study. In the setting of diffuse T
wave
inversion on baseline ECG, there was T wave normalization noted
during exercise, which returned to baseline morphology by 7
minutes of recovery. The rhythm was sinus with rare APB's and
one PVC during
exercise. There was hypertension noted at rest with an
appropriate blood pressure response to the level of exercise
performed. Hear rate response was blunted due to the patients
limited functional capacity.
.
IMPRESSION: Non-specific T wave changes noted in the presence of

uninterpretable baseline ECG abnormalities. No anginal type
symptoms
reported. Limited functional capacity demonstrated. Resting
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with poorly controlled HTN, ischemic sCHF, DM, CAD s/p
MI admitted to MICU with hypertensive emergency with SBP >220,
chest pain, and mild pulmonary edema.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: SBP >220 with report of chest pain and
CXR with acute pulmonary edema. On review of CXR, appears
similar to prior, without significant worsening. Per patient,
has not been taking meds as prescribed ("diovan leaves a bad
taste in my mouth"). SBP down to 150s on nitro gtt. Once
transitioned to PO meds her blood pressures stabilized in the
150s-160s systolic. In an effort to simplify her regimen and
provide control with agents she would take, we adjusted her
outpatient medication regimen to - Carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Losartan 100 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], Isosorbide Mononitrate
ER 90 mg daily, and Spironolactone
