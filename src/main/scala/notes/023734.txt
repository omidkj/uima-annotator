Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
75M with recently diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer,
presented to the ED this morning after experiencing sudden right
sided weakness. He was diagnosed with metastatic esophageal
cancer while vacationing in [**Country **] earlier this month. Records
were provided to his Atrius oncologist with plan for further
staging and plan for chemotherapy. He was scheduled for an
endoscopic ultrasound today. While brushing his teeth this
morning, he felt suddenly weak in his right arm and unable to
hold the toothbrush. He initially went back to sleep, then woke
up and called an ambulance. Per EMS his strength had recovered,
but again in the ED he experienced weakness.
.
In the ED a Code Stroke was called. Initial vs were: 84% on RA,
94% 4L, 98, 18, 98.9, 106/55. Neurology noted mild R hand
weakness. CT noted a perfusion defect. Guaiac positive stools so
neurology recommended starting heparin, no tPA. Also found to
have a PE on neck CTA. He remained hemodynamically stable.
.
On the floor, he complains only of abdominal pain, which has
been increasing for the previous few weeks. He has taken
morphine with good resolution of his pain. He is also cognizant
of his right handed weakness. He endorses early satiety and poor
appetite, along with a 15lb weight loss over the last couple
weeks. He has noticed some shortness of breath and chest
tightness that began during his flight to [**Country **] and has been
intermittent. The flight attendant had reported his breathing
looked shallow. He also endorses an occasional cough.


Past Medical History:
1) Esophageal cancer (The patient was diagnosed esophageal
adenocarcinoma in [**Country 1073**]. [**Location (un) 2274**] provider ordered CTA of abdomen
and pelvis which showed a mass with and planned to biopsy
[**10-28**])
2) Oral cancer treated with XRT at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2083**]
3) Macular degeneration / b/l cataracts
4) Migraine aura without HA
5) Hypothyroidism

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:
[**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth
[**2115-10-31**] MRSA screen - negative
[**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth
[**2115-10-31**] Urine culture - Enterococcus, sensitive to Vancomycin
.
IMAGING:
[**2115-10-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process.
Please refer to findings on subsequent CTA head.
.
[**2115-10-28**] CT BRAIN PERFUSION - Acute ischemia in a small
territory of the superior division of the left MCA with
increased mean transit time but no significant abnormality of
blood volume; this represents a significant "ischemic penumbra."
Acute pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobar pulmonary
artery branches, incompletely imaged. Right hilar
lymphadenopathy.
.
[**2115-10-28**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS - Small acute infarct in the
left precentral gyrus. Possible punctate acute infarct in the
right occipital lobe. Acute infarcts in bilateral cerebral
hemispheres would suggest central embolic etiology. No evidence
of intracranial metastatic disease.
.
[**2115-10-30**] 2D-ECHO - Normal regional and global biventricular
systolic function. Early appearance of agitated saline bubbles
in the left atrium/ventricle with the patient performing the
Valsalva maneuver. This finding is most consistent with a patent
foramen ovale. LVEF > 55%
.
[**2115-10-30**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWA - Marked pooling within the
valleculae with delayed hypopharyngeal transit. Aspiration of
pooled contents with nectar thick and thin liquids.
.
[**2115-10-30**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process,
with known embolic infarcts not identified.
.
[**2115-11-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - As compared to the previous
radiograph, there is no relevant change. Normal lung volumes.
Left-sided PICC line. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema. Unchanged
left pleural effusion with left basal and retrocardiac
atelectasis.
.
[**2115-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of
[**11-3**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with pulmonary edema. Opacification at the left base is
consistent with effusion and atelectasis. Left PICC line remains
in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with a PMH significant for recently diagnosed metastataic
esophageal carcinoma, HTN, hypothyroidism who presented with
acute respiratory failure found to have left ischemic stroke
with incidental pulmonary embolus undergoing heparinization
complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring MICU
transfer due to presumed aspiration PNA
.
PLAN:
# METASTATIC ESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA - Originally diagnosed in
[**Country **] at the American Hospital with evidence of metastatic
disease based on reports provided, although no tissue was
provided. The patient's staging work-up was completed in [**Country **]
- with CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, EGD showing a
distal obstructing mass extending to the gastric cardia region,
and a colonoscopy which was reassuring. A RUQ U/S performed at
American Hospital in [**Country **] was also performed. This admission,
the patient initially had a GI evaluation for possible repeat
endoscopy with biopsy, but this idea was aborted given the
decision to transition to hospice without further oncologic
intervention. His outpatient Oncologist met with the Medicine
team and Palliative care physicians on [**2115-11-7**] and at that time
he opted to pursue hospice care. It was noted that even if he
obtained a feeding tube and underwent rehabilitation, his
clinical status would likely not be optimal to pursue systemic
chemotherapy or radiation. In the transition to hospice, the
patient's pain was controlled with liquid/PO Dilaudid, and
Lorazepam liquid PO for anxiety regarding his condition.
.
# (?) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA - There was a concern for an
aspiration event this admission given his hypoxemic respiratory
failure (from secretions, was NPO at the time). A video swallow
evaluation showed marked pooling within the valleculae with
delayed hypopharyngeal transit. Aspiration of pooled contents
with nectar thick and thin liquids was noted. A CXR sho
