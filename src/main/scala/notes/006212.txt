Date of Birth:   [**2082-10-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
Spanish speaking male with a long and complicated medical
history, significant for diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, coronary artery
disease, and history of multiple lung infections, now
presenting with a left line site pain.  Review of systems is
positive for nausea and vomiting, pain is also significant
along the spine in the back and along the legs, positive
history for malaise, increased shortness of breath, and a
non-productive cough.  The patient denies any abdominal pain,
dysuria, or diarrhea.

His previous medical history is very involved.  The patient
was last admitted in [**11-15**] for a superior vena cava syndrome,
occluded superior vena cava secondary to stenosis, and
possible deep vein thrombosis.  The left internal jugular was
removed at that time.  The patient was treated with Coumadin
and received hemodialysis through a femoral line at that
time.  In [**Month (only) **], the arteriovenous fistula was unrepairable
and was removed in [**2146-6-14**].  A magnetic resonance
arteriography showed an occluded right system.  The patient
was receiving dialysis through a left subclavian line which
now appears to be infected.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease, the patient receives
hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at [**Hospital1 3494**]

resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus, and Klebsiella recently in [**8-16**],

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.2; heart
rate 75; blood pressure 150/68; respiratory rate 18; oxygen
saturation rate 95% on room air.  General:  patient is lying
in bed, breathing comfortably.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, anicteric sclera.  Neck:  supple, no
lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  decreased breath sounds to the
bases with rails on deep inspiration.  Cardiovascular:  large
systolic murmur, no rubs, gallops, murmurs, consistent with
previously documented murmur.  Abdomen:  soft, non-tender,
non-distended, bowel sounds are present.  Extremities:  trace
edema, warm, weak pulses in lower extremities bilaterally,
dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurological:  alert and oriented
times three, no focal deficits to gross confrontation.

LABS:  White count normal 15.1; blood cultures pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a very long and complicated
hospital course.

1.  Infectious Disease.  The patient had a line infection and
was initially placed on vancomycin and gentamycin.  The
gentamycin was continued for five days.  His doses were
checked with the levels in hemodialysis and dosed
accordingly.  The patient's blood cultures grew out a skin
sensitizing antibody.  The patient was changed to oxacillin
which was started on [**7-13**].  Due to the back pain and the
patient's history of osteo to the spine with prior line
infections, there was concern over a receding of these bones.
It was decided that the patient would need a long course of
intravenous antibiotic therapy secondary to possible osteo as
well as ceding of multiple known blood clots.  Due to his
heart murmur, there was also a question of endocarditis which
was evaluated.  On the 20th, the patient's blood
sedimentation rate was 449, his white count 16.8.  The
patient's back pain was evaluated with a magnetic resonance
scan of the cervical spine initially which showed an early
inflammatory process, though this was greatly resolved from
the last study.  This was thought to be resolving from his
prior episode of osteomyelitis and not representing a new
condition.  The patient also had a magnetic resonance scan of
the lumbar spine much later in his hospital course that
showed no osteo, no discitis which was relevant for possible
abscesses or hematomas in the psoas muscle which will be
discussed in a later section.  The patient had a
transthoracic echocardiography initially to evaluate valvular
changes.  The transthoracic echocardiography showed the left
atrium mildly dilated, a left to right shunt across the
internal atrial septum, consistent with a secundum-type
atrial septal defect, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, and ejection fraction greater than 55.  There
was, compared to the prior study, new aortic regurgitation
and the severity of mitral regurgitation was slightly
increased as this was suspicious for endocarditis.  A
transesophageal echocardiography was ordered.  The patient
initially refused the first attempt on [**7-18**].  The patient did
undergo a transesophageal echocardiography on [**2146-7-21**].  No
spontaneous echocontrast or thrombus was seen.  No
vegetations were noted.  The left ventricular ejection
fraction was consistent with greater than 55%.  There were
abnormally thickened aortic valve leaflets with a non-mobile
focal echogenic structure, probable calcifications of the
non-coronary cusp, trace aortic insufficiency, and no aortic
abscess.

2.  Abnormally thickened mitral valve encarditis with trace
mitral regurgitation.  Moderate mitral annular calcification,
no vegetations.  Abnormally thickened tricuspid valve, no
vegetations were seen.  The possibility of endocarditis could
not be excluded.  The patient was treated with intravenous
oxacillin beginning on [**7-13**] which was changed to intravenous
Cephazolin on [**7-27**] as this is dosed during dialysis and did
not require peripheral intravenous access and could be dosed
as an outpatient during dialysis sessions.  The patient
continued to spike from [**7-10**] to [**7-19**].  The patient then
remained afebrile and stable throughout the rest of his
hospital admission.

3.  Access.  The patient had his initial infected line
changed over a wire on [**7-12**] as his INR was 2.1 and
Interventional Radiology felt uncomfortable removing the line
with this level of coagulation.  Anticoagulation was held.
The patient was given Vitamin K as well as fresh frozen
plasma.  The line was removed [**7-13**] and his hematocrit
stabilized.  A PIC was added on [**7-20**] for intravenous
antibiotics as the patient had pulled out most of his
remaining peripheral access.  On day 14 of intravenous
antibiotics, a permanent central dialysis catheter was placed
and his stem dialysis line which had been placed on [**7-12**] was
removed on [**7-28**].  A vascular mapping study was done on the
13th and Transplant will follow-up with these results to
evaluate for further fistula work-up.  The patient
accidentally broke off one line of his PIC on [**8-1**] and then
this line was self discontinued on [**8-3**].  The patient went
home with stable and working dialysis access.

4.  Hematology.  The patient initially presented on Coumadin
for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  This was changed to
heparin to allow adjus
