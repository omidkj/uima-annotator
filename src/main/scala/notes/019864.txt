Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
The patient is an 80 year old man with a history of
poliomyelitis as a child, new onset atrial fibrillation, and
recent GI bleed now presenting with respiratory failure. The
patient problems began in late [**Month (only) 956**] when he presented to his
Cardiologist with increased shortness of breath and was found to
be in rapid afib and congestive heart failure. He went for a
cardiac catheterization at the time which showed severe LAD
disease. The cath procedure was complicated by a presumed
reaction to the contrast dye. He was noted to have a bilateral
pneumonia and was started on doxycycline. The patient was
discharged home later afebrile and on warfarin and lasix. He
epresented about a week later to the hospital, febrile and with
hematemesis and BRBPR--his bp was 80/38 with a HR of 125; INR
was 6.2. He was found to have bleeding jejunal diverticulas and
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear--both of which were surgically corrected.
He underwent a head ct for "sundowning" which was normal by
report.  He remained intubated, febrile, was started on vanco,
cefepime and flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 year old male with recent admit to [**Hospital 108**] hospital
[**2120-3-18**] due to acute dyspnea. He has a new onset A- fib, CHF,
S/P jejunal resection on [**2120-4-5**], for bleeding diverticulae.
Transferred from [**Hospital 108**] hospital for failure to wean from vent.
Since being at [**Hospital1 18**], he has remained intermittantly febrile
(fever curve has improved). He is noted by the nursing staff to
intermittanly follow simple commands, moving all extremities,
and has become agitated at times requiring ativan, fentanyl,
haldol and more recently seroquel. He gets ativan 1 mg tid
standing, fentanyl patch in addition to prn's of those. His
respiratory status has remained tenuous and has been diagnosed
with atypical pneumonia vs. early ARDs. He was transferred to
the surgical service of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2120-4-12**] for failure to wean
from vent. He was febrile and hypotensive after transfer, and
pressors were started. The pressors were weanted and he was felt
to be in ARDS. He was trached on [**4-17**] and has had generally not
been able to be weaned since that time. He has completed courses
of empiric antibiotics. He has been slowly getting better since
that time, and is being transferred to the MICU service [**2120-5-9**]
for failure to wean from the ventilator.

Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved over the past
five days. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. There is no focal
pulmonary abnormality to suggest pneumonia. Feeding tube ends in
the proximal jejunum. Tracheostomy tube is canted in the trachea
and should be evaluated clinically to determine the position is
acceptable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

more prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 80 year old man with a h/o recent onset atrial
fibrillation, GI bleed, and ARDS now presents with continued
respiratory failure. His neurologic exam demonstrates
obtundation--perhaps related to multiple sedating meds. His head
ct shows 2 hypodensities in the right cerebellum that may be
new. The neurologic differential for respiratory insufficency
would include: muscle- critical illness myopathy; NMJ:
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], nerve: AIDP (had reflexes), critical illness
polyneuropathy; cord: high cervical cord injury (does not seem
paraparetic); anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] cell- AlS, west [**Doctor First Name **], enteroviruses
(does have h/o questionable h/o polio). Impression is for a
non-neurologic cause of his respiratory failure (pna, ards). Pt
secondary to His respiratory failure underwent tracheostomy on
[**4-17**]/5.

#) Respiratory failure - Patient was trached [**4-17**]. Now
oxygenating and ventilating adequately. Increased secretions but
afebrile, [**3-15**] CXR with improved edema and no PNA. Large amount
of measured dead space contributing to difficulty weaning.
