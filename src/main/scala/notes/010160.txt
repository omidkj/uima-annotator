Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive, diarrhea, hypernatremia
*transferred to MICU for hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 2, mini trach, PEG

History of Present Illness:
86 y/o male with recent CVA admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**11-16**] due
to FTT, hypernatremia, ongoing c. diff, and decreased po intake.
At [**Hospital **] rehab patient was noted to have a sodium of 153,
chloride of 120, BUN/Cr of 51/2.1, WBC 18.6.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On admission, he was
rehydrated and given IV levoflox and metronidazole.
.
On the AM of [**11-17**], the pt was noted to be hypotensive to the
70s, with pulse in 150s.  He was bolused 2L NS and 2L LR, with
response to the low 100s.  Because of the afib, he was given
lopressor 1 mg iv, then 1.5 mg iv, then 2.5 mg iv.  His pulse
improved slightly to the 130s.  Later in the day his blood
pressure again dropped to the 70s, and at this point he was
transferred to the MICU for further management.  Currently, the
pt states he does not feel good but is unable to elaborate
further.  He denies pain.

Pertinent Results:

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the medical service for failure to
thrive, dehydration and multiple electrolyte abnormalities.  On
HD 2 he required transfer to the intensive care unit for
hypotension [**2-9**] atrial fibrillation with RVR.  In the MICU he
required intubation for respiratory distress secondary to septic
shock.  He had ongoing respiratory distress, which was
attributed to an aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, and fluid
overload.  He was briefly extubated but required reintubation
within a couple days for a second episode of sepsis.  His MICU
course was complicated by acute renal failure, continued
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite cardioversion, ventilator
associated pneumonia, sepsis, and extensive fluid overload
likely secondary to EF 15-20% and repeated need for fluid
boluses for hypotension.  Despite multiple attempts at diuresis
and treatment of his pneumonia, he remained ventilator dependent
in the MICU for ~ 30 days.  Given poor prognosis and in
accordance with what the family felt his wishes were, his family
made the decision to switch to comfort measures only.  He was
extubated, started on a morphine drip on [**2129-12-15**] and died
peacefully on [**2129-12-16**].  Family declined an autopsy.  Attending
and PCP were notified.
