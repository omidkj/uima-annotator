s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89307**] is an 87y/o gentleman with HTN and CAD s/p stents,
MI x3 (last one medically managed), who presented to an OSH s/p
fall and was transferred here for further management.  He had
subbed his toe and fell face-first to the ground.  He denied
LOC, changes in vision, nausea or vomiting.  He was found to
have right frontal SAH, C1 and type 2 dens fracture, frontal
bone and superior orbital fracture.

147/68, RR 18, SaO2 97% 2L.  He was alert and interactive,
complaining of neck pain.  He was admitted to a surgical floor
but was quickly found to be in respiratory distress with O2 sat
80% RA, 93% face tent and 5L NC.  He was given Lasix 20mg IV and
was transferred to the Trauma Surgery ICU for management of his
heart failure.

CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2137-5-13**]
1. Anterior wedge deformity of T1 of unknown acuity with
widening of the
anterior disc space of C6/7. This can be further assessed at the
time of
C-spine MRI.
2. No acute fractures in the remainder of the thoraco-lumbar
spine.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. Diffuse ground glass pulmonary opacities in setting of
effusions and
cardiomegaly may be due to pulmonary edema.
6. Secretions within the left mainstem bronchus.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2137-5-13**]
1. Fractures of C1 and the dens of C2 as described above with
marked
narrowing of the spinal canal at that level and adjacent
hematoma. MRI is
recommended for further evaluation of the spinal cord.
2. Anterior compression deformity of T1 with possible oblique
fracture of
unknown acuity. No retropulsion. This can be further assessed at
the time of MRI.
3. Widening of the anterior intervertebral disc space at C6-7.
Assessment for ligamentous injury at this level can be assessed
on MRI.

EKG [**2137-5-14**]
Sinus rhythm. Probable intra-atrial conduction delay. ST-T wave
changes with prolonged QTc interval are non-specific but
clinical correlation is suggested.  No previous tracing
available for comparison

MRI C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2137-5-14**]
1. Type 2 odontoid dens fracture with distraction and angulation
causing mild canal narrowing without evidence of a cord
contusion or intraspinal hematoma.
2. C1 fracture is better demonstrated on the recent CT study.
3. Widening of the anterior intervertebral disc space at C6-7
suggests
distraction without convincing evidence of an anterior
longitudinal ligament injury.
4. Increased T2 and STIR signal at the superior aspect of C7
vertebral body
suggests fracture versus bone contusion.
5. Anterior wedge compression deformity of T1 vertebral body.
6. Widening and distraction of the left C6-7 facet joint with
fluid.
Images are degraded by motion artifact, failed to correct on
multiple
sequences.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2137-5-14**]
1. Enlarging right frontal hemorrhagic contusion, with increased
local mass
effect, but no shift of normally midline structures.
2. Mild right convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage, slightly
increased.
3. Moderate hematoma in the right frontal scalp.
4. 1.4 cm nodular lesion in the right suboccipital scalp. Please
correlated
with physical exam.

CXR [**2137-5-14**]
Severe pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2137-5-15**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis. Only the lateral wall
has relatively preserved function. Dilated and depressed RV with
moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation.

CXR [**2137-5-15**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
improvement of the still extensive pulmonary edema. The lung
volumes have
slightly increased. Newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities
suggesting
pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Unchanged size and shape of the
cardiac
silhouette. Unchanged appearance of the mediastinal structures.
Old left rib fractures. Unchanged interposition of colon between
liver and
the abdominal wall.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2137-5-15**]
1. Unchanged appearance of a post-traumatic large right frontal
parenchymal
hematoma, with minimal leftward subfalcine herniation.
Blood/fluid levels
within this lesion are som
