ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.
Epiaortic scan showed no significant atheromatous disease of the

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2149-9-30**] where the patient underwent coronary
bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary, reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to first diagonal coronary artery, reverse
saphenous vein single graft from aorta to second obtuse marginal
coronary artery, as well as reverse saphenous vein graft from
the aorta to the posterior descending coronary artery. See
operative note for full details. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight. he was on Plavix
preoperatively for stents to LAD, RCA and Cx and this was
resumed. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By
the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with visiting nurse
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
