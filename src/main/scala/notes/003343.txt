History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o CAD, dCHF, symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM,
severe pulmonary hypertension admitted from [**Hospital **] rehab with
cough, SOB and hypotension today. Per records and signout from
[**Hospital **] rehab patient initially had ST and cough on [**7-5**]. Was
afebrile and treated with robutussin [**7-6**]. Then overnight on [**7-7**]
noted to be hypotensive (89/59 ->80/50) with )2sat 70% on
RA->88% on 2LNC. Patient was placed on NRB and BP dropped
precipitously to 69/30 so she was given 500mL bolus at [**Hospital **]
rehab but was not responsive (BP 70/37, HR 77 RR 24, [**Last Name (un) **] 100%
NRB) and was subjectively more SOB so sent to ED.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.6 85 120/34 28 100 on NRB. Then
had fever to 100.8. CXR showed RLL PNA and patient was given
vanc and levoquin as well as 1L NS however BP continued to
"dwindle" and patient was more and more dyspneic so she was
given succinylcoline, etomidate, versed, and fentanyl and then
intubated and a CVL was placed in left IJ. EKg was reportedly
with inferior STD thought [**12-30**] demand from increased work of
breathing. Started on levophed drip for persistent hypotension
and thoguht sepsis vs chf.

****

[**2122-7-8**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2122-2-24**], the estimated pulmonary artery
pressures are lower. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is
reduced (although image quality on current study is very
limited). A very small pericardial effusion is seen.
.
[**2122-7-8**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Left
atrial abnormality. Modest ST-T wave changes with prolonged QTc
interval are non-specific but cannot exclude possible
drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of same date there is no
signficant change.
.
[**2122-7-8**] CXR:  1. Worsening right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis with or without coexisting infection. 2. Improved
left pleural effusion.

.
[**2122-7-9**] CXR: No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
pneumonia.
.
[**2122-7-13**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions, right great than left.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o d CHF, HTN, dementia here with
cough/fever/hypoxia requiring intubation and hypotension
requiring levophed likely [**12-30**] sepsis from PNA although may also
have component CHF.  Admitted to the MICU on [**7-8**], transferred
to the floor on [**7-11**] and discharged on [**7-13**]
.
# Shock: When pt was admitted, hypotension was thought [**12-30**]
sepsis vs. CHF.  An ECHO was done which showed improved heart
function when compared to an echo from [**Month (only) 958**].  IVF boluses were
used for her hypotension as sepsis was thought to be the likely
cause of her hypotension.  The pt was originally on levophed,
however this was d/c'd soon after her admission (within 12 hrs).
 An MI was also r/o with cardiac enzymes and serial EKGs.  The
pt was originally started on vanc/zosyn, however we narrowed to
levoquin once further sputum culture speciation showed
pneumococcus.  She continued her course of IV levofloxacin on
the floor and was sent with a prescription to continue it PO as
an outpatient for at total of 10 day course.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial and
includes baseline compromised respiratory function from severe
pulmonary hypertension with likely superimposed PNA.  Pt was
weaned to pressure support and extubated after 2 days on the
ICU.  The main thought was PNA, so she was treated with abx as
above.  Pt also had pleural effusion, with the thought to do
thoracentesis, however she stablized so this was deferred.
Also, pt was continued on home dose (3x a week) of lasix and
metolazone. This regimen was continued on the floor and will be
continued as an outpatient.  On the floor, she was satting well
in the mid-high 90s on 2L NC.
.
#Nutrition: Patient failed her bedside s/sw for concern of an
aspiration risk.  However, her PO meds were continued mixed in
applesauce,  and she was able to take her pills.  She was sent
for video s/s eval on [**7-14**] and they recommended nectar thickened
liquids and soft solid diet.

# Hypertension: Pt hypertensive to 180s-190s thought [**12-30**]
anxiety.  Returned to normotensive range with ativan in the
MICU.  Started on prn zydis for anxiety.  Once transferred to
the floor
