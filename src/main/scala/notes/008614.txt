Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain radiating to back

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with two bare metal stents to the left
circumflex artery

History of Present Illness:
The patient reports that the morning of her admission, as soon
as she awoke, she had a sensation of indigestion beneath her
breastbone bit high along the sternum. She found this sensation
disturbing because she does not generally get indigestion.
Because the patient has most of her family in her house for an
early celebration of [**Holiday 1451**], she originally thought that
she was merely tired from all of the work. By 7:15 am she had
taken an aspirin and experienced no relief. The patient felt
weak and perhaps a little dizzy. She then took a second aspirin,
but started to experience pain that radiated to her left
shoulder blade. Following a discussion with her family, she
decided to call an ambulance.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for just a single episode
of chest pain six months ago. Patient denies dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
and syncope. The patient does have edema of bilaterla lower
extremities, but has history of vascular surgery for her veins.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 73, BP 198/76, RR 17, O2 sat
100%. The patient then went to the cath lab where she received
two overlapping bare metal stents the lower branch of left
circumflex. Jailing and occlusion of upper branch occurred.

Cardiac catheterization [**2126-11-2**]:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
3. Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
4. Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
3. Successful PCI of Lcx with BMSx2.
.
Echo [**2126-11-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: The patient had an inferior STEMI with occlusion
of left circumflex. The patient received two bare metal stents
in the left circumflex.
She was then medically managed initially with ASA 325 mg daily,
Clopidogrel 75 mg daily, Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], Atorvastatin 80
mg daily. Her lipid panel showed a total cholesterol of 157,
triglycerides of 65, HDL of 56, and LDL of 88. Her
echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function (LVEF > 55%). Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased
PCWP. Lisinopril was also added to help control her
hypertension. She was returned to her home dose of atenolol.
.
# PUMP: Patient's PCWP was 28. JVD was [**8-23**]. Patient denied
symptoms of right-sided heart failure. On the morning of
[**2126-11-4**], the patient awoke to a coughing fit and some dyspnea.
Due to the hydration given and concerns for heart failure, she
was administered Lasix 10mg IV. Her dyspnea improved, but given
the lack of other symptoms of heart failure, her cough may have
been the result of a chronic post-nasal drip, as the patient
reports cough for many months.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Given the STEMI, the patient's anti-hypertensive
regimen was changed. She was kept on atenolol, since she was
already on and toerated that beta-blocker. The patient's HCTZ
was stopped, adn lisinopril started at a low dose.
.
# COUGH, LIKELY SECONDARY TO POST-NASAL DRIP: During the
patient's hospitalization, she demonstrated a regular cough. The
patient ascribed the cough to post-nasal drip. She was
prescribed Flonase.
