Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
hyoxia and NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
failed central line placement

History of Present Illness:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 4107**]. 80 F with hx alzheimers, NSTEMI
Dx 6 weeks ago and treated with medical mgmt, had been in rehab,
returned to hospital with right arm and right axillary pain. She
was found to be volume overloaded with low 02 sats, had 2 CXR 3
hours apart showing interval development pulmonary edema, placed
on BiPAP and treated with diuresis and subsequently came off
bipap.She went to the ICU, became hypotensive, started on low
dose dopamine and neeosynephrine for BP support with dopa dc'd
by time of transfer. On arrival, had EKG showing dynamic EKG
changes (inferolateral TWI) with trop tI initially 0.01 on
[**2177-2-12**] then 1.06 without accompanying CKs. She was transfered
to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath.

On arrival to the ICU EKG showed dynamic TWI inversions, stable
ST depressions, prominent R waves in precordial leads, ? RH
strain. She was CP free. Cardiac review of systems was notable
for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. A central line placement was attempted but
failed. Her prognosis was discussed with pt/proxy and a plan was
made for medical management and she became DNR/DNI.

Imaging:

Echo ([**2177-2-13**]) - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Inferior and inferolateral akinesis consistent with
prior infarction. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve is
tethered with consequent assymetric coaptation of the mitral
leaflets and at least moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation,
directed posteriorly. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

CXR ([**2177-2-13**]) - IMPRESSION: Increased perivascular haze in lung
upper zones and left side, possibly beginning pulmonary edema.
The lung areas appear emphysematous.  Followup in short interval
is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o woman with hx alzheimers transfered with dynamic EKG
changes/mild troponin leak equivocal for NSTEMI with decision
for medical management.

#Coronaries: Acute CHF at OSH in setting of CP/troponin leak.
Echo showed tethered MV, overall more consistent with chronic
MR. Troponin peak likely secondary to CHF, versus poor clearance
in the setting of renal failure. Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Medical management was continued with aspirin, atorvastatin.
Home BB/Ace was held given hypotension.

#Respiratory distress: s/p flash pulmonary edema. Tethered
mitral valve, may be chronic MR. Dopamine initially given for
increased CO with concommittent cardiac output augmentation
however she became tachycardic and her blood pressyures were
much improved, and so the dopamine was discontinued and her home
ACE restarted.

# Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.3. Increased to 1.9. Unclear if
ATN vs [**1-7**] poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. Urine lytes
showed Feurea 35, indicating a pre-renal state. Creatinine was
improving at the time of discharge.

#Leukocytosis: She was afebrile and there was no evidence of
infection. Could simply have been a stress response. Her WBC was
improving at the time of discharge, and she was afebrile.

#Diabetes: We held metformin in setting renal failure. This
continued to be held at the time of discharge. The patient's
fingersticks should be measured in the morning at her living
facility to determine the need to insulin. Additionally, her
creatinine should be followed. Her metformin can be restarted if
her creatinine continues to improve.

#Dementia: We continued aricept.
