Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Groin pain, nausea & vomitting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2104-7-13**] Suprapubic catheter changed by Urology.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 yo M w/ suprapubic catheter ([**2092**]), hx prostate CA
s/p cryotherapy, and recurrent UTI (last [**2-9**], 3x/year), and
Afib on digoxin, DMII on insulin who p/w groin pain X 2 days.
Pain was bilateral localized to groin, w/o dysuria, hematuria,
fevers, or chills, improved with fluids, advil and aspirin. He
had one episode of nonbloody emesis, but no diarrhea. He denies
melena or hematochezia, but is reported by ED to have
salmony-colored stool. Last episode of groin pain in [**2-9**] was
attributed to UTI and cleared with abx (pt does not recall what
was given). Suprapubic catheter is changed q6wks, and last
changed 3 wks ago (followed by urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 583**]).

.
In the [**Name (NI) **],  pt's vitals on arrival were stable: HR 56 BP 113/51
RR 16 98% on RA. UA was positive for nitrites and wbc and spgr
1.1015, and he was given 1g Iv Ceftriaxone and 500cc bolus NS
was given, and IVF were started. Urology was consulted and
changed the suprapubic catheter. While in ED, he became
bradycardic to the 30s, coming up spontaneously to the 50s on
arousal (no atropine was administered).  At that time,
chemistries revealed a K of 5.6 and Dig 5.7, and 1st degree AV
block on ECG (no priors for comparison). 30 mg po Kayexalate was
given, and 4 vials of digibind were given per toxicology.
Cardiology was consulted re: digoxin toxicity, and recommended
ECHO. He was given 1g IV morphine and zofran and transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring.
ROS: weight change 8lbs/last several months (unintentional
weight loss 210--140lbs), 1x emesis nonbloody, longstanding
constipation; + long extremity weakness with cramping at ankles,
and increasing gait unsteadiness and burning in legs with

but no change in color of vision.

IMAGING:
=======
[**2104-7-14**] CARDIAC ECHO (TTE) - The left atrial volume is
markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction.
Mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (clip
#[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
[**2104-7-14**] RENAL ULTRASOUND - FINDINGS: The study is limted due to
bowel gas. The right kidney is hypotrophic measuring
approximately 7.4 cm in diameter and demonstrates mild
hydronephrosis. The left kidney measures 10.4 cm. The renal
parenchymal thickness and echogenicity are normal within the
left kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis. Small left
parapelvic cyst are seen. IMPRESSION: Hypotrophic right kidney
with mild hydronephrosis.

.
[**2104-7-13**] ACUTE ABD SERIES ([**1-6**] VIEWS OF ABD & SGL CHEST VIEW) -
ABDOMINAL SERIES: Heart size is normal. The lungs are clear
without evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air. The bowel gas
pattern is nonobstructive with
nondilated loops of large and small bowel noted. A right total
hip prosthesis is intact
