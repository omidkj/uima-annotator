Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a 56 y/o F with history of DMI with frequent
admissions for DKA, [**Doctor Last Name 933**], who presents with DKA and
gastroparesis flare.
.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with numerous admissions for DKA.
Infectious workup was negative.  It appears that patient
developed DKA in the setting of a flare of her gastroparesis.
She was started on Insulin gtt in the ER 7unit bolus then
7units/hour. She was initially admitted to the ICU. Her gap
closed quickly on the insulin drip and she was started on her
home dose of lantus 32 units twice daily. She was hypovolemic
and was given fluid boluses with potasium.  After her anion gap
closed she was called out to the floor for ongoing care.  Her
electrolytes continued to improve, and her bicarb gradually
returned to [**Location 213**].  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and assisted with
insulin titration.  Her lantus dose was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing,
briefly at 20 units [**Hospital1 **], however she developed recurrent
hypoglycemia and her lantus was titrated down to 15 units [**Hospital1 **],
with a sliding scale.  This can be titrated back up as
necessary.
.
Acute Renal Failure:
Patient had acute renal failure on admission due to dehydration
in setting of DKA. Creatinine was 1.7 on admission (baseline is
0.8). This resolved over the course of the admission with IV
fluids/hydration.
.
Nausea/[**Hospital1 **]/Gastroparesis:
The patient stated that she had a flare of her gastroparesis
prior to developing this episode of DKA, with 10/10
