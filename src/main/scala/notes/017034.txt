RADIOLOGY:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-10-2**] 6:12 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval:PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval:PNA
INDICATION: 83-year-old female with shortness of breath.
Evaluate for pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2179-2-2**].

SINGLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

Allowing for rotation, the heart size is stable with left
ventricular configuration. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The
aorta appears tortuous. Within the lungs bilaterally, there are
multiple nodular densities predominantly within the mid and
lower lobes. These findings are corroborated by CT done on [**2-18**], [**2177**]. An additional opacity within the right middle lobe is
also similar in appearance compared to prior chest x-ray and CT
from [**2179-2-2**], and [**2178-2-18**], respectively. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.

IMPRESSION:

No acute cardiopulmonary processes. Stable appearing nodular
densities within the right middle and bilateral lower lobes
consistent with long standing inflammatory changes caused by a
granulomatous process such as sarcoid or tuberculosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o female with combined restrictive and obstructive lung
disease, and diastolic dysfunction presented with altered mental
status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Despite efforts at
improving venitation with BIPAP, she did not clinically improve.
Discussion with her Daughter/Health Care Proxy resulted in the
family's decision to make comfort the goal of the patient's
care. She expired on [**2179-10-5**] at 1:10AM with her
daughter at her bedside. An autopsy was not done.
