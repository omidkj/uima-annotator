Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Drop in HCT at rehab, Guiaic positive stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, patient is an 87 year-old gentleman with a history of
multiple myeloma, essential thrombocytosis, diabetes mellitus
(presumed Type II), who was recently started on [**First Name3 (LF) **] for his
essential thrombocytosis who presented from [**Hospital3 2558**] with
decreased Hct (27 --> 23). Stool was noted to be guiaic positive
on admission. He denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis. No symptoms of anemia including lightheadedness,
dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain were experienced.
In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable but was noted to have
maroon stools and clots per rectum. NG lavage was negative. GI
was consulted, tagged red cell scan was done as part of w/u,
which was negative. Patient was transfused total of 3 units, and
Hct has subsequently remained stable. Plan is for colonoscopy on
Monday. While in MICU, patient had large hematuria; he was
evaluated by GU, and hematuria was thought to be secondary to
both UTI and foley trauma with underlying BPH. After drainage,
urine clarity has improved, and Hct has remained stable. Patient
will need cystoscopy as outpatient.
.
Patient also noted to be hyperkalemic on [**2138-2-7**], EKG had
questionable T-wave peaking, and he was given Ca Gluconate, D50
and insulin, kayexelate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 87 year-old gentleman with Multiple Myeloma,
Essential Thrombocytosis, Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation who
presented witha 4 point Hct drop at [**Hospital3 2558**] in setting of
guiaic positive stools. The following issues were addressed
during his hospital stay:
.
1. LOWER GI BLEED
Patient with guiaic positive stools with blood noted on rectal
examination here. Tagged red cell scan was negative for source
of bleed. Patient was admitted to the MICU and received 3 units
PRBCs with appropriate increase in Hct. Antihypertensives,
aspirin, and Heparin were held; IV Protonix was administered
[**Hospital1 **]. When stabilized, patient was transferred to the floor. He
had one additional episode of bleeding per rectum and was
tranfused 4th unit PRBCs. Following adequate bowel preparation,
colonoscopy was performed, which was negative for active
bleeding or culprit lesion (see full report above) -- drop in
Hct was attributed to bleeding diverticulum that had
self-resolved. Hct remained stable in the 28-29 range
thereafter. No further bleeding episodes or change in stool
color were noted. Incidental polyps were noted on colonoscopy,
patient to have follow-up study in 6 months per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8469**].

2A. HEMATURIA
Following foley placement, patient with notable bleeding into
foley bag, including passage of clots. [**Name Initial (PRE) 159**] was consulted,
and 3-way foley was placed with irrigation. Bleeding was
attributed to underlying UTI given positive UA and to trauma
from foley in setting of underlying BPH. Patient's urine cleared
following foley irrigation, and no further blood was noted in
the urine. Patient to follow-up with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] for cystoscopy as
outpatient, appointment time/date noted in discharge planning.
.
2B. UTI
Patient with positive UA on admission, which was treated with 5
days Ciprofloxacin. Patient likely with some urinary retention
secondary to BPH. To be further managed by [**Name Initial (PRE) **] as
outpatient, work-up including cystoscopy.
.
2C. BPH
Once hemodynamically stable, outpatient Tamsulosin was
restarted.

3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Patient with Cr 1.8 on admission, improved with fluids and
PRBCs. Pre-renal etiology secondary to volume loss. Cr 0.7 on
discharge.
.
4. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/CAD
Anticoagulation was held in setting of GI Bleed. Patient was not
on Coumadin therapy given multiple GI Bleeds. Aspirin was also
held - patient had been on [**Name Initial (PRE) **] as therapy for thrombocytosis,
will hold off on medication per discussion with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
treatment re: therapy pending discussions between PCP and
[**Name9 (PRE) **].
.
5. ESSENTIAL THROMBOCYTOSIS
Aspirin held secondary to GI Bleed. Patient to follow-up with
Heme-Onc as outpatient regarding re-starting therapy vs.
substitute therapy. Hydroxyurea discontinued in past due to
pancytopenia. Patient with significantly elevated platelets to
1000 on this admission. Appointment sche
