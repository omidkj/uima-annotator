Microbiology:

Urine culture [**2173-7-27**] - no growth
Blood fungal cultures [**2173-7-28**] - no growth
Sputum culture [**2173-7-30**] - GRAM STAIN <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial
cells/100X field. Gram stain indicates extensive contamination
with upper respiratory
secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid. PNEUMOCYSTIS
CARINII NOT SEEN. POOR QUALITY SPECIMEN.
Blood cultures 8/11, [**8-1**] - no growth to date
Catheter tip cultures 8/17 - pending
.
Imaging:
EKG: Sinus tachycardia, Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities
Since previous tracing of [**2173-7-14**], rate is increased
.
CXR [**2173-7-27**]: Slight increase in pulmonary vascularity without
frank pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2173-7-29**]: INDICATION: Line placement. A right internal
jugular vascular catheter has been placed, terminating in the
lower superior vena cava at the junction with the right atrium.
No pneumothorax is evident. The heart size is normal. There is
vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness, likely due to mild
fluid overload. Attention to this region on followup films would
be helpful to exclude atypical pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2173-7-30**]: Improving congestive heart failure. Right lower
lobe pneumonia.
.
Chest CT w/out Contrast [**2173-7-30**]: Two focal areas of
consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the
right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass
halo. The imaging characteristics are most consistent with
invasive aspergillosis. Other forms of infection are also
possible. Small bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse
mediastinal adenopathy. Multiple non-obstructing renal stones
bilaterally.
Widespread osseous involvement from the patient's known plasma
cell
leukemia. Diffuse anasarca.
.
CXR [**2173-8-4**]: successful placement of right subclavian venous
access device. No pneumothorax is identified.
