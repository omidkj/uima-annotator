Allergies:
Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
referred for biventricular ICD implant as primary prevention of
sudden cardiac death.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD, [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86131**] is a 76 y/o female with significant medical history
of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, CAD s/p ramus stent in [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2166**] and newly diagnosed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The
patient initially presented to the hospital in [**2167-9-3**] for
dyspnea and was found to have Pneumonia. On chest CT, she was
noted to have cardiomegaly which was further confirmed by ECHO
demonstrating an LVEF of 20-25%. During her hospitalization she
was noted to have episodes of non-sustained VT. Cardiac
catheterization was performed during that hospitalization
demonstrating disease in the ramus branch which was treated with
a drug eluting stent. Because her cardiomyopathy was out of
proportion  compared to the single vessel coronary artery
disease, it is thought to be non-ischemic. Since [**2167-9-3**],
the patient has been maintained on a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor without any significant change in her LVEF. However,
last week her ACEi was discontinued secondary to cough and she
was started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].
.
The patient presented today for elective ICD placement for
primary prophylaxis. Her post-procedure echo showed a 1 cm
circumferential pericardial effusion that was not previously
seen on earlier echo. Her blood pressure remained stable at 110
with heart rate in the 60s. Her pulsus was 8. She was admitted
to the CCU for further monitoring and management.
.
Of note, the patient reports that she has always been somewhat
dyspneic with exertion. She reports having to stop playing
tennis in the early 90??????s because she was unable to keep up with
her friend of a similar age. The patient reports shortness of
breath with moderate exertion as well as a dull chest ache
several times per day not associated with exertion, often
occuring after food. The patient denies LE edema, PND or
orthopnea. She is enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation and is able
to walk one mile four times per week at a slow pace without
difficulty.
.
ROS as per HPI. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence
of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2168-3-7**] echocardiogram
The left ventricular cavity is dilated. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with normal free wall contractility. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion (~ 1cm diastolic width).
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Clinical correlation
recommended.

[**2168-3-7**] CXR
FINDINGS: No previous images. There is enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette
without vascular congestion or pleural effusion. This
discordancy raises the
possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. No
evidence of pleural
effusion or acute pneumonia. Dual-channel ICD device is in place
with the
leads in appropriate positions. Specifically, no evidence of
pneumothorax.

[**2168-3-8**] echocardiogram
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
mildly depressed (LVEF ?45-50% %); however image quality is
technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion.
There anterior septum appears hypokinetic and there may be
inferior/inferolateral hyokinesis but these segments were not
fully visualized. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is
borderline RV diastolic indentation which is similar to slightly
less prominent compared to yesterday.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86131**] is a 76 YOF with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD
s/p DES, systolic CHF (Ef 25-30%) who presented for elective
primary prevention ICD and was found to have pericardial
effusion.
.
# Pericardial effusion: The patient underwent placement of
prophylactic [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular ICD.  Her post-procedure
echocardiogram had evidence of mild to moderate pericardial
effusion.  She was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit
for monitoring.  Overnight she had no evidence of hemodynamic
compromise and did not have an elevated pulsus paradoxus on
serial exams.  Her chest x ray showed no evidence of acute
pneumothorax or other complication.  The following morning the
patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed improvement of
the effusion as well as ejection fraction.  She was restarted on
all of her home medications and discharged home.  She has a
follow up appointment with her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2168-3-14**].
