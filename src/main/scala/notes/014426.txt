Chief Complaint:
abnormal Venous blood gas at rehab and joint pains and abdominal
pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
60F w/ hx of COPD, PAH w/ cor pulmonale, right-sided CHF, CKD,
s/p tracheostomy on [**12-25**] in setting of COPD exac and resp
failure, who presents with left sided arm pain and question of
abnormal VBG suggestive of hypercarbia at rehab. Pt reports pain
in her left wrist, left elbow, both feet. Pain feels similar to
a gout flair. Also notes abdominal pain which is chronic since
[**2116**]. Her daughter reports that she has had increased secretions
from her trach lately.
Pt has had several recent admission over the last few months.
She had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 49798**] for shortness of
breath thought initially to be pneumonia but eventually
attributed to COPD exacerbation as opposed to infection. Due to
respiratory failure she underwent a tracheostomy on [**12-25**].
.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 66503**] for malfunctioning tracheostomy. At
that admission, trach was replaced with [**Last Name (un) 295**] tracheostomy
piece. Pt initialy on vent and then weaned off. Found to be
anemic, [**1-30**] anemia of chronic disease, she was transfused 1 U
PRBC for HCT 24. She also had advancement of dophoff per IR,
nutrition adjusted tube feeds.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  T 98.2 HR 98  102/65, 26 99%, Tm
101.5.
VBG performed in ED did not show any signs of hypercarbia. BNP
5000 and CXR with pulm edema, given 20mg IV lasix. CT abd and
pelvis was performed (pt was ventilated to allow her to lie
flat) and is pending. Pt refused LENI on extremities. UA
positive and started on levofloxacin 750mg IV, vanco 1g and
cefepime 2g. Pt found to have foul smelling yellow drainage
around trach site, covered broadly with vanco/cefepime. After CT
head, chest, abd, pelvis, she was transfered to the MICU for
close observation.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is comfortable, on the vent. Reports
pain in hands and feet, similar to prior gout flairs. Reports
some abd pain. Vitals: BP 108/55, HR 84, CMV FiO2 30%, TV 400,
PEEP 5, f18, satting 97%.

Studies
CXR [**2127-1-3**] Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion
appears similar
compared to most recent prior exam. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
detected on this view. Tracheostomy appears to be in standard
position.
Right PICC tip projects over the low right atrium. IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Right PICC terminating in the right atrium. This finding was
reported to
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7867**] by telephone at 6:02 a.m.
on [**2127-1-3**].

CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2127-1-3**]
1. Dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with decompressed
distal ileum
consistent with early or partial small bowel obstruction. The
transition point is in the right lower quadrant and is likely
due to adhesions. There is no bowel wall thickening, free fluid,
or free air.
2. Status post gastric bypass surgery with the nasogastric tube
in the
jejunum.
3. Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with patient's known
pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of pneumonia.
5. Tracheostomy in standard position.

CT head [**2127-1-3**] 1. No evidence of acute intracranial process. 2.
Mucosal thickening of paranasal sinuses with aerosolized
secretion in the
sphenoidal sinuses, might represent acute sinusitis in the
appropriate
clinical setting.

[**Month/Day/Year 5283**] U/S [**2127-1-3**] Distended gallbladder with small shadowing
stones. The
appearance of the gallbladder is indeterminate for cholecystitis
by
ultrasound. No specific signs are seen; however, the patient was
noted to be tender at the site of the gallbladder on real-time
imaging. Consider a HIDA scan if further evaluation is needed of
the gallbladder
