History of Present Illness:
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old man with a history of ESRD on HD,
DMII, HCV who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from home complaining of "not
feeling right". He reported that a few days prior to admission
he felt unwell. He had nausea and one episode of vomiting. He
mentioned some of his symptoms at [**Hospital1 2286**] but it is not clear
if anything such as blood cultures were done at that time. He
continued to feel poorly so on the morning of admission he was
sent in from HD to the ED for evaluation. He also noted that he
began feeling lower back pain which was new. +fevers/chills. Pt
also denied SOB.
.
In the ED his temp was noted to be 101.4, with SBP's in the
70's. Peripheral dopamine was started as the patient refused a
CVL. 3L NS was administered.
.

Past Medical History:
.
1. Type 2 diabetes times 16 years.
2. End stage renal disease secondary to diabetes, currently
on hemodialysis. L femoral tunnelled catheter.
3. Hepatitis C.
4. History of deep venous thrombosis and superior vena cava
thrombosis
5. Hypertension.
6. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 40
percent in [**2145-8-27**]. In [**5-30**], LVEF 55%, impaired
relaxation, [**1-29**]+ MR.
7. History of zoster.
8. Aortic calcifications.
9. Elevated homocysteine.
.

[**9-22**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from
[**2148-9-17**]. There is a catheter projecting over the mid
abdomen likely into the IVC. Clinical correlation is
recommended.  There is a very large right-sided pleural
effusion, which is partially loculated along the right lateral
chest wall, which is unchanged from the prior study.  The right
side down decubitus view demonstrates some layering of the
fluid; however, a LEFT side down decubitus view would be best
for evaluation of the pleural fluid.  The left lung field is
clear. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is
cardiomegaly. Overall, the findings are stable.
.
[**9-22**] AXR: FINDINGS:  Catheter is seen projecting over the mid
abdomen in the IVC/right atrium, likely [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] catheter.
There is a large right pleural effusion. There is no free air
under the diaphragm.  Intraluminal jejunal contrast from
previous study is noted.  Note is made vascular calcifications.
No dilated bowel loops are identified.  Stool and air is present
within the colon.
IMPRESSION: 1)  No obstruction. 2)  Large right pleural
effusion.
.
ECHO, [**2148-9-18**]: LVEF 50-55%.  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-21**],
mitral
regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now higher. As noted in the prior
report would consider diagnosis of amyloid versus hypertensive
heart disease. No vegetation identified but cannot exclude.
.
Tunneled Catheter Placement, [**2148-9-17**]: Status post successful
placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter via the left
transfemoral approach. Extensive venous disease in the
infrarenal inferior vena cava, left common
iliac and left external iliac veins. There is no apparent venous
inflow from the right iliac system.   This will likely preclude
any further de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] placement of transfemoral approach lines or
catheters. This patient may be served with placement of a stent
within the narrowed segment of the infrarenal inferior vena cava
and or left common and external iliac veins.  Status post venous
angioplasty in the infrarenal abdominal aorta and left external
iliac artery. Removed catheter tip sent for microbiology.
.
Chest xray, [**2148-9-17**]: Right-sided pleural thickening and
subpleural atelectasis are chronic since at least [**2147-12-28**].
 Since [**9-14**], a large right pleural effusion has
reaccumulated.  Atelectasis at the base of the left lung is
unchanged.  There is no interstitial pulmonary edema.  Heart
size top normal.
.
EKG, [**2148-9-14**]: Sinus rhythm; Indeterminate axis; Intraventricular
conduction delay; Possible anterior infarct - age undetermined;
Generalized low QRS voltages; Since previous tracing of
[**2148-1-16**], no significant change
.
MRI Spine, [**2148-9-14**]: Limited study secondary to motion.  No
evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis on this non-enhanced
study.  Question of elongation of intra-articular region at L5
level could be to spondylolysis.
.
EGD: Esophagus: Mucosa: Esophagitis with ulceration and no
bleeding was seen in the lower third of the esophagus .
Protruding Lesions A single nodule with some supoerficial
erosion was seen in the gastroesophageal junction. Not biopsied
because of elevated INR. Other Whitish exudate was seen in the
esophagus
Stomach: Other Small thickened fold was seen with some erythema
in the body of the stomach
Duodenum: Other A small thickened fold vs nodule was seen in the
duodenal bulb.
Impression: Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus
Nodule in the gastroesophageal junction
A small thickened fold vs nodule was seen in the duodenal bulb.
Small thickened fold was seen with some erythema in the body of
the stomach
Whitish exudate was seen in the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: PPI
Repeat EGD with biopsy of the esophageal nodule when INR is
lower
Follow Hct


Brief Hospital Course:
.
This is a 55 year old man with a history of ESRD on HD, DMII,
HCV admitted to the MICU after tunneled fem line infection and
hypotension requiring pressors in the unit.  Blood cxs revealed
[**4-30**] Coag Neg Staph with antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin
QHD.
.
Brief MICU Course: the patient was started on broad spectrum IV
antibiotics, Vanc and Gent for presumed HD femoral line
infection. The patient had a low blood pressure at baseline,
however dopamine was required for hypotension (80s/60s).
