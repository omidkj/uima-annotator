Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
agitation and fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
58yo M discharged from the neurology service on [**4-28**] following
complete L PCA infarction now returning from rehab following a
fall from bed, admitted to the medicine service, now having
fallen from bed again and found to be unresponsive.  Pt was
found
on the ground at [**Hospital3 **] earlier today, and was sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for head CT. His examination was reportedly consistent
with prior exams, head CT revealed a large L PCA infarct. He was
admitted to the medicine service for further care. At 5am this
morning patient was found on the ground next to his bed again
and
was noted to be unresponsive. Neurology was consulted.

The patient was minimally responsive, unable to provide a ROS or
history.

Please refer to details of recent admission from yesterday's
note.

The patient was taken for STAT CTA head and neck to rule out a
recurrent posterior circulation vascular event. There was no
evidence for vessel occlusion or cut-off. Pt was transferred to
the neurology ICU and Neurology ICU service for further care and
monitoring. No evidence for ICH  noted on CT following fall on
coumadin. Reconstructions of the CTA neck showed no evidence of
fracture.


Past Medical History:
L PCA infarct as described previously- etiology unclear if
cardioembolic versus possible L vert dissection. Pt was briefly
on coumadin and plavix. discharged on coumadin monotherapy.

ago.

EKG: NSR

[**4-28**] CT head: 1. Evolving left PCA territory infarct. No
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Small left frontal subgaleal hematoma.

[**4-28**] CT c-spine: 1. No fracture.
2. Mild cervical spondylosis with grade 1 C5 on C6
retrolisthesis, likely
degenerative.

[**4-29**] CTA: 1. Evolving left posterior cerebral artery infarct
involving the left
thalamus, posterior occipital lobe, and left side of the mid
brain.
2. No significant abnormalities on CT angiography of the neck
without
vascular occlusion or stenosis.
3. Improved left posterior cerebral artery irregularity with no
evidence of
occlusion on CT angiography of the head.
4. Right pulmonary artery thrombus is partially visualized

CT PE and Abd, pelvis: CTA chest with CT abdomen and pelvis
found no occult malignancy.

There is embolism within the branches of the right pulmonary

artery which might be chronic in origin.

There was also enlargement and hypodense filling defects of the

right common femoral vein and right external iliac veins are

concerning for acute DVT in this area.

There is also Colonic pandiverticulosis.

CTA CNS on 6/ 10/ 09:
less evident hypodensity in the left PCA territory with less
evident
hypodensities in the left pons and midbrain. no new areas of
infarct. no
hemorrhage. hypoplastic right vertebral, otherwise normal COW.


Brief Hospital Course:
58yo M with prior L PCA infarction and cerebellar infarction now
with two episodes of "falling" from bed followed by
unresponsiveness. The patient at present is comatose. Anisocoria
and right hemiparesis are consistent with prior exams. CTA brain
did not show a recurrent cerebral event. Hence patient's
markedly impaired diminished level of consciousness is perhaps
related to seizure. Pt's falls from bed may relate to motor
activity associated with seizure, but has yet to be witnessed.

Mr [**Known lastname 34393**] was admitted to the neurology ICU, Attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and monitored with q1h neuro checks, tele,
cardio/resp monitoring.

Neuro: Pt woke up more and improved after 1mg IV ativan
consistent with diagnosis of seizure. He was able to say his
last name, say the correct year, and show two fingers with the
left hand. He received Keppra 1,000mg IV x 1, then started
1,000mg IV BID thereafter.  Routine EEG after keppra load did
not show any sign of ongoing seizure and lab evaluation with
troponin/CK, LFT's, repeat Chem 10, CBC was wnl with stable hct.
 Head CT was negative for new stroke or bleeding.  Over the
course of the following 2 days he remained somnolent but easily
arousable, briskly following simple motor commands, dysarthric,
oriented to [**Location (un) 86**] and name only. His opthalmoplegia worsened.
His right eye had minimal abduction and barely any adduction.
The right eye had minimal upward and downward movements. The
left eye did not abduct or adduct, and barely made any vertical
movements.   His continued disorientation and somnolence was
attributed to post ictal state and medication effect from keppra
and ativan/Seroquel which he was requiring for agitation. Upon
transfer from the ICU to the floor, ativan was stopped and he
was placed on a standing order of Seroquel 25mg qhs to improve
his sleep/wake cycle.

Heme: Incidental LUL PE was found on CTA neck.
Hypercoagulability/malignancy work-up was initiated given
multiple thrombi involving multiple organ systems while
therapeutic on coumadin.  INR was monitored and coumadin
decreased from 7.5mg to 6mg given rapidly increasing INR.

There were no active cardiovascular, respiratory (he was stable
on room air w/o tachypnea despite the PE seen on CT),
infectious, or renal issues.

At his family's request his code status was changed to DNR/DNI.


Neurology floor course:
CTA chest with CT abdomen and pelvis found no occult malignancy.
There is embolism within the branches of the right pulmonary
artery which might be chronic in origin.
There was also enlargement and hypodense filling defects of the
right common femoral vein and right external iliac veins are
concerning for acute DVT in this area. There is also Colonic
pandiverticulosis.

On [**5-3**] at 7:20am, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1794**] noted that his mental status
had worsened. He received a CTA CNS on 6/ 10/ 09: less evident
hypodensity in the left PCA territory with less evident
hypodensities in the left pons and midbrain. no new areas of
infarct. no
hemorrhage. hypoplastic right vertebral, otherwise normal COW.
We informed the family that he might be having new small vessel
strokes in the pons or midbrain which could not be
