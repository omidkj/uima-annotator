Service:  INT MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 38 year old gentleman
with a history of ETOH abuse and esophageal varices who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**1-18**], to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with
hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum, with a systolic
blood pressure in the 140s and a hematocrit of 30.0.  He
arrived intubated for airway protection from the outside
hospital status post transfusion with four units of packed
red blood cells and one fresh frozen plasma.  Endoscopy done
at outside hospital showed diffuse gastropathy with oozing.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit he received q. four hours
hematocrit checks, intravenous octreotide, a hepatic
ultrasound, a diagnostic paracentesis, hepatitis serologies,
AFP check, prophylaxis antibiotics and a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**1-19**].

He was noted to have esophageal Grade 1 varices that were not
bleeding at that time, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and a
nonbleeding moderately sized fundic varix.  The hematocrit
remained stable in the Intensive Care Unit with no further
bleeding.  He was treated for a likely aspiration pneumonia
with Levofloxacin and clindamycin and was changed to
azithromycin prior to his transfer to the floor.

He was extubated on [**1-23**], changed to nasal cannula
oxygen and transferred to the floor on [**1-24**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  ETOH abuse and history of withdrawal seizures.
2.  History of esophageal gastric varices.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  History of remote right ankle fracture.

ALLERGIES:   To Keflex.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history of hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Drinking three to four beers a day.
Tobacco, one and a half packs per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On initial presentation, vital signs
were a temperature of 99.8 F.; heart rate of 114, blood
pressure of 145/74; saturation of 100%.  He arrived
intubated, on CPAP and pressure support of 18 and 8
respectively.  He was sedated and ventilated, but responded
to touch.  He had moist mucous membranes and clear
oropharynx.  Pupils were equal with anicteric sclerae.  He
had no jugular venous pressure elevation.  Multiple spider
angiomas were noted on his skin.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate but was
noted to be tachycardic.  He had a distended abdomen with
positive bowel sounds.  Two plus pitting edema was noted
bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, CBC showed a white blood cell
count of 15.0, hematocrit of 28.2, platelet count of 232.
Chem-7 showed a sodium of 144, potassium of 4.4, chloride of
113, carbon dioxide of 22, BUN of 20, creatinine of 0.7,
glucose of 145.  He had an ALT of 13, AST of 31, alkaline
phosphatase of 105, direct bilirubin of 1.7, total bilirubin
of 3.4, albumin of 2.7.  He had an INR of 1.5 and a PTT of
40.

EKG performed at the time showed no evidence of ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Intensive Care Unit course preceded as
listed in the HPI.  The patient received multiple blood
cultures which were no growth.  He had sputum cultures
performed that showed four plus organisms consistent with
oropharyngeal flora as well as beta lactamase negative H. flu
with moderate growth.  The peritoneal fluid done on
diagnostic tap showed two plus polys, no organisms and
negative culture.

Initial chest x-ray showed patchy consolidation of the right
lung, aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia.  Hepatic
ultrasound done on [**1-19**] showed fatty infiltration of
the liver, moderate to large ascites, gallbladder sludging
with no ductal dilation and patent hepatic vasculature.

The patient, on initial transfer to the floor was monitored
with 12 hour hematocrit checks and continued on a proton pump
inhibitor.  He had already completed a five day course of
Octreotide by the time he arrived on the floor.  He was
followed closely by the Gastrointestinal Service.

His hematocrit remained stable so he was changed to q. 24
hour hematocrits on the 27th.  His upper gastrointestinal
bleed remained stable for the rest of his course and he did
not require further transfusion.  He had known liver disease
and appeared to have fluctuating mental status changes that
improved with increasing doses of lactulose.  He was followed
closely by Liver for this.

2.  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  The patient was extubated as
previously mentioned on [**1-23**].  He was initially on
Levofloxacin and clindamycin for presumed aspiration
pneumonitis versus pneumonia.  He was changed to azithromycin
prior to his transfer to the floor.  However, he developed a
fever to 101.0 F., on the [**1-25**].  He was
recultured at that time and it was presumed that azithromycin
was insufficient coverage for his pulmonary infection.  He
was restarted on his Intensive Care Unit regimen of
Levofloxacin and clindamycin.

There was a report from one of his nurses that he had had
difficulty with swallowing his water with his morning meal so
he was requested to have a swallow evaluation.  His bedside
swallow evaluation was entirely normal so he was put back on
his p.o. diet and had no further difficulties during this
stay.

3.  ETOH:  The patient was initially maintained on a CIWA
scale but did not require ativan doses while on the floor.
He was seen by Addiction Services in order to assess whether
or not he was ready or wiling to accept help with his current
level of drinking.  He admitted to his Care Team as well as
to his family that he intended to continue drinking after
discharge.

Social Work came and talked with the patient as well as with
the family in order to determine the best disposition for the
patient.  The patient lived with his parents at home prior to
this admission and they verbalized willingness to take him
back upon discharge.  They understand and voiced
understanding of his need for supervision given his hepatic
encephalopathy and level of impulsivity.  We discussed with
them the need for the lactulose in order to maintain his
mental status as well as discussed the possibility that he
may have further gastrointestinal bleeds in the future given
his degree of liver disease.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISPOSITION:   Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is instructed to follow-up with the
[**Hospital 3585**] Clinic within the next several weeks.
2.  He is instructed to see his primary care physician within
the next two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastric bleeding due to liver disease.
2.  Alcohol abuse.
3.  Hepatic encephalopathy.
4.  Alcoholic liver disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Spironolactone 25 mg, two tablets p.o. q. day.
2.  Propranolol 60 mg, [**1-31**] capsule q. day.
3.  Pantoprazole 40 mg q. day.
4.  Lactulose every eight hours, titrated to produce more
