Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia and S/P fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with h/o dementia, Parkinson's, CAD, CHF (EF 30%)
presents following a fall w/ 3 days of worsening shortness of
breath since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-1-9**].  He was
admitted at that time s/p probable mechanical fall and hypoxia.
He again presents following multiple falls since last discharge.
 He denies lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain prior to the
falls and says that his walker slipped ahead of him.  He does,
however, note some confusion following the fall.  He does not
recall head trauma.
.
Also of note, his daughter reports that around the time of these
episodes he had significant sweats and chills. Since his
discharge, he has continued to be short of breath, even
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing according to his son-in-law (a
nephrologist).
.
In the ED, BNP was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 31854**], but CXR did not reveal
gross volume overload. Cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponin
(but this is at his baseline given his acute on chronic renal
failure) and CKs were flat.  His initial vitals revealed T 98.0
HR 120 BP 88/40 and RR in the 20s with O2 sats of 88% on RA.
Given his elevated lactate and recent h/o sweats and rigors, he
received vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage although there
currently is no clear source of infection.

.
CHEST, AP: There is a dual lead pacemaker device in a similar
position. The heart is enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. There are no effusions. There is a
mildly displaced left lateral eighth rib fracture with air in
the adjacent subcutaneous tissues. In the absence of penetrating
trauma, this could possibly represent a small pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumonia.
.
IMPRESSION: Left-sided rib fracture with question of small
pneumothorax
.

The left atrium is elongated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial  septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial
septal defect. The  estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis/thinning of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments are hypokinetic. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2137-10-2**], the right ventricular cavity now
appears dilated with free wall  hypokinesis. The severity of
mitral regurgitation is now incresaed. Overall left ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed.
.
V/Q:
IMPRESSION:
1. Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism. 2.
Evidence of
activity in the arterial system as demonstrated by increased
activity in the brain and kidneys consistent with a right to
left shunt.
.
CXR [**1-16**]:
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Lungs are fully
expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Left subclavian transvenous right atrial pacer and
right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard
placements, unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxemia: On admission, CXR did not reveal pulmonary edema
nor infiltrate to suggest CHF, despite elevated BNP, or
pneumonia as contributors to his hypoxemia.  Heparin gtt was
started in the ED given concern for PE.  He had, however, been
subtherapeutic for only approx. 3 days once his coumadin (for a.
fib) had been recently been stopped [**1-30**] to his fall risk.
However, TTE on [**2139-1-14**] revealed worsening RV function and L-->R
shunt via ASD.  Because of the worsening right heart function, a
V/Q scan was pursued given persistent concern for PE (renal
failure prevented CTPA).  V/Q scan performed [**1-15**] showed low
probability of PE so heparin gtt was d/c'd.  Additionally, V/Q
scan revealed e/o R-->L shunt, thus suggesting shunt as likely
cause of his transient, posititionally related hypoxemia.  O2
saturations have otherwise been normal on room air.  Left sided
pneumothorax from left 8th rib fracture was evaluated by
thoracics in the ED and remained stable on follow up imaging.
Repair of ASD discussed with family, declined.
.
# Pneumothorax: [**1-30**] to left 8th rib fracture.  Evaluated by
thoracics in the ED who did not feel that intervention would
benefit him at this point and recommended serial CXRs.  X-rays
have remained stable.
.
# CHF: [**2139-1-14**] EF was found to be depressed slightly to 25%
compared to EF 30% on echo [**10-2**].  He was found to have worsened
RV function on this echo, but as above, V/Q scan showed low
probability for PE.  Clinically and on CXR he did not appear to
be fluid overloaded and his lasix was held in the setting of
elevated creatinine from baseline and presumed prerenal picture
in the setting of persistent diuresis with lasix in setting of
poor PO just prior to admission.
.
# CAD:  Elevated troponin on admission, but this is within his
BL range in the setting of his acute on chronic renal failure.
EKG did not reveal e/o acute ischemic changes and CKs were flat.
 He was continued on beta blocker and statin.  ASA had recently
been held PTA [**1-30**] to his mulitiple falls. Coumadin held
(discussed with family) because of fall risk.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine appears
1.4-1.5; admission creatinine was 1.9.  As above, hct appeared
hemoconcentrated.
