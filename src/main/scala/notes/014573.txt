Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old man with schizophrenia, HTN, and G6PD
deficiency presenting with 2-3 days of increasing intermittent
abdominal pain. Reportedly was having diarrhea at Group Home,
though pt states he has not had bowel movement in 4 days, no
hematochezia. He states that abdominal pain comes on suddenly,
[**9-16**] and sharp in quality, when he drinks fluids, lasts for a
few seconds and self-resolves. Has not been able to eat in the
last 2-3 days due to decreased appetite. No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Lives at group home.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 73 114/69 16 95% on ?RA. Vitals
stable at triage but became increasingly unresponsive,
responding to painful stimuli. Pupils 2mm, minimally reactive.
Patient was given 0.4 narcan, and appeared to transiently be a
little more alert, though he appeared to sometimes respond to
sternal rub even without narcan for 30-60 seconds. He received a
total of 2mg narcan in the ED. FAST ultrasound showed small
ascites, pericardial effusion, but no signs of tamponade. CT
abdomen showed moderate ascites, pericardial effusion, diffuse
bowel wall edema. Guaiac negative. EKG similar to prior. Also
received potassium repletion in ED for K of 2.8. Serum tox
negative. Vitals on floor prior to transfer are as follows: T 98
HR 64 BP 139/80 RR 16 O2sat 100%2L NC.
.
On the floor, patient is alert and oriented, responsive to
questioning. He feels hungry and would like to try eating food.
He denies current abdominal pain.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. He has lost 30 lbs unintentionally in the last [**4-10**]
months due to decreased appetite. He does report that he is
urinating frequently because he is drinking lots of fluid.
Denies dysuria or nocturia.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
.

Social History:
Patient originally from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], [**Country 480**]. Moved here 30 yrs
ago. Currently lives in Group Home. Works as cab driver for
30yrs. Educated through 8 years of elementary and middle school
in [**Country 480**]. Did one year of training in electronics here but
could not find a job, so continued as a cab driver. He is not
married, has no kids. Has 2 brothers and 2 sisters in [**Name (NI) 480**],
not well in touch with his family back home.
States that he is given meds at Group Home three days/week
(Wed/Thurs/Fri), and he takes meds himself the other four days
of the week.
Tobacco: Smoked x 30yrs, quit 2wks ago
Marijuana: Smoked x 20yrs, states he quit 10yrs ago b/c too
expensive. (per OMR, he has smoked marijuana prior to ED visits
in [**2173**])
ETOH: reportedly none
Illicits: no IV drug use or cocaine use


Family History:
No known family history of kidney, liver, cardiac disorders, but
patient not well in touch with family.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 97.8 BP: 140/82 P: 72 R: 21 O2: 92%RA
General: Alert, oriented x3, no acute distress, decreased
attention-- unable to list months of year backwards (able to
state [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 359**])
HEENT: Sclera mildly icteric, mildly dry mucus membranes,
oropharynx clear; lower lip appears large (but pt states this is
his normal)
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated
Lungs: Does not give good inspiratory effort, but soft rhonchi
at bilateral bases
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, early systolic
murmur [**3-15**] loudest at LUSB
Abdomen: moderately distended, non-tender, hypoactive bowel
sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding
Ext: warm, well perfused, trace pulses, 1+ peripheral leg edema



Pertinent Results:
CXR - [**2178-6-9**]
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding and
possible superimposed mild edema. No focal consolidation noted.

.
CT -abdomen [**2178-6-9**]
1. Diffuse small bowel wall edema. No pneumatosis. DDx includes
reactive due to ascites/hypoproteinemia; mesenteric ischemia,
although no atherosclerotic disease; angioedema due to ACE-I
2. Normal size of AAA
3. Cardiomegaly with large pericardial effusion
4. Moderate-large ascites, new from [**2178-10-3**].
5. Nodular patchy opacities at lung bases, right > left, in
bronchovascular distribution suggest aspiration
6. Vicarious excretion of contrast via gallbladder and oral
contrast in the large bowel suggest recent prior imaging, not at
our institution.
.
CT HEAD [**2178-6-9**]
1. No acute intracranial process
2. Hypoattenuation in the bilateral periventricular white matter
may be sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease but
has progressed from [**2173**] and is greater than expected in this
age group.
.
EKG: [**2178-6-9**]
NSR, rate 69, LVH, borderline LAD, inverted T waves in V-V4,
biphasic T waves in V5. (changed from prior)
.
TTE [**2178-6-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2167-1-7**], the degree of LVH is now moderate.
There is now a very small pericardial effusion (without
tamponade).
.
CXR [**2178-6-11**]: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung
volumes. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate, has worsened.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small and new or newly apparent.

.
RUQ US [**2178-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: Initial four quadrant ultrasound did
not demonstrate enough free fluid for paracentesis. This
suggests that prior ascites may have shifted. Note is also made
of sludge in the gallbladder with nonobstructive non-shadowing
small stones. Previously visualized focal lesion at the liver
dome is not visualized as no focal hepatic lesions are
identified.
