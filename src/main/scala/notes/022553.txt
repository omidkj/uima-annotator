CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman with multiple medical problems including human
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen) who
has had multiple admissions in the past for mental status
changes and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

He came to the Emergency Department on [**10-23**] after a fall.
He had refused to go to dialysis early in the week.

poor historian and could not answer questions.
The patient denied all pain.  On presentation, his potassium
was 8.7.  Arterial blood gas revealed 6.99/92/64 on 6 liters
nasal cannula.  The initial electrocardiogram was notable for
peaked T waves in V1 to V6 with possible peaked T waves in
leads I and II.  The patient was given intravenous calcium
gluconate, bicarbonate, and 60 mg of oral Kayexalate.

The Renal Service was called and recommended dialysis the
following morning.   A repeat arterial blood gas on 4 liters
was 7.03/87/61.  Per primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient's
baseline pH is 7.2.  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for administration of BiPAP for treatment
of his hypercarbia.  He also was administered 1 g of
ceftriaxone and 500 mg of azithromycin in the Emergency
Department for a possible right lower lobe infiltrate.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a temperature of 98.2, heart rate
was 96, blood pressure was 124/100, respiratory rate was 22,
oxygen saturation was 91% on 6 liters nasal cannula.  In
general, a thin and emaciated Caucasian male sitting in bed,
in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx
was clear.  Mucous membranes were slightly dry.  Heart
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
Lungs revealed bronchial breath sounds in the right base.
Could not auscultate due to position.  Otherwise, clear to
auscultation.  The abdomen revealed normal active bowel
sounds.  Nontender and nondistended.  No masses.  Extremities
revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Good dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.  Neurologically, alert
and oriented times two.  The patient was oriented to person
and place.  Thought the month was [**Month (only) 205**].  He perseverates.  He
moved all four extremities.  He had a resting right upper
extremity tremor.  No asterixis.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory data
on admission revealed white blood cell count was 4,
hematocrit was 41.4, and platelet count was 77.  Differential
revealed 86% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, and
2% eosinophils.  PT was 16.8, PTT was 36.6, INR was 1.9.
Chemistry-7 disclosed sodium was 141, potassium was 8.7,
chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was
88, creatinine was 10, and blood glucose was 139.  Calcium
was 10.6, magnesium was 2.4, phosphate was 7.5,  Ammonia
level was 69.  Arterial blood gas at 2:24 a.m. was
6.99/92/64.  Arterial blood gas at 3:44 a.m. was 7.03/87/61.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray disclosed large lung
volumes, increased opacity in the right lower lung field.

Electrocardiogram at 2:08 a.m. showed questionable P-R
elongation, QRS elongation to 172 milliseconds, peaked T
waves in V1 through V6, I, and II.

Electrocardiogram at 3:06 a.m. showed a normal sinus rhythm,
normal P-R interval, QRS interval was 50 milliseconds, peaked
T waves in V1 through V6 persisted as well and were
consistent with prior electrocardiograms in [**Month (only) 359**] and
[**2179-9-24**].

IMPRESSION:  This is a 59-year-old male with a complicated
past medical history which included human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (on home oxygen), and end-stage renal
disease (on hemodialysis) who presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure and change in
mental status, and hyperkalemia secondary to noncompliance
with dialysis regimen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit so that he could be administered
BiPAP for his hypercarbia.

His potassium improved with the administration of
bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  In addition, he
was administered albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q.3-4h.
He was treated empirically for a community-acquired pneumonia
with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  On [**10-24**], he
underwent dialysis.

The patient had persistent episodes of hypoglycemia for which
he required the administration of D-50.  It was hypothesized
that his hypoglycemia may have been due to adrenal
insufficiency, so a free cortisol level was sent.  Previous
evaluation had ruled out adrenal insufficiency in a work up of
hypotension.

The patient's mental status continued to improve, and he was
transferred to the [**Location (un) **] Service on [**10-24**].  He was
administered Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.  A repeat ammonia level
was 24.  He underwent dialysis on [**10-25**].

He was judged medically stable for discharge home.  The patient
was to complete his course of azithromycin.  He spoke at length
with his PCP and the renal service regarding the imperative of
complying with hemodialysis treatment and the possible fatal
consequences of failure to comply.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to home
with [**Hospital6 407**].

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to undergo hemodialysis four times per
week.  The patient was to undergo dialysis on [**10-27**].
2.  The patient was to follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3.  Visiting nurses were to check his complete blood count on
[**10-29**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome.
2.  Hyperkalemia.
3.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on 4 liters home
oxygen).
5.  Hepatitis C.
6.  Hepatitis B.
7.  Intravenous drug abuse.
8.  Depression.
9.  Anxiety.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. (the patient to take
standing olanzapine)
 2.  Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Levoxyl 100 mg p.o.
