Admission Date: [**2145-8-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-8-29**]


Service:  TRA


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female, who was visiting her daughter from [**Name (NI) 3908**]. She is
chronically on warfarin therapy for a mechanical aortic valve
replacement. Fall some time prior to admission hitting her
head on a bedside table. Immediately she had epistaxis and as
well she complained of head pain. She was taken to [**Hospital **]
Hospital where a CT scan of the head revealed a 7 mm subdural
hematoma with no midline shift and an INR of 3.9. At the
outside hospital, she was given 2 units of fresh frozen
plasma and 10 mg of subcutaneous vitamin K. She was then
intubated for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**]. Her repeat head CT at our
institution showed a small subdural hematoma along the falx.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for congestive heart
failure, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mechanical aortic
valve replacement for which she was on warfarin therapy.

MEDICATIONS:  Her other medications included potassium,
furosemide and metoprolol.

ALLERGIES:  She is not allergic to anything.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  As was noted before, she lived in [**State 3908**]
but was visiting her daughter in the area at which time her
accident happened.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs at the time of
admission were as follows: A temperature of 97.9, heart rate
89 and normal sinus, blood pressure 148/58, respiratory rate
of 16, and she was 100% on mechanical ventilator, the
settings of which were AC, FiO2 of 1.0, tidal volume of 500,
rate of 16, and a PEEP of 5. On exam, she was noted to be
intubated and sedated. There was an epistaxis balloon that
was placed in the right naris to prevent her nosebleed. She
was also noted to have a large neck goiter. Her oropharynx
was noted to be clear. On heart exam, she was noted to have a
regular rate and rhythm and mechanical S2. On lung exam, she
was noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her
abdomen was soft and nondistended. She was noted to have
guaiac positive rectal exam. Her feet were warm and well
perfused.

In addition to her CT scan of the head which she received on
admission, she also received a CT of the cervical spine which
revealed no fracture. She had plain x-ray films of her
thoracic, lumbosacral spine as well as of her left femur and
right hip, and these all proved negative for fracture and
dislocation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the trauma intensive
care unit. Her white count on admission was 8.6 and
hematocrit on admission was 34.2. Her INR had been reversed
from 3.8 to 2.3 with the use of fresh frozen plasma and
vitamin K. Her UA was negative as well. On hospital day 2,
the patient was evaluated off sedation for mental status. She
was noted to be unresponsive to commands which appeared to be
different from prior neurologic exams, and she was taken for
a stat head CT which revealed no acute changes from the prior
CT. She was noted to have a bradycardic episode at the time
and her rhythm at that time was irregularly irregular. The
neurosurgery team who had been following the patient since
admission also evaluated the patient for this alteration in
mental status and recommended that a CT scan be repeated in
the morning. She was cleared for extubation as soon as she
was able to tolerate weaning mode on ventilation. Her
systolic blood pressures were kept below 140 and her INR was
kept below 1.5 in order to minimize the effects of her head
bleed. On postoperative day 3, the patient was extubated and
was somewhat responsive to commands although her mental
status seemed to wax and wane. On exam, she was found to have
bilateral coarse wet crackles and was administered furosemide
with good effect. Cardiac enzymes were also drawn and tested
to rule out a cardiac event and these proved negative.
Despite furosemide therapy, her respiratory status continued
to decline and she was reintubated by the anesthesia team in
the trauma ICU. On hospital day 4, a chest x-ray revealed
worsened pulmonary edema despite furosemide therapy. The plan
was to continue to diurese her until her respiratory status
improved. She was weaned to pressure support ventilation with
good effect. On hospital day 5, the patient was found to be
awake and intermittently following commands. She was noted to
move her head from side to side but had no other spontaneous
movements of extremities. She had been weaned to face tent
but was noted to have respiratory acidosis despite 100% FiO2.
Acetazolamide was started for her respiratory acidosis and
metabolic alkalosis and she was tolerating extubation
relatively well. An EKG revealed left anterior fascicular
block as well as right bundle branch block although her
cardiac enzymes had proved negative. The cardiology consult
was obtained to evaluate the patient for new onset atrial
fibrillation as well as to help manage her congestive heart
failure. They recommended that her beta blocker be restarted.
On hospital day 6, the patient continued to have tolerated
extubation but her mental status never quite improved past
intermittently following commands and responding to voice. A
chest x-ray showed again persistent pulmonary edema that
seemed to be somewhat intractable to Lasix therapy. Later
that day on [**2145-8-29**], the patient's respiratory status
was noted to steadily worsened. The thought was to reintubate
her. As the patient failed extubation twice before and as her
congestive heart failure did not seem to be improving at all,
the patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] with regard to their
wishes and the patient's wishes for intubation and
resuscitation. After lengthy conversation with the family and
after the family had arrived at the bedside of the patient,
the patient was made first DNR/DNI and then was made comfort
measures only. She expired at 12:00 p.m. on [**2145-8-29**], in
the presence of her family. The medical examiner was called
and notified about the death. The family declined postmortem
and the medical examiner declined postmortem as well.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post fall.
2.  Anticoagulated due to mechanical valve replacement.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Respiratory distress.
6.  Altered mental status.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.
