Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old gentleman with hypertension who
presented with decompensated heart failure. He originally noted
dyspnea on exertion two months prior to admission. He
experienced shortness of breath after walking one city blood and
experienced mild sporadic chest pain with and without activity.
He also developed bilateral lower extremity edema and vascular
congestion with increased neck veins.

In [**10-17**] patient had an ETT MIBI which showed partially
reversible defects in the area of the PDA and LAD, new since
[**2099**]. EF was 35-45%. In [**2099**] EF had been 50%. MIBI showed
moderate global LV hypokinesis, mild asymm LVH, mild PA HTN.
During that MIBI patient had AVNRT and sinus tachycardia.

Patient presented for elective cath which showed normal
coronaries but the following pressures:  RA 32/RV 64/21 PA
72/32, wedge 35. PA sat 46%. CO 2.9 and CI 1.6. Pt was given 100
lasix in lab and put on natrecor drip at 0.01 and milrinone at
0.325. Transfered to CCU. Of note, INR was 1.8, and there was
significant oozing from groin post sheath pull.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) s/p open prostatectomy secondary to BPH [**2097**]
3) s/p hernia repair
4) s/p hydrocele repair

Social History:
Married. Quit smoking 15 years ago.

ECHO [**2104-2-4**]:

Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.1 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.8 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.5 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 35% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.3 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
preservation of apical segments (suggestive of a non-ischemic
myopathy). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CATH: [**2104-2-4**]

1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no
angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
 The
left main coronary artery, LAD, LCX, and RCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided pressures
were
severely elevated (mean RA pressure was 33 mm Hg and RVEDP was
32 mm
Hg).  Pulmonary artery pressures were severely elevated (PA
pressure was
70/28 mm Hg).  Left sided pressures were severely elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 34 mm Hg and LVEDP was 36 mm Hg).  Central arterial

pressure was mildly elevated (aortic pressure was 144/95 mm Hg).

Cardiac index was low (at 1.6 L/min/m2).  There was no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter
from the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to
markedly
elevated filling pressures and two recent determinations of
ejection
fraction.
4.  Intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
and
sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs were noted.
5.  Because of the markedly elevated filling pressures, the
patient was
transferred to the CCU for IV inotropic, vasodilator, and
diuretic
therapy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery
disease.
2. Severely elevated right sided filling pressures.
3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
5. Severely depressed cardiac index.
6. Known moderately to severely depressed left ventricular
systolic
function.

CT ABDOMEN [**2104-2-5**]:
FINDINGS:
CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small right sided pleural
effusion which is low in density. There is adjacent atelectasis
within the right lower lobe posteriorly, and atelectasis vs
scarring at the left base. There is cardiomegaly. A Swan-Ganz
catheter is in place via a right femoral approach. Within the
right lobe of the liver medially, a 1.6 cm hypodense lesion is
seen. This is incompletely characterized on this noncontrast
examination. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
appear otherwise unremarkable in contour on this noncontrast
examination. There is density within the right renal hilum near
the upper pole which could represent calcification vs a small
amount of previously excreted contrast related to the patient's
cardiac catheterization. Additional similar areas are seen
within the collecting system of the left kidney. There is a 6 cm
simple cyst arising from the interpolar region of the right
kidney. An additional rounded cystic appearing structure is seen
just superior to this within the right kidney, possibly
representing a hyperdense cyst, although this is incompletely
evaluated on this examination. There is nonspecific stranding
surrounding both kidneys. The aorta is normal in caliber
throughout, with mural calcifications consistent with
atheromatous disease. The aorta is ectatic at the level of the
bifurcation. There is no free interperitoneal air. There is
diffuse stranding throughout the mesentery and subcutaneous soft
tissues, possibly consistent with congestive heart failure.

CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a small amount of fluid
layering within the pelvis, and between multiple pelvic loops of
bowel. This is low in density consistent with ascites. The
bladder contains a Foley catheter and a small amount of excreted
IV contrast. There is a suggestion of bladder wall thickening at
the bladder base, although the dome of the bladder is
nonthickened. There are surgical sutures in the right groin.
Small amount of stranding surrounding the right common femoral
artery and vein, possibly consistent with puncture at this
location. There is a right common femoral venous line in place.
No expansion of the retroperitoneal structures to indicate
retroperitoneal hematoma. A small fluid collection is seen in
the left groin, in the region of a left fat containing inguinal
hernia. This could also possibly represent an enlarged lymph
node.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes of
the thoracic and lumbosacral spine without evidence of
suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. Low density ascites
without evidence of
