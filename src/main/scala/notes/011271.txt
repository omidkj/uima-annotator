Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ placement [**6-23**]

History of Present Illness:
63 YO M w bipolar disorder, HTN, IDDM2, LE ulcers, CHF (EF =
20%) and prior CVA presenting from his PCPs office after being
section 12'd in the setting of hypotension. The patient is a
very poor historian but reports that he has had shortness of
breath productive of thick sputum over the past 3-4 days. He
denies any hemoptysis. He has also had substernal chest pressure
associated with diaphresis although without radiation. He is
unable to characterize further or describe in what setting this
chest discomfort occurs. He also endorses poor PO intake but
denies fevers, chills, nightsweats. He reports that his friend
is dying of HCV and lung cancer and he is inside of him. He
states that he would not have gone to the doctor's but his VNA
was concerned about his LE ulcers. The patient does also endorse
increased LE pain. He was sent into the ED from his PCPs on a
section 12 with SBPs in the 70s, and was admitted to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, his VS were: 99.1  65/47  73  98% RA.
Exam was notable for a cantancerous male with left sided
crackles and LE ulcers. Labs were notable for a creatinine 1.7,
trop 0.02 and an INR 1.6. A CXR was c/f left sided PNA. Given
hypotension, a FAST exam was done and the patient was given 1L
NS bolus. After fluid bolus the patient become sob w ABG
7.34/50/177 and was placed on CPAP with reported improvement.
Fast exam showed free fluid so a CT A/P was done. This showed
likely cirrhosis, ascites and ARF. The patient was given vanc
and zosyn. An EKG was done and showed a RBBB reportedly
unchanged from prior. A RIJ was placed and the patient was
started on a levophed gtt. VS prior to transfer 77 97/65 18 100%
CPAP 6 FiO2 40.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports feeling much
improved. He says that he lived with the devil for years and he
should have never let the devil into his home. He states that
the devil took his foot off.

Reports
[**2144-6-23**] CT A/P:IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis and splenomegaly.
2. Mild simple ascites and marked body wall edema.
3. Delayed bilateral renal contrast excretion; Recommend close
monitoring of renal function as contrast induced nephropathy is
a concern.
4. 4-cm infrarenal AAA.
5. Bilateral adrenal fullness, likely reactive hyperplasia.
6. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

TTE:The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
with near akinesis of the inferior wall and mild dyskinesis of
the aneurysmal apex (LVEF = 25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
mitral regurgitation.] Cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0l/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement with global and
regional systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process (multivessel
CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.), Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.

CXR:CHEST, AP: Examination is suboptimal due to
underpenetration. Changes of CABG are seen, with median
sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips. Mild
cardiomegaly is present. Other than some retrocardiac
atelectasis, the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly. No consolidation.

RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and ascites.
2. Partially distended gallbladder with wall thickening. This is
likely
reactive, given absence of symptoms is less worrisome for acute
cholecystitis.




Brief Hospital Course:
63 YO M w bipolar disorder, HTN, IDDM2, LE ulcers, CHF (EF =
20%) and prior CVA presenting from his PCP's office with
hypotension, recent cough/SOB and chest pressure as well as
increased LE ulcer pain.

Brief Hospital Course by Problem

#. Hypotension. The etiology of his initial hypotension was
unclear, however it improved with diuresis, suggesting possible
cardiogenic shock. Per review of clinic notes, he also has
history of low SBP 80s-90s at baseline so likely was not too far
from baseline and had low reserve. Hypotension improved with
diuresis and antibiotics for question of pneumonia, and he was
weaned off levophed [**6-25**]. It was also possible that he took more
of his home antihypertensives given his confusion and delirium
with mania on initial presentation. His blood pressures were
monitored and were stable with SBP 90-120.  He was kept on a low
salt diet.  On discharge, he was started on lasix PO 60 mg once
a day, lisinopril at home dose, and coumadin.  Will ask patient
to f/u with PCP and have INR checked.  Per outpatient records,
patient is on coumadin for Afib ([**Country **] score of 2 for DM and CHF)

.
#. SOB/Cough in the setting of systolic CHF. The patient may
have had bronchitis although unlikely to have pna with a clear
xray and lack of need for oxygen aside from in the setting of
what sounds like acute pulmonary edema after receiving a fluid
bolus.  He was started on levofloxacin/ceftriaxone for presumed
CAP; changed levofloxacin from IV to po [**6-25**]; after which he
remained afebrile and WBC normalized with no sx of PNA.
Levofloxacin 750 mg PO/NG discontinued on [**6-27**] and CeftriaXONE 2
gm IV Q24H discontinued [**6-27**].  He was kept on Ipratropium
Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q4H and Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH
Q4H until discharge.  He was weaned off of oxygen.
