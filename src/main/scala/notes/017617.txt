Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with banding of esophageal varices [**2145-12-9**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 90095**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with Hep-C
cirrhosis and multifocal HCC. About 3 years ago, he underwent
treatment with pegylated interferon and Ribavirin for 6 months,
and did not respond to it. He had to reduce his dose at 4-1/2
months secondary to anemia, and he was told he had genotype 2.
He is status post a right lobe TACE on [**2145-5-29**] followed by RFA
to a segment II/III lesion on [**2145-8-4**]. A left lobe TACE was
subsequently performed on [**2145-8-6**] for residual disease. The
patient has portal vein infiltration from his HCC and known
portal hypertension evidenced by Grade I esophageal varices seen
on recent EGD. The patient was in his normal state of health
until Saturday when he had increasing pain in his midepigastric
area. He described the pain as sharp, radiated to the back, and
was worse with deep breaths, and with laying on his left side.
He had some relief with dilaudid, but he says that the pain was
worse and different than his normal RUQ pain. The pain was not
associated with eating, nor did he describe it as reflux pain.
The patient says that the pain continued until Sunday when he
felt a "popping" sensation in the same distribution as the pain.
He said that the pain actually improved then, but then on Monday
he developed dark, black, tarry stool. The patient continued to
have black, tarry, large quantity stools on Wednesday, but then
the patient's stools returned to a brown color. The patient
denied hematemesis, nausea, reflux, BRBPR, lightheadedness,
dizziness, orthostasis. He does take intermittent Ibuprofen. He
is not on prophylactic nadalol or propranolol. The patient was
admitted directly from clinic to the MICU for urgent EGD for
possible variceal bleed. On arrival to the MICU, the patient was
afebrile with normal BP, HR.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90095**] is a 63-year-old man with cirrhosis who was
found to have multiple liver lesions suspicious for HCC on
screening ultrasound [**2145-4-9**]. MRI [**2145-4-16**] demonstrated a
cirrhotic liver with a 4.2 cm mass in segment II and a bilobed
5.5 cm mass in segment VIII. He underwent TACE to the right lobe
of the liver on [**2145-5-28**]. His post Tace course was notable for
fever, significant and prolonged RUQ pain, mild nausea, urinary
retention and constipation in the setting of  narcotics to treat
his pain. On [**2145-7-26**], he started on a clinical trial 08-256
involving RFA plus or minus sorafenib.  The patient underwent
RFA
to a segment II/III lesion on [**2145-8-4**].  He also underwent
CT/ultrasound-guided biopsy at that time.  Imaging was notable
for a previously noted right adrenal nodule which was shown to
have increased in size to 25 x 15 mm, suspicious for metastasis.
 Notation was also made of interval increase in size of
remaining foci of arterial enhancing lesions within the liver.
These findings were reviewed  in Tace Imaging Conference and it
was recommmended that the patient undergo TACE. Following TACE,
the patient will be set up for bx and RFA of his adrenal nodule.
Consideration will be given to sorafenib in the near future. He
received his first TACE to the left lobe and to two targeted
branches to the Segment 4 in the right lobe and the hepatic
dome. He had discomfort at the end of the procedure (he has
previously had epigastric and left shoulder pain related to his
RF and RUQ and right shoulder pain from his TACE - both of these
might be expected post-procedure).  He got Versed/Fentanyl for
moderate sedation, Toradol during the case, and had significant
nausea at the end of the procedure for which he got additional
Zofran and a dose of Haldol.  The procedure itself went well.
He received Diludid PCA complicated by constipation and nausea.

PMHx:
- Gallstones, s/p cholecystectomy in early [**2133**] complicated by a
collapsed lung and "nicked" diaphragm.
- hx of IV drug abuse
- cirrhosis (bx performed during cholecystectomy in early [**2133**]
b/c of abnormal liver findings) Presumed [**12-30**] Hep C 3a, viral
load
> 1 million [**2145-2-26**]. Complicated by 'fogginess' and
difficulty
multi-tasking improved on rifaxamin after trial of lactulose.
Treated with interferon x 4 doses in [**2141**] without response. HIV
negative.
- kidney stones as per pt report
- HepBsAB + but HBsAG negative.
- Hep C 3a positive, viral load > 1 million [**3-9**]

Social History:
(As per previous notes).  Married. Lives with wife and adult
daughter and young grandson. Smokes [**11-29**] pack/day. Smoked 25+
pack year. Sober x 25 years. Prior heavy drinker. Worked as
contractor/carpenter on [**Hospital3 **] until [**2144**]. Quit IV drug use
at age 49.

Family History:
Father with CAD.  DM in his sister and grandparents.
