Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis and melena


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
75 year old female presenting to OSH with about 24 hours of
hemetemesis and melena. Patient was found by daughter this
morning to be lethargic and less responsive. Patient has hx of
significant NSAID use for her chronic back pain. Upon
presentation to the ED she was oriented and alert. She had 2 IVs
started and given 1L crystalloid bolus. She was noted to have
large amount of melena in the ED. She was given a protonix bolus
and started on IV infusion. At the OSH the patient denied any
chest pain, shortness of breath with mild abdominal discomfort.
The mild abd pain has been present for a couple of weeks.
Patient was initially tachycardic and hypotensive to 90
systolic.

At OSH pt underwent EGD after elective endotracheal intubation
for airway protection. The EGD showed large clot in the stomach
with gastric varices. No esophageal varices were identified. no
evidence of ulcer in duodenum. No intervention was performed.
She was transferred here for tertiary care. At OSH she received
a total of 7 units pRBC, 6 FFP, and 4L of crystalloid. She was
started on an octretide drip. Patient's blood pressure remained
relatively stable and required a short time of peripheral
pressor support.

.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated but arousable. She
was hemodynamically stable with normal blood pressure. She was
on sedation as well as an octreotide drip.

AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:

ET tube ends no less than 4 cm above the carina in standard
placement. Right internal jugular introducer ends in the upper
SVC. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening.
Heart size top normal.  Diminished pulmonary vasculature
suggests emphysema. No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis and mild
interstitial edema.
2. Splenic vein thrombosis. Multiple varices noted in the region
of the spleen and anterior to the stomach.
3. Thrombosed aneurysm at the origin of the SMA, with
reconstitution of the distal SMA from adjacent vessels.

EGD:

Esophagus:
Contents: Old blood was seen along the mucosa of the lower third
of the esophagus.

Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the whole esophagus. There
was no evidence of esophageal varices or esophagitis.

Stomach:
Contents: A large amount of clotted blood was seen in the
fundus. Thirty minutes were spent trying to suction and remove
the clot to visualize the fundus, however the fundus could not
be fully visualized. The GE junction was carefully examined and
there was no evidence of gastro-esophageal varices. Isolated
fundal varices could not be ruled out.

Duodenum:
Mucosa: Old blood was noted in the whole duodenum, however the
mucosa was normal without ulcers




Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, breast
cancer s/p lumpectomy in remission transferred from OSH with
significant active upper GI bleed. Patient required multiple
packed red cell transfusions with continued instability upon
admission.  Emergent EGD showed extensive hemorrhage in the
stomach; a lesion could not be localized.  Patient underwent a
massive transfusion protocol, and received 14 units of packed
red cells at the outside hospital and [**Hospital1 18**].  Octreotide and
pantoprazole gtts were continued.  CT abdomen suggested gastric
varix due to splenic vein thrombosis was possible source of
bleeding.

#Diabetes- monitored finger sticks
.
#COPD- Continued home meds (ventolin and adviar)
.
#Hyperlipidemia- Held Crestor
.
#Hypertension- held lisinopril until hemodynamically stable
.
# FEN: IVF, NPO
# Prophylaxis: Pneumaboots
# Access: peripherals x 3, right IJ trauma line was placed
# Communication: HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 732**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91259**]; discussed case
# Code: DNR
.
Following initial stabilization, patient had another episode of
significant hematemesis and melena on the afternoon of [**2144-12-4**],
and was hemodynamically unstable, requiring additional packed
red cell transfusions.  An emergent conference was held
involving attending physicians from the hepatology,
interventional radiology, ICU and surgical services to discuss
possible therapeutic interventions. It was felt that no
endoscopic options were possible and that, due to multiple
varices and very difficult/calcified/aneurysmal anatomy, IR
options were not optimal. Surgery was felt possible but
extremely high risk and with a low likelihood of long-term
control. [**Hospital **] health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 732**] (daughter),
was involved in the process. She expressed that patient would
not wish to undergo major surgery.  After an informed
discussion, the decision was made to transition the patient to
comfort care.  No further interventions were pursued.  With
family at her bedside, the patient expired peacefully on
[**2144-12-5**] at 2:07 a.m.
