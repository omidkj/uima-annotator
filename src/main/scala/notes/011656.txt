Service:

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  Pending.

AGE:  59-year-old female.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old female
with history of ascending aortic aneurysm, status post AVR
thirty years ago, who presented to an outside hospital found
to be in third degree heart block.  She received a permanent
pacemaker and she was sent home.  However, she returned to
the outside hospital developing infected hematoma at the
pacemaker site.  The pacemaker was removed.  The patient
developed ectopy, bradycardia, and arrest.  Admission was
necessitated and transvenous pacer was placed.  The patient
also developed a left eye infection, which was treated and
drained.  The patient was taken for a transesophageal
echocardiogram at that time and this did not show vegetation
at the valve.  Ejection fraction at the time as 55% to 60%.
The patient was transferred to this hospital, where she was
found to have vegetation of her valve and IV antibiotics were
started, which grew MRSA.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for as above,
as well as peripheral vascular disease status post
angioplasty, high cholesterol, hypertension, question of CVA,
complete heart block requiring pacemaker.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  History is significant for AVR thirty years ago, TAH
fifteen years ago, pacemaker placement.
2.  The patient has positive tobacco and occasional alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has questionable allergy to
PENICILLIN AND ZOFRAN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lovenox.
2.  Norvasc 5 mg q.d.
3.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
4.  Clonazepam 0.5 mg q.d.
5.  Lidocaine drops gtt at 2 mcg per drop.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs:  On admission, the patient was afebrile.  She
was 77 and V paced.  Blood pressure was 115/53, respiratory
rate 22.  She was 97% on three liters nasal cannula.  This is
an elderly female in no apparent distress.  She is oriented.
The neurological examination was grossly intact.  HEENT:
pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
muscles were intact.  She was anicteric.  She had no bruits,
no JVD.  NECK:  Neck was supple.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  She was regular rate and rhythm
with S1 and S2 with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  ABDOMEN:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds were present.
She had no organomegaly.  Extremities were warm with palpable
pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs showed the following:  White
count of 8.5, hematocrit 28.6, platelet count 180,000.  PT
was 13.4, PTT 36.9, INR of 1.3.  Sodium 133, potassium 2.4,
chloride 99, bicarbonate 24, BUN 33, creatinine 1.5, and
blood sugar was 124.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium 1.6 and the
phosphorus was 3.4.  Blood cultures from [**6-24**] grew MRSA and
from the wound also grew MRSA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the hospital.  She was
started on IV antibiotics.  The Department of Ophthalmology
was consulted for her endophthalmitis.  Echocardiogram was
done, after admission, which showed vegetation in her valve.
The patient was started on Oxicillin and Rifampin for
treatment of MRSA endocarditis.  The Department of
Ophthalmology was consulted, who found an endogenous
endophthalmitis most likely due to septicemia.  The patient
was continued on her antibiotic treatment and the
endophthalmitis improved.

The Infectious Disease was consulted at this time and with
their suggestion, the patient was started on Oxacillin and
Gentamicin.  It was felt that the PENICILLIN ALLERGY was
questionable and Oxacillin was attempted.  The patient did
well.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  TPE
and TEE were performed.  CT of the chest was done to evaluate
the aneurysm and the antibiotics were continued.  At the
time, the TEE revealed vegetation along her valves and she
was started on antibiotics for the endocarditis.  Temporary
pacer was placed during the time in order for the patient to
be paced.  The Electrophysiology and Cardiology Departments
were consulted for this placement.  The patient was
transferred to the floor to continue intravenous antibiotics
after she was stabilized and the pacemaker was placed.  She
continued to improve on the floor.  She continued to build up
her strength.  The patient was taken to the operating room on
[**2116-5-26**], where a CABG, AVR, and ...................procedure
were performed.  The patient was transferred to the CSRU
postoperatively.

Prior to the operating room, the patient was changed to
Oxacillin and Rifampin for antibiotics because the Gentamicin
was discontinued due to a rise in the creatinine.  The
patient's Gentamicin was stopped due to its renal toxicity
and bumped the creatinine at the time Rifampin was started.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2116-7-27**],
where the AVR, CABG, and ....................were performed.

Tissue samples from the operating room were sent both to
microbiology, as well as pathology for culture.

She was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively.  The patient
was slowly weaned from the ventilator.  Diuresis was begun on
postoperative day #1.  The Electrophysiology Department was
consulted postoperatively for pacemaker placed and pacemaker
was placed.

The patient was hypertensive postoperatively and Nipride and
Hydralazine were used to control the blood pressure.  The
patient was edematous at that time due to the high volume
load of the operation.  The patient was extubated on
[**2116-7-29**].  Diuresis was continued at that time.  The patient
did well.

The patient had Foley and chest tubes removed on
postoperative day #3 and the pacemaker was placed at that
time with no complications.  The patient was given
intraoperative and immediate postoperative Vancomycin dosing
which stopped on [**2116-7-30**].  The patient needed a Foley to be
placed again due to urinary retention on [**7-31**].  The
patient was switched to PO hydralazine as well for better
blood pressure control.

It was decided on [**2116-8-1**], to treat the patient with
Oxacillin and Rifampin until [**2116-8-10**], at which time the
patient can discontinue the antibiotics.  IV access was
attempted and it was found that PIC line could not be place,
at the bedside and suggestion was made for interventional
radiology placement of PIC line.

The Department of Physical Therapy was consulted at the time
to work with ambulation and with mobility and to maximize the
strength.  The patient did well.  The Physical Therapy
Department suggested and recommended cardiac rehabilitation.
The patient was transferred to the floor again on [**2116-8-3**].
She did well on the floor and aggressive diuresis was
continued.  Chest x-ray showed large pleural effusion and
pulmonary edema, which responded well to IV Lasix.  The
patient began to complain of decreased hearing since the
operation and the Department of Audiology was consulted at
that time.  For further protection and concern, Lasix was
held and the patient was switched to Zaroxolyn.  Audiology
hearing testing was done at the bedside and it was found that
the patient had some fluid in her inner ear, however, she had
a mixed hearing loss including some of her air-bone
conduction system.  The patient had a PICC line placed on
[**2116-8-4**], postoperative day #8 at Interventional Radiology.
At the same time, a duplex ultrasound was done of the right
upper extremity, due to the high amount of swelling in that
region, disproportionate to her left arm.  No clot was found.
The PICC line was placed through the right arm.  At that time
the central line was also removed.  Diuresis continued.  The
patient's breathing improved significantly.

On [**2116-7-6**] repeat chest x-ray was done to evaluate the
pleural effusion, as well as the pulmonary edema.  At this
time, the patient is awaiting rehabilitation placement for
aggressive diuresis, pulmonary toilet and physical therapy.

Please see attending for rehabilitation placement,
medications, and diagnosis.
