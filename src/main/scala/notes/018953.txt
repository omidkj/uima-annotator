History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 106520**] is a 61 yo with a PMH significant for chronic
hypotension, severe chronic asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and past substance abuse who presented to the ED with suspected
anaphylactic shock. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**12-15**] until [**12-22**] for low back pain that started three weeks
earlier when she sufferred a fall after tripping over the wheels
of her walker.  Her workup revealed an L5 compression fracture
and she was treated with epidural steroid injections by the pain
service.  She was also started on MS contin and dilaudid for
pain control and was discharged to a rehab facility for further
treatment of her back pain and for physical therapy.

She was doing well at rehab until 5:00 am the morning of
admission ([**12-24**]) when she received 2 tablets of dilaudid 2 mg,
morphine SR, and ibuprofen for pain control and developed
diffuse erythema and puritis. At approximately 8:30 AM, she also
complained of difficulty breathing which she described as a
tightness in her throat and lungs. Her pulse was 123 and her
oxygen saturation on room air was 88%. She was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. Of note, she has received dilaudid in
the past without any adverse effect.

In the ED, her VS were 99.8 116 63/40s 28 97% on a 100%
nonrebreather. It was felt that she had suffered an anaphylactic
reaction to the dilaudid. She was treated with 125 mg of IV
solumedrol, 20 mg IV pepcid, and 50 mg IV benadryl. She also
received a total of 4 liters of NS. She had a good BP response
to the fluid. Epinephrine was avoided as the pt responded to the
other medications and she was tachycardic. Labs were significant
for a WBC count of 26.7 (history of chronic leukocytosis) and a
UA suggestive of UTI. There was also a concern in the ED for an
infiltrate on CXR. The pt was treated with levoquin, vancomycin,
and flagyl. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
observation.

ROS:
She denies any chest pain, no change in baseline SOB, except for
morning of admission, when had a feeling of SOB and "tightness"
that was much different and worse than baseline SOB. + gas for
few days prior to admission, + nausea and no emesis. + decreased
PO intake, last BM 1 dat PTA.  no BRBPR, no fevers, chills,
myalgias.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic severe asthma- Pt is on long term steroids.
2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
3. Gait disturbance- Thought to be multifactorial secondary to
peripheral neuropathy, steroid induced myopathy, and
polyradiculopathy.
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Depression
7. History of polysusbstance abuse- Pt used ETOH, cocaine, and
heroin in the past. She has been clean since [**2140**].
8. Hepatitis B
9. H/O duodenal ulcer
10. MGUS
11. Iron deficiency anemia
12. Diverticular disease seen on colonsocopy
13. Type II Diabetes

1. Elavil- Caused confusion.


Social History:
She is an artist. She denies narcotic use in the past 16 years
but has h/o abuse. She has been in a [**Hospital1 1501**] since her recent
admission.

Recent studies:

CXR ([**2155-12-24**]):
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There may be new atelectasis at
the medial aspect of the right lung base but lungs are clear of
any focal lesions of concern. A small-to-moderate-sized hiatus
hernia is air filled. It could be a loop of small bowel
alongside the esophagus. The appearance is unchanged since [**8-18**], [**2152**].

Echo ([**2155-12-16**]):
Normal LVEF of >55%. Normal RV chamber size and free wall
motion. Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS or AR.
Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 1+ TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure. Small pericardial effusion.

MRI Lumbar Spine ([**2155-12-15**]):
Compression fractures at T10, T12, and L1. There is no evidence
of abnormal signal to suggest an acute component. Slight
retropulsion of the superior corner of T10 but this does not
compromise the cord. There is also some retropulsion of the
superior margin of T12 which touches the cord but is not
producing high grade canal stenosis. There is a more recent
compression fracture of the body of L4 which is new compared to
previous exams. There is persistent spondylolisthesis at this
level. Oce again a moderacte canal stenosis. There now is
bilateral neural foramen stenosis. There is no evidence of focal
disc protrusion at any additional level.

MRI Cervical Spine ([**2155-12-17**]):
Images severely degraded by motion artifact. It is impossible to
interpret spinal cord signal intensity. Although the exam is
limited, there is no evidence of spinal cord compression.

MRI Thoracic Spine ([**2155-12-20**]):
T10, T12, and L1 vertebral bodies demostrate compressions as
seen on the previous study. No evidence of increased signal seen
in these vertebral bodies on inversion recovery images
indidicating chronic compressions. There is mild retropulsion at
T11-12 level slightly indenting the thecal sac. No evidence of
high grade spinal stenosis. Mild retrolisthesis and slight
extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord is also seen at T9-10
level. From T1-2 to T8-9 no evidence of disc buldge, herniation,
or spinal stenosis seen. Incidental small hemangiomas are noted
in T3, T4, and T5 vertebral bodies. Spinal cord shows normal
intrinsic signal. Mild disc degenerative changes are seen from
T9-10 to L1-2 level. Incidental finding of a large hiatal
hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 106520**] is a 61 yo with a PMH significant for chronic
hypotension, severe chronic asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and past substance abuse, recently discharged to rehab for back
pain who was readmitted through the ED with suspected
anaphylactic reaction.
.
1. Anaphylactic reaction- Pt's presentation to the ED was most
consistent with an anaphylactic reaction. However, it is unclear
what would have caused this as she had been taking the morphine
SR, Dilaudid, and ibuprofen for quite some time. Her symptoms
had resolved by the time she reached the ICU, but she was kept
for further monitoring and concern for the development of a
delayed reaction. Pt was continued on IV Solu-Medrol and
Benadryl for 14 hours. Oxygen saturation was monitored closely,
and she maintained sats of in range of 93-100%.  Benadryl was
discontinued on the day after admission. IV steroids were also
discontinued and pt was switched to her usual dose of
prednisone. Allergy was consulted and felt that the reaction was
most likely due to NSAIDs.  They felt that the reaction was
either a non-specific histamine release in the setting of
concurrent NSAID and opiate administration or an NSAID
intolerance causing an anaphylactoid reaction. Pt should avoid
all NSAIDs in the future, including acetylated salicylates. If
pt should need to take aspirin, she should be desensitized on a
protocol prior to doing so.  According to the allergist, it is
safe for her to use non-acetylated salicylates such as Disalcid
or choline salicylates.  It is also safe for her to continue to
use Tylenol, oxycodone and ot
