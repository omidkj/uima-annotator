Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Mechanical Valve
[**2177-8-7**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9464**] is a 61 y/o F with PMH notable for severe AS
presenting as transfer from [**Hospital6 6640**] for further
management of worsening dyspnea on exertion. The patient
presented to Sturdy with a 3 week history of worsening dyspnea,
especially with exertion. The patient was feeling more and more
short of breath with minimal activity (such as folding laundry);
of note, she has been quite inactive for some time due to her
MVC in [**1-/2177**] with resultant multiple orthopedic injuries. She
required a long rehab stay and has just recently increased her
activity level. On [**8-2**], she contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS due to worsening
dyspnea; en route to the hospital, she received lasix but was
ultimately intubated in the Sturdy ED due to respiratory
distress. CXR at that time demonstrated pulmonary edema and ? of
pneumonia; she was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin and
briefly required pressors. Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which
demonstrated PCWP of 20; she was diuresed and ultimately
extubated on [**8-3**] without complication.
.
During this time, she ruled in by enzymes for NSTEMI (trop I
14.2) but denied ever having chest pain. Echocardiogram on [**8-4**]
demonstrated severe AS with mean gradient 44 mmHg and valve area
0.6 cm2. LVEF was slightly depressed at 45%. She requested
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care; on arrival, she denies any
difficulty breathing. In fact, she is irritated by the nasal
cannulae at the present time. She denies any chest pain. She has
residual pain in her left clavicle and occasionally in her
sternum due to her numerous prior fractures.

Past Medical History:
Severe aortic stenosis
Prior CVA ([**1-8**])
DM 2 (diagnosed [**2172**])
Carotid endarterectomy ([**5-/2177**])
MVC with multiple injuries including fractured hip s/p repair,
sternal fracture, rib fractures
Gout
Psoriasis
Osteoarthritis
Myocardial infarction

Social History:
The patient lives alone and has two sons in the area who visit
her often. She is a prior smoker but quit following her MVC last
[**Month (only) 1096**]. She does not use alcohol; previously drank only
occasionally. She has been on disability due to back pain since
the [**2140**].

Family History:
Her mother and father both had heart disease with MIs in their
70s.

Pertinent Results:
[**2177-8-7**] Cath: 1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant
circulation demonstrated non-obstructive coronary disease. The
LMCA had minimal disease. The LAD had minimal disease. The LCX
was large with 3 OM branches and non-critical disease. The RCA
had a small 40% proximal lesion. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed normal left and right filling pressures. The mean RA
pressure was 6 mm Hg. The mean PCW pressure was 9 mm Hg.  Fick
CI was slightly low at 2.18 l/min/m2. There was no pulmonary
hypertension. 3. Interrogation of the aortic valve revealed a
mean gradient of 40.03 mmHg with a calculated area of 0.70 cm2.
4. The patient experienced a likely vagal event with hypotension
and bradycardia, treated and resolved following administration
of atropine 1 mg and intravenous fluids.
[**2177-8-8**] CNIS: 1. Occluded right ICA. 2. Hypoechoic left ICA
plaque, no significant associated stenosis however (graded as
less than 40%).
[**2177-8-11**] Head CT: No evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct.
Encephalomalacia changes consistent with chronic infarct of the
left centrum semiovale.
[**2177-8-12**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed. 3. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. 4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm)atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+)mitral regurgitation is seen. Both leaflets are
slightly restricted. Annulus measures 3.6cm in the commisural
axis. Vena contracta is 0.6 -0.7 cm. Systolic blunting is noted
in the pulmonary veins. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study,
the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
phenylephrine andf epinephrine. 1. A well-seated bileaflet valve
is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and
gradients (mean gradient = 20 mmHg). Washing jets are noted.
Leaflets appear to open well. 2. MR is significantly improved
and now is mild in severity. 3. Biventricular systolic function
is improved 4. Aorta and interatrial septum are intact post
decannulation 5. Other findings are unchanged
[**2177-8-15**] CXR: Improved left lower lobe atelectasis, small
bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9464**] is a 61 year old female with known severe aortic
stenosis transferred from OSH after episode of respiratory
distress leading to intubation due to pulmonary edema. She was
extubated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She underwent cardiac
evaluation including cardiac catheterization which confirmed
severe aortic stenosis and clean coronary arteries(see result
section for further detail). Further evaluation included carotid
ultrasound and head CT scan. Carotid ultrasound showed a
complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, with
some hypoechoic plaque/wall thickening involving the left
internal carotid artery
