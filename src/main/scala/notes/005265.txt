History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 yo M with hx of RA, BL claudication, 2vd CAD s/p MI and
arrest [**2185**], old MI, hypercholesterolemia, DM, prostate CA
presenting with VF arrest.  Patient went in to see his PCP for
some [**Name Initial (PRE) **] arm pain (presumably secondary to osteoarthritis) and for
a lab check before starting a medication for RA and was found to
have hyperkalemia with a K of 6.1 (BUN 43, Cr 1.1).  Also WBC
12.9 with left shift, hct 39.5 (baseline).  A CXR showed ? of a
LLL infiltrate.  His EKG showed NSR, Q waves in II, III (old)
and no ST changes.  He was admitted [**3-25**] for monitoring, given
kayexalate, started initially on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
and then continued on azithromycin.  He was monitored on
telemetry and his cardiac enzymes were cycled x3.  On [**2191-3-26**],
his troponin was found to be 0.19 at 8 AM and then 1.3 at 4 PM.
Pateint was started on ASA 325 mg QD.  He had no complaints of
chest pain or other symptoms at that time.  On [**2191-3-26**], a code
blue was activvated at 8:11 PM when the patient was found to be
cyanotic.  Chest compressions were started and he was intubated.
 He was found to be in VF and was shocked with 200 J x 1 with
conversion to SVT w/HR 190s and SBP 200s.  1 minute later, he
was back in VF and was shocked with 300 J into an SVT rhythm in
190s.  Patient was given lopressor IVx 2 with decrease in HR to
95-100.  He was paralyzed with rocuronium and ventilated on AC
TV 500 RR 12 FiO2 60%.  An NGT was placed and bloody fluid was
obtained.  He was also noted to have guaiac + stools.  He was
not considered a candidate for IV heparin or integrillin in
discussion with cardiology.  He was started on IV amiodarone
(bolus 150 mg IV x 1 and then 1 mg/min), plavix 300 mg x1 and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

extracranial carotid systems.
.
[**2190-6-18**] Arterial doppler of LEs: moderate decrease in arterial
flow to the RLE at rest at the level of the aorto-iliac.  mild
decrease to the LLE at rest at the runoff level.  Dorsalis pedis
appears to be occluded.  When compared to the previous study
from [**2189-12-18**], there has been a decrease in arterial flow to the
RLE and the L dorsalis pedis is now occluded.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2191-3-31**] 9:51 AM
HISTORY: Left axillary vein puncture for ICD lead placement.
Please check.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-29**] and 22:

A new transvenous pacer defibrillator from the left axillary
power pack follows the expected course to the right ventricular
apex, proximal electrode dense from the left brachiocephalic
vein to the SVC. Lateral view shows small bilateral pleural
effusion, right greater than left, which could have been present
on the earlier films and is not likely to represent hemothorax
related to lead placement. There is no pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic and
unchanged. Lungs are grossly clear.

Healed left clavicle fracture and pleural thickening along the
lower costal pleural margin adjacent to chronic fractures
indicate prior chest trauma.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with h/o HL, DM, CAD s/p IMI and VF arrest in [**2174**] p/w
VF arrest s/p NSTEMI.  The following is a summary of his
hospital course by problem.
.
Cardiac:
#. Ischemia - The patient has a long CAD history with an IMI and
VF arrest in [**2174**] and with recent stenting of occluded LCX in
[**2188**].  EKG with new TWI in aVL.  Peak CK at 162, MB 11.  NG tube
with ? guaiac +, bloody aspirate at OSH, so he did not receive
integrillin and heparin drip on admission.  Given his prior
history of ARF with contrast, he was given mucomyst and bicarb
prior to receiving his catheterization.  Cardiac cath showed
unchanged coronary anatomy with a 50% tapering distal LMCA
lesion, mild luminal irregularities in the LAD with maximum 30%
obstruction, patent LCX stents with mild OM2 disease, and a
totally occluded RCA in its mid course with the distal vessel
filling by left to right collaterals.  He was continued on ASA,
Plavix and titrated up on metoprolol to Metoprolol XL 225 QD.
He was also continued on lipitor, gemfibrozil and niacin, and
found to have an LDL 37.  He was restarted on his home dose of
accupril and norvasc.
.
#. Pump - Patient's BNP at the OSH was 197.  An admission chest
X-ray showed mild CHF and small bilateral pleural effusions.
His LVEDP at cath was elevated at 17 with a LVEF 51% and very
mild hypokinessis.  A TTE showed EF 45-50%, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  He autodiuresed and was started on
metoprolol XL 225 QD and continued on accupril 20 QD.
.
#. Rhythm - Patient s/p VF arrest, then in SVT wi
