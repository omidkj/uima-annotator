History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year-old male with a distant history of a Bilroth
II procedure and recently diagnosed cholelithiasis who presents
with acute cholecystitis and possible choledocholithiasis who is
being transferred from [**Hospital6 19155**] for ERCP.
Frequent upper abdominal pains recently. Recent ER visit with US
showing cholelithiasis and thickened GB wall with slight dilated
CBD and dilated PD. LFTs showed t bili of 3.1 with direct 1.4
but no fever, chills, jaundice or bloody stools prior to
admission at OSH. At OSH had fevers and chills and brief
diarrhea but no nasuea or vomiting. Last bowel movement he
recalls was last Saturday (5 days ago). He thinks he has passed
small amounts of flatus but he is not sure.
.
Admitted [**12-23**] to OSH. LFTs trended down and he was scheduled for
cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed [**2146-12-26**]
which was "challenging with empyema of the gallbladder
encountered with both acute and chronic cholecystitis".
Intraoperative cholangiogram performed which showed markedly
dilated CBD and intrahepatic duct with 6-7 2-3mm gallstones in
the distal CBD which did not flush. Duct ligated and gallbladder
removed.
.
Post operatively he developed wheezing and a CXR showed probably
RLL infiltrate c/w possible aspiration PNA. He was started on
DuoNebs with good affect. Overnight he became more confused and
had worsening abdominal pain which they treated with Demoral
without good affect but which responded to ativan. The next
morning (the morning of transfer) a CXR showed ongoing RLL
infiltrate with possible cephalization and so he was diuresed
with almost 2L output.
.
On arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was in visible discomfort, tachypneic,
and complaining of RUQ pain which was worth with deep breathing.
VSS and as noted below.
.
ROS:
(+) +RUQ pain worse with inspiration, +R shoulder pain, +mild
SOB x2 days, +mild cough x 2 days, +diarrhea (brief, nonbloody,
resolved, last episode ~5 days ago), +no bowel movement x5 days

(-) The patient denies any nausea, vomiting, current diarrhea,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity edema, dysuria.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous predominantly fluid collection in the
gallbladder fossa
measuring 9.3 x 5 x 6.9 cm. The JP drain has displaced and is no

draining this collection.
2. Subcapsular hepatic fluid.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis.
4. Possible high-density material seen in the distal CBD
consistent with
stones. Recommended correlation with ERCP.
5. Calcification of the aorta and coronary arteries.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Probable mild diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Trivial pericardial effusion without echo

CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Status post ERCP. Evaluation for interval changes.

COMPARISON: [**2147-12-28**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Minimal interstitial pulmonary edema, associated with a
minimal right
pleural effusion and a mild degree of left and right basal areas
of
atelectasis. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No newly
appeared
focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the medicine service on
[**2147-12-27**]. He underwent a CT scan that showed a 9x5cm biloma and
perihepatic fluid c/w bile leak. He was started on broad
spectrum atbx with vanc/zosyn. On [**12-28**], the patient underwent
percutaneous drainage of his biloma and drain was left in place.
His lab values were improving and his LFTs began to trend down.
On [**12-29**], patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and
extraction of stones from the CBD. A pancreatic stent was
placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient's
diet was then changed to clears, and advanced as tolerated to
regular diet. The patient was transferred to the floor on HD 4.
His pain was much improved and he was tolerating regular diet.
His foley was dc'd on HD4, and patient voided without problem.
His [**Name2 (NI) **] continued to trend down and all cultures were negative.
He was transitioned to po pain meds, and restarted on his home
medications as well. Vanc/zosyn were discontinued and patient
was switched to unasyn on [**2147-12-30**]. He will be sent home with 3
days of augmentin to complete a 1wk course of atbx. On day of
discharge, patient's JP drain was removed, but new pigtail drain
was left in place. Of note, the patient did have increased work
of breathing upon admission with SOB/dyspnea. Crackles and
diffuse wheeze were heard in the RLL and CXR showed some
consolidation in that area. Patient was started on nebulizer
treatments and adequate pain control was started to minimize
splinting. ECHO was performed to rule out heart failure, and
this study was normal. Patient's breathing continued to improve
during his stay, and he was saturating well on RA at time of
discharge with no complaints of dyspnea.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
