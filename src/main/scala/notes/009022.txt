Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 66561**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of arterial line

History of Present Illness:
60 yo F with h/o HTN, CVA, bipolar, depression transferred from
[**Hospital1 1474**] for SOB and new LBBB.  Patient was apparently doing
well 2 weeks ago, when she visited her PCP and had an EKG which
was reportedly normal.  Patient was found at home by son very
lethargic, diaphoretic with labored breathing.  Called ambulance
and was brought to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital.  She was initially
responsive to questions and denied chest pain.  Pupils were
found to be 3mm bilaterally, she had rales in her lungs.  She
was given 40 mg IV lasix, NTG SL x 1, placed on a nonrebreather
and then she became unresponsive and unarousable.  She was
intubated for airway protection with etomidate and succinyl
choline and vecuronium.  An EKG showed a new LBBB, Trop I 6.0
(0-1.4) CK 282, MB 23.7 (0-5),K 6.4.  At the OSH, she was given
protonix, bicarb, kayexalate, ativan 2 mg, ASA, lopressor,
heparin.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt.  In the
ED, she was given ASA and continued on heparin drip.  Patient's
family does not want aggressive management and would not want
her to be receive a cath.  They would like her to be DNR, but
continue her intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo F with h/o HTN, CVA, bipolar, depression transferred from
[**Hospital1 1474**] with fever, RLL pneumonia, new LBBB.
.
Brief hospital course by system:
.
Pt expressed wish to be extubated, and to not be reintubated,
even if she were to go into respiratory failure.  Her family
agreed.  Pt was extubated at 2 PM on [**2144-3-26**], and did well for 1
hr, until her O2 sat dropped to 77% FM.  ABG 7.16/86/60/32, CXR
showed likely mucus plug in RLL and washout.  Pt was placed on
CPAP with increase of O2 sat to 100%.  Pt expressed wish to have
CPAP removed, and family agreed.  Family wished to make patient
comfortable on a morphine gtt, and pt passed away surrounded by
family on [**2144-3-26**] at 5:30 PM.
.
Cardiac:
#. Ischemia - On admission, the patient's EKG was found to have
Q waves in III and aVF, V1-V3 which were found to be old in
comparison with her EKG from [**6-28**]. She did have a new LBBB, and
a bedside echo showed EF 15-20%.  The family stated at the time
that they did not want cardiac catheterization, and that the
patient should be DNR.  She was admitted to the CCU and
continued on aspirin, heparin and lipitor, and started on
metoprolol which was held until the following morning for blood
pressure < 100.  Her cardiac enzymes were trended, and she was
found to have a peak CK of 292, MB 22, Trop 0.47 trending down
to CK 199, MB 10, Trop 0.19, suggesting a demand-related NSTEMI.
 On HD2, her LBBB was found to be rate related on tele
