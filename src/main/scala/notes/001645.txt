IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities,
greater on the left than right, probably attributable to
atelectasis, but not entirely specific.

If pulmonary symptoms are present or other concern for
pneumonia, than when clinically appropriate, short-term followup
chest radiographs, preferably with standard PA and lateral
technique if possible, could be considered

PENDING

Brief Hospital Course:
85 M w/ hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, afib, CVA w/ residual R sided
weakness who presented from [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] with hypotension.

#Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the ED
however  BP normalized with one liter of IVF. BP normal upon
presentation to ICU (last admission BP normalized to approx
100-110 systolic). Hypotension was felt to most likely be
secondary to hypovolemia as the patient had no clear e/o
infection (WBC normal, no fevers). He was continued on
vancomycin and levofloxacin initially. The patients blood
pressure remained stable and he remained afebrile and was
transferred to the general medical service.  Thereafter, BP were
normal with the exception of one event during hemodialysis; this
episode of hypotension was attributed to not taking midodrine
prior to hemodialysis as the patient normally does.  The patient
declined further labs and ECHO and requested discharge to home.
As the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, the
antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was discharged
home.

STABLE ISSUES

#ESRD on HD: Patient is dialyzed on a MWF schedule. He had
missed [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] on the day of admission. As above blood pressure
stabilized and he was dialyzed on HD 1 and 3. He was also
continued on his home phosphate binder.

#Hx of CAD: no e/o active ischemia. No EKG changes.  A cardiac
evaluation for heart failure was attempted; troponin 0.05 but
the patient declined further cardiac biomarkers and ECHO.
Patient was continued on his home statin and ASA.

# Atrial Fibrillation- Patient has a known hx of a fib in the
past. He is not currently anti-coagulated due to frequent falls.
 His was intermittently in atrial fib throughout this admission.
 However HR remained stable in the 80s-90s.

#Pulm Htn: noted TTE from [**2128-1-20**]. Has OSA but is not currently
on CPAP. No e/o heart failure on exam.
