Studies:

[**8-23**] TTE: EF=40%, multiple wma
Head CT: large right MCA stroke

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female, with multiple medical problems, s/p MI and large R
CVA, who failed extubation, was made CMO due to poor prognosis,
and passed away comfortably.

1. Respiratory failure: known cancer metastatic, likely lung Ca
despite BAL neg with mass on cxr.  Now with likely pneumonia.
ABG on MICU admission with extremely acidemic [**12-28**] anion gap
metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, likely respir distress
[**12-28**] inability to compensate with respirations from underlying
disease.  Also with RLL pna on cxr, on levaquin/flagyl, 7-day
course; Pt extubated, did well initially, then was reintubated
for increased work of breathing.  Need for reintubation thought
to be [**12-28**] pulmonary edema/chf (as pt s/p new MI).  Pt was made
CMO by family after prognosis was discussed. Pt passed away on
[**8-27**].

2. NonAnion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: AG 27 on MICU admission,
likely [**12-28**] Acute MI with spilled lactate.  Intubation allowing
for respiratory compensation.  Lactate and ABG improving.
[**Name (NI) 24995**] pt was initially extubated, was reintubated for
increased work of breathing, eventually made CMO before she
passed away.

3. Malaise/Neuro
- Antiemetics PRN for nausea
- Likely [**12-28**] myocardial ischemia- repeat EKG showed improved ST
changes lateral precordium. Pt to get MRI/MRA [**8-25**]; CT showed
large stroke of R-MCA/right posterior parietal and pt with left
hemineglect.  Will ck more thorough neuro exam when pt
completely alert.  What will be her prognosis for regaining
function?  Can she handle her secretions post-extubation.  After
pt was reintubated, neuro recommended Carotid duplex if
aggressive workup was pursued, but pt was made CMO, and expired.

4. + cardiac markers and tachypnea: Large lateral V5 and V6 ST
depressions on primary EKG. Tachypnea noted on exam though pt
denied SOB, O2 sats high 90s on minimal O2 (2L). Pt thought to
have had a large MI by cardiac markers, EKG changes.  EF showed
decreased systolic function (EF=40%).  When pt was extubated,
she had increased pulmonary edema/chf (likely [**12-28**] to the
pressure effects of extubation on preload and afterload).
Re-extubation was thought to be an unlikely possibility given
her cardiac status.  Family did not want to pursue aggressive
measures (cardiac cath/CABG), she was made CMO, and passed away.


5. Hypotension: likely cardiogenic shock, on levophed.  Goal CVP
15 (given it may be falsely elevated given pulm htn); will give
fluids (and blood products as necessary).  Pt now with A-line.
Goal SBP>120 given recent stroke.  BP stable now off pressors.
Pt failed extubation as above.

6. Sinus tach: unclear etiology, afebrile, denies pain, no
pulsus. Is anxious. [**Month (only) 116**] have PE given ca hx, but given CXR and
phys exam will diurese first, if no improvement, consider CTA
(again question if we would heparinize).  Now stable.

7. Cancer: No treatment now, pt has declined treatment in the
past.

8. Leukocytosis: 79% neutrophils. [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] follow for now. RLL
pna on cxr. On levaquin and flagyl; WBC is coming down and pt
afebrile; will monitor.  7-day empiric course levo/flagyl

9.  Anemia: Pt with low hct; guaiac negative; are cking
hemolysis labs as well as B12/folate; c/w ACD; will transfuse
for goal>30

10. GERD: PPI

11. FEN: Nutrition c/s. Tube feeds.
12. Proph: PPI, SQH; Constipation: bowel meds
13. Code: Pt was initially full code as per her wishes.  After
she failed extubation, prognosis was discussed with her family,
and she was made CMO.  Pt was extubated, put on a morphine drip,
and she passed away comfortably on [**8-27**].
