CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 40865**] is a 56-year-old
woman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
[**2102**], also longstanding type 1 diabetes, who was in her usual
state of poor health in which she generally just stays in bed
or sits in a chair until two weeks prior to presentation when she
began experiencing chest pain. The patient experienced frequent
episodes of chest pressure up to several times a week lasting up
to 10-15 minutes, but resolving with nitroglycerin.

usual angina, which she describes as a "pressure in the
middle of her chest, at rest".  She took one sublingual
nitroglycerin which relieved the pressure.  However, the
patient's chest pressure returned 30 minutes later, but was again
relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  The discomfort
appeared for a third time, at this time it was a sharp and
sternal chest pain not relieved with nitroglycerin and then
she presented to the [**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency Department.

At no point did she experience any shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  In the
[**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency Department, she was found to have ST
elevations in lead III, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in aVL, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
depression in V3 and V4.  She also had Q waves in V1 and V2
and slight prolonged Q-T interval.  At the outside hospital,
she was treated with 50 mg of Lopressor intravenously, and
made pain free with 10 mg of morphine sulfate.  She was then
treated with aspirin, Aggrastat, nitroglycerin drip, and Heparin
drip.  She remained pain free and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post angioplasty in [**2097**],
myocardial infarction in [**2097**] and [**2102**].
2. Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine uncertain.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 1 x47 years complicated by
retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
4. Depression.
5. Toe amputations of all five digits on the left.
6. Chronic anemia uncertain hematocrit at baseline.
7. Essential tremor.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2. Insulin 10 units of regular q am, 20 units of NPH q am, 24
units of N q pm.  She is on a regular sliding scale at
dinner.
3. Lasix 80 mg po q day.
4. Zoloft 50 mg po q day.
5. Lipitor 50 mg po q day.
6. Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.
7. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
8. Iron sulfate 325 mg po q day.
9. Vitamin C.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim and Biaxin.  She becomes nauseous to both
of those drugs.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Of note, the patient spends most of her
time in bed, though will transfer to a chair.  She is unable
to walk secondary to weakness and shortness of breath with
minimal exertion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon presentation to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit, the patient had the following vital
signs:  Her temperature is 97.8, blood pressure 107/55, heart
rate 76 and regular.  She is breathing 16.  Sating 88% on
room air, 100% on nonrebreather at 10 liters.  GENERAL:  She
is lying in bed with a nonrebreather.  She can speak in full
sentences in no acute distress.  She has a resting tremor of
her right foot and left hand.  HEENT:  She has no vision in
her right eye.  Her left eye has decreased vision with
surgical pupils.  She is anicteric.  Her oropharynx is clear
and dry.  NECK:  No bruits, no jugular venous distention
appreciated at 45 degrees.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Respiratory crackles bilaterally to 1/3 up on the
right, 1/2 up on the left.  No wheezes or rhonchi.  ABDOMEN:
Soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Five toe amputee on the left, no edema.  She
had Doppler DP pulses bilaterally and 1+ femoral pulses
bilaterally.  NEUROLOGICAL:  She is alert and oriented times
three.  She is moving all extremities symmetrically despite
the tremor.  She has this resting tremor in the right foot
and left hand.  She has decreased sensation of both feet to 2
cm above the ankle to light touch.

LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had the following
laboratories at the outside hospital:  She had a complete
blood count which had a white blood cell count of 10.1,
hematocrit of 32.2, MCV of 90, and platelets of 248.  She had
74% polys, 21% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes.  PT 12.2, PTT 20.6,
an INR of 1.0.

Her chemistry is as follows:  She had a sodium of 133,
potassium of 5.1, chloride 98, bicarb 22, BUN 51, creatinine
2.0, baseline not certain, and a glucose of 513.  Her enzymes
at the outside hospital were as follows:  She had a CK of
149, CK MB of 4.7, index of 3.2, and troponin less than 0.3.

She had a chest x-ray which showed bibasilar opacities.
Heart size within normal limits.

Of note, she had cardiac catheterization in [**2103-6-8**] at
[**Hospital3 **], which showed three-vessel disease.  She had
diffuse disease in the proximal right coronary artery with a
90% mid right coronary artery lesion and diffuse disease in
the other vessels.  She had an echocardiogram in [**6-7**] which
showed an ejection fraction of 45-50%.

Upon arrival here, her laboratories were as follows:  She had
a white blood cell count of 11.3, hematocrit of 27.9,
platelets of 241.  PT 15.3, PTT 140.9, INR 1.5.  Sodium 141,
potassium 4.7, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 51, and
creatinine of 1.7, and glucose was 343, calcium 7.8,
magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 4.3.  Her CK had risen to 377.  CK
MB to 44.  Her index showed 11.7 and troponin increased to
37.8.  Her hemoglobin was 7.4.  She had a urinalysis which
showed trace blood, negative nitrates, traced glucose,
negative protein, negative ketones, and trace leukocyte
esterase, [**3-11**] red blood cells, and [**6-16**] white blood cells,
many bacteria, and 0-2 epi's.  Her urine electrolytes showed
a sodium of 88, creatinine of 49, potassium of 36, and osms
of 410.  Of note, she had a peak CK of 1,112, which declined
to 692.

Her electrocardiogram was notable for resolution of the ST
elevation in III the day after admission.

She underwent cardiac catheterization which shows the
following:  She had severe three vessel coronary artery
disease, severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  Her
left main was diffusely diseased.  The left anterior descending
artery was diffusely diseased throughout with 90% lesion at D2.
She had diffusely diseased proximal left circumflex lesion and a
subtotal occlusion of the right coronary artery at the mid vessel
with left to right collaterals.

She in addition, she had a transthoracic echocardiogram during
this admission which demonstrated the following:  She had
anterior akinesis with inferobasilar and  inferolateral
hypokinesis.  Her left ventricular ejection fraction was
likely unchanged from her [**2102**] study which demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50%.  Of note, she had a normal TSH
in addition, and she grew Gram-negative rods, Klebsiella
pansensitive from her urine cultures greater than 100,000
colonies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  The patient from a pump standpoint, had
severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with an
estimated ejection fraction of 45-50%.  She remained slightly
fluid overloaded during her hospital stay and was gently
diuresed.  This was done carefully given the patient's
tenuous blood sugar control and her tendency to tip into
diabetic ketoacidosis very easily.

Otherwise, her blood pressure remained systolic between
90-130 during her hospital stay.  She was started on a beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor, and tolerated both of these
medications well.

From a rhythm standpoint, the patient remained in normal
sinus rhythm following her transfer from Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit to the floor.  She had a known artifact on her
Telemetry which mimicked monomorphic V-tach with an essence
of an artifact from her essential tremor.  She had no other
arrhythmias.

Coronary artery disease:  As mentioned previously, the
patient had a catheterization which showed triple vess
