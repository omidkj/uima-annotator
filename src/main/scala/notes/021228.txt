Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy with cauterization of bleeding vessel
PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old anaesthesiologist with history of CABG, esophageal
strictures/dismotility, HTN, and CHF with EF 45% presenting with
mahogany stools.  The week prior to admission he began to feel a
sense of weakness, fatigue, and dizziness.  He stopped taking
his ASA, also had been on Advil for sore foot a week prior.  He
started noticing melanic stools the morning prior to admission.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] where his HCT was found to be 20
from a baseline of 29.  He had no nausea or hematemesis.  At the
[**Hospital1 46**] ICU his HCT went to 22 after 3 units PRBCs.  He has
gotten 3 more units PRBCs prior to arrival in the MICU for a
total of 6 units.  He has had 4 bloody BMs today.  The GI
physicians at Jordans were hesitant to scope him given his
esophageal stricture so he was transfered here for EGD.  His
last colonoscopy was [**11/2133**] which showed diffuse
diverticulosis.
Currently he has no chest pain, he had some abdominal pain
earlier today which has resolved with Fentanyl.  He has no
shortness of breath, no nausea.  He does note a 20 lb weight
loss over the last few months with no change in diet.  He has no
edema, no orthopnea, no PND.

Past Medical History:
1. Esophageal dismotility - treated with botox injections,
eventually requiring PEG placement 5 years ago.
2. Esophageal stricture - unable to pass pediatric endoscopy
tube without dilation
3. Paroxismal atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for
tachy brady syndrome
4. Ischemic heart disease s/p CABG '[**18**]
5. Aortic stenosis
6. Mitral regurgitation
7. CRI, baseline creatinine 1.6
8. HTN
9. CHF with EF 45%
10. Bladder tumor

Social History:
Retired anesthesiologist who worked for 40 years at [**Hospital1 3325**].  Currently leading very active life.  Golfs 3X per

.
echo:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal and apical hypokinesis as well as basal inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EGD report [**1-12**]:
Fresh blood was found in the duodenal bulb and second portion of
the duodenum. A clot was seen with active bleeding in the second
portion of the duodenum. After 20 cc of 1:10,000 epinephrine was
injected in the area with successful hemostasis, what appears
like a single cratered ulcer with a visible vessel was seen in
the second part of the duodenum. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied for hemostasis successfully.
Impression: Blood in the stomach Ulcer in the second part of the
duodenum
Recommendations: Protonix 40mg IV BID Continue serial hct. Avoid
NSAIDs.
.
EGD report [**1-15**]:
Previous single ulcer was found in the duodenum s/p bicap with
question of minimal oozing. Impression: Duodenal ulcer
PEG placed.


Brief Hospital Course:
While in MICU, patient transfused 4 more units PRBCs.  GI
consulted, underwent EGD through PEG tube site given esophageal
stricture.  Found to have blood in bulb and 2nd part of
duodenum.  A clot with active bleeding was also found,
hemostasis achieved w/ epi and electrocautery.  Hct decreased
from 37-30.8 throughout the day yesterday, now stable at 30-31.
No further episodes of melena.
.
On transfer to the medicine floor, the patient felt somewhat
improved, denied chest pain or shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, or light-headedness.  His hematocrit was monitored every 6
hours, and he was transfused 1 more unit overnight given that it
had decreased from 30 to 27, with an appropriate increase the
following day.  GI decided to re-scope him to ensure no further
bleeding, the previous lesion had some slight ooze, but did not
require any intervention.  A PEG tube was placed without
complication.  The patient was continued on the PPI [**Hospital1 **], and did
not have any further episodes of melena or guaiac positive
stool.  His hematocrit remained stable.  He was provided with
PPN given that he was NPO, and tube feeds were initiated once
his PEG was placed.  He was provided IVF and free water boluses
through the PEG tube to help correct his hypernatremia.
Additionally, he noted to have right foot pain on the day prior
to discharge.  Plain films were obtained, which suggested gout.
Treatment was discussed, but deferred for now as the patient did
not feel that his pain was intolerable, and he felt it was
improving.  Prior to discharge, his ACE was also restarted to
ensure that his blood pressure would tolerate this.
He was evaluated by PT prior to discharge and cleared for a safe
discharge home.  He was provided a script for Protonix, but
instructed to substitute Prilosec if unable to afford the
Protonix.  He will follow-up with his PCP after discharge, and
was reminded to avoid all aspirin and NSAIDs.
