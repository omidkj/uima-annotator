Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
diagnostic thoracentesis [**2164-9-28**]

History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with history of HTN, CAD, COPD who presented to
[**Hospital6 3105**] on [**9-22**] with fatigue and positional
dyspnea.
Of note, the patient had been discharged from [**Hospital3 **]
approximately two weeks before after a hospitalization for
pneumonia. During that hospitalization the patient had remarked
on hemoptysis and chest imaging revealed a right middle lobe
lesion. He had a broncheoalveolar lavage during that
hospitalization and was discharged. In the interim between the
two hospitalizations, pathology of the cells from the lavage
revealed cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. This
unfortunately was not conveyed to the patient or family.
Upon the patient's second presentation on the 16th he was
diagnosed again with pneumonia; started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin. He received bronchodilators for presumed COPD and
was diuresed with furosemide 40 mg IV BID. Unfortunately,
despite these measures the patient's work of breathing remained
high and he continued to tire so that he was intubated on [**9-23**].
The patient's family was informed of his lung cancer diagnosis
after he was intubated. On [**2164-9-25**] the patient was extubated.
His effusion has been somewhat controlled on furosemide [**Hospital1 **] and
he has been satting reasonably well on [**1-11**] L of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  Of note, vancomycin was discontinued once blood,
urine, and sputum cultures returned without growth.
On the request of his family he is being transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further work up and management of his lung
cancer.  Currently, the patient appears in mild distress but
denies shortness of breath or pain. He denies any particular
complaints.


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p MI eight years ago, managed with PTCA
-Hemorrhagic Stroke w/ craniotomy [**10/2162**] complicated by
recurrent bleed and seizure approximately 6 mos later
-HTN
-COPD


Social History:
He is retired from working on missile systems for [**Company 2676**]. He
smoked approximately two packs per day between at least age 18
and 65, stopped for six years and then restarted at about a pack
per day for the last two. (Overall >90 pack years). He denies
any history of heavy alcohol use. No drugs. He lives with his
wife in [**Name (NI) 7661**].

Family History:
Mother died of laryngeal cancer, Father died of leukemia

Imaging:
Liver U/S:
1. Suboptimal visualization of the left hepatic lobe, limiting
evaluation.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of hepatic
metastasis.
2. Right pleural effusion.
3. Bilateral renal cysts

OSH Echocardiogram ([**2164-9-24**])
IMPRESSION:
1 LV EF 60% w/ nl wall motion
2. Normal RV systolic function
3. Mild circumferential pericardial effusion
4. No transvalvul gradients or significant regurgitations
OSH CTA Chest ([**2164-9-22**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of PE, exam limited by motion
2. Large R perihilar mass, which is probably maligannt,
associated mediastinal and R hilar adenopathy
3. Moderate R pleural effusion with substantial atelectasis of
the right lower lobe
4. Probably post-obstructive pneumonia in the right upper lobe
OSH Bilateral LENI's ([**2164-9-22**])
IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study, no evidence of DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. male with significant smoking history and recent
diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic
respiratory failure thought due to post-obstructive pneumonia
and volume overload now improving. The acute hypoxic respiratory
failure was believed to be multifactorial etiologies due to
obstructive lung cancer, compressive atelectasis due to large
pleural effusion, possible postobstructive PNA and very poor
pulmonary reserve due to underlying lung disease. Upon admission
to [**Hospital1 18**], patient appearred to be overall improving following
extubation, but still had significant work of breathing with
accessory muscle use.  He was continued on levofloxacin.  Chest
imaging revealed moderate right pleural effusions, as well as a
large right-sided perihilar mass with encasement of the trachea,
proximal portion of the right main bronchus, the right main
pulmonary artery, the right brachiocephalic vessel, and the
esophagus.  A few cc of fluid were aspirated by bedside
thoracentesis.  Hematology/oncology was consulted and discussed
treatment options to consider only after the patient recovered
from his critical illness.

Overnight on the night of [**9-28**], the patient had respiratory
arrest requiring intubation.  He also developed pulseless
electrical activity, requiring resuscitation with epi and
atropine. He had return of spontaneous circulation, but remained
intubated. Discussions were held between the MICU team and the
patient's wife and three children, when it was decided that the
patient clearly did not want to remain on artificial life
support for a prolonged period of time. His goals of care were
changed to focus on his comfort. He was terminally extubated and
passed away soon after, with his family at his bedside.
