[**2159-4-7**] CT head w/out contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left subdural collection of uniform low density, likely
represents a
subdural hygroma or chronic subdural hematoma with mild
rightward shift of
midline structures.
2. Prominent extra-axial space overlying the right frontal lobe
mixed density between intermediate and lower density suggesting
a subdural hematoma which is likely either subacute or older.

[**2159-4-7**] CT spine w/out contrast:
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment. Stable
degenerative changes.  Dilated esophagus and small left pleural
effusion, also better evaluated on chest CT.

[**2159-4-7**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/out contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple displaced comminuted left-sided rib fractures with a
left-sided pleural effusion and small foci of air which are
loculated in the pleural or extrapleural space near the
fractures and also along the outer chest wall, although there is
no substantial pneumothorax at this time.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Dilated esophagus suggesting an abnormality of motility.
4. Mildly prominent left supraclavicular lymph node, probably
reactive.

[**2159-4-7**] Left femur xray (AP & LAT), pelvis xray (AP only):
IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting prior injury. Bilateral total
hip
replacements, which appear intact.

[**2159-4-7**] HUMERUS (AP & LAT) LEFT; ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT;
SHOULDER 1 VIEW LEFT
FINDINGS: The bones appear demineralized. Left-sided rib
fractures are
better characterized on CT torso examination from the same day.
There is no evidence for fracture, dislocation, or bone
destruction involving the
shoulder, humeral shaft or elbow. At the elbow, there is
prominent calcified enthesiopathy along both the medial and
lateral epicondyles.
IMPRESSION: Left-sided rib fractures, better characterized on CT
imaging of the same day.

[**2159-4-7**] ECG
Normal sinus rhythm with marked intra-atrial conduction
abnormality. Left
anterior hemiblock. Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary
repolarization abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. Abnormal
tracing. No previous tracing available for comparison.

fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted initially to the ICU under the acute care
service for monitoring. Her imaging was reviewed and neurosurgey
was consulted for her SDH. It was determined that her head CT
findings were not acute, and that findings were consistent with
L frontal lobe SDH vs. hygroma without mass effect and R chronic
SDH. She remained without neurologic defecits, and no
intervention was needed. It was determined she was safe to start
on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin. She was scheduled for
neurosurgery follow up and a repeat head CT prior to discharge.

Of note, cardiac enzymes were cycled on admission given the fall
and patient's cardiac history. Troponins were slightly elevated
at 0.02, 0.02 and 0.04; however this was in the setting of
chronic renal insufficiency and elevated creatinine (1.7-1.9).
ECG was obtained as well which showed normal sinus rhythm with
marked intra-atrial conduction abnormality but no evidence of
acute myocardial infarction or ischemia. She remained without
chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or syncopal
symptoms.

She was admitted on a regular diet. She was also started on a
bowel regimen given her decreased mobility and administration of
narcotics. She was noted to have no repsiratory issues. She has
a known EF of 20% so her fluid status was watched closely. After
being monitored overnight in the ICU wihtout any issues she was
transferred to the floor on HD #1.

On the floor her vital signs were routinely monitored and she
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her oxygen
saturations remained within normal limits on room air. Her home
cardiac medications were restarted including her plavix,
metoprolol, aspirin, and lasix; however, her spironolactone was
held due to persisent mild hyperkalemia 5.5 on admission (5.0 at
discharge). Her electrolytes were monitored and repleted as
needed. Her pain medications were adjusted to adequately control
her pain level and ensure her ability to use incentive
spirometry. She was also started on standing nebulizer
treatments to optimize her respiratory function. Her neuro
status remained unchanged.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted to
assess her mobility and safety given her injuries and history of
falls, who recommended to discharge a rehab facility when
medically cleared.

On [**2159-4-10**] she is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her pain
is well controlled and she is tolerating a regular diet and
making adequate amounts of urine. She is being discharged to a
rehab fa
