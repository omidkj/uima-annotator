Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hemiparesis, aphasia

Intra-arterial tPA


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 yo woman with PMH of HTN who arrived as a
code stroke transferred from an OSH.  Per her daughter, she was
last ween well at 1600.  Daughter then returned home at 1840 and
found patient with some difficulty speaking and complaining that
her right leg was giving out on her.  She was, however, actually
able
to stand.  She was taken to an OSH where she was found to have a
dense left MCA sign.  She was then transferred.

STUDIES:
CTA/CTP:
CT-perfusion of the head/CTA head and neck; [**2152-11-3**] 8:49 pm: On
non-contrast study, there is a hypodense left MCA representing
occlusion from a M1 segment.  There is slight decrease of the
attenuation in the left basal ganglia.  There is no evidence of
acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.

On CT angiography, there is a left ICA occlusion involving
almost entire
length from bifurcation.  There is heavily calcified
atherosclerotic plaque at the bilateral bifurcations.  The right
ICA is narrowed approximately 60% just above the bifurcation.

There is an abrupt cut-off of left MCA at the origin of M1
segment, consistent thrombus.  All M2 branches are opacified.
The rest of the intracranial vessels are unremarkable.

On perfusion study, there is an increase of mean transit time in
the left MCA territory with slight decrease of blood volume and
the flow, suggesting the possibility of reversibility of
ischemia except in basal ganglia region.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute left MCA occlusion from M1 segment . Perfusion study
suggests the possibility of reversibility of ischemia.
2.  Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with plaques and narrowing
at bilateral carotid bifurcation.  Complete occlusion of left
ICA.
3. Severe emphysema.

<br>
NCHCT [**2152-11-8**] 12:19 am:  The patient is status post tPA and
angiogram.  Hyperdensity along the falx and layering over the
tentorium may reflect prior contrast administration.  New 1.9 x
0.6 cm hyperdensity in the left basal ganglia may represent
hemorrhage or enhancment status post angiography.  There is no
shift of the normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.  An
air fluid level in the left maxillary sinus and opacification of
the nasal cavity is likely secondary to intubation.

IMPRESSION: New 1.9 x 0.6 cm hyperdensity in the left basal
ganglia
representing contrast enhancement vs hemorrhage.  Interval
follow-up is
warranted.

<br>
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2152-11-9**] 8:13 am:  Comparison was made
with a prior head CT dated [**11-9**] and 19, [**2151**].  Previously
noted high attenuation in the left basal ganglia is less
conspicuous and more ill-defined compared to the prior study,
with persistent vague areas of high attenuation without
significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structure.
There is no other area of hemorrhage.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation is preserved on nonconrast CT. The appearance of
the ventricles are unchanged and it is symmetric without
hydrocephalus.  There is mild bifrontal cortical atrophy.

There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary and
ethmoid sinuses. Frontal sinuses are not pneumatized.  The
surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  Less conspicuous and more ill-defined appearance of
left basal ganglia high density compared to the study 8 hours
ago, likely representing diliuting IV contrast in the area of
infarct, rather than hemorrhage. MRI will help to further
evaluate the finding.

<br>
Cerebral angiogram [**2152-11-8**]: IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8389**] underwent
emergent stenting of  a left internal carotid artery and
mechanical chemical thrombolysis of left MCA with complete
recanalization.

<br>
EKG [**2152-11-8**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Inferior ST
segment depressions. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

<br>
TTE [**2152-11-9**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The
left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%) and the estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Hyperdynamic
left ventricular systolic function. No significant valvular
disease seen.
