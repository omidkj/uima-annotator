CXR [**2121-4-14**]:
SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are
low, there is new obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm which
is concerning for infectious airspace consolidation. There are
numerous pulmonary nodules from metastatic disease throughout
the chest, in the right hilar, and left upper and lower lobes.
Hilar adenopathy is better apreciated on recent CT. There is
moderate right pleural effusion and new bibasilar atelectasis.
The aortic arch is heavily calcified. Sclerotic foci seen in the
upper thoracic vertebral bodies on prior CT are not as well
appreciated. Left chest pacing device terminates with two intact
leads in unchanged positions.

IMPRESSION:
1. New right pleural effusion, and right greater than left
atelectasis.
2. Extensive findings of metastatic disease as on prior
radiograph.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 93123**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a history of COPD, HTN, and
HL who presented to the ED complaining of weakness found to have
2nd degree heart block with 3:1 conduction on EKG. She is now
status post pacemaker placement [**2121-4-11**].
P/
#1 Second degree Heart Block and Bradycardia: S/P [**Company 1543**]
sensia dual chamber (VDD lead) pacer via left cephalic vein. No
complications. Mild ecchymosis and tenderness at site, stable.
Has completed her 3 day course of prophylactic antibiotics. See
Page 1 for care of pacemaker site and activity restrictions. She
will follow up with the device clinic in 1 week and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in 6 weeks.

#2 Hypertensive urgency: Baseline SBP 140's per primary care.
SBP here has been 140-200 during pacemaker placement and
throughout rest of hospital stay. Possible etiologies have
included use of ibuprofen, use of albuterol for COPD
exacerbation and anxiety. Amlodipine, HCTZ, and Hydralazine was
added to her regimen and her Metoprolol was increased to 200mg.
Benazepril was d/ced as non formulary here.  Noted that BP in
left arm is 20-30 points lower than in right arm. No headache or
dizziness. Goal of SBP should be 140 to avoid watershed injury.
BP needs to be followed closely to avoid SBP < 140. Her
medicines can hopefully be tapered in the next 2 weeks.

#3 Hypoxia: Thought [**2-4**] COPD exacerbation with loud wheezes,
productive cough and no leukocytosis. Occ low grade temps noted
that would quickly resolve. Azithromycin and Prednisone was
started on [**4-15**] for total of 5 day course. Her Advair and
Spiriva was continued, Albuterol nebs prn for wheezing. On day
of discharge, she had no O2 requirement or fever.

#4 Hyperlipidemia: statin was continued at home dose.
