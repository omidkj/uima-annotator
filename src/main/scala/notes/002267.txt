Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
mediastinal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 42 y.o male with no PMH who was originally transferred
from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital for eval and tx of a new mediastinal mass
and PE. Pt reports was in USOH until ~4wks ago when he developed
a fever, non-productive cough, scratchy throat and severe SOB
(+orthopnea and DOE), facial+neck swelling, cyanotic ears/lips,
decreased appetite (wt loss 10-12lbs). He also reports sharp
R.sided lateral chest/rib pain, with occasional radiation down
his R.arm and a dull discomfort in his RUQ. He also reports a
white spot in his R.eye vision, that has since resolved. He
reported 2 episodes of n/v over this 4 wk period. He denies
travel, sick contacts, headache, blurred vision, odynophagia,
dysphagia, palps/d/c/melena/brpbr/dysuria/paresthesias
/weakness/skin rash.
  He then presented to [**Location (un) **] Urgent Care [**2171-2-14**] where a
large lung mass was found on CXR. He was then admitted to [**Hospital 5279**]
Hospital.
There, CT chest showed a large [**Location (un) 21851**] invading the
R.mediastinum causing severe compression, but no occlusion of
the SVC. This mass was in contact with the pulmonary artery.
Labs showed AFP 1303, LDH 407, normal B-HCG. CT guided bx showed
malignant cells c/w poorly differentiated carcinoma (ddx
carcinomatosis of immature teratoma within mixed cell germ tumor
or poorly differentiated carcinoma with non-small cell
morphology.
  Therefore, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for mediastinoscopy and
further care. Pt now being transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
the initiation of chemotherapy. Pt will require ICU given
possibility of tumor swelling causing complete SVC occlusion (IR
vs. vasc would need to stent). Onc felt comfortable starting
chemo if no liver lesions. Currently ?defect in falciform
ligament, radiology rec U/S. Pt with pan scan at OSH.
.
Currently, pt reports SOB, facial swelling, and R.arm swelling,
but pain is controlled.


Past Medical History:
none

Social History:

drinks a week, and denies drug use.  He lives in [**Location (un) 3844**].

Chest CT scan    Date: [**2171-2-11**]   [x] outside film
Impression:
1.) large [**Location (un) 21851**] of the RUL invading the right aspect of
the mediastinum and causing severe compression but not occlusion
of the superior vena cava.
2.) PE involving the LLL artery
3.) Multiple nonspecific mediastinal lymph nodes are seen
without
change, the largest right peritracheal lymph node measuring
9x14,
not enlarged by criteria
.
Other
CT-guided needle biopsy [**2171-2-13**] (by dictation, original report
is
not available): flow cytometry negative for lymphoma, POSITIVE
markers: epithelial, pankeratin, BEREP4; NEGATIVE markers: CK-7,
CK-20, TTF-1, b-HCG, yolk-sac cocktail;  impression -
differential diagnosis includes carcinomatosis component of the
immature teratoma within the mixed germ cell tumor and poorly
differentiated carcinoma with a non-small cell morphology.
.
MICROBIOLOGY:
none
.
EKG: ST, TWI III, TWF AVF, biphasic T v4-v6. na, no prior.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior
chest imaging.  Mediastinum is roughly midline despite a large
right pleural effusion accompanied by a sufficient right lung
atelectasis to suggest that this is a longstanding finding.
Smaller left pleural effusion has a very irregular contour along
the mediastinum posteriorly, which may indicate adenopathy.
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the
extent of
mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would
require
cross-sectional imaging for assessment. With such a study one
can distinguish cardiac tamponade from SVC syndrome, which can
present with great clinical similarity. No pneumothorax. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was paged.
.
ECHO [**2171-2-12**] OSH
-normal LV size, EF, RV normal, atrial normal, no valvular abn,
trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], impaired LV relaxation. No significant
pericardial effusion.
.
CT abd/pelvis OSH read: focal fatty infiltration is seen within
the liver adj to the falciform ligament. pancreas, spleen,
kidneys and adrenal glands are normal in appearance with
incdiental not of 2.5cm cyst from the lower pole of the
R.kidney, no calcified gallstones seen, no enlarged
intra-abdominal nodes seen. Moderately dilated loops of proximal
small bowel are seen with an abrupt caliber change inteh LUQ
beyond which the small bowel is decompressed. The colon overall
is normal caliber. Pelvis-large amt of stool present in rectum
and pelvic contents are otherwise unremarkable.

CXR [**2171-2-16**]:
AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging.
Mediastinum is roughly midline despite a large right pleural
effusion accompanied by a sufficient right lung atelectasis to
suggest that this is a longstanding finding. Smaller left
pleural effusion has a very irregular contour along the
mediastinum posteriorly, which may indicate adenopathy.  Trachea
is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of
mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would
require cross-sectional imaging for assessment. With such a
study one can distinguish cardiac tamponade from SVC syndrome,
which can present with great clinical similarity.

CXR [**2171-2-21**]:
There is no significant interval change in the large right
pleural effusion, although minimal decrease might be suspected
most likely due to postural changes. The right upper
paratracheal enlargement can be again appreciated.
The left lung is well aerated except for minimal basilar
opacities. The left midline tip is at the level of the mid
portion of left subclavian vein.

Scrotal U/S [**2171-2-18**]:
FINDINGS: There are small bilateral hydroceles. The right
testicle measures
2.45 x 1.93 x 3.54 cm. The left testicle measures 2.53 x 2.51 x
3.33 cm. The echotexture of the bilateral testes is extremely
heterogeneous with diffuse patchy areas of relative hypo- and
hyperechogenicity; however, there is no discrete mass identified
within either testicle. Vascularity within the teste
