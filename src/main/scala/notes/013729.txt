History of Present Illness:
89 year old woman w/ MMP including h/o colon CA and HIT referred
from [**Hospital3 7**] w/ hypotension and hemoptysis. She has
been convalescing at [**Hospital1 **] after recent MICU stay for
urosepsis. Was doing well until 2 days ago, when she developed
hypotension w/ SBP in 80s and low urine output. She was started
on dopamine gtt and treated w/ lasix, but urine output remained
low at 100cc in 24 hours. This AM, she developed hemoptysis w/
suctioning of frank blood from the oropharynx in the setting of
INR 5.8, prompting referral to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Before transfer,
she was reportedly treated w/ 2 units FFP and 2.5mg vitamin K.
.
In the ED, she had significant hemoptysis and was intubated for
airway protection. She was transiently hypotensive to nadir of
48/20's while transiently off dopamine. A left fem line was
placed but was complicated by significant groin ecchymosis,
prompting removal of the line and placement of a new right
femoral line. Treatment was continued with dopamine gtt. CT
torso was completed, and she was admitted to the MICU for
ongoing care.
.
Currently, she is intubated and sedated w/ dried blood on her
face, but no frank blood on ETT suctioning

Physical Exam:
PE: T 95.6 axillary, BP 135/81, HR 117 irregular, O2 sat 99% on
AC
Gen: morbidly obese woman lying flat in bed, intubated and
sedated
HEENT: anicteric, surgical pupils b/l, OP w/ dried blood and ETT
in place, dried blood over face and chin, no JVD
CV: reg s1/s2, + 2/6 systolic murmur at apex, no s3/s4/r
Pulm: coarse BS throughout, no crackles or wheezes
Abd: obese, +BS, soft, NT
Ext: cool, 2+ pitting edema to thighs and to elbows b/l,
dopplerable but not palpable DP b/l, 10cm ecchymosis at the left
groin w/ no hematoma, right femoral vein TLC in place, scattered
ecchymoses over the arms b/l.
Neuro: sedated, does not respond to commands


Pertinent Results:
EKG: low voltage, afib w/ RVR at 120 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals,
poor R wave progression, no change from prior tracing.
.
CT head: no hemorrhage or midline shift.
.
CT chest:  IMPRESSION:
1. Limited examination with poor contrast bolus may be secondary
to poor cardiac function. Additionally, diffuse anasarca and
intra-abdominal ascites suggest volume overload/congestive heart
failure.
2. Patchy airspace consolidation in the left lower and right
lower and right upper lung lobes. Moderate left pleural
effusion.
.
Femoral vascular US: LEFT TARGETED FEMORAL ULTRASOUD: Single
Doppler image of the right greater saphenous vein shows flow,
but with mixed arterial and venous waveforms. This indicates
arterial venous fistula.
,
.
ECHO: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is
16-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Free wall motion is normal.
[Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the
aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild
to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-10-24**],
the findings
are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 89-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, COPD, HTN, HIT, afib w/ pacer,
transferred from [**Hospital3 7**] w/ hemoptysis and
hypotension.  Her active issues during this hosp course include:
.
# Resp Failure: Pt was initially intubated for hypoxia from
pneumonia and anasarca affecting wall motion. Over the hospital
course, she showed no improvement and was unable to be weaned
from ventilator. She remained unresponsive despite trials of no
sedation. Ultimately, after many conversations with family, it
was decided that given her extremely morbid prognosis, she would
be CMO.  Family was present and actively involved in the
decision making process. On 1:45PM [**1-18**], pt made CMO.
.
# Pneumonia: Prior to this hospitalization, she had been
hospitalized for urosepsis. It was felt that while she was still
recovering from her sepsis, she also developed a pneumonia,
which was supported by elevated WBC and consolidation on CXR.
Lactate 2.7 on admission. TTE negative for vegetation. She was
initially covered with ceftaz (due to numerous Abx allergies)
and linezolid was added after blood cultures grew enterococcus.
Sputum cx positive for MRSA.
.
# Hypotension:  Felt to be multifactorial from sepsic shock and
initial possible hemoptysis/blood loss.  She continued Levophed
at minimal dosesto keep BP up to facilitate diuresis. Levophed
was unable to be weaned.
.
# Anasarca: She had profound anasarca felt [**12-28**] fluid
resuscitation in recent prolonged ICU course w/ some component
of CHF and hypoalbuminemia. Bumex was used for diuresis.
Unfortunately, she did not respond to daily attempts at diuresis
and limiting factors included worsening renal function and
hypotension.
.
# OP bleeding/Hemoptysis: Initially, there was concern for
hemoptysis given presentation of blood in ETT. However, bronch
revealed lack of endobronchial lesions, no active bleeding, and
adherent clot visible in right middle lobe. Ultimately, it was
felt to be actually related to an upper/oropharyngeal cause from
suctioning and mouth care in setting if high INR. NG lavage was
indeterminate. GI [**Month/Day (2) 4221**] EGD revealed erosive gastritis but
no active bleeding. ENT was curbsided and recommended watch
until INR normalizes, most likely [**12-28**] friable tissue/trauma from
intubation/suctioning. After INR improved and suctioning
decreased, bleeding stopped.
.
# HIT: h/o positive HIT Ab, but negative serotonin release
assay. On coumadin for the past 6 weeks for treatment; no h/o
thrombus in this setting. Risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of
thrombosis from HIT at this time.
.
# Renal failure: baseline 1.3. Has been 1.6-1.7 range this hosp
course. most likely from prerenal azotemia w/ possible component
of ATN after hypotension.
.
# COPD: controlled w/ advair, combivent INH, and prn albuterol
.
# Atrial fib: She had no active issues during this admission.
She maintained reasonably rate controlled despite stopping her
outpatient metoprolol for hypotension.
.
# Proph: pneumoboots, PPI
.
# Access:
- Left IJ
- left A-line
- a femoral line was attempted; however, complicated by AV
fistula. This was removed and evaluated with U/S.
