History of Present Illness:
88 year old female with hx of a. fib and right brachial artery
embolism on dabigatran, CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN, hypothyroidism
presenting with dysphagia. Pt was recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 22336**] for DOE and melenotic stools; Hct was found to
be 22 from baseline 40. She underwent extensive GI workup
including EGD, colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy that was
largely unrevealing for source of bleed. She was started on
omeprazole for gastritis. She received total of 4 units PRBCs
during admission with Hct in low 30s on discharge. She was
discharged on lower dose of dabigatran and lower dose of
atenolol.  She was discharged to rehab where she had
difficulties with constipation and intermittent dysphagia. She
was discharged home approximately one week ago and has
complained of intermittent dysphagia. On day of admission, she
had difficulties even swallowing water. Reports vomiting twice.


In the ED, initial VS were: 96.6 50 167/69 16 94% RA. She was
evaluated by GI who plan to perform EGD tonight. Anesthesia was
called for intubation for MAC anesthesia. CXR was unremarkable.
CT chest showed fluid distention of the stomach and fluid
layering up to mid esophagus.

IMAGING
CXR [**2105-4-4**]
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Cardiomegaly is again noted with diffuse ground-glass opacity
concerning for pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
present, left greater than right with bibasilar consolidation,
likely representing compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is
seen. Aortic calcifications again noted. Bony structures are
demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis, stable cardiomegaly.

CT CHEST [**4-4**]
1. Fluid distension of the esophagus suggesting dysmotility.
2. Left adrenal nodule is incompletely assessed. Elective
evaluation with
dedicated adrenal protocol CT may be performed as an outpatient.


EGD [**2105-4-4**]:
Impression:
Food in the whole Esophagus
Erythema and friability in the lower third of the esophagus
compatible with esophagitis
Retained fluids in stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations:
Trial clears with close monitoring. Continue PPI to allow
esophagitis to heal. F/u TSH. Barium swallow and esophageal
manometry should be done to evaluate motility within the
esophagus. Can consider further motility evaluation if it
becomes clear that the stomach as well as colon are involved as
well and if the above is unrevealing.

Barium Swallow [**2105-4-5**]
FINDINGS: The patient has mild esophageal dysmotility. The
primary stripping wave breaks in the mid to distal esophagus.
There is a moderate amount of residual contrast in the esophagus
after swallowing, even in the upright position. There is no
abnormal dilation, stricture, or evidence of achalasia. The
esophagus distends normally. The 13-mm tablet passes easily into
the stomach.

IMPRESSION: Mild esophageal dysmotility. No evidence of
achalasia.

Manometry [**2105-4-8**]: no signs of achalasia, final read pending


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 88 year old female with hx of a. fib and right
brachial artery embolism on dabigatran, CAD, diastolic CHF, HTN,
hypothyroidism who presented with dysphagia and was found to
have esophagitis and food particles throughout the esophagus
without evidence of stricture on barium swallow. Manometry
showed no signs of achalasia.

Dysphagia: Patient presented with intermittent dysphagia.  She
had a CT of the chest which showed large amounts of food in the
esophagus with air fluid levels.  She was intubated for her EGD
given food seen on CT scan and concern for aspiration. Her EGD
showed large amounts of food in the esophagus as well as
esophagitis without evidence of strictures or malignancies. Food
was removed and she was extubated without incident. Barium
swallow showed no stricture. Manometry showed no signs of
achalasia. She was advanced to clear liquids then full liquids
and finally to a pureed diet which she tolerated. She was given
pantoprazole IV initially and then started on po omeprazole 40
mg po BID. She was discharged on pureed diet after the nutrition
specialist gave her diet education.  Etiology of dysphagia
remains unclear.  Gastroenterology thinks esophagitis likely is
contributing to esophageal dysmotility, though there is concern
for dysmotility elsewhere in the GI tract including in the colon
given constipation and the stomach as this was full of food.  No
clear metabolic cause for this has been discovered, however.
Patient will be closely followed by GI to discuss further work
up as indicated.

Diastolic CHF: Torsemide dosing recently increased from 20mg to
40mg for worsening LE edema.  She initially appeared euvolemic
on exam and torsemide was initially held. It was restarted when
she developed an O2 requirement on [**2105-4-6**]. She then was
oxygenating well on room air and had minimal LE edema. Her
torsemide dose was subsequently decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg
prior to discharge as she developed a contraction alkalosis and
appeared euvolemic to slightly dry.  She was instructed to weigh
or if she developed lower extremity edema.

Intubation: Pt electively intubated with fentanyl/versed for MAC
anesthesia/EGD.  She was extubated following the procedure
without complications.

Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled on atenolol and digoxin. On
dabigatran on off-label dosing for afib and right brachial
artery embolism.
