Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain at rest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-8-21**]: Cardiac catheterization with 2 DEX to RCA, no
intervention to totally occluded LCA.

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 69 yo M with history of HTN, HL,
DMII presenting with exertional chest pain x 10 days, now
occurring at rest.
Patient was in [**Country 38213**] at onset of pain, and was evaluated at
the hospital. EKG there showed evidence of "a blocked artery,"
but they did not have stress test or catheterization capability
so he was sent to [**Country 5881**]. In [**Country 5881**], the patient refused to go
to the hospital, as he wanted to come to the US for further
care. He had to wait 7 days to get a plane ticket and arrived
Sunday. On Monday, he saw his PCP who started nitroglycerin,
imdur and atorvastatin (he has not yet taken the atorvastatin)
and set him up for cardiology evaluation on Wednesday am.
On the morning of admission, patient developed acutely worse
pain while climbing stairs that did not resolve with rest,
prompting him to seek medical attention.
Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED. Labs were notable for
an elevated troponin to 3.29, BNP 987, ddimer 1563. EKG had no
ST elevations. Patient was started on heparin gtt and nitro
paste. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.6 80 157/105 18 98% 2l. EKG
was notable for sinus rhythm, Q waves with st depressions in
inferior leads, no ST elevations. Posterior EKG showed no ST
elevations. Labs were notable for troponin 1.08 with CK 144 and
MB4, normal CBC, electrolytes (Cr 1.0), and u/a negative. Nitro
paste was removed and converted to nitro drip, and patient was
chest pain free. In addition, given evidence of heart failure,
patient received 40mg IV lasix. Cardiology was consulted who
recommended admission to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management and
catheterization.
On arrival to the floor, initial vital signs were T97.5 BP
146/102 HR 75 RR 20 O2 93% on 2LNC. Patient denied ongoing chest
pain, pressure or shortness of breath.
He reports that he has had some right calf pain, without
swelling or erythema. He has had fevers at home (but has no
taken his temperature).

Cardiac review of systems is notable for symptoms above, absence
of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, dysuria or hematuria.

Past Medical History:
- Type 2 diabetes
- Dyslipidemia
- Hypertension
- Asthma
- Regarding cardiac disease, per patient: stress test 5-6 years
ago treatment with medication, no cath.
- Chronic Hepatitis C (untreated per patient preference)
- Basal cell carcinoma (forehead)
- medication noncompliance (per PCP all medications should be
generic)

Social History:
Patient is married with children. He lives with his wife, who
speaks [**Name (NI) 24075**]. He is originally from [**Country 38213**] but emigrated to the
US in [**2113**]. He speaks [**Year (4 digits) 24075**] and Albanian. He is retired but
worked in fruit/vegetable delivery.
Denies tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drugs.

No known family history of CAD, HTN, DM, or early MI, both
parents died in 60s.

CARDIAC CATH [**2154-8-21**]
1)Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel disease with occlusion of RCA and mid LCx. The LMCA
 was
normal. LAD had 50% mid, diffuse distal 70% lesion and D1 had
60-70%
lesion. The LCx was with total occlusion after OM1 with faint
L->L
collaterals to distal OM. RCA with total occlusion with faint
antegrade
flow and L->R collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed aortic pressure of 95/53 and
elevated
right sided pressures with wedge of 25 and decreased cardiac
output and
index.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with occlusion of RCA
and Cx
(mid).
2. Admit to CCU for heart failure management.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
leg.
.
CARDIAC ECHO [**2154-8-22**]
LVEF 35%
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary
to hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Inferoposterolateral
myocardial infarct

Brief Hospital Course:

well as SOB. On admission to the floor, he was currently chest
pain and pressure-free, deni
