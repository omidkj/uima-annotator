[**2126-11-15**] CABGx3


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old male with worsening anginal symptoms
who underwent cardiac catheterization that showed critical left
main disease and
ostial left anterior descending stenosis with disease involving
the circumflex and his right coronary and particularly the left
ventricular branch. His ejection fraction was diminished. His
anterior wall was hypokinetic. He was transferred  to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for suurgical management. He has a heavy alcohol use history and
given his anatomy, he needs urgent surgery realizing the risk of
alcohol withdrawal. However, alcohol withdrawal in the presence
of such coronary disease may also be disastrous. Referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for urgent CABG.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the septum, distal half of
the anterior wall, and distal inferior walls. The apex is mildly
dyskinetic with no visible intracavitary thrombus (cannot
exclude due to suboptimal image quality). The remaining segments
contract reasonably well with overalll LVEF of 35%. Minimal
views of the right venrtricle suggest normal cavity size with
good systolic function. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small (0.8-1.0cm), somewhat echodense pericardial
effusion anterior to the right ventricle c/w with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-11-14**] viua transfer
from [**Hospital6 **] for surgical management of his
coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner by the cardiac surgical service.  Thiamine
and folic acid were started given his history of heavy alchol
use. On [**2126-11-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three
vessels.
 Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he remained
intubated and sedated on epinephrine, neo and propofol drips. On
POD #2, epinephrine was weaned off, but he remained on neo and
propofol drips sedated. He was hemodynamically stable and
received ativan for DT prophylaxis. He had tonsillar fossa and
right oropharyngeal bleeding postoperatively and was seen and
evaulated by the ORL service. He remained intubated while the
packing was in place.Chest tubes were removed. He was extubated
on POD #4 and remained in sinus rhythm, alert and oriented. Swan
was also removed.Diuresis, aspirin and beta blockade continued.
He was transferred to the floor on POD #5 to begin increasing
his activity level. Pacing wires were removed on the floor
without incident and his foley was removed on POD #6. He was
cleared for discharge to rehab on POD #7.
