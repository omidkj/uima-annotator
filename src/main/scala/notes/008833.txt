Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
female with a history of panhypopituitarism secondary to
hypophysectomy for pituitary adenoma and [**Location (un) 3484**] disease,
type 2 diabetes [**Location (un) **] and multiple ventral hernias with
incarcerations, who presented to an outside hospital
Emergency Room with vomiting for one day, fever to 104.3,
hypotension (80/palpable) and lethargy.

The night prior to going to the Emergency Room, the patient
began vomiting, which was yellow in color, but she had two
episodes in which the vomit became black in color and she
described the texture as stringy.  Eventually, the vomitus
turned yellow again and she continued to vomit until the next
morning.  She has never had coffee-ground emesis in the past,
but she does have a history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

The patient's son found her very lethargic the next morning.
She was unable to get out of bed without assistance and
unable to dress herself.  She was responsive and oriented
initially but does not recall any events after the arrival of
the ambulance.

The week prior to admission, the patient had a cough with
clear sputum and was feeling clammy at night.  She denies
shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fevers, chills,
skin changes, diarrhea, black tarry stools or bright red
blood per rectum.  She had no chest pain, no headache, no
dizziness and no visual changes.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a temperature of
104.3, oxygen saturation of 92% and a systolic blood pressure
in the 70s to the 90s.  She had a negative lumbar puncture,
negative head and abdominal CT scans and a negative
urinalysis, with pending cerebrospinal fluid cultures and
blood cultures to rule out a source of infection for her
fever and hypotension.  Additionally, she had a drug
toxicology screen that was positive only for amphetamines,
normal arterial blood gases, thyroid function tests, CK and
troponin and electrolytes, with a glucose of 144.

The patient received 1 gram of vancomycin and 1 gram of
Rocephin and was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **].  In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
Emergency Room, the patient was lethargic but easily
arousable to verbal stimuli, alert and oriented times three
with an FSBS of 225.  She had a stable blood pressure of
97/45, heart rate of 100, temperature of 101.4, respiratory
rate of 16 and oxygen saturation of 97% in room air.  Her
white blood cell count was 11.  She was guaiac negative.

The patient received intravenous Levaquin 500 mg and stress
dose intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg.  She was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where she had
a stable blood pressure in the 110s to 120s/50s, a heart rate
in the 100s and an oxygen saturation between 93% to 96%.  Her
glucose level remained in the 110s to 160s, which were
controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient became afebrile and received stress doses of
steroids, hydrocortisone 100 mg every six hours, was given
vancomycin, Flagyl, gentamicin times one but switched to
levofloxacin 500 mg per day.  She received a surgical consult
given her extensive past medical history of abdominal
surgeries.  She received a KUB and repeat abdominal CT, which
were negative.  She also had a chest x-ray which was
negative.

The patient had normal electrolytes and had pending blood
cultures when she was transferred from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit after one and one-half days to the floor.  When she
arrived on the floor, she was no longer vomiting, remained
afebrile and had regained some strength, but still needed
assistance to get out of bed.  She continued to have a cough
with clear sputum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed with an adrenal
insufficiency crisis secondary to tracheobronchitis.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.  She
was placed on a steroid taper and continued on her Levoxyl.

As the patient's steroids were tapered, she was placed on her
normal regimen of NPH and metformin and she had two morning
glucose levels which were low, in the 50s.  Her regimen was
then changed to NPH 30 units in the morning with 20 units in
the evening and metformin 500 mg twice a day.

continued on oral levofloxacin 500 mg per day for a total of
ten days.  Her blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid
cultures demonstrated not growth to date.  Her diet was
advanced and she regained her strength in order to perform
her normal activities of daily living.

The patient's hematocrit remained at 30 with a low MCV, but
she has had a prior workup for her anemia in [**2175-10-19**],
which demonstrated anemia of chronic illness.  Her aspirin
was discontinued due to questionable gastric irritation with
coffee-ground emesis.  On the last day of admission, the
patient's potassium went down to 3.1 and she was given two
doses of 40 mEq of K-Dur.
