Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis, known esophageal varices
admitted with melena and emesis.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable throughout his admission.  He had no
further episodes of melena during this hospital course.  The
patient was initially maintained with two large bore IVs with a
plan to transfuse for a hematocrit less than 28.  He had an EGD
which did not demonstrate any actively bleeding lesions.

The patient was actively drinking prior to admission.  Although
he denied a history of withdrawal seizures he was tachycardic,
hypertensive and nauseated on admission. He was maintained on a
q2 hour CIWA scale, with decreasing benzo requirements
throughout his admission.  The patient was also maintained on
thiamine, folate and a multivitamin.  His clonidine was
discontinued on admission and restarted once the patient was
called out to the floor.

The patient has a coagulopathy secondary to his chronic
cirrhosis.  His disease is secondary to ETOH with HCC, and he is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]. His disease is complicated by portal
hypertension, hypertensive gastropathy, esophageal varices s/p
banding and melena in the past, as well as ascites,
thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy.  His medications
were initially held but once it was clear the patient was not
actively bleeding, his nadolol, furosemide, spironolactone and
lactulose were restarted.

The patient had a stable thrombocytopenia.  He did receive FFP
prior to a planned RFA for three liver lesions.  The procedure
went well and the patient was discharged the following day.

The patient was continued on his outpatient pain regimen of
Neurontin and a lidocaine patch.

He also had a chronic stable anemia which was macrocytic, likely
multifactorial given GIB, EtOH use and liver disease. Vitamin
B12 1787 [**4-12**], folate 11.8 [**4-12**].

The patient was a full code throughout this admission.
Communication was as follow: mother [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94196**],
Partner [**Name (NI) **] (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94197**], (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94198**].
