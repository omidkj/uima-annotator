CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old Greek
female with a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding,
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and other comorbidities, who
presents from her nursing home with maroon stools times ten
to fourteen days and bright red blood per rectum for the past
two days.  For the past ten to fourteen days, she has also
had crampy intermittent lower left quadrant pain,
nonexertional shortness of breath and moderate fatigue.
Falling hematocrit necessitated transfusion of two units of
packed red blood cells at [**Hospital6 13846**]
Center where she has been living for four months.  She denies
the following:  chest pain, syncope, nausea, vomiting,
dysphagia, dysuria or hematuria.  She also denies a history
of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease.
She does report swelling and erythema of her legs which has
been unchanged for the past six months.

Gastrointestinal bleeding history:
1.  [**Month (only) 404**] to [**2117-6-9**], recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds
over these months requiring eighteen transfusions at various
hospitals.
2.  [**2117-6-9**], [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  Video endoscopy did
not reveal bleeding, upper endoscopy showed papular
gastropathy but no source of chronic bleeding.
3.  [**2117-7-10**], [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  Colonoscopy revealed
a single nonbleeding angiectasia in the transverse colon
which was treated with electrocautery.
4.  [**2117-8-9**], [**Hospital3 **] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] Medical Intensive Care Unit -
Presented at [**Hospital3 **] with bright red blood per
rectum, hematocrit fell from 28.0 to 12.0 and was transferred
four units; transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  Coumadin and Heparin were held.  There was a
bleeding scan positive for bleeding from angiodysplasia of
the cecum or ascending colon past the distal ileocolic
artery.  She received interventional radiology embolization
of the right colon.  Coumadin and Heparin were restarted
after embolization.  In addition, the patient was hypotensive
throughout the admission with blood pressure nadiring at
82/30; her hematocrit on that admission 24.0, INR 2.6; and in
this setting, she had a myocardial infarction with peak CK of
300 and troponin of 34.  An echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 40%.  In addition, the patient had a
catheterization that showed one vessel disease which seemed
chronic.  She was transfused four units at [**Hospital1 346**] for a total of eight.  Her
hematocrit stabilized and bleeding was mostly resolved.
5.  [**2117-9-9**], [**Hospital1 69**] Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient presented with bright red
blood per rectum initially progressing to maroon colored
stools plus intermittent substernal chest pain relieved with
sublingual Nitroglycerin.  She was hypotensive to 99/56.  Her
electrocardiogram showed 0.[**Street Address(2) 11725**] depressions in
leads II and III.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction
and was transfused five units total.  Interventional
radiology elected not to embolize due to the risk of
mesenteric ischemia.  Coumadin and Heparin were held.
Bleeding resolved.
6.  [**2118-2-9**] - The patient presented to [**Hospital6 14430**] with hypotension and malaise.  Colonoscopy showed a
continuous area of nonbleeding shallow ulcer of the mucosa
with no stigmata of recent bleeding present in the ascending
colon distal to the cecum, three ulcers next to each other,
largest 1.0 centimeter, nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids as
well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleeds as above.
2.  Status post aortic valve replacement with a St. Jude
valve in [**2113**].
3.  Congestive heart failure with transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**2118-3-4**], showing normal left ventricular
systolic function, inability to assess the ejection fraction
due to irregular rhythm although an ejection fraction of 40%
was shown on [**2117-8-25**].  Right ventricle was dilated with
moderately reduced systolic function.  Aortic valve
prosthesis was well seated, no aortic insufficiency, 2+
mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary
artery pressure 70 mmHg, mitral valve calcified at the
commissures but mobile without stenosis, dilated inferior
vena cava suggestive of elevated right heart diastolic
pressures.
4.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient is status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2100**].  She
is status post multiple myocardial infarctions.  Cardiac
catheterization on [**2117-8-25**], demonstrated 100% proximal right
coronary artery stenosis with diffuse right coronary artery
disease, not felt to repairable by angioplasty or bypass.
Septal inferior artery with 60% occluded, obtuse marginal 60%
occluded and the first diagonal 20% occluded.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker placement.
7.  History of rheumatic fever.
8.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  The patient is now requiring
insulin.  History of neuropathy and mild nephropathy.
9.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  She requires home
oxygen at three liters since [**2112**].
10. Klebsiella urinary tract infection in [**9-10**].
11. Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.
1.  Left atrial mass resection [**2113**], nonneoplastic infected
atrial myxoma.
2.  Ovarian cyst removal.
