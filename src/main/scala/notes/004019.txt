Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 2 days of malaise and
for a Foley catheter change. On presentation he was found to
have a fever and hypotension. His catheter was changed and he
was found to have a UTI with quinolone-resistant E coli and
Proteus. He initially required admission to the ICU for
fluid-responsive hypotension and was then transferred to the
floor. Due to a difficult Foley catheter change he developed
hematuria. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and his
hematuria resolved without intervention.
