studies:
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT: no DVT

Left wrist: IMPRESSION: 1. Questionable cortical irregularity
along the dorsal surface of distal left radius. No acute
fracture plane visible. Recommend correlation with physical exam
findings of pain localized over the dorsum of the distal radius.

cxr: Congestive failure with possible infiltrate developing at
the left base

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo man with ESRD on HD, IDDM, admitted with delirium in
setting of HONK/DKA and found to have LLL PNA and other
metabolic derrangements.

1) Delirium - patient had inattentiveness and fluctuation in
level of consciousness on examination, likely due to his
metabolic derrangements (hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, uremia).
He was initially intubated for airway protection. CT head
negative for ICH. He was extubated on [**3-28**]. His mental status
cleared after infection and hyperglycemia were treated.

2) Respiratory Failure - intubated for airway protection in
setting of altered mental status. ABG once intubated was fine.

3) Hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia: On admission blood
glucose was 1017 with anion gap of 22. ABG at the time was
7.35/38/87. Given his normal pH, the relatively low gap for the
given glucose (gap likely [**12-19**] uremia), and the severity of the
hyperglycemia, this was thought to be HONK. He was started on an
insulin drig and given aggressive hydration. His glucose
improved and he was restarted on insulin. The [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and his insulin was titrated. He will follow up with
the [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

4) LLL PNA - Found on x ray. Patient received ceftriaxone and
azithromycin initially. He completed a 10 day course of
antibiotics. He did not require oxygen and ws feeling well on
discharge.

5) LLE cellulitis - Patient was noted to have ulceration on left
foot and lower extremity cellulitis. He was started on
vancomycin. Podiatry was consulted. He was advised as to be non
weight bearin on left. His wound was dressed with wet to dry
dressings. He was discharged on vancomycin to be dosed at
hemodialysis for a total of 14 days. He also had a LE ultrasound
that was negative for DVT.

6) ESRD - Patient was dialyzed without complication.

7) s/p L wrist fracture - Patient had swollen wrist. X rays were
performed and showed possible fracture. He will continue to wear
a splint and follow up with orthopedics as an outpatient.
