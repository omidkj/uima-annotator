History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93850**] is a 60 year old male with a history of end stage
renal disease on [**Known lastname 2286**] (MWF), end stage liver disase
secondary to hepatitis C and seizure disorder who was recently
admitted to this hopsital from [**2139-8-26**] to [**2139-8-27**] for
bradycardia and shortness of breath. He was found to have
evidence of volume overload on CXR as well as a potassium of
6.7.  EKG showed a junctional bradycardia which resolved with
treatment of his hyperkalemia.  He received emergent [**Month/Day/Year 2286**]
with resolution of his symptoms.  He was also started on
azithromycin for possible pneumonia on CXR although no fevers or
leukocytosis.  He was discharged home yesterday afternoon. He
was seen by the staff at his facility in the evening and was
noted to be in his usual state of health.
.
He was found on the morning of presentation to be unresponsive
in his home.  His facility called up to his apartment because
transportation was waiting to take him to [**Month/Day/Year 2286**].  When they
called his apartment there was no response so they went to check
on him and he was found to be minimally responsive on his floor.
 No acute signs of trauma.  They called 911 and he was brought
to the emergency room.  In the field his initial O2 sats were
89% on RA.  His blood pressure was elevated at 220/140.  He was
placed on CPAP and received nitroglycerin spray.   He was
brought to the emergency room.
.
On arrival to the emergency room his inital vitals were T: 96.1
BP: 186/120 HR: 115 RR: 28 O2: 100% on BIPAP EKG showed.  CXR
showed mild worsening of his volume overload.  He was noted to
have an approximately 15 second tonic clonic seizure which
resolved without treatment.  He did not have any head imaging.
He was started on a nitroglycerin drip and received aspirin 325
mg x 1.  He transiently received BIPAP but was weaned to 4L
nasal canula.  He was admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
On arrival to the MICU he is in acute respiratory distress with
respiratory rates in the 30s, HR in the 140s, SBP in the 180s on
a nitroglycerin drip.  He is unable to answer questions at this
time.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with a history of end stage renal disease on
[**Month/Day/Year 2286**] (MWF), end stage liver disase secondary to hepatitis C
and seizure disorder who was found down by EMS and had witnessed
seizure activity in the emergency room. He was transferred from
the MICU to the general medical service for further evaluation
of his symptoms. His altered mental status was likely related to
seizure activity as he has a known history of tonic clonic
seizures with post-ictal periods.  We found his dilantin level
to be subtherapeutic and consulted Neurology about the best way
to dose this. He had a one time 300mg dose and then was
continued on his outpatient regimen. Follow-up phenytoin levels
were therapeutic and he did not require further adjustment. It
was unclear if he had missed any doses of his medications and if
that is what caused his subtherapeutic level. Blood cultures
were obtained as infection could be a possible source of
seizure. He was also having pain and tenderness in the right
side of his chest around his HD line, and we suspected line
infection. He grew out 3/4 bottles of GPC's in clusters from
cultures drawn on [**8-28**]. He was afebrile and did not have a white
count.  He was started on Vancomycin empirically. Culture data
returned as coagulase negative staph that was resistant to
fluoroquinolones and a number of other antibiotics, so
vancomycin treatment was clearly indicated. This was discussed
with ID and they formally consulted on this patient. Due to
staph bacteremia, a TTE was obtained to rule out endocarditis.
The TTE returned negative for valvular vegetation. He remained
afebrile, VSS throughout his course on the floors. His BP meds
were continued and he attended [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] on [**8-31**]. Home seizure
medications (keppra, lamotrigine, phenytoin) were continued as
per outpatient regimen. Renal medications (cinacalcet and
nephrocaps) were also continued. vitals were monitored closely
and electrolytes were obtained and repleted as necessary. He was
discharged in stable condition with
