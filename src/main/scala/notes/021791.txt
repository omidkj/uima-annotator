Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 951**] is a 72 year old woman with a history of
progressive pulmonary fibrosis, CAD s/p CABG x 4 [**2137**], moderate
AS, hypothyroidism.  She presented to an OSH with increased
shortness of breath, fatigue and recent chills.  She was treated
empirically for community acquired pneumonia with levaquin, CHF
exacerbation wtih lasix, IPF with prednisone and azathioprine,
empiric PCP treatment with IV bactrim and prednisone.  Despite
these interventions patient denies significant improvement in
shortness of breath.
.
She was presented with the option of bronchoscopy and possible
biopsy to further evaluate her respiratory status. She initially
agreed and due to her high supplemental oxygen requirement she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for this procedure.
.
On arrival to the ICU her only specific complaint is
constipation. She reports that she has reconsidered the
bronchoscopy and has decided not to pursue any invasive
procedures out of fear that she would not be able to be
extubated and that it may not change her management or
prognosis.  She reports she has not had further episodes of
chills since her admission.  She does not feel like she is in
respiratory distress when at rest with high flow oxygen.

MARKED WORSENING OF GROUND-GLASS OPACITIES WITHIN BOTH LUNGS IN
THE

THE
BACKGROUND INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY FIBROSIS, THIS COULD REPRESENT
AN
ACUTE EXACERBATION OF IPF, THOUGH THE FACT THAT NEW AREAS APPEAR
AFFECTED RAISES THE QUESTION OF A SUPERIMPOSED ATYPICAL
INFECTION, DRUG REACTION, OR ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS.

GENERALIZED PNEUMONIA BUT COULD ALSO REPRESENT PULMONARY
CONGESTION WITH SOME INTERSTITIAL AND AIR SPACE EDEMA.

CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral interstitial opacities.
Differential include acute excacerbation of UIP, superimposed
edema and/or infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute on chronic hypoxia: Patient's hypoxia is likely
secondary to progressive pulmonary fibrosis as diagnosed on
imaging. Baseline oxygen requirement of 4 L NC at home. Patient
refused a bronchoscopy as she did not want to risk chance of
being intubated indefinitely. Given that we could not get a firm
diagnosis from a bronch, it was decided to treat her for an IPF
exacerbation as well as for infection.

 Regarding her IPF exacerbation, she was continued on duonebs
prn, NAC 1200 mg po tid, and tessalon perles prn. She was
continued on azathioprine as well as prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], which
was transitioned to 60 mg daily. This will be slowly tapered by
decreasing 5 mg weekly and she will follow up with her
pulmonologist at the end of the month for further management.

***Note, prednisone is not for PCP treatment, but for IPF. This
should not be stopped once PCP treatment is completed. ***

 She was also diuresed with improvement in her hypoxia given her
history of CHF. She reached a euvolemic state but still required
supplemental oxygen with 5 liters NC and 60% shovel mask with O2
sats in low 90s. This was stable through most of her
hospitalization. She should attempt to be further weaned in
rehab.

 Her elevated WBC and increased sputum were initially concerning
for infection so she was started on a course of therapeutic
bactrim, zosyn, and levaquin at the OSH.  Zosyn was discontinued
given negative sputum cultures. Levaquin was continued for a
full 7 day course. Given worsening ground glass opacities on CT
and mildly elevated LDH and hypoxia she was empircally treated
with bactrim and will complete a 21 day course of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**].
She is due to stop Bactrim [**2154-9-7**].  Notably, b-glucan was
negative at outside hospital, and pending at lab drawn at [**Hospital1 18**].
Since her oxygenation and white count improved at treatment dose
was started, it was felt she should complete this regimen. Her
wbc prior to d/c trended down to 12.4, (peaking at
14.4).
-WBC should be trended at rehab until within normal limits.
-PCP treatment ending [**2154-9-7**]
-f/u beta glucan from [**Hospital1 18**]

# Hyponatremia: Felt to be secondary to SIADH as Urine Na of 77.
She was continued on a water restriction of 1 liter per day. Her
serum Na nadir'd at 122. Prior to discharge was 128. She should
continue on a water restriction with trending of her Na. Her
mental status was intact.
- Trend Na

# Hyperkalemia: Noted on day prior to d/c. Peaking at 5.7. She
was given Kayexelate with improvement to 5.4. She developed no
EKG changes. This was felt to be secondary to Bactrim. Her
potassium should be checked daily to [**Hospital1 **] until stable. She had
no signs of adrenal insufficiency.
- Trend K

# CAD: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG x 4 in [**2137**]. Continued on
aspirin. BB was initially held, but slowly titrated back to home
dosage of atenolol 75 [**Hospital1 **].

# Hypothyroidsim: TSH checked within normal limits at 0.96.
Continued home levothyroxine 125 mcg daily.

# Constipation: Likely exacerbated by immobility and
dehydration. She was started on an aggressive bowel regimen with
docusate, senna, miralax daily, bisacodyl prn, benefi
