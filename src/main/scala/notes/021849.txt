Chief Complaint:
altered mental status and poor urine output

Pacemaker placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 y.o. with atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
peripheral vascular disease, and stage IV CKD who presented to
the hospital this morning with altered mental status and poor
urine output since yesterday.  Over the last three weeks the
patient has been suffering from right hip and ischial pain after
having sustained a mechanical fall.  After this fall, he has had
CT's of the head and pelvis that failed to show any acute
pathology.  Due to persistent pain he has been started on
tramadol during the day and oxycodone-APAP at night with some
relief of his symptoms.  Over the last few days he has been
feeling overall weak and more tired than usual.  He also has had
multiple episodes of altered mental status over the past two
days with occasional confusion and auditory and visual and
auditory illusions versus hallucinations (the patient cannot
perfectly describe these episodes but most sound as if they were
misinterpretations of existing stimuli).  He has had two
episodes of dizziness but no syncope.  The patient has also been
having intermittent involuntary jerking movements one of which
caused him to knock a lamp off of his bedside table last night.
Yesterday and this morning the patient's friend who helps care
for him noted that he seemed to be urinating less (only twice
yesterday) and given this cumulation of concerning symptoms he
presented to the ED this morning.  Overall, he denied any other
specific complaints except feeling tired and generally unwell
and those noted.  He particularly denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, or frank syncope.

In triage he appeared unwell with a HR of 28 and SBP's in the
70's.  He was given 1 mg atropine with improvement of rates to
the 40's and pressures to the mid teens but then rates dropped
back to the 20's with ECG showing complete heart block.  He
received another amp of atropine with improvement of rates back
to the 50's with SBP's greater than 100.  Patient was evaluated
by the elecrophysiology service who planned for pacemaker
placement this afternoon.  Labs also notable for acute kidney
injury on his chronic kidney disease and potassium of 5.4.  He
received kayexalate and was admitted to the floor.

On arrival to the floor the patient received insulin and glucose
as well as calcium gluconate.  He complained of feeling
generally unwell but denied any localizing symptoms and was
initially alert and oriented *3.  A bit later he had some
altered mental status and confusion and was found to have a
blood glucose of 35.  He received one amp of dextrose with
improvement back toward baseline.

Shortly after resolution (and repeat blood glucose>102).  The
patient was taken for permanent placemaker placement.  He
tolerated the procedure well and is now denying any complaints
and reporting feeling much better.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  He has exertional
buttock pain that is stable.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chronic stable
orthopnea and some mild lower extremity edema.  It is notably
negative for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations or syncope.
