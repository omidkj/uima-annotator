Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from OSH to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital, she was seen in the Trauma Bay by Trauma
Surgery, Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery were also
consulted.  Repeat CT demonstrated stable small SAH and plain
films of the pelvis confirmed Rt hip fracture.  she was
transferred to the Trauma ICU in stable condition. The remainder
of her discharge will be done by systems:

Neuro: The patient had a repeat Head CT on [**2135-2-20**] which showed
stable SAH. Neurosurgery recommended holding her plavix for 7
days, no need for seizure prophylaxis. She was AOx3 with some
episodes of confusion likely [**1-2**] dementia. Her neurological exam
remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.

CV: The patient has a h/o chronic Afib, post operatively she
went into AF w/ RVR with a rate in the 120s, she was hypotensive
and required Neo for BP suppory  She was ruled out for MI, her
troponins were mildly elevated 0.26 maximally. She was started
on a Dilt gtt for rate controlHer Hct was 27 and she reecieved 1
unit of PRBC. She has an ECHO which demonstrated EF > 55% w/
mild LVH, Rt ventricular cavity dilated with normal free wall
contractility and moderate TR.  Cardiology was consulted and
felt that the troponin leak was likely [**1-2**] demand ischemia. They
recommended continuing on ASA, beta blockade, rate control, and
statin, restarting plavix when able. They did not recommend
anticogulation given her fall risk.  The patient was weaned off
pressors, she was transitioned from Dilt gtt to a po regimen of
Dilt 45mg QID and Lopressor 75 TID with adequate rate control.
She is to restart her plavix on [**2136-2-25**]

cleared for a Soft (dysphagia); Thin liquid diet on discharge

and hypovolemia. Her UOP improved and she was restarted on her
home regimen of Torsemide prior to discharge

Heme: The patient was placed on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis

Endocrine: The patient continued on her home dose of
Levothyroxine

Prior to discharge the patient was doing well. She was
neurologically intact. Her heart rate was irregular, her lungs
