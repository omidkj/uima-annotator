Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**]
Chief Complaint:
Pelvic mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, radical resection of pelvic mass,
supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
ileocecectomy with ileal ascending colostomy anastomosis, rectal
resection with end sigmoid colostomy and Hartmann pouch,
infracolic omentectomy, extensive tumor debulking.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 35274**] is a 42 yo woman who initially presented in [**Month (only) 205**] with
LUQ discomfort.  Due to her h/o nephrolithiasis, a CT urogram
was done on [**8-11**] which showed non-obstructing stones and a bulky
heterogenous uterus consistent with fibroids. Pt then had
gradual onset of pelvic discomfort, constipation, and bloating.
Pelvic ultrasound on [**10-16**] showed a large complex vascular left
adnexal mass.

Past Medical History:
PMH: Brain aneurysm, nephrolithiasis
PSH: Coiling of brain aneurysm in [**2170**], lithotripsy [**2173**]
OB HISTORY: Vaginal delivery x1.
GYN HISTORY: Last Pap smear and mammogram were both recently
normal.


Social History:
The patient does not smoke or drink.  She is an accountant.


Family History:
Significant for mother with liver cancer.

Physical Exam:
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Well developed, well nourished.
HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.
LYMPHATICS:  Lymph node survey was negative.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular without murmurs.
BREASTS:  Without masses.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and distended with a palpable mass extending from
the left lower quadrant to the left upper quadrant.  This mass
was nontender.  It felt quite firm.  There was also a palpable
mass in the mid lower abdomen, which was also quite firm.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
PELVIC:  The vulva and vagina were normal.  The cervix was not
visualized.  Bimanual and rectovaginal examination revealed that
the cervix was small and displaced anteriorly.  There was a
large smooth mass that was palpable both through the anterior
vaginal wall and through the posterior fornix.  By rectal
examination, the posterior mass was filling the cul-de-sac.  The
rectal was
intrinsically normal.  Bimanual examination revealed that the
mass seemed to be contiguous with the mass in the left upper
quadrant.  There was no parametrial disease.

ECG [**11-6**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Delayed R wave transition. No previous
tracing available
for comparison.
.
Chest X-ray [**11-6**]:
COMPARISON: [**2177-10-28**].
  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
markedly decreased. There is a marked retrocardiac atelectasis,
associated
with a small left-sided pleural effusion. Small areas of
atelectasis are also
seen at the right lung base. The size of the cardiac silhouette
has mildly
increased. There are no features suggesting pulmonary edema. No
evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
CTA Chest [**11-6**]:
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   R/o PE
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pulmonary emboli, right upper lobe pulmonary artery and
segmental
divisions.
2. Severe bibasilar atelectasis and small airways obstruction
probably also contributory to respiratory insufficiency.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions reflect recent abdominal
surgery. No
evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.
.
Surgical Tissue Pathology [**11-4**]:
DIAGNOSIS:

1.  Pelvic mass, biopsy (A-G):  Poorly differentiated carcinoma
consistent with papillary serous carcinoma.

2.  Pelvic tumor, resection (C-G):  Papillary serous carcinoma.

3.  "Ovary", left (H-Q):  Papillary serous carcinoma, see
synoptic report.

4.  Uterus, right ovary and tube, left ovary and tube, small
intestine, large intestine and rectum:  Papillary serous
carcinoma, see synoptic report.

a.  Uterus, right ovary and tube, left ovary and tube (AA-AI):

-Uterine serosal implant of serous carcinoma.
-Resected supracervical margin is negative.
-Ovaries (left and right) with serous carcinoma.
-Right fallopian tube free of tumor.
-No left fallopian tube recognized.

b.  Small intestine (R-U): Multiple serosal implants of serous
carcinoma
c.  Large intestine and rectum, partial resection (V-Z):

Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo P1 admitted to the gyn oncology service s/p suboptimal
cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.  She had an
exploratory laparotomy, SCH/BSO, small bowel resection and
re-anastimosis, and sigmoid rection with colostomy.  The surgery
was uncomplicated; please see operative note for full details.
.
She was monitored in the ICU overnight given her extensive
surgery, and was transferred to the regular floor on POD 1.  Her
post-operative course is summarized below and was complicated by
the following:
.
*) Pulmonary embolus:
On POD 1, she had shortness of breath, tachycardia, and
tachypnea.  A CTA was performed which showed a right upper lobe
PE.  Heparin drip was started for anticoagulation and she was
transitioned to Coumadin when tolerating a regular diet.  She
was given Coumadin 5 mg PO QHS and her INR was monitored daily.
INR was supra-therapeutic at 4.7 on [**11-12**].  Coumadin was held
that night, and INR was 3.7 on [**11-13**].  Since she was stable for
discharge at that time, she was discharged home with plans to
have her INR monitored by [**Month/Year (2) 269**] and her Coumadin adjusted by her
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 35275**].
.
*) Blood loss anemia:
Her starting hct was 33, and EBL was 1000cc.  She received 1 U
PRBC intra-op and another 2 U PRBC on [**11-7**].  Her hct was stable
at 26-27 for many days prior to discharge.
.
*) Chest pain:
She had one episode of chest pain on POD 2 which resolved
spontaneously.  Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia and her cardiac
enzymes were cycled for 3 sets and found to be normal.
.
*) Colostomy:
Her ostomy started functioning on POD3.  She was seen by the
ostomy nurse and learned to independently care for her ostomy.

She was discharged home POD #9 in good condition.  She was
ambulating, voiding, and tolerating a full diet without
problems.  [**Name (NI) 269**] was arranged for stoma care and to check her
INRs.
