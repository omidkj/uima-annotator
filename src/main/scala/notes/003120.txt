Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46 y/o male who is currently incarcerated who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of PNA, pleural
effusion, and cirrhosis. Pt states that about 2 weeks ago, he
noticed increasing weakness along with chills, SOB, and
pleuritic chest pain. He was sent from jail to the ED for
further evaluation of the above-described symptoms. Pt oxygen
saturation on RA upon arrival to the ED were in the 80s.
Oxygenation improved with NC. Initial CXR revealed a large RLL
PNA and pleural effusion. He was started on levofloxacin for
CAP. He subsequently underwent a CT chest, abdomen, pelvis which
revealed cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and a large right pleural
effusion along with an infiltrate in the left lobe. Pt is s/p
paracentesis x 2. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and management.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging Studies:
.
[**2166-4-25**] CXR
Moderate right pleural effusion.
.
[**2166-4-26**] Abdominal U/S
Normal appearing liver. No focal liver lesions. Large right
pleural effusion. Splenomegaly.
.
[**2166-4-26**] CXR
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is again demonstrated
and probably unchanged allowing for positional differences from
semi-upright on the prior exam to upright on the current study.
Adjacent atelectasis is present in the right middle and lower
lobes. The left lung is clear except for focal opacity at the
left base peripherally, likely due to atelectasis. Hemidiaphragm
deformity may potentially reflect a small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2166-4-27**] CXR
Accumulating right pleural fluid.
.
Acid Fast Bacilli Stains x3 + BAL specimen, pleural fluid
stains- All negative.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2166-5-7**]
Small stable right pleural effusion and right apical
hydropneumothorax. Opacity at the right lung base which may
represent atelectasis versus airspace disease.
.
LIVER CORE BIOPSY- [**2166-5-5**]
Liver, transjugular biopsy:

1.  Fragmented biopsy with wide fibrous septa, bile-duct
proliferation, and vague nodularity consistent with cirrhosis,
trichrome stain evaluated.
2.  Mild septal and lobular mononuclear infiltration with
scattered apoptotic hepatocytes (grade 2 inflammation).
3.  No prominent cholestasis is seen.
4.  No fatty change is seen.
5.  No iron is seen on special stain

Note:  The findings are consistent with chronic viral hepatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 year old male with history of hepatitis C,
hepatitis B, and bipolar disorder who is currently incarcerated
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management of PNA and pleural effusion.
.
MICU Course:
Pt was transferred from an outside hospital to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU
for further evaluation and management of a recurrent right
pleural effusion and possible PNA. Pt is s/p thoracentesis x 2
at the OSH which revealed a transudative effusion. Pt was
started on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10128**] of ABx for CAP on [**2166-4-20**]. Upon arrival to
the MICU, the pt was hemodynamically stable. Since admission,
the pt was diuresed with Lasix and spironolactone with
significant improvement in his oxygen requirement. He completed
a course of levofloxacin for CAP which was stopped on [**2166-4-27**].
BCx, UCx, and SCx have been NGTD. He is being ruled out for TB
with 2 sputum cultures. PPD placed on [**2166-4-25**] was read as
negative on [**2166-4-27**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and are
planning to pursue a VATS procedure on Tuesday. Etiology of
pleural effusion is hepatic hydrothorax vs. parapneumonic
effusion. Liver was consulted for Hep C/Hep B/Cirrhosis. Liver
is recommending VATS prior to consideration of TIPS procedure.
Hepatitis serologies and viral load pending. HIV negative.
.
Hospital course on the Floor:
Pt underwent VATS pleuradesis with chest tube placement with
evidence for resolution of the effusion.  Chest tube placement
was complicated by re-expansion pulmonary edema, which resolved
with lasix diuresis and high flow oxygen therapy. The patient
did not require intubation. The chest tube was removed three
days after placement. He developed recurrent pleural effusion
despite pleuradesis.  Pleural effusion was transudative in
nature.  Underwent transjugular biopsy for measurement of his
hepatic wedge pressure shown to be 24 (normal <12), with biopsy
revealing chronic active viral hepatitis (full path results
listed above).  Hepatitis Be antigen positive with IGM viral
load greater than 200,000 copies indicated acute Hep B
infection. The patient was started on Adefovir 10mg daily and
should continue until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Liver Clinic
at [**Hospital1 18**].  It is likely this patient had underlying chronic
liver disease, that was well compensated until acute Hep B
infection.  Pt was started on Spironolactone 100mg daily and
lasix 40mg daily diuresis.  He was on higher doses, but
developed hypotension, and has since been stable on the above
regimen.
- Serial Chest xrays should be performed to assess for interval
change in effusion.
- At time of discharge there was no evidence for recurrence of
effusion, the patient may require TIPS in the future should this
recur given evidence of elevated portal pressures.
- Follow up abdominal ultrasound should be considered in the
setting of possible ascites that may develop.

1) Fever/Possible Pneumonia- (AFB negative x3 as above).
Developed fevers [**5-4**] with loculated effusion (However, s/p
pleuradecis last week, s/p chest tube placement) Given recent
instrumentation he was started on broad coverage for HAP with
Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP [**5-4**]. His cultures of pleural fluid,
sputum, urine and blood
