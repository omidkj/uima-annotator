Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The severity of aortic regurgitation may
be underestimated. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric,
directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is bilateral retraction of the
mitral valve.
8. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
9. A moderate left pleural effusion is seen.
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the
results.

POST-CPB: On infusions of epi, neo. AV pacing , then a pacing.
Well-seated mechanical valve in the aortic position. Coronary
flow seen in LMCA and RCA. Trace AI consistent with washing
jets. Preserved ventricular function on inotropic support. LVEF
is now 40%. Trace MR. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30814**] was admitted on [**2156-3-16**] and underwent AVR( mech AVR
#23 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. See operative note for details.
Post operatively he remained intubated and was transferred to
the CVICU in stable condition on epinephrine, phenylephrine,
propofol, and lidocaine drips. He awoke neurologically intact,
was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Vasoactive
medications were weaned after hemodynamic stability was
achieved. Betablockers, diuretics and statin therapies were
initiated and titrated. Chest tubes and temporary pacing wires
were removed per protocol. Coumadin therpay was intiated for
mechanical AVR. He was evaluated and treated by physical therapy
for strength and conditioning. Mr. [**Known lastname 30814**] was cleared for
discharge to home on POD#4 with an INR of 2.0 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
