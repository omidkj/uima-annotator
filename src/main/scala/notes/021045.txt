Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo w/ DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, h/o CVA ([**1-16**]),
trasferrred from OSH c/o interscapular back pain. There found to
have SBP's in 200's, and a CTA revealing a dissection of her
descending thoracic aorta (type B) vs an intramural ulcer,
subsequently transferred to vascular surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation/further management.  In our ED started on Nipride
drip, given lopressor and vitamin K to reverse INR of 3.3. BP
down to 130's/60's, HR 55. Course complicated by ARF, CHF,
NSTEMI (peak CK 520/MBI 11.3, w/ ECG on [**8-20**] showing sinus
@70bpm, Normal axis, TWI in V2-6, I, II, III, AVF) and Delerium.
Made DNR/DNI on [**8-22**] at family meeting.

Studies:
1. Carotid U/S: mild non significant Plaque, luminal narrowing
<40%.
2. CT head ([**8-19**]): chronic small vessel ischemic disease with
multiple bilateral small lacunar infarcts.
3. CT of chest (done at [**Hospital **] Hospital [**2118-8-19**]): [**Location (un) **] type
b dissection involving a small segment of the descending
thoracic aorta, more distal to the dissection is an aneurysm
measuring 5.6x 3.9cm.
4. MRI ([**8-30**]): There is no evidence of dissection involved
within the aorta. Multifocal penetration ulcers are identified
throughout the aorta. There is no evidence however of focal
intramural hematoma. The right common carotid artery is
significantly tortuous. There is a 4.3-cm aneurysm of the
descending thoracic aorta with areas of thickened
atherosclerosis. This reaches its maximum dimension above the
level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. Bilateral pleural effusions
are present.


Problems:
1. Question of aortic dissection: Transferred to vascular
service here after CTA at outside hospital concerning for aortic
dissection. Pt's blood pressure was aggressively controlled with
IV labetalol drip.  However, a MRI/A done here did not show
evidence of aortic dissection but rather multifocal penetration
ulcers along her aorta. No intervention was needed and pt's BP
was able to be adequately controlled on po B-[**Month/Year (2) 7005**] and ACE-I.

2. A on CRF: Etiology likely multifactorial. Our initial
differential included decompensated diastolic CHF(FE Urea found
to be 34%), medications (eosinophils found in her urine), vs a
progression of her dissection into her renal arteries, however
this was ruled out by repeat MRI. She was also found to have b/l
renal artery stenosis clinically significant on the right.  She
refused a diagnostic catheterization with possible stenting. Her
Cr returned to 1.6 on the day of discharge.  She will need
follow up with her PCP to evaluate for diabetic/hypertensive
nephropathy. Pt is to have outpt Cr and K checked. Results to be
sent to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

3. DM. Pt was started on a regular insulin sliding scale with
good effect.  She will need evaluation of her blood glucose by
her PCP and possible initiation of oral hypoglycemic
medications.

4. Diastolic CHF. Pt became clinically overloaded and was
transiently on Natrecor for diuresis as well as prn lasix.  Pt
required O2 via NRB and NC but was successfully weaned off prior
to discharge.  An echocardiogram done on [**2118-8-19**] showed an EF of
~60%, E/A ratio 0.91, no wall motion abnorm, and 1+ AR.  Pt
subsequently suffered a NSTEMI shortly after the echo, therefore
a repeat echo was performed on [**2118-9-1**] which showed an EF of
50-55%, [**1-14**]+AR, and 1+MR (no significant change since prior
Echo). She was d/c'ed on an ACEI for afterload reduction and
given a prescription for lasix to be started if clinically
indicated after she sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

5. Hypothyroidism. Pt continued on her outpt dose of synthroid.
No active issues.

6. NSTEMI. Pt started on a beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Lipitor, which
she tolerated well. Enzymes peaked at 520.  Persantine-MIBI
stress test on [**2118-9-2**] showed moderate reversible defect in the
inferior wall.  However, the pt refused cardiac cath at this
time and she was discharged on medical management as above. She
will follow up in the cardiology clinic.

8. Resp Acidosis--resolved on its own. Thought to be secondary
to episodes of hypoventilation secondary to pain vs. medications
(benzo's, barbituates, narcotics).

9. Delirium--resolved. Etiology thought to be multifactorial.
Differential included metabolic (increased BUN/uremia?) vs.
infection vs. NSTEMI vs. medication in the setting of ARF.
LFT's, TSH, amylase/lipase all were within normal limits.
Benzo's, bendadryl and narcotics were discontinued. Pt was
administered prn zyprexa and haldol at night for increased
confusion with good result.

10. UTI diagnosed by UA. Pt was treated with Levofloxacin.
