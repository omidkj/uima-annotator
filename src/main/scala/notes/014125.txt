Smear analysis by Heme/onc fellow: blasts with granules, no rods
seen; concerning for APML.

OSH CXR: clear

EKG: NSR in the 90s, with PVCs, QTC 475. no ischemic changes

MRI head [**11-29**]: Corresponding to the hypodensity seen on CT,
there is a subacute infarct involving the right occipital lobe.
It shows slow diffusion with increased T2/FLAIR signal. There is
no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. A small focus of
abnormal susceptibility is seen in the right centrum semiovale,
series 7, image 19 with no corresponding hyperintensity on the
CT, likely represents old hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus
or midline shift. Major intracranial flow voids are preserved.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. The visualized orbits and
paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Subacute right occipital infarct may be embolic.
Given the clinical diagnosis of leukemia the possibility of
infarct secondary to thrombosis cannot be entirely excluded.

CT head [**12-2**]: Multiple new hypodensities are noted throughout
the right cerebral hemisphere, most concentrated in the centrum
semiovale, and with regions of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter involvement. There is
diffuse effacement of the right cerebral sulci and right lateral
ventricle.
  Right parafalcine occipital infarct continues to evolve. In
addition, there is new trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
right parietal region. Midline structures are intact, with no
current evidence of cerebral herniation. Dense calcifications
are noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid and vertebral
arteries.

Minimal mucosal thickening is noted throughout the ethmoid air
cells. The
frontal sinuses are underpneumatized. Mastoids are also
underdeveloped, with partial fluid opacification on the left
that may be increased from prior examination. There is
cartilaginous narrowing of the bilateral external auditory
canals, with trace cerumen. Orbits and intraconal structures
appear symmetric.
  IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple new right cerebral hypodensities. Given the absence
of tumor
involvement on recent MR, this finding is most concerning for
embolic
infarcts.
2. Evolving right occipital subacute infarct.
3. New right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
4. Partial mastoid opacification; please correlate clinically
for
mastoiditis.

Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2146-12-6**]: The left atrium is
elongated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
probably noraml and free wall motion appears normal. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate (2+)
eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Unable to adequately assess for patent foramen
ovale/atrial septal defect.
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-11-28**],
ventricular function appears similar. Mitral regurgitation now
appears more prominent. The mitral valve leaflets were not fully
visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo M with hx of COPD, HTN, DM who presents with acute
promyelocytic leukemia,  subsequently developed DIC resulting in
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory failure requiring
intubation and R MCA stroke resulting in left hemiparesis.

# Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress - Patient with SOB and cough x
4 days, fever, hypoxemia and CXR showing diffuse bilateral
infiltrates.  Patient with acute leukemia and functional
neutropenia.  Infectious etiologies initially high on the
differential, including bacterial pneumonia, atypical bacterial
pneumonia.  PCP lower on the differential in acute leukemia.
Viral and fungal infections less likely, but also considered.
ATRA/differentiation syndrome also on the differential, although
patient only received one dose of ATRA at the time of resp
distress.  Alveolar hemorrhage from low platelets also
contributory as patient with hemoptysis.  Pulmonary edema lower
on differential as exam is euvolemic and patient lungs without
crackles.  Leukostasis was entertained but unlikely given WBC
only 50,000.  Chest CT demonstrated multifocal infection (RLL
and RML consolidation likely from aspiration) vs lung hemorrhage
vs leukemic infiltration.  Bronchoscopy reveals diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage and no micro-organisms.  Viral swab was negative.
Treated with Vanc/cefepime 7-day course and azithromycin 5-day
course for HAP.  Platelets transfused to >50 for alveolar
hemorrhage.  Decadron 10 mg IV BID started for treatment of
differentiation syndrome.  Patient intubated for bronchoscopy on
day 2 of admission and kept on PSV overnight.  Extubated on day
3 of admission, but in the evening, had difficulty maintaining
on home setting CPAP and was placed on NIPPV post extubation,
and soon after reintub
