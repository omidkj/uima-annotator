Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
female with a history of HIV/AIDS, end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis and cardiomyopathy, who was admitted with a
complaint of one month of coughing and shortness of breath.
Her cough is productive of a clear to yellowish sputum, and
she has had increasing weakness over the past two weeks.  The
patient denies any fever, chills or weight loss.  She does
complain of some night sweats.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had an oxygen
saturation of 88% in room air.  She also complained of
abdominal pain which is similar to what she has had in the
past.  Previous workup for abdominal pain has been extensive
and unrevealing to date.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile
with heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure 130/80, oxygen
saturation 87% in room air, up to 96% on two liters via nasal
cannula.  A pulseless level of 6 mmHg was measured.  In
general, the patient was comfortable and in no apparent
distress.  The oropharynx was clear with moist mucous
membranes and no lesions.  Pulmonary examination revealed
lungs with crackles at the right base. Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm, with a III/VI systolic
murmur at the apex.  Abdominal examination showed mild left
lower quadrant tenderness which was not reproducible.
Abdomen was soft.  Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies were significant
for a white blood cell count of 4.3, hematocrit 33.0,
platelet count of 212,000.  The MCV was 72.  Panel seven
revealed a blood urea nitrogen of 24, creatinine 5.0.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with right lower lobe
consolidation and a right sided pleural effusion consistent
with congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per
minute, normal axis and intervals, inferolateral T wave
inversions which were new compared to electrocardiogram in
[**2134-11-12**].

A chest CT showed massive cardiomegaly with a pericardial
effusion. Enlarged pulmonary artery was consistent with
pulmonary artery hypertension.  Bilateral pleural effusions
were noted. Two 4.0 to 5.0 millimeter nodules were noted at
the right lung apex which were old compared to prior
examinations.  A subcapsular calcification of the spleen was
suggestive of a prior hematoma.

Transthoracic echocardiogram reconfirmed the pericardial
effusion but did not display any evidence of tamponade.  Of
note, the patient had moderate left ventricular hypertrophy
with moderate global hypokinesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient's shortness of breath was
attributed to congestive heart failure.  More fluid was
removed during the patient's subsequent dialysis treatments,
and serial chest x-rays revealed improvement in the
congestive heart failure and decrease in the size of the
right pleural effusion.  The decision was made that it was
not necessary to tap the pericardial effusion.  Repeat
transthoracic echocardiography on [**2136-11-1**], showed the
presence of a trivial pericardial effusion, much smaller than
before, with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and
moderate global hypokinesis. An ejection fraction was
estimated at 40% at this time.  The patient's symptoms of
shortness of breath had essentially resolved at this point of
her hospitalization.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were
measured on [**2136-10-26**], with a CK of 43 and a troponin I of
7.7.  On [**2136-10-29**], the patient's troponin was noted to be
13.5.  Troponin levels trended downward from here to 6.7 on
[**2136-10-30**], and 5.7 on [**2136-11-3**].  CK levels remained normal
throughout.  Repeat electrocardiograms showed persistent T
wave inversions in the inferolateral leads.  A Persantine
MIBI was performed on [**2136-11-6**].  The patient experienced no
pain or discomfort and no ST changes were observed.  Nuclear
images showed no defects during stress or at rest with no
wall motion abnormalities and an estimated ejection fraction
of 45%.  The etiology of the elevated troponin was thought to
be secondary to pulmonary hypertension and/or congestive
heart failure, with the possibility of a myocarditis or
pericarditis.  It is not believed that the patient has any
coronary artery disease.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient was continued on her
HAART therapy.  She remained afebrile throughout her
hospitalization and did not require any antibiotics for
treatment.  An expectorated sputum showed only oropharyngeal
flora.  Blood cultures drawn on [**2136-10-29**], were negative.
Clostridium difficile test was negative on [**2136-11-5**].  A PPD
with anergy panel was planted and all were negative during
her hospitalization (the patient was anergic).  The patient;s
effusions were thought to be secondary to congestive heart
failure and not tuberculosis given the resolution with
increased fluid removal with dialysis.

3.  Renal - The patient was continued on her regular
hemodialysis schedule.

4.  Endocrine - On [**2136-10-28**], the patient was found on the
floor of her room.  She did not complain of any
light-headedness or diaphoresis.  A blood sugar at the time
was noted to be 10, and the patient was administered ampules
of dextrose 50, started on a dextrose 10 drip, and treated
with glucagon as well as Dexamethasone.  Her blood sugar
remained depressed and required continued boluses of dextrose
50 with Dexamethasone to maintain normal blood sugar.  A
measured insulin level on [**2136-10-28**], was 18 (slightly above
normal), and repeat insulin levels on [**2136-10-29**], and [**2136-10-30**],
were 44 and 41, respectively.  A measured C-peptide level on
[**2136-10-28**], was 5.5 (normal is 0.6-3.2).  Pro insulin and ACTH
levels were pending at the time of discharge.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on [**2136-10-29**], for close blood sugar monitoring.  Her
blood sugar remained stable in the 100 to 200 range while she
was maintained on a dextrose 10 drip and Dexamethasone.  She
was returned to the floor on [**2136-10-30**], and her blood sugar
remained in the normal range thereafter.  All further
supplementation with steroids as well as dextrose infusions
was discontinued and the patient did not have further
abnormal hypoglycemic episodes.  It is believed that the
patient was inadvertently administered an oral hypoglycemic
[**Doctor Last Name 360**], which caused the hypoglycemic episode on [**2136-10-28**].

5.  Pulmonary - The patient's cough persisted, though
decreased in intensity during her hospitalization.  The ace
inhibitor should be considered as a possible etiology of the
patient's cough.  Consideration should be made to change to
an angiotensin receptor blocking [**Doctor Last Name 3
