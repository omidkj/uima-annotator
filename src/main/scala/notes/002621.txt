Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71 M with hx CAD and hyperlipidemia was admitted to [**Hospital 107367**]
Hospital for TURP [**4-24**] (day of admission to CCU).  ASA was held
for sx which proceeded uneventfully.  Postop, he developed CP
and neck pain.  ECG was obtained demonstrating SR in the 70s and
5mm inferior ST elevation; pt was given ASA, nitrates, IV
heparin and xferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the cardiac cath lab, the SVG graft to RCA was down w/biliary
stent visualized.  The lesion was felt to be high risk for
intervention and was thus not intervened upon.  LCx was
occluded.  FIC CO was 7.48.


Past Medical History:
CAD- several right coronary angioplasties in mid [**2096**].  Single
vessel bypass to RCA.  Biliary stent to RCA bypass in [**2112**] c/b
MI.  Report of LV dysfunction following cath; specific EF not
known.
Prostate hypertrophy s/p TuRP
Multiple urinary infections
Ulcerative colitis
Kidney stones
Arthritis
Colonic polyps


Social History:
Former smoker; quit mid [**2119**].  No excess EtOH.  Wife passed away
in recent months.

Cath: Graft to RCA w/large biliary stent not patent.  CO by Fick
7.48.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 M with hx CAD and hyperlipidemia admitted with inferior
MI s/p TURP.
.
IMI: RCA lesion felt to not be ammenable to cath.  Medical
management of AMI to consist of ASA 325 daily, Lipitor 80mg
daily, metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient was restarted on Toprol XL
at outpatient dose of 50mg QD prior to discharge.  He was also
started on cozaar25mg daily.  He is to continue the regimen on
discharge. His cardiac enzymes trended down by time of discharge
- 132 on d/c with peak of 1688 on [**2122-3-25**]. He was walking the
floor without chest pain/sob.  TTE on [**4-27**] revealed 20%EF and:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-23**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
EF severely depressed - out of proportion to damage likely to
occur from his acute event. The etiology of this is likely
ischemia vs HTN. Recommend nuclear stress test or other study
(ie cardiac MR) in future to assess viability of cardiac tissue.
Repeat TTE 1 month to consider ICD placement. F/u with
outpatient cardiologist within 2 weeks.
Plan for outpatient cardiac rehab.
.
S/P TURP- Patient was seen by urology during admission. CBI was
continued until early am of [**2122-4-28**]. Foley then d/c'ed and
patient had no difficulty with urination thereafter. Denied
dysuria. On day of d/c, he was day [**1-26**] of cipro with plans to be
placed back on bactrim ppx after cipro course complete.
.
FEN- Cardiac/HH diet.
