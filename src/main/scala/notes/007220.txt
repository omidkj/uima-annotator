Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 yo F w/ CAD s/p multiple stents and CABG x 1 in
[**2132**] (LIMA to LAD) not on ASA/Plavix, AVR, and GI bleed who
presents s/p cardiac arrest. Per husband pt had some trouble
breathing for last few days. Felt weak last night, poor po.
Tonight she felt poorly, nauseous, uneasy. Had BM and tried to
vomit but was unable to do so. She had elevated blood sugars
around 300 so took an extra Avandia. Tonight, had episode of
gasping for air then stopped breathing- husband started CPR
while she was still on the couch (he ? if she possibly
aspirated) then called 911. This was around 1730. EMS arrived 15
minutes later and gaive 1 shock, epi, lidocaine, atropine.
Patient at that time had wide complex tachycardia without pulse.
She was then inutbated with RSI, fent, rocuronium. Patient went
to [**Hospital1 487**] then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Started on hypothermia at
[**Hospital1 487**] and then continued on admission.
.
In the ED vitals were 130/86, 94, intubated. She was given ASA
325 and Plavix 300. Patient had head CT that showed no head
bleed. She was then started on ASA, Plavix, heparin gtt, and
lidocaine gtt. Once in the CCU an echo was done that showed new
wall motion abnormality. Patient was then taken to cath lab.
.
Of note patient was on plavix for 1 year with many bleeds and
blood transfusions. Still anemic at times and gets epo shots
prn.
.
ROS not completed since patient intubated.

[**2134-7-9**] CXR:
ET tube tip is 4.9 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the
stomach.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is in
unchanged
position at the cavoatrial junction. Widened mediastinum with
engorgement of the vasculature is unchanged. Left lower lobe
atelectasis has markedly
improved. Perihilar and right lower lobe opacities have worsened
and
consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no evident
pneumothorax.
.
[**2134-7-7**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or interictal
epileptiform
discharges were seen. The background was very low voltage on
this day
of recording with some visible beta frequency activity at times.
This
finding suggests the presence of a severe encephalopathy which
can occur
because of hypoxic ischemic injury, medications, metabolic
disturbances,
and other etiologies of diffuse brain dysfunction.
.
[**2134-7-5**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls,
and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.] No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A well seated
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets appear mobile, but the transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation
present is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
stenosis. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Well seated mechanical AVR with mobile leaflets but
increased gradient. Severe mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2134-7-4**] CT head:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel disease. The LMCA had no significant disease. The LAD was

occluded proximally with filling of the mid-vessel in a
retrograde
fashion from the LIMA; the distal LAD filled via minimal
collaterals
from the LCx. The LCx had no significant disease. The RCA was
diffusely
disease and occluded in the mid segment; the distal vessel
filled
antegrade and via collaterals from the LCx.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revaeled the LIMA to be widely
patent up
until the distal anastamosis site with retrograde filling of the
mid LAD
but occlusion of the LAD distal to the graft without the
appearance of
an acute event.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
hypertension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD with occlusion of the LAD distal to the
anastamosis
site of uncertain age not suitable for PCI.
3. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
.
[**2134-7-4**] Echo:
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
The remaining segments are incompletely visualized but appear to
contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic val
