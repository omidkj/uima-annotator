History of Present Illness:
 The pt is a 74y/o F with a PMH of CAD, COPD presenting with
dyspnea. The pt reported acute onset dyspnea starting the day of
admission. She denied CP. She was found to be tachypnic and
hypoxic with sats in low 90s on 3L NC. She was placed on NRB
with O2 sat increased to 100%. No N/V. Pt was noted to be
lethargic and confused.
.
Pt recently hospitalized [**3-12**] with acute cholangitis due to
choledocolithiasis She underwent urgent ERCP with stenting and
was treated with Cipro/flagyl.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.6 BP 133/81 P 114 R 22 O2 sat
100% NRB Patient was given Solu-medrol 125mg IV X1, [**Month/Day (4) 19188**],
[**Month/Day (4) **] 325mg X1. ECG Afib with RVR at 117bpm, NA, LVH with recp. ST
changes. CXR demonstrated left basilar atelectasis and probable
small left pleural effusion. No overt CHF. CTA Chest showed
pulmonary emboli involving the right main pulmonary artery,
right upper lobar/segmental pulmonary artery, and right middle
lobe segmental pulmonary artery. She was started on a heparin
gtt.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is resting comfortably on 3L
NC. Denies CP, states dyspnea is improving. C/o B/L LE pain at
baseline.
.
Uneventful MICU course. HD stable on coumadin. ECHO w/o RV
strain. Should check w/ PCP prior to coumadin as this had not
been started for afib. LE U/S pending.
.
On transfer: She states she feels hungry. She does not know why
she is in the hospital. She denies CP/SOB. She states she feels
itchy. Unable to give further clarification of past medical
history.

CT CHEST PERFORMED ON [**2110-3-21**]

Comparison is made with a prior chest CT scan from [**2109-11-11**] as
well as a prior
chest radiograph from [**2110-3-11**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: 74-year-old woman with dyspnea. Evaluate for
PE.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images
through the chest
prior to and following the uneventful administration of 100 cc
Optiray IV
contrast. Multiplanar reformations were provided.

FINDINGS: A pacer device is noted in the right chest wall with
lead tips
positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle. Non-contrast
imaging
demonstrates coronary artery calcifications. Pneumobilia is
noted in the
upper abdomen.

There is an eccentric filling defect within the right main
pulmonary artery,
best seen on series 3, image 32, which is compatible with a
pulmonary
embolism. Please note recanalized areas within this filling
defect suggest
that this is a chronic pulmonary embolism. There is extension of
this filling
defect into the right upper lobar and anterior segmental
pulmonary arterial
branches. Recanalization through this region also suggests a
non-acute
pulmonary embolism. There is a filling defect also noted within
the right
middle lobe, medial segmental branch of the right pulmonary
artery. This
filling defect is occlusive and appears acute. The remainder of
the pulmonary
arterial branches appear patent. The aorta contains
atherosclerotic
calcification, though is normal in caliber. The heart is
enlarged without
pericardial effusion. There is no lymphadenopathy. The airway is
centrally
patent. There is bronchial wall thickening especially in the
right upper
lobe, which is unchanged from prior exam.

Lung windows reveal confluent ground-glass opacity in the lungs
which is most
apparent in the right upper lobe. This finding is unchanged and
is likely
related to advanced RB-ILD (desquamative interstitial
pneumonia). A nodule is
again noted in the left lower lobe on series 3, image 48, which
measures 6 mm.
Compressive atelectasis is noted at the lung bases bilaterally
in the lingula,
left lower lobe, and portions of the right lower lobe. There is
no pleural
effusion.

In the visualized upper abdomen, there is a small hiatal hernia
and
pneumobilia is identified within the liver. Pneumobilia is new
from prior CT
and clinical correlation is advised. Please note, patient has
prior ERCP
dated [**2110-3-11**] and findings are likely secondary to prior
sphincterotomy.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is
seen.
Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli involving the right main pulmonary artery,
right upper
lobar/segmental pulmonary artery, and right middle lobe
segmental pulmonary
artery. Please note, there are likely acute-on-chronic pulmonary
emboli given
the eccentric nature of the filling defects with evidence of
recanalization
through portions of the filling defects.

2. Emphysema with parenchymal ground-glass opacities most
apparent in the
right upper lobe suggestive of advanced respiratory
bronchiolitis.

3. 6-mm left lower lobe nodule, for which followup in [**7-18**]
months is advised.
,
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of RV strain
.
LE U/S: Prelim: NO DVT
