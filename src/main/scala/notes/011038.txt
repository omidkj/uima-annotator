Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for PNA/positive trop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2124**]
and cardiac catheterization earlier this week in [**Hospital 1559**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for treatment of PNA and
positive troponin.
.
Per patient, prior to her cardiac cath, she was having chest
pain at rest, equivalent to her angina that was not responsive
to nitro on Tuesday. Her PCP referred her to the ED at St.
Vincents in [**Hospital1 1559**], where she underwent cardiac cath with no
intervention. The cath showed occluded SVG to RCA and patent
LIMA to LAD.  The chest pain resolved on its own.  She was sent
home but began feeling unwell a few days later with cough,
weakness, fatigue. She reports her roommate during the
hospitalization for cath had a bad pneumonia with the same
symptoms.
.
She presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with these symptoms and was
diagnosed with multifocal PNA. She also had a troponin drawn
that was positive and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for elevated
troponin and PNA.
.
In the ED here, initial VS: 98 84/41 16 97%3L. labs significant
for an elevated troponin to 0.04, CKMB of 8 (normal) and BNP
(5000). ECG revealed lateral 2mm STD (no prior). Cardiology was
consulted in ED and recommended starting heparin gtt.  She had a
CTA here to r/o PE which revealed multifocal PNA but was
negative for PE. She received vanc and levoquin at OSH. She
received Aspirin 325mg PO, oxycodone, and was started on a
heparin drip here at [**Hospital1 18**].  Mild pulmonary edema and elevated
BNP but hypotensive to 80s on admission to our ED. Got 1L NS and
came up to 90s. O2sat has been stable but now trending back down
to the 80s so getting another bolus. Pt notes that her blood
pressures tend to run low. Vital Signs prior to transfer to ICU
from ED are as follows: HR 91, BP 95/52, RR 24, O2sat 98 on 2L
NC.
.
On arrival to the floor patient reports that she has had low
blood pressure for several years (80s/50s) and for this her pcp
took her off of her atenolol. She denies any symptoms and feels
great.

CTA Chest [**2129-12-11**]
FINDINGS: The thoracic aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
calcification, without evidence of acute thoracic aortic
pathology. The ascending thoracic aorta maximally measures 2.5
cm. Extensive coronary arterial calcifications are present. The
patient is status post CABG. There is no pericardial effusion.
  .
The main pulmonary arteries are well opacified up to
subsegmental levels
bilaterally without evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
  .
Multifocal peribronchial nodular opacities are seen within the
right upper
lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe and left upper lobe.
Focal areas of dense consolidation are seen within the right
lower lobe. Reactive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present. These findings are
concerning for
multifocal pneumonia. There is mild septal thickening and small
right pleural effusion, consistent with a mild degree of
pulmonary edema. Mild centrilobular emphysema is present.
 .
This study is not tailored for evaluation of the
sub-diaphragmatic organs.  The image portion of the liver and
spleen are unremarkable. Incidental note of an accessory left
hepatic artery is made. A small hiatal hernia is present.
 .
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection
or
malignancy are detected. The patient is status post median
sternotomy for
CABG.
  .
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology.
2. Multifocal peribronchial nodular opacities within the entire
right lung
and left upper lobe are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Reactive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a small right pleural effusion.
Recommend a follow up chest CT after the acute episode to rule
out underlying pulmonary nodules.
3. Mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2129-12-13**]
FINDINGS: A single upright portable chest radiograph was
obtained. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.
There is increasing opacification of the right lower lobe,
consistent with worsening pneumonia.
In the course of reviewing prior imaging, a lesion was
identified at the apex of the right lung that could be a nodule
or may be secondary to an infectious process. There is a small
right effusion. Surgical clips are seen over the left
hemithorax.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Right apical nodule or infection. Followup of this lesion is
recommended.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
.
ECHO [**12-12**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
