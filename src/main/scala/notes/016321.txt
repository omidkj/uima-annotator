Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
80-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma,
diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for a cardiac
catheterization.  The patient initially complained of acute
onset of substernal chest pain associated with shortness of
breath while in the shower on the morning of admission.  Her
initial EKG showed ST elevations in V4 and the lateral leads.
She was given aspirin, nitroglycerin, heparin, and Lopressor.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal range.  Her cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 10% occlusion of the right
coronary artery, 20% occlusion of proximal LAD, 60% occlusion
of mid LAD with possible dissection and residual unstable
plaque, and a small fistula between the left circumflex and
left atrium.  A cipher stent was placed in the mid LAD
without residual stenosis.  An echocardiogram demonstrated an
EF of 25-30%, moderately dilated left atrium, severe mitral
annular calcification with 1+ MR, 1+ TR, left ventricular
hypertrophy to akinesis with some basal preservation of
function, trace AR, and small pericardial effusion.  Her
initial cardiac pressures were right atrium 5, right
ventricle 35/1, PA 30/15, wedge 13, left ventricle 115/83.

The patient had a cardiac catheterization which was
complicated by a right bundle branch block, probably
secondary to placement of a PA catheter.  EP evaluated the
patient and did not intervene.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroid.
2.  Multiple myeloma.  Oncologist:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 24344**].  The patient
has had an indolent course.  Her last bone marrow biopsy in
[**2130-6-27**] showed 13% plasma cells.  She was initially
diagnosed in approximately [**2124**] with pancytopenia.  In the
past, she was treated with Melphalan but is not currently
under treatment.
3.  IgG gammopathy.
4.  Anemia:  The patient had a negative anemic workup in [**2130-5-28**].  She receives Procrit every two weeks to q. month
depending on her hematocrit level.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Diabetes.
7.  Diabetic gastroparesis.

PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  Her family is very
involved.  She does not have a history of smoking or alcohol
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for CAD.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile,
heart rate 82, blood pressure 130/68.  General:  The patient
was an elderly female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Moist
mucous membranes.  No JVD.  Crackles inferiorly.  Heart:  S1,
S2.  There was a I/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  Warm, dry, no edema.  There was 2+ dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.  No groin hematoma.
Abdomen:  Benign.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times
three.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The EKG pre catheterization
revealed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, normal
intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads I and aVL, [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depression inferiorly with poor R wave progression.

Post catheterization EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 86, left
axis deviation, QRS at 126, left anterior fascicular block, T
wave inversion in V1 through V5, II, and aVL, resolution of
ST changes.

Cardiac output:  4.2.  Cardiac index:  2.3.  SVR [**2145**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80-year-old female with a
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and
multiple myeloma who presents with an acute MI, who was found
to have a low ejection fraction.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had a cipher stent
placed to her mid LAD.  The patient was maintained on beta
blocker, aspirin, Plavix, and a statin.  Her Lipitor dose of
10 was increased to 80.  Initially the patient was placed on
hydralazine and Imdur for preload and after reduction.  A few
days after cardiac catheterization, she was started on an ACE
inhibitor, however, the next morning her creatinine bumped
from 1.3 to 1.6 and, therefore, the ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  Hydralazine and Imdur were restarted.  The
plan is for the patient to be restarted on an ACE inhibitor
as an outpatient and see if her creatinine is effected.  The
patient had a cholesterol panel, triglyceride elevated at
160, HDL 41, LDL 57, and cholesterol of 130.  In addition,
the patient had baseline LFTs prior to starting statin that
showed an ALT of 32, AST 53 (likely elevated from cardiac
injury), alkaline phosphatase 103, and total bilirubin 0.6,
within normal limits except for the elevated AST.  The
patient's CPK peaked at 151.  The patient will follow-up with
her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She will most likely need a
repeat echocardiogram within a month or two to evaluate for
function.  Although she had a low EF and global hypokinesis,
she was not anticoagulated because she has low platelets at
baseline.

2.  LOW EJECTION FRACTION:  The patient's low ejection
fraction is unlikely to be explained entirely by her mid LAD
lesion.  She probably has underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy,
however, her ventricle size was within normal limits.  In the
setting of multiple myeloma, the diagnosis of cardiac amyloid
was entertained, however, multiple myeloma is extremely
indolent according to her oncologist, unlikely to be
associated with amyloid.  In addition, her echocardiogram did
not show evidence of amyloid infiltrate.  She was not
anticoagulated for this low EF secondary to her
thrombocytopenia.

3.  DIABETES:  The patient was maintained on Reglan for
gastroparesis and insulin.  Prior to discharge, she was
restarted on her Avandia and her normal dose of NPH and
regular insulin.

4.  INCREASED CREATININE ON ADMISSION:  The patient received
Mucomyst and post catheterization hydration for renal
protection.  As her creatinine trended down, an ACE inhibitor
was started.  The day after the ACE inhibitor was started,
her creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 1.6.  It is unclear what
her baseline creatinine is, however, the ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  At the same time, the patient was hyponatremic
and her BUN had increased.  She was slightly volume
overloaded on examination and, therefore, was diuresed.  The
etiology for the increased creatinine is most likely mild CHF
and not related to the ACE inhibitor.  She will likely be
able to be started on an ACE inhibitor as an outpatient.

5.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was maintained on a beta
blocker and hydralazine.

6.  ANEMIA:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable during
her hospitalization.

7.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient's thrombocytopenia was low
but was within normal limits during her hospitalization.

8.  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient was maintained on Levoxyl.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged to a
rehabilitation center.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable, tolerating p.o. diet.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Low ejection fraction 25%.
3.  Systolic heart failure.
4.  Renal insufficiency.
5.  Diabetes.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Thrombocytopenia.
8.  Hypothyroidism.
9.  Multiple myeloma.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
within the next two weeks.  As an outpatient, she will be
started on an ACE inhibitor as her creatinine tolerates and
at that time, Imdur and hydralazine will be discontinued.

1.  Aspirin 325 once a day.
2.  Plavix 75 once a day.
3.  Atorvostatin 80 once a day.
4.  Amitriptyline 25 q.h.s.
5.  Reglan 10 p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Toprol 25 q.d.
