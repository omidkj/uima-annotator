Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with argon ablation and lung biopsy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 y.o. man with a history of COPD, HTN and recurrent
NSCLC presenting with hemoptysis. On the evening prior to
admission, the patient had multiple episodes of hemoptysis with
bloody sputum. The patient went to sleep and awoke at 5AM with
further bloody sputum production. On the way to the ED, the
patient coughed up an estimated [**11-19**] cups of frank blood by
report of the patient's son. In the ED, the patient was noted to
have stable vital signs with a stable hematocrit and
radiographic evidence of progression of his known RUL mass. The
patient was admitted for further management.
.
The patient was initially diagnosed approximately 30 years ago
with non-small cell lung cancer and underwent a Left upper
lobectomy at that time. He was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 359**] with
hemoptysis requiring intubation, found to have a new RUL mass
and underwent bronchoscopy with laser excision found on
pathology to be undifferentiated large cell CA. The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course was complicated by a PE without DVT's and was
discharged on lovenox. Staging screening revealed locally
advanced disease with Right hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. PET and CT did reveal other lesions including
renal and splenic masses felt to not be consistent with
metastatic disease. The patient was seen by outpatient Heme/Onc
and CT surgery. Outpatient recommendations from [**Hospital **]
included combined chemo and radiation therapy. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] of CT
surgery saw the patient within the past 2-3 weeks. By report of
the patient and his son, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] wanted to proceed with
possible surgical resection of the mass. The patient underwent
pre-op evaluation including outpatient stress testing. The
patient was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy on Thursday
[**10-24**] for further biopsy and imaging of the lesion.
.
ROS: Denies fevers, chills, nightsweats, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, chest pain.

Past Medical History:
Onc History: NSCLC first diagnosed at age 45 s/p Left upper
lobectomy at age 45 without adjuvant therapy at that time. The
patient presented to an OSH on [**2160-9-5**] with massive hemoptysis
requiring intubation. Bronchospopy revealed obstructive lesion
of the Right mainstem due to a RUL tumor. The patient underwent
tumor excision with rigid bronchoscopy. Pathology revealed
undifferentiated large cell CA. The patient underwent staging
scans. PET scan from [**2160-10-2**] demonstrates an FDG avid right
hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, there was an unusual
focus of FDG uptake and soft tissues prominence along the left
posterior psoas of unclear significance. He had a CT of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**2160-9-14**], which demonstrated
pulmonary embolus, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy,
ground glass and consolidative opacities concerning for
hemorrhage, marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper
lobe, nonspecific pulmonary nodules, several subcentimeter vague
hypoattenuating foci in the liver, a large 3 to 4 cm nonspecific
lesion in the spleen, and a 30 mm lesion along the lower pole of
the left kidney. A [**Year (4 digits) 500**] scan on [**2160-9-15**] showed no definitive
evidence for metastatic disease.  An MRI of the head on
[**2160-9-14**] showed no evidence of intracranial metastases.
.
PMH:
CAD status post three angioplasties, with the last requiring
stenting all of which occurred approximately 13 years ago.
Patient underwent recent stress test as part of pre-op eval for
possible lung mass excision.
HTN
COPD

Social History:
Lives with family and worked 25 years as a plumber. Has a 60
pack year history of smoking and has been exposed to asbestos in
the past. He socially drinks alcohol.


Family History:
Mother died at 82 of stomach CA. Brother with unknown CA death
at 76. Sister with [**Name2 (NI) 500**] CA at 53. Daughter with breast CA in her
40's.


Physical Exam:
 VS 97.1 72 149/67 18 95% RA
 Gen: Well appearing. NAD.
 Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
 HEENT: PERRL. Pink, moist oral mucosa without lesions.
 CV: RRR. Normal S1 and S2. No M/R/G.
 Pulm: Decreased breath sounds in the RUL and LUL.
 Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
 Ext: No edema.
 Neuro: A&Ox3. Grossly intact.
 Psych: Appropriate mood and affect.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal axis and intervals. No acute ST or T
wave changes.
.
CTA chest ([**2160-10-20**]): 1. Increase in size of right hilar
enhancing mass with probable extension into the right main stem
bronchus.  This results in partial occlusion of the right main
stem bronchus, but there are no postobstructive changes. 2.
Near complete resolution of right lower lobe airspace opacities
seen on the prior examination.
3.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.  The possible filling
defect in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery has resolved. 4.
Unchanged appearance of emphysematous and fibrotic changes in
the right upper lobe.
.
Portable CXR ([**2160-10-20**]): Near complete resolution of right lower
lobe consolidation, with unchanged right upper lobe opacities.
Right hilar neoplastic mass slightly increased on the concurrent
CT.
.
PET Scan ([**2160-10-2**]):  1. FDG avid right hilar mass and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 2. Unusual focus of FDG uptake in a
soft tissue prominence along the left posterior psoas of unclear
[**Name2 (NI) 68402**]. The location of this lesion is not typical of
metastatic disease. 3. FDG uptake associated with a previously
described indeterminate 13 mm left renal lesion, along the left
lower pole. The FDG uptake heightens concern for a solid nodule
such as a renal cell carcinoma.
.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**2160-9-15**]): No evidence of lower
extremity DVT.
.
MRI ([**2160-9-14**]):  No evidence of intracranial metastasis.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] Scan ([**2160-9-15**]): No definite evidence for osseous
metastases.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2160-9-14**]): 1. Appearance raising concern for the
possibility of a pulmonary embolus in a right lower lobe branch
of the right pulmonary artery, although indeterminate. 2.
Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. 3.  Bibasilar mixed
ground-glass and consolidative opacities, which given their
recent onset, are most suspicious for an infection,
inflammation, or in the appropriate clinical setting,
hemorrhage. 4.  Marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper
lobe. 5.  Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, for which short-term
followup is recommended. 6.  Several subcentimeter vague
hypoattenuating foci in the liver which are nonspecific.
Metastatic disease cannot be excluded. 7.  Large 3-4 cm
nonspecific lesion in the spleen.  To evaluate the significance
of this finding, further correlation with prior studies could be
most helpful. 8.  A 13 mm lesion along the lower pole of the
left kidney with indeterminate
characteristics and too small to characterize here.  It could be
helpful to use an ultrasound to determine whether this
definitely represents a mildly dense cyst, if clinically
indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o. man with a history of COPD, HTN and recurrent NSCLC
presenting with hemoptysis.
.
# Hemoptysis secondary to the patient's known RUL mass with
bronchus involvement. On most recent admission, the patient
suffered significant bleeding requiring intubation for airway
protection. Patients HCT was stable throughout his hospital
course.  Because of his increased hemoptysis, the patient was
transfered to the MICU.  IP was made aw
