CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint on admission
was lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  (Via a translator, the patient
is Spanish-speaking)  A 64-year-old male who complains of
intermittent headache times two weeks and lethargy times one
week.  Also complains of increasing right-sided tremulousness
over the past week.  Tremulousness had been noticed in the
past after a cerebrovascular accident.  The patient has also

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history is
significant for)

descending artery with an ejection fraction of 40%, global
hypokinesis, and mildly elevated pulmonary artery
hypertension, severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of
0.7 cm2.
2.  He had a gastrointestinal bleed in the past with a
colonoscopy in [**2119-2-23**] which showed colonic ulcers
consistent with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use.  A
repeat colonoscopy in [**Month (only) **] was negative for ulcers.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a left atrial
thrombus.

moved to the United States in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  He quit
tobacco times 35 years.  No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Physical examination at
the time of admission revealed vital signs with temperature
of 97.9, heart rate 68, blood pressure 98/63, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters.  Alert and
talkative, in no acute distress.  Pupils were equally round
and reactive to light.  Right surgical pupil.  No jugular
venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  A regular rate and
rhythm.  Positive aortic stenosis murmur.  Diminished breath
sounds bilaterally, bibasilar rales.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  No masses.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Periphery revealed no edema.  No clubbing or
cyanosis.  No calf tenderness.  Neurologically nonfocal with
right hand paresis.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory data at the time of
admission revealed sodium of 133, potassium 4.2, chloride 95,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 139.  White
blood cell count 5.8, hematocrit 25, platelets 625.
Calcium 8.8, magnesium 1.9.  Digoxin level 0.4.  PT 18,
PTT 28, INR 2.1.  ALT 14, AST 47, alkaline phosphatase 84,
total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 3.3, amylase 40, lipase 13.
Urinalysis was negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Head CT revealed old left cerebellar
infarct, old left occipital calcification.

Chest x-ray revealed bilateral small pleural effusions with
atelectasis.  No change from prior study.

Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 63, with
normal axis and intervals, slight lateral ST depressions and
J point elevation in V2 through V3; unchanged from
[**9-1**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The Gastrointestinal and the Neurology
Services were consulted.  The patient was transfused with
packed cells shortly after admission.   Prior to admission he
had been scheduled for an aortic valve replacement at the end
of [**Month (only) **], and so Cardiothoracic Surgery was notified of
the patient's admission.

The patient also had a chest CT and an upper gastrointestinal
series.  The upper gastrointestinal showed transient spasms
in the middle to distal esophagus; however, following 2 units
of packed red blood cells the patient's hematocrit remained
stable, and no further endoscopic procedures were scheduled.
The patient also underwent a speech and swallow evaluation.
The patient also had a chest CAT scan which showed persistent
ground glass/solid nodule of the left apex with a morphology
suggestive of bronchoalveolar cancer.  A right lower lobe
opacity consistent with atelectasis, and adjacent pleural
thickening, and thickening of the esophageal wall in the
subcarinal region, as well as several mediastinal nodes in
the aorticopulmonary window, right paratracheal and
paracarinal areas.  This showed no changes compared with a
prior chest CT except for the enlarged nodules.  No further
workup of this was pursued at that time.

The patient's swallow study was significant for mild
oropharyngeal swallowing dysfunction.  Diet was to consist of
ground solids with honey thickened liquids and aspiration
precautions.

Following his medical workup the patient was scheduled for
his aortic valve replacement; however, due to equipment
difficulties in the operating room, aortic valve replacement
was postponed.  Following the postponement of the patient's
surgery, it was noted that his sodium level had fallen to a
level of 125.  He was therefore seen by the Renal Service,
and after being cleared by the Renal Service was brought to
the operating room on [**10-2**], where he under coronary
artery bypass graft times one with a vein graft to the
posterior descending artery as well as an aortic valve
replacement with a #21 pericardial tissue valve and a maze.
The patient tolerated the operation well.  Please see the
Operative Report for full details.  He was transferred from
the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient was AV paced at a rate
of 90.  He had a mean arterial blood pressure of 75, a
central venous pressure of 15.  He was transferred on a
Milrinone infusion as well as Neo-Synephrine infusion.  At
the time of transfer he had an arterial line, a Swan-Ganz
catheter, two ventricular and two atrial pacing wires, and a
mediastinal chest tube.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was weaned off all cardioactive infusions.  His anesthesia
was reversed, and the patient was weaned from and extubated
shortly after arrival in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  He remained hemodynamically stable overnight on the
day of his operation, and on postoperative day one his
Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.  His chest tubes were
removed, and he was transferred to Far Six for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Following his surgery, the patient was seen by the
Electrophysiology Service given his previous history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and to comment on the need for
beta blocker and amiodarone use in the postoperative period,
as well as the need for continued pacemaker use to maintain
hemodynamic stability in the postoperative period.

Over the next several days, the patient's hemodynamic status
and underlying cardiac rhythm were monitored.  On
postoperative day four, it was decided that he would require
a permanent pacemaker, and he was brought to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory at that time where he underwent
placement of a permanent pacemaker.  Please see the
catheterization laboratory report for full details.  In
summary, at that time he underwent permanent pacemaker
placement with a DDD pacemaker.  There were no complications
on the permanent pacemaker implantation.

Following the permanent pacemaker implantation, the patient
was restarted on Coumadin.  He continued to be seen by
Physical Therapy, and his activity level was advanced over
the next several days.   On postoperative day eight, it was
decided that the patient was stable and ready for discharge
to home with support of the [**Hospital6 407**] and
home physical therapy.
