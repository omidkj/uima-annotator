This 73 year old white male has a past medical history
significant for increased hypercholesterolemia and a question
of transient ischemic attack one year prior to admission and
reports a [**1-2**] year history of light-headedness attributed to
Atenolol which has been monitored by the patient's
cardiologist.  He reports attempting to rise from a chair
approximately two months ago at which time he became very
light-headed and fell.  He denies loss of consciousness or
head injury.

He subsequently went to his primary care physician who
referred him to a neurologist.  Carotid duplex studies were
performed which revealed no evidence of stenosis.  His
Atenolol was switched to Cardizem and his light-headedness
subsided.  He was referred for a stress Thallium which
revealed moderate anterior apical wall deficits and moderate
partially reversible septal defect.  The cardiac
catheterization was done on [**10-4**] which revealed the left
ventricle had an ejection fraction of 64% with no arm motion
abnormalities.  He had a 40% proximal right coronary artery
stenosis and 80% proximal left anterior descending lesion,
60% mid left anterior descending lesion, 80% diagonal-1
lesion, a 90% OM-1 lesion and a 70% OM-3 lesion.  He is now
admitted for coronary artery bypass graft.

artery to the left anterior descending, reverse saphenous
vein graft to the OM-2 and OM-4, cross clamp time was 58
minutes, total bypass time 83 minutes.  He was about to be
transferred from the bed to the Operating Room table and was
noted to have massive hemoptysis.  He required a rigid

He had a bronchial block replaced and was transferred to the
