Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
36F with h/o severe persistent asthma, pericarditis, recently
discharged after bronchiothermoplasty procedure complicated by
asthma exacerbation returns to the ED with worsened dyspnea. She
had been home less than 24 hours and felt that her breathing
became acutely worse, she took prednisone 60 x1 and rescue
inhalers without improvment peak flow measured at home was 300
(typically 350-370), she came into the ED for evaluation.
She has had severe asthma since her first pregnancy leading to
several hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 3278**], and at [**Hospital1 18**], requiring ICU
admission for close monitoring (no intubations).
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 81964**] for asthma exacerbation
following bronchiothermoplasty of RLL. Her course as compliacted
by tachypenia and tachycardia prompting transfer to the MICU for
close monitoring. She was given heliox and ativan with
improvement of her symptoms. She had a LENI for calf pain which
was negative for DVT. She was transferred back to the floor
however returned to the MICU due to persistent dyspnea and
tachycardia. She was evaluated by ENT who found the patient to
have [**Date range (1) 81965**] vocal fold motion which could be contributing
to her symptoms. It was recommended that she start a reflux
regimen (omeprazole) and follow up with ENT in [**1-16**] weeks. She
was discahrged on a prednisone taper (60mg decreasing by 10mg
every 3 [**Known lastname **]) with IP and ENT follow up.
Initial VS in the ED:97 104 151/85 22 97%. Peak flow was 340.
Exam notable for poor air movement and wheezes, occasional
"barking cough". Labs notable for WBC 12.6 89% PMN Cr 0.8 UCG
negative.
Patient was given Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs x3,
MethylPREDNISolone 125mg, Lorazepam 1mg IV for anxiety and 1L
IVNS. VS prior to transfer: 98.1 84 139/82 20 100% Peak flow
repeated at 340.

On the floor, she complains of continued sharp right sided chest
pain since bronchiothermoplasty pain is made worse by deep
inhalation and exhalation. She has been coughing and
occasionally bringing up yellow mucous. Temperature at home was
100.1.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 36 year old female with PMH severe asthma recently admitted
s/p
bronchialthermoplasty for asthma exacerbation returns to the
hospital with asthma excerbation.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial. Asthma exacerbation is very
common after bronchialthermoplasty (90%) though her peak flow is
approximately baseline. Her [**Month/Day/Year 81965**] vocal fold motion also
likely contributing along with anxiety. Less likely to be
pneumonia, as CXR showed improveds right sided infiltrate which
is likely post-procedural edema. Patient received
Methylprednisolone IV 125mg in ED along with nebs. Given
patient's baseline peak flow is 350-370 and her current peak
flow is 340, we restarted her steroid taper at Prednisone 40mg
PO. Continued Albuterol, Impratropium nebs, Advair, Flovent.
Started Lorazepam for her anxiety.

# [**Month/Day/Year **] Vocal Fold Motion: seen on laryngoscopy in prior
admission and may contribute to current dyspnea. Continued
omeprazole and ranitidine. Will get close follow-up as an
outpatient with speech & swallow.

# Chest pain: right sided and pleuritic, likely related to
inflammation following bronchiothermoplasty and patient's cough.
EKG does not show any ischemic change. Pain controlled by
oxycodone.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- follow up BCx
