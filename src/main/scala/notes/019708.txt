times three, decreased sensation in the lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
of 4, with a hematocrit of 33.7; 81% polys, 10% lymphocytes,
and 7.9% monocytes.  PT of 11.2, PTT of 26.1, INR of 0.9.
Sodium of 143, potassium of 3.5, chloride of 99, bicarbonate
of 36, BUN of 1.9, glucose of 241.  AST 29, ALT 22, creatine

Vitamin B12 was 574, folate of 4.9.  Toxicology screen was
negative.  Urinalysis had 3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 to 2
red blood cells, moderate bacteria, greater than 300 protein.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated by Neurology
consultation who noted that the etiology of her falls were
likely multifactorial including diabetic neuropathy,
autonomic dysfunction, possible steroid myopathy, and visual
deficits.  She was also noted to have a low-grade fever on
admission and underwent a fever workup.

Three days after admission, the patient developed shortness
of breath and hypoxia during routine hemodialysis and was
felt to be in acute pulmonary edema.  The patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Unit where she was subsequently
ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.  While in
the unit, [**1-1**] blood cultures from the fistula tested positive
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and her
urine grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.  The
patient was given vancomycin and linezolid for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

The patient returned to the floor on [**10-12**] in stable
condition.  Her gallium scan revealed questionable abdominal
activity in the cecal area and delay scan in several days was
recommended.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Instructions to come back for a
follow-up gallium scan.  She will have nursing services at
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Pulmonary edema.
3.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  NPH insulin 30 units every morning and 20 units at night.
5.  Regular insulin 10 units every morning.
6.  Prednisone 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
