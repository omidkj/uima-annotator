Chief Complaint:
Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2145-1-8**], [**2145-1-12**]


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o F with PMHx as below, otherwise significant for recurrent
sigmoid diverticulitis and severe COPD, admitted to OSH on [**12-29**]
with SOB, malaise, and elevated WBC.  A CXR showed an infiltrate
in the RML c/w pneumonitis.  A CT abd/pelvis showed RML
infiltrate, no evid of diverticulitis.  Her VS were sig for mild
hypoxia to 91% on RA -> 96% 2L NC.  She was admitted to their
medical floor and treated with Zosyn for CAP due to her recent
hospitalization.  She was also placed on IV SoluMedrol &
nebulizers to cover a possible COPD exacerbation.  A Chest CT
obtained on [**1-4**] showed a large hiatal hernia (old) with large
amt of food impaction and ? chronic aspiration (patchy RML and
LLL infiltrates).  GI was consulted who performed an EGD on [**1-6**]
which revealed esophagitis and fresh blood at the distal end of
the esphoagus which was injected twice with epi.  A large amt of
clots were seen in the stomach without other etiology.  A repeat
hct showed a hct of 27 (36 on admission?) and 1u pRBC was given.
 10mg SC Vit K was given for an INR of 1.7.  Hct bumped to 34,
then back down to 27.  A repeat EGD on [**1-7**] again demonstrated
showed active bleeding in the distal esophagus with large amt of
clots in the stomach.  Due to poor visibility, no further action
was taken.  An addt'l unit of pRBC was given, Protonix gtt was
started, and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat
EGD/intervention.   Given her GIB her steroids were returned to
her home dose of 5mg of prednisone.
.
On arrival, pt c/o epigastric abd pain, radiating to the LUQ.
She denies any recent N/V, hematemesis, BRBPR, or hematochezia.

any F/chills, productive cough, chest pain, dysuria, or any
other symptom.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o F with PMHx as below, otherwise significant for recurrent
sigmoid diverticulitis and severe COPD, admitted to OSH on [**12-29**]
with CAP, found to have UGIB
.
# UGIB: Has long-standing history of severe GERD and esophagitis
however no h/o GIB; had prior esophageal resection for
dysphagia, found to have stricture. s/p EGD x 2 during
admission, no evidence of active bleeding seen however initial
EGD showed blood in stomach; and biopsy showed esophagitis.
Hematocrit remained stable during admission, she did not require
any blood transfusions here although she received 2U at OSH.
H.pylori serology negative. Continued pantoprazole daily,
however also added carafate prior to discharge for abdominal
pain.
.
# Abdominal pain: Localized to LUQ & epigastric area. Unclear
etiology, improved during pt's stay. Etiology still unclear as
EGD done unrevealing, however biopsy showed esophagitis. Pain
control with dilaudid prn, pain improved during stay. Pt to f/u
with PCP for further evaluation.
.
# COPD: Pt with significant COPD, on oxygen as needed at home.
Had initially been treated at OSH hospital with high dose
steroids, tapered down to home regimen prednisone 5mg po daily.
Her O2sats were adequate here, did not require oxygen. We
continued her on home regeimn advair, spiriva and nebs as
needed.
.
# DM: Well controlled on admission, held lantus 7U at bedtime
while on clear liquid diet. Resumed prior to discharge.
.
# HTN: Restarted pt on home regimen of furosemide 20mg po daily
prior to discharge. Had been held on admission due to UGIB.
.
# Osteoporosis: Continued pt on home regimen Evista.
.
# Leukocytosis: Resolved prior to discharge, had been treated
for CAP at OSH with 10day course of zosyn, also ?leukemoid
reation from steroids. No evidence of active infection as
afebrile without leukocytosis. No antibiotics.
.
Pt reached maximal hospital benefit and was discharged home to
follow up with Gastroeneterology as well as PCP.
