History of Present Illness:
(History based on accounts of patient's daughter,
daughter-in-law, home caregiver, EMS and OSH records)
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation (not on coumadin), hypertension, DVT's, and colon
CA 7 years ago, who was found unresponsive lying on her right
side on the day of presentation by a neighbor.  She lives alone
and has a neighbor who is her nurse-caregiver several mornings a
week.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was last seen normal about 12 hours before
she was found.  Her daughter-in-law reportedly called her the
evening prior and there was no answer, and called her again in
the morning, became concerned, and notified her neighbor, who
called EMS.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was found lying on her right side next
to her recliner with her right arm and leg entangled in the
chair.  She had some edema overlying her right scalp and her
right arm and leg were also edematous.  She was not responsive,
not talking or following commands, and not moving her right side
as well as the left.  She was brought to the [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital
ED, where she arrived at 1:17 p.m.  There her initial blood
pressure was recorded as 67/45, HR 130, RR 24, T 100.8 axillary.
 Blood glucose was 317.  Due to her somnolence she was
intubated, for which she received lidocaine, rocuronium,
etomidate, succinylcholine, ativan 4 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg at
about 2 p.m.  She was also given NS IV with improvement in her
blood pressure. On exam there prior to intubation she was noted
to have left gaze deviation and "withdrawal with all four
extremities."  Labs were significant for a wbc of 18.5, INR of
1.32, and UA with 37 wbc. CK was elevated at 863, MB fraction
was pending. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Upon arrival at 5 p.m. she was afebrile, with BP 220/110, HR
109, RR 20.  She had received no sedation since 2 p.m., but was
not responsive to voice, and did not move her right side as well
as the left. Neurosurgery was consulted and she received 1 gram
Dilantin, 50g Mannitol, 10 mg Decadron, and ultimately required
a labetalol drip to control her blood pressures.  She had a
CT/CTA of the head which revealed acute subarachnoid and
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal, parietal, and
temporal lobes.  There was evidence of edema with sulcal
effacement on the left and 2 mm of midline shift.  CTA was not
suspicious for a mass lesion.  She received propofol 10 mg at 6
p.m. for the CT but has had no sedating medications since then,
without any improvement in her mental status.  When it was
determined that Neurosurgery would not be admitting her, the
Neurology service was consulted, 3 hours after the patient's
arrival to the ED.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] has not been feeling well for several weeks,
sometimes not getting out of bed in the morning.  Her family are
not aware of any specific recent illnesses, although her
daughter thinks she may have had a mild heart attack two weeks
ago.  Her daughter reports that she has been falling a lot
lately, and hitting her head.  It sounds like she loses
consciousness with the falls, as she once said she woke up after
falling down the stairs and didn't recall that she had fallen.

Review of systems:  Not definitively known per nurse or
daughter.

Physical Exam:
Exam on presentation to neurology service:
T  99.8  HR 90's  BP 160/80   RR 19  Pulse Ox 99%
General appearance: 85 year old woman intubated in NAD
HEENT:  Wearing C-spine collar
CV: Irreg irreg, distant heart sounds, no gallops or murmurs
audible
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender
Extremities: Bilateral pitting edema in LE's with abrasions
scattered over right LE

Mental Status: Intubated, not sedated.  Eyes closed. No

daughter squeezes her left hand to command for her.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light
3>2. Does not blink to threat on right. Left gaze preference,
can get eyes to midline but not past.  Unable to assess OCR due
to C-spine collar.  Corneals present bilaterally.  Difficult to
assess facial symmetry due to ETT, grimaces bilaterally to nasal
tickle, maybe a bit less on the right.  Does not cough/gag on
ETT.

Motor System: Tone flaccid in right arm, less so in legs,
paratonia with  rigidity in left arm.  Rarely spontaneously
moves left arm but not purposefully.  Able to wiggle fingers
with left arm, withdraws to noxious stimuli.  No movement of
right arm, grimaces but does not move with noxious.  Weakly
withdraws both legs to noxious, left a bit more vigorously than
right. No spontaneous movement of legs.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric in the upper
extremities, 2+ at the patellae, absent at the Achilles. No
clonus. Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally.  No
[**Doctor Last Name 937**].

Sensory: Responds to noxious stimuli in all four extremities as
above.
