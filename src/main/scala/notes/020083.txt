"laying on my chest". It was not worse with exertion, but was
worse when lying down sometimes.
.
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG revealed no ischemic changes. She was given 20
IV hydralazine without significant reduction in her blood
pressure, then started on a nitroprusside drip. CT head showed
no bleed, and she was given aspirin, morphine, and tylenol for
the chest pain. CXR was clear. She was admitted to the MICU for
hypertensive urgency.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
-Chest Xray ([**2120-4-23**]):  The lungs are clear.  Heart size is top
normal with hilar contours and pleural surfaces appearing
unremarkable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION:  1.  No acute
cardiopulmonary process identified.
.
-CT head without contrast ([**2120-4-23**]):  There is no evidence of
acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus or major vascular
territorial infarction.  Numerous dural calcifications are again
noted.  The normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation is
preserved.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.  There is no osseous abnormality.  The regional
soft tissues are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or other acute
intracranial pathology.
.
-Cardiac ECHO ([**2119-2-17**]):  EF 70%.  Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
.
-EKG ([**2120-4-23**]): NSR at 67, normal axis, no ST elevation or
depression, early R wave progression in lateral leads.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course/Assessment/Plan:
This is a 45 year old woman with history of CHF (EF 70% in [**2119**])
and hypertension who presented to her PCP's office for routine
follow up visit on [**4-23**] and was noted to have blood pressure of
240/140.  She denied any chest pain, visual changes, or
decreased urine output.  Of note, approximately four weeks ago,
her blood pressure regimen was changed from diltiazem to
atenolol.
.
.
1) Hypertensive urgency:
Blood pressure 240/140 in PCP's office on day of admission.  No
evidence of end organ compromise.  Normal creatinine.  CT head
did not reveal evidence of intracranial bleed.  Urine analysis
negative for protein.  Guaiac negative.  In [**Month (only) 956**], blood
pressure medication regimen altered from diltiazem 120 daily to
atenolol 50 daily.
[**Hospital **] transferred to MICU and started on nitroprusside
infusion.  Decision made to restart cardizem, but increased from
120 to 240 mg daily.
-Blood pressure remained elevated despite multiple medications.
On discharge, patient will continue on diltiazem 240 ER daily,
furosemide 40 daily, lisinopril 40 daily, propranolol 120 twice
daily, triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide daily, and hydralazine 25
three times daily.  On this regimen, blood pressure remained
below systolic 170s.  As outpatient, could consider changing
diltiazem to other calcium channel blocker, such as verapamil,
that may have increased efficacy for blood pressure management.
If blood pressure not well controlled, consider workup for
secondary causes of hypertension.
