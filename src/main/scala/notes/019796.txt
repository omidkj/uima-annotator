CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Nonspecific bilateral peripheral lung nodularity. It is
unclear whether
these findings represent areas of scarring or inflammatory
changes. However,
other entities cannot be excluded and a followup scan in three
months' time is
suggested to evaluate for change.
3. Limited images of the abdomen demonstrate significant
narrowing of the
infrarenal aortic lumen on the very last image, suggestive of
possible Leriche
syndrome/aortic occlusion. It is unclear if this is an acute or
chronic
finding and correlation with physical examination and CT of the
abdomen.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w
CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (Images reviewed) of [**2156-11-8**], the
wall motion abnormalities are more extensive (mid-septal
hypokinesis was suggested on review of the prior study).

Brief Hospital Course:
Her hospital course is summarized as follows:

In the ED T 96 HR 130 BP 205/98 RR 20 86% on RA. She was put on
continuous nebs with improvement in O2 to 96% on 4L. She was
given Solumedrol 125mg IV x1 and atrovent Nebs x3. After talking
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] she was given Vancomycin 1g IV and Cefepime
2gIV. She had a CXR which showed concern for right sided wedge
shaped opacity concerning for PE. Patient was unable to lie flat
for CT show she was started on a heparin gtt. Patient refused
rectal exam prior. She was also given ativan 0.5mg IV x2 which
improved symptoms.

In the MICU continued on vanc/cefepime, IV steroids with
improvement in symptoms. Continued on heparin until CTA
performed with ?aortic occlusion known aortoiliac dz. Vascular
consulted and felt stable.  Her CTA was negative for pulmonary
embolus. She is to follow up as an outpatient with Vascular
Surgery.

Of note, found on Her CTA were: "Nonspecific bilateral
peripheral lung nodularity. It is unclear whether these findings
represent areas of scarring or inflammatory changes. However,
other entities cannot be excluded and a followup scan in three
months' time is suggested to evaluate for change."

Concern for cardiac event NSTEMI possibly due to demand ischemia
in the setting of HTN on admission with BP 200's/150's vs ACS.
She has a baseline LBBB difficult to evaluate for acute changes.
Cards consulted with tentative plan for outpatient stress
testing. This should be discussed with hr PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] out with
stable VS, on 2L NC, IV steroids for total 72 hours then to
taper, IV abx(per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] [**Name (STitle) 7027**])for further
management.

While on the floor, she was given pulse dose oral steroids,
chest PT, and continued on antibiotics. Her care reached a point
where is felt she would be better served at a rehab hospital,
and she was thus transfered. The specifics of your continued
pulmonary treatment are outlines in your discharge paperwork.
