Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo female on enoxaparin bridge for
mechanical AVR in preparation for colonoscopy presented with
right thigh hematoma and hematocrit drop.

1. Hematoma: Believed to be secondary to overdosed enoxaparin
due to renal failure.  Patient was admitted with a Hct of 34
that dropped to 27.  Concern for a worsening bleed into her
right thigh resulted in transfusion of 4 units PRBCs total
during her stay. On hospital day 6 it stablizied at 29. Her
right thigh pain was controlled on Morphine IV and Oxycodone.
The pain subsided to a single daily dose of oxycodone for pain.
Hematocrit should be monitored daily.

2. Hypertensive urgency: SBP in the 220s on presentation to ED
as the patient had not taken BP meds on admission. She was
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. In the ICU, the
patient received her home regimen of hydralazine and metoprolol
which controlled her blood pressure. There were no more
incidents on this home regimen throughout the stay. She should
be continued on current regimen of Metoprolol and Hydralazine.

4. s/p Aortic Valve Replacement: Patient has mechanical valve.
Patient admitted with INR of 1.7 and 1mg of warfarin qday. Due
to acute bleed all anticoagulation was stopped. Anticoagulation
with heparin gtt and Coumadin was restarted after hematocrit
stabilized. She is currently on Warfarin 5mg PO Qday and heparin
gtt should be stopped onced INR is between 2.0-3.0.  It is 1.4
at the time of discharged today.

5. End Stage Renal Disease: The patient is anuric and has been
on hemodialysis 3 times per week for six months.  During her
stay she was kept on this regimen.

6. Diabetes (Type II) The patient has an unclear of diabetes
versus hyperglycemia.  She has not outpatient therapy for
diabetes.  She was maintained on an insulin sliding scale
requring approximately 6units throughout the day.  Her
hemoglobin A1c is 5.4, and we have put recommendations to stop
insulin and start oral therapy forward to the rehabilitation
facility.

7. Access: Patient has PICC line and tunnelled line.
