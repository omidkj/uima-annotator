SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and
ambulates with a walker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.8; heart rate 160;
blood pressure 92/70; respiratory rate 41; oxygen saturations
100%.  Constitutional:  This is an elderly female, alert and
oriented, in moderate distress. Pupils were equal and
reactive.  No jugular venous distention.  Chest: Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Tachy, irregular
rhythm, no murmurs or rubs.  Gastrointestinal:  Soft,
positive right upper quadrant tenderness with palpable mass
and questionable enlarged liver. Positive bowel sounds.
Negative guarding, negative rebound.  The ostomy appeared
intact.  Genitourinary:  Negative leg ecchymosis.
Musculoskeletal:  +3 lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 24.9; platelets
of 775; hematocrit of 25.4.  Chemistry 7 131; 6.5; 95; 22;
50; 2.4; 129.  INR of 5.3.  PTT 46.8.  Urinalysis:  Large
amount of blood.  Nitrate negative.  Lactate 4.1.  Troponin
of 2.2.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Sepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  The initial problem list upon admission
included the following:
Anemia,
Coagulopathy,
Septic shock, most likely due to urosepsis,
Cholecystitis,
Intraperitoneal fluid with questionable hemoperitoneum,
Acute renal failure,
Hyperkalemia;
Atrial fibrillation;
Troponin leak;
Left leg numbness with questionable femoral to popliteal
graft failure.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
aggressive management of her acute issues. During that time,
a CT scan of the abdomen was obtained.  At that time, they
saw the large gallbladder with stranding.  There was free
fluid around the liver and in the right pericolic gutter.  At
that time, a general surgery consult was obtained.  The
sepsis most likely was from the acute cholecystitis and not
from the positive urinalysis.  Interventional radiology was
consulted for a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.
Due to the patient's coagulopathy, IR was reluctant to place
an emergent cholecystostomy tube.  Fresh frozen plasma was
administered to the patient overnight to correct the
coagulopathy.

The general surgery recommendations included broad spectrum
antibiotics, pan culture the patient, large bore access with
Swan placement, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to
decompress the gallbladder and, if the patient decompensates,
to go to the operating room for an open cholecystostomy tube.
Fluid resuscitation with packed red blood cells and FFP
aggressively.  Serial hematocrits, serial abdominal
examinations.  Follow the left lower extremity for ischemia,
as it appears the femoral to popliteal graft has failed.
Complete the trauma x-rays to rule out cervical spine or TLS
fractures.  Consult vascular surgery regarding the left lower
extremity graft.

Overnight, the patient's situation decompensated and the
patient became more septic.  The patient was resuscitated
with fluid, packed red blood cells and FFP.  Early in the
morning on the 5th, the patient was intubated for respiratory
distress.  At that time, the patient was also hypotensive.
The patient received additional fluid boluses and FFP.  The
patient continued to decompensate, become hypotensive and
bradycardiac.  The patient was aggressively resuscitated but
progressed to a cardiac arrest. CPR was initiated and ACLS
protocols were started.  After several rounds of ACLS, the
patient's blood pressure and pulse returned.

After stabilization, it was decided that the patient would be
brought to the operating room for emergent exploratory
laparotomy and cholecystostomy tube placement.  On the [**8-26**], the patient was brought to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24068**].  The preoperative diagnosis of
free fluid and acute cholecystitis was made.  The patient had
exploratory laparotomy and a cholecystostomy tube placement.
The surgical findings at that time included a gangrenous
cholecystitis and purulent free fluid.  In the operating
room, the patient received 1.2 liters of Crystalloid and
Factor 7.  The patient had 100 cc of urine output.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the trauma
Intensive Care Unit for aggressive resuscitation.  Hematology
was consulted for DIC as the patient became more
coagulopathic.  They recommended continued transfusions with
red blood cells, FFP, cryoprecipitate and Vitamin K.

During the postoperative period, the patient became more
septic and unstable. The patient had a severe metabolic
acidosis which was refractory to treatment.  The nephrology
service was consulted for an emergent CVVH in attempts to
reverse the acidosis.  Prior to the CVVH, the patient became
hypotensive and bradycardiac.  The patient had a second
cardiac arrest which resulted in asystole.  ACLS was
performed per protocol.  The patient did not respond to
medical management and on 12:04 on [**2158-12-26**], the
patient was pronounced dead.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sepsis.
2.  Cholecystitis.
3.  Urosepsis.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Hypothyroidism.
9.  Diverticulitis, status post colovaginal fistula.
10. Status post sigmoidectomy and colostomy.
11. Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral
popliteal.
12. Degenerative joint disease.
13. Morbid obesity.
14. History of bladder and renal stones.
15. Hypercholesterolemia.
16. Status post right thyroidectomy.
17. Status post left total hip replacement.
