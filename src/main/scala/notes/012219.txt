History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with h/o RA previously on humera and mtx who
was discharged on [**2189-4-11**] when she presented with R shoulder
pain. Her joint was tapped and it demonstrated an inflammatory
joint fluid c/w with RA and negative for septic arthritis.  She
was discharged on ibuprofen prn. Upon return home 3 days prior
to presentation she felt very well but one day later noticed the
gradual onset of dyspnea on exertion.  She also had episodes of
chest twinges overnight which resolved within minutes.  + lower
extremity edema. While in the hospital she was ambulatory.  She
went to [**Country 4754**] over [**Holiday **] and returned on [**2-20**].  She
has not had any long trips or travel rides since then.  At home
she climbed 13 steps twice a day to get to her bedroom. She last
had a mammogram one year ago and it was normal. Her last
colonoscopy was in [**2187-4-12**] and it was normal. + difficulty
swallowing solids which began a few weeks ago.
She saw her rheumatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1839**] today who referred her to
the emergency room.

Imaging/results:
.
LENIs [**4-14**]: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
LENIs [**4-21**]: IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the left
common femoral and left superficial femoral vein, new when
compared to prior exam. No evidence of thrombus within the right
lower extremity
.
UE dopplers (R) [**4-22**]: negative
.
CTA [**4-13**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There are bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli
involving the right upper, middle and lower lobe pulmonary
arteries, and the pulmonary arteries supplying the left upper
lobe, lingula and the left lower lobe. No saddle pulmonary
embolus is seen, and no evidence of right heart strain
.
TTE [**4-14**]: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**4-15**]:
1. Moderate-size left rectus sheath hematoma with
extraperitoneal extension inferiorly along the left piriformis
muscle. Evidence of IV contrast extravasation suggesting active
bleeding. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. If serial
hemacrit continues to drop, the bleeding site may be amenable to
catheter embolization by interventional radiology.
2. Large gallstone without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
.
CT a/p [**4-23**]:

1. Left retroperitoneal hematoma likely arises from the left
psoas muscle and
tracks along the left posterior pararenal fascia. There is no
evidence of
acute extravasation.

2. Left rectus sheath hematoma is similar to [**2189-4-15**].

3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis..
Renal US [**4-16**]:  No right hydronephrosis. Pelvic hematoma.
Otherwise, extremely limited exam, did not visualize L kidney
.
CXR [**4-16**]: no pulm edema
.
CXR [**4-20**]:  In comparison with the study of [**4-16**], the patient has
been a very lordotic position which most likely accounts for the
increasing prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Right IJ
catheter tip extends to the lower portion of the SVC, and there
is no evidence of pneumothorax.
.
CT Head [**4-26**] (prelim): No ICH or mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
70year old female with h/o RA, HTN, obesity, recent d/c [**4-10**]
after acute RA flare,  presented [**4-13**] with DOE/LE edema, found to
have bilateral/multifocal PE. LENIs were negative and TTE was
unremarkable for evidence of cardiac strain. She was started on
a heparin drip on admission but subsequently developed a rectus
sheath hematoma on [**4-15**]. Given the large clot burden, she was
hemodynamically stable, and the thought that the hematoma was
likely to tamponade itself off, heparin was not initially
stopped, although the target PTT was changed to the lower end of
therapeutic (althought PTTs remained elevated up to 90s). She
eventually developed worsening bleeding (extended
retroperitoneum) with tachycardia and hypotension and dropping
HCT (nadir 20), and was tranferred to ICU.  She ended up
requiring 9U prbc for the acute bleed (10U total during hospital
course). Heparin was stopped and pt underwent IVC filter
placement on [**4-17**] by IR without complications. Her HCT stabilized
and she was transferred out of ICU on [**4-18**]. She remained stable
in terms of her HCT. However, developed asymmetrical L>R
swelling and had a fever on [**4-20**]. LE dopplers checked which
showed NEW L prox DVT. Heme was consulted to help with decision
on safety of resuming anticoagulation given significant clot
burder and ongoing hypercoag that may not be protected by IVC
filter alone. CT scan was repeated on [**4-23**] which showed large L
retroperitoneal bleed (resulting in above HCT drop), but no
active bleeding.  She was given an additional 1U prbc (10 total)
for HCT 23.6 though it was not believed she had ongoing
bleeding. After discussion with patient/husband regarding
risks/benefit of anticoagulation, decision was made to resume
heparin. As for her PEs, she remained hemodynamically stable and
was weaned off of O2. For her LE edema and risk of posthrombotic
complications, she was placed on TEDs and reccommeded to keep
her legs elevated. As for the cause of her hypercoagubility, No
clear precipitant: no self-reported history of immobility (last
flight [**2-20**]), no history of malignancy (up to date with
