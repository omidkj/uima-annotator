Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement.

History of Present Illness:
56 y.o. female with asthma p/w multiple resp complaints on [**5-27**].
 Pt had 2 days of nonproductive cough and chest pressure under
right breast with deep inspiration or cough (now only with
cough).  Also c/o dyspnea at rest over 24 hours PTA.  Has been
using albuterol frequently without any relief (normally rarely
has to use albuterol).  Subj fever but denies chills/sweats.
Denies HA, N/V/D/abd pain.  Denies neck stiffiness.  Denies URI
symptoms xcept runny nose, cough.  Due to dyspnea pt called 911
and arrived in ED yesterday where she was found to be
hypotensive with BPs 83-94/36-64, tachycardic, and with low
grade fever of 100.4  Also had leukocytosis with neutrophilia.
As BP did not respond to initial 2L NS bolus, sepsis code was
called and MUST protocol was initiated.  Started on levaquin for
presumed CAP.  CTA chest did not show PE but did show b/l UL
infiltrates.  Pt's BP responded to further fluid resuscitation
and has been stable since last night.  Her dypnea appears to
have improved.  She also had nonspecific TWI on EKG but was
ruled out by enzymes.  Currently, dyspnea and cough are much
improved.  Only has chest pain with cough and is on right side
under breast.  Denies fever, chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course, By problem:

56 y.o. woman with h/o breast CA, asthma, presenting with cough,
dypnea and pleuritic chest pressure.  On exam, pt had initial
lowgrade fever which has now resolved.  Labs/studies showed
leukocytosis (improving) and b/l upper lobe infiltrates on CT.
She was therefore treated with levaquin for CAP.  Septic shock
resolved quickly with fluid resuscitation only.  Though there
were nonspecific EKG changes, there is no evidence of ACS by
enzymes.
-
1) URI/Pneumonia:  Defervesced and decreasing WBC indicate
improvement.  She received a 4 day course of levaquin.  As she
had more mostly URI symptoms with a prominent hoarseness of her
throat, dry cough and rhinorrhea, and as she improved so quickly
her symptoms were thought to be less likely related to a
bacterial pulmonic process.
-
2) Asthma:  Exacerbated in setting of pneumonia.  We continue
inhaled steroids and standing albuterol.  The later was tapered
to prn by the day before discharge.  She was requiring 2
puffs/day at discharge.  She was also placed on a 7 day
prednisone taper.  Her symptoms improved significantly by the
day of discharge with only minimal dyspnea with exertion
-
3) CV:  Though no ACS, EKG changes concerning given they were in
contigous leads.  A repeat EKG showed resolution of the changes.
 She may have had demand ischemia in setting of septic shock.
She may need an outpt pharm stress test and echo if her dyspnea
does not improve
.
4) Sinus Tachycardia: Possible etiologies included persistent
hypovolemia, frequent beta agonists.  Her tachycardia improved
with fluid resuscitation and tapering of her albuterol to prn.
-
4) Diarrhea: She developed diarrhea on Day 3 of her hospital
stay.  A C. Dificile assay came back positive on the day of
discharge and she was started on a ten day course of flagyl.

5) Psych:  Outpatient regimen of effexor and seroquel.
-
6) F/E/N:  Cardiac diet
-
7) Deconditioning:  She was seen by Physical Therapy and thought
to need services with home rehab.  She was discharged with home
physical therapy.
