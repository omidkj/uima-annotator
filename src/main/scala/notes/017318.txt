[**2142-4-27**]
PELVIS IMPRESSION: Status post left total hip arthroplasty with
expected post-surgical changes and no evidence of hardware
complications.

[**2142-4-28**]
HIP XR: Left total hip arthroplasty with satisfactory alignment.

[**2142-4-29**]:
Portable CXR: Cardiomediastinal contours as well as pulmonary
vascularity are unchanged in appearance, except for development
of retrocardiac opacities, probably due to atelectasis in the
recent postoperative setting. Small left pleural effusion has
also developed. Right cardiophrenic angle has been excluded and
cannot be evaluated.
