Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

VP shunt removal [**2203-11-20**]
VP shunt placement [**12-6**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3989**] is a 60y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, CAD s/p MI, AFib,
TIA, colon cancer s/p resection, s/p abdominal trauma with
splenectomy and left hand digit amputations, right forearm
fracture with plan for hardware removal [**11-22**], as well as
complicated hospital course last month for spontaneous SAH and
pneumonia now s/p trach/PEG/VP shunt who was sent from rehab to
an OSH for altered mental status and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
due to concern for VP shunt complication vs infection.

He was admitted to Neurosurgery [**Date range (1) 4216**] after presenting to an
OSH with the "worst headache of his life" and being found to
have a spontaneous SAH in the setting of Coumadin use (no trauma
and no known cerebral artery malformations).  He was intubated
in the ED, and was treated by an external ventricular drain.
His course was complicated by AFlutter requiring Dilt drip, VAP
(treated with Vanc/Cefepime, d/c'd to rehab on Vanc), brief
hypotension and pressors, and DVT (was restarted on Warfarin).
He underwent trach, PEG, and V-P shunt placement and was
discharged to rehab at [**Hospital1 700**].  His recent
baseline is that he is normally alert and responsive, able to
sit at edge of bed but not walking yet, and has no focal neuro
deficit.

Per transfer records, at rehab this morning at 1:30AM he was
confused, only A+O x1, slow to respond, and only verbalizing the
word "yes."  Per report he had some new right-sided weakness.
Had temp 102.9 and was noted to have cloudy foul-smelling urine
in condom cath.  EMS was called and he received 800cc NS en
route to the OSH.

At the OSH, his VS were T 101.5, BP 167/118, HR 90, RR 16.  He
had WBC 13.3.  CXR with question of consolidation, and CT head
w/o contrast with no acute process.  Received Acetaminophen,
Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Azithromycin 250mg IV as well as Cefepime 2g
IV and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T 97.6, HR 75, BP 110/70, RR
18, POx 98% 3L TM.  Labs were notable for WBC 15.8 (74% PMNs, no
bands), UA with 0 epis, 35 WBC, few bacteria, moderate leuks,
>182 RBCs (foley had been placed).  CXR showed R>L bibasilar
opacities.  He was evaluated by Neurosurgery and underwent VP
shunt study which was normal.  VP shunt was tapped and CSF
revealed WBC 425 (87% polys), protein 57, glucose 63.  Gram
stain showed 4+ PMN, 4+ GPCs in pairs/clusters.  He received 1L
NS and Vancomycin 1g IV and was admitted to Medicine for further
management.  VS prior to transfer were 97.6, 67, 10, 170/83,
100%.

On arrival to the floor, patient was A&O x3, he denied fever,
chills, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, dysuria or
diarrhea. He reports headache with hip and knee pain that is
chronic. He wants to eat, but his daughter emphasize that he is
chronically NPO because he aspirated.

Imaging:
[**11-20**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of dependent bibasilar opacities,
which may
reflect an evolving aspiration pneumonia in the setting of
fever.

[**2203-11-21**] Wrist XR - In comparison with study of [**11-14**], there is
little overall change in the extensive fixation device about
previous fracture of the distal radius. Widening of the
scapholunate interval is not definitely appreciated on this
study.  Overlying cast greatly obscures bony detail.

[**2203-11-21**] CT head - Stable appearance of ventricular catheter and
ventricular size

[**11-22**] CXR - stable b/l lower base opacities suspicious for
pneumonia

[**2203-11-23**] CSF culture, source shunt. GRAM STAIN: no
polymorphonuclear leukocytes seen, no microorganism seen;
preliminary fluid culture is no growth.  WBC: 240(lymph 14%,
Mono 23%, Polys 63%, RBS 0), Tprot: 28, Glucose: 76.
[**12-1**] ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve,
but ca
