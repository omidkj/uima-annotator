RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-2-19**] 7:26 PM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: r/o PNA
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
44 year old woman with CP
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PNA
STUDY: AP chest [**2102-2-19**].
HISTORY: 44-year-old woman with chest pain. Evaluate for
pneumonia.
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low due to poor inspiratory
effort. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal
limits. There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or
large pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
Low lung volumes without signs for acute cardiopulmonary
process.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2102-2-17**]
PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: History of IVC leiomyoma.  Assess [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] vs
thrombus
Height: (in) 60
Weight (lb): 200
BSA (m2): 1.87 m2
BP (mm Hg): 112/64
HR (bpm): 74
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2102-2-17**] at 10:57
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00
Test Location: West Other
Technical Quality: Adequate
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 60% (nl >=55%)
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Tumor or myxoma in the RA. No
ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic
function.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored  by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was  provided by
benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The  posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2%
viscous lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.2 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. A large  homogenous mass (suspicious for tumor; thrombus
less likely given the size and  appearance) is seen in the right
atrium extending from the IVC and filling the  IVC (3cm in
diameter) with severely narrowed residual flow. There is no
extension into the SVC. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The ascending,
transverse and  descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic  plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good  leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets  are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a  small pericardial effusion.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
44 year old woman with h/o saddle PE in [**2096**] p/w CP,

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval: PE (known reaction of hives to IV [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] PREMEDICATE;
please scan at noon)
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: History of pulmonary embolus and IVC thrombus/tumor.
Please evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were first obtained through
the chest without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed
by contrast-enhanced CT angiogram of the chest. Coronal,
sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
Again seen is a massively dilated inferior vena cava containing
a large non-enhancing filling defect, which extends into the
right atrium. This has not significantly changed since the CT
torso of [**2101-12-19**]. However, comparison is difficult secondary to
different technique. There is no evidence of mass or thrombus in
the right ventricle or pulmonary arteries. There is no pulmonary
embolus. Probable contrast mixing defect in SVC. The aorta is
normal in caliber throughout. The coronary arteries are normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. The airways are patent to the
segmental level bilaterally. There is unchanged probable
scarring in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Dependent changes are seen in the lung fields bilaterally. There
are no nodules or areas of airspace consolidation. There is no
pleural effusion. There is no pathologically enlarged axillary,
hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Although this examination
is not tailored evaluation of the abdominal organs, limited
