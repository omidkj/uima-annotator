History of Present Illness:
This is a 48-year-old female with PMHx of spina bifida, HTN, MR,
paraperesis, non-epileptic [**First Name3 (LF) 54422**], and urostomy with chief
complaint of abdominal pain.  This occured 2 days prior to
arrival, pain was diffuse (9.5/10), gradually increasing in
severity.  Associated with: nausea and vomiting (food contents,
non-bloody); patient denies f/c, new n/t/w, HA/neck pain, change
in vision, CP, SOB, cough, change in BM (1 on day prior,
non-bloody), GU s/sx.  Review of OMR reveals that the patient
has been admitted several times for abdominal pain that
presented similarly and had a negative work up including CT
abdomen, RUQ U/S and HIDA scan. On her [**Month (only) 116**] admission she was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and discharged after
having daily stools. Also, the patient was recently admitted for
spastic movements that were determined not to be [**Month (only) 54422**]. She
then went to the ED again last week with spastic movements in
renal ultrasound that neurology felt were consitent with her
non-epileptic [**Month (only) 54422**]. In the neurology consult note from this
ED visit her abdomen was noted to be diffusely tender and
somewhat distended.
.
In the ED VS: 96.5 72 111/68 18 99% 2L. Exam was notable for
distended abdomen that was mildly distended diffusely tender to
palpation. She was guaiac negative. Labs notable for alk phos of
113 and U/A negative (bacteruira from ileal condiut). Patient
had Abd Xray and CT scan which were unremarkable (stool present,
no SBO, no abscess, no pancreatitis or other acute process). CXR
showed no abnormality. Patient given morphine x2 and Zofran and
admitted for pain control.
.
On the floor, patient was sleeping but when awoken states that
her abdomen is painful and distended.

(Of note, the above HPI is from the patient's presentation to
the ED).  She has since been admitted to the medical ICU for her
diffuse fixed drug reaction/dermatologic condition).

EKG ([**2178-1-21**]):  Sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 may
be a normal variant. Baseline artifact in the limb leads makes
assessment of those leads difficult. Since the previous tracing
of [**2178-1-20**] there is probably no significant change but unstable
baseline in the standard limb leads makes comparison difficult.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48-year-old female with spina bifida and long standing
urostomy, mild mental retardation, and prior bullos skin lesions
admitted [**2178-1-20**] for abdominal pain, suspected related to
constipation; overnight with fever to 103 and development of
bullous skin lesions, concerning for drug reaction.  Patient is
being transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] for further burn care.
.
BULLOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY DRUG REACTION:  New onset diffuse
erythema and bullae in areas of friction noticed on hospital day
2, following fever to 103 evening prior.  Progressive throughout
the day, with increasing blistering, particular in axilla, neck
folds, back, thighs, and shins.  Dermatology was actively
involved in patient's care.  Zofran suspected to be causative
[**Doctor Last Name 360**], with morphine and divalproex less likely.  (Patient has
had at least 4 previous bouts of drug reactions, and has
required intubation for laryngeal and angioedema).  Recommended
transfer to [**Hospital6 **] Burn Unit for close monitoring
due to rapid progression of bullae.  Zofran was stopped.  Skin
biopsy performed by dermatology with path pending.  Patient was
given over 2 Liters of IV hydration in the ICU; hydration was
stopped when IV access was lost.  Pain control was with IV
morphine, but then switched to PO after IV access was lost.
Patient received 1 dose of IVIG (1g/kg/d); she was in the middle
of her second dose before she lost IV access.  She should get a
total of 4 doses of IVIG over 4 days.  She was given
methyprednisolone 40mg IV once.
.
2) ACCESS: Patient lost access on the morning of [**1-23**].
