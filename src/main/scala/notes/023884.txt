Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cerebral angiogram with MERCI clot retrieval


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 y/o woman with a PMH significant for HTN,
HLD
and severe peripheral vascular disease requiring mulitple
procedures (including kissing iliac stents in [**2161**] with
subsequent restenosis requiring angioplasty in [**2164**]) who
initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with ischemic rest pain
and was found to have infrarenal abdominal aorta thrombotic
occlusion with extension into the common iliac artery. She
underwent aortobifemoral bypass yesterday ([**2165-12-9**]) for this
aortoiliac occlusive disease. During an attempt at placement of
a
R IJ central venous catheter yesterday, the R carotid was
punctured and was subsequently repaired. The patient was
reportedly doing well post-op. This morning, she was last noted
well at 7:20 AM, but at 7:30 AM, she was noted to have a L
hemiparesis by staff at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital. A NCHCT and CTA were
performed and showed a probable acute thrombus in the R M2
segment. She was determined to not be a tpa candidate due to her
surgery yesterday. The decision was then made to transfer her to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cerebral angiogram/ endovascular
intervention.


Past Medical History:
- peripheral artery disease s/p multiple procedures as noted in
HPI, including aortobifemoral bypass on [**2165-12-9**]
- HTN
- HLD
- Osteopenia


Social History:
She is married with 2 children. She works in the
[**Location 90421**] Police Dept. in the prosecution dept. She is a
current smoker.


Family History:

Admission Exam:

Mental Status: awake, alert, oriented x3. Speech slightly
dysarthric, but intact naming, repetition and comprehension.

Cranial Nerves: R pupil 3 mm and sluggishly reactive. L pupil
2.5
mm and sluggishly reactive. Eyes in midposition in primary gaze
but has complete left gaze paresis. L lower facial droop.

and
LE for 5 secs. Dense left sided hemiparesis, with no ability to
move.

light touch and pinprick on the left.

MICRO:
MYCOPLASMA IGM NEG, IGG POSITIVE
LEGIONELLA NEGATIVE

IMAGING:
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ON ARRIVAL:
1. No definite evidence of progressive infarction, compared to
CT from five hours prior and no definite large vascular
territory infarction.

2. White matter hypodensities predominantly in the right frontal
and temporal lobes, with subtle right sulcal effacement but no
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is unchanged compared
to five hours prior. Chronicity of white matter hypodensities is
uncertain without more remote imaging for comparison, but, in
this context, these likely represent relatively acute infarcts.

3. Increased density of both middle cerebral arteries, likely
reflects the
intravenous contrast material administered for cerebral
angiography performed within the same hour. No acute hemorrhage
seen.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
no cardiac source of embolism seen. Technically sub-optimal
bubble study (due to poor image quality) so PFO cannot be
excluded. Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Probable diastolic
dysufnction. No significant valvular abnormality seen.

BRAIN MRI
Multifocal infarction involving right frontal, temporal, and
parietal lobes, in the right MCA territory, with evidence of
hemorrhage within areas of infarction in the right insula and
parietal lobe, not evident on prior head CT.

CT CHEST/AB/PELVIS
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Reticular opacities in the right upper lobe and left upper
lobe consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse subcutaneous
anasarca.
4. Status post aortobifem bypass for occluded AAA stent. Small
amount of
post-operative fluid. Bypass grafts are widely patent.

LENI
No evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombus.

CAROTID DUPLEX U/S
1. No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis right side.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 y/o woman with PMH HTN, HLD and peripheral
arterial disease s/p aortobifemoral bypass as well as right
caroid artery repair the day before transfer, who developed
acute onset L sided weakness while at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital the
morning of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. CTA was performed at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital and was suggestive of R M2 segment acute thrombus. She
was not a candidate for tpa because of her surgery. It was
decided that she would be Medflighted from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent endovascular intevention. Upon arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] angio suite, about 4.5 hrs after last known well time, she
was awake, alert, and oriented, but her NIHSS was 15 for left
gaze paresis (she is only able to look to the right) and dense
left sided motor and sensory hemiparesis. She was taken directly
to angio suite, where she was urgently prepped and draped for
cerebral angiogram and for which MERCI retrieval of clot was
performed. Her arteries were noted to be open at the end of the
procedure, but her defecits persisted. The vascular surgery
service was consulted regarding her post-op management for the
aortobifemoral bypass. Her surgeon at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital was also
[**Name (NI) 653**], who said that it was ok from surgical standpoint to
resume Plavix.  She had no complications from the intervention,
with stable head CT and MRI. She was safe to restart Plavix.
She did not have significant recovery during her course and
remains with dense L hemiparesis, not ambulatory.

She did have constipation and urinary retention, which were
treated with bowel regimen and Foley catheter respectively. She
should continue bowel regimen at rehab, and trial Foley removal
after she moves her bowels.  She also has anemia, which surgery
felt was due to third spacing and fluid shifts post-op. Hct
remained relatively stable.

**For rehab facility, please trial D/C Foley and continue to
treat constipation as needed. Please check HCT twice weekly.
