Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with fevers, back pain, and pathologic
evidence of Sweet Syndrome


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Bone marrow biopsy
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
(Primary historians: wife & daughter):
66 y/o male with lung cancer s/p RUL lobectomy, back pain w/
spondylolisthesis, s/p lumbar laminectomes x2, initially
admitted to OSH with back pain, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
fevers, leukocytosis, and delirium.
.
Patient was in his usual state of health until mid-[**8-11**]-2 weeks after returning to [**State 350**] from [**State 8842**]. He
initially complained of acute onset R lower back pain that
started after leaning over quickly.  He went to see his
chiropractor.  Pain worsened and developed L sided back pain as
well.  Also with + constipation and LE weakness.  Around this
same time, the patient started developing a productive cough and
fevers.
.
He presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**9-2**].  Initially alert and
oriented x 3, but noted to "say odd things".  He was febrile to
101 in the ED, and was intermittently confused.  MRI back showed
L5-S1 central disc protrusion without mass effect or abnormal
enhancement.  CT of the head showed diffuse mild cerebral
atrophy with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. MRI with
and without contrast showed no evidence for meningitis and no
enhancing mass lesion. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt no
intervention needed based on lumbar imaging.  ID consulted, and
felt the patient had no clear signs of infection, aside from
fevers, so antibiotics have been generally held.  Neurology
assessment was to assess the patient for viral illness,
including viral meningitis, less likely paraneoplastic disorder.
Lumbar puncture was attempted x 4, with records indicating that
one attempt may have yielded venous blood.  Acyclovir was
temporarily started and then d/c'd when LP fluid was negative
for HSV PCR. Heme/onc consulted for leukocytosis, bone marrow
aspirate revealed myelodysplasia with no evidence of leukemia.
Chromosomal and cytogenetic studies were sent.
.
Required ICU stay for angioedema of tongue with rash of neck and
cheek.  He did not require intubation, and the angioedema
resolved with dexamethasone. He developed nodules on his face
and neck; biopsies revealed neutrophilic dermatosis, c/w Sweet
Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.
.
Found to be hypercalcemic with low albumin levels and ionized
calcium of 1.61 on day prior to transfer. PTHrP and PTH were
sent with Vitamin D studies. These were pending at the time of
transfer.
.

.
Review of sytems:

hallucinating and seeing people that aren't in the room. When
asked who is in the room with him, the patient states "just my
family."

palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

[**2122-9-16**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low, and apical
lordotic projection and portable technique also contribute to an
accentuation of the cardiomediastinal contours. Patchy opacities
are present at both lung bases, and may reflect atelectasis in
the setting of low lung volumes. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and early infectious pneumonia. Followup PA and
lateral radiographs are suggested when the patient's condition
permits.

[**2122-9-17**] CT Head: No evidence of acute hemorrhage
[**2122-9-17**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. No evidence of spinal or
paraspinal abscess. Note that if concern exists for focal
discitis or osteomyelitis, MR would be the more sensitive
modality for evaluation.
  2. Nodularity of the pancreas and left adrenal gland. Given
history of
previous lung malignancy, metastatic disease is the primary
consideration at the pancreas. Additionally, though the adrenal
nodule is statistically likely an adenoma, metastatic disease
must be considered. Ongoing followup is recommended with repeat
CT within 6 months, or with comparison to prior
imaging.
  3. Large bilateral consolidations in the lower lobes
bilaterally. Given the history of fever and cough reported on
