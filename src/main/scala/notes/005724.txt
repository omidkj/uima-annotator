Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
Vague diffuse abdominal discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
55 yo M with h/o chronic EtOH abuse, HTN, ?DM2, and asthma,
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-8**]->[**2123-1-9**] with intoxication and
right rib fracture, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after presenting
to clinic intoxicated.  He was initially combative and agitated,
but improved.  He complained of chest pain and was found to have
a troponin of 0.02.  On last admission, he was ruled out for MI
with negative cardiac enzymes.
.
In the ED he received 10 IV valium x 2, 40 meq K, banana bag,
and Mag.  He fell out of bed and a head CT was obtained.  He had
an episode of vomiting and became hypoxic, requiring a NRB mask,
and was sent for CXR.
.
He now complains of diffuse abdominal pain.  He is unable to
provide much history, due to recently receiving valium.  He
denies SOB, chest pain, N/V/D, headache, constipation, blood in
BMs, palpitations or anxiety.
.
ROS: Per patient and OMR records, he was hit by a car in early
[**Month (only) 1096**] with consequent rib fracture.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
EtOH abuse
Asthma
? DM2
rib fracture

Social History:
He is homeless, and stays in a shelter. Ongoing alcohol abuse,
about [**1-25**] pint of vodka per day.  Last drink 24 hours ago.  No
IVDU. Current smoker, 1ppd X 40 years. Patient declines rehab.


Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
VITALS: T 96.3, HR 98, BP 171/96, RR 17, O2 96% 2L NC
GEN: Somnolent but rousable, smells of EtOH.
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL  ?Mild icterus, conjunctival injection b/t.
OP clear.  MMM.
RESP: Diffuse expiratory wheezes. Distant BS.  No crackles.
CVS: RRR.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur or rub.
GI: + BS.  Diffuse abdominal tenderness.  Voluntary guarding on
deep palpation.  No rebound.  No mass palpable.
EXT: Some superficial skin wounds.  No edema.  warm.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: In the frontal view, a sliver of lucency projects above the
splenic flexure without a clear corresponding abnormality on the
lateral.  If symptoms persist, I would recommend radiographic
evaluation of the left hemidiaphragm in the right decubitus
position to exclude small volume of pneumoperitoneum.  The
region of the right hemidiaphragm is normal.  Mild cardiomegaly
is unchanged and mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality is
stable since at least [**1-7**] and probably more chronic.
.
CT Abd: 1.  Acute left posterior rib fracture - eleventh rib
associated with small focal muscle hematoma with no associated
visible injury to the left kidney or spleen.  There is
associated atelectasis at the left lung base and this should be
followed up with imaging to assure clearance.
2.  Atherosclerosis including visceral branches and dense plaque
at the origin of left renal artery end coronary atherosclerosis.

3.  Fatty liver.
4.  Distended urinary bladder.
.
CT Head: No evidence of acute mass effect or hemorrhage.

EKG:  sinus tach @ 101.  nl intervals.  <0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] dep in

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 yo M with history of EtOH abuse, asthma, and HTN
who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and was undergoing
EtOH detoxication.  The patient was placed on valium per CIWA
scale for acute alcohol withdrawal.  Since he presented s/p
fall, a head CT was done that was negative for bleed.  He was
quite somnolent, diaphoretic, and agitated on his day of
admission and was transferred to the ICU overnight for
monitoring.  He was transferred back to the floor the next day.
He continued to become agitated but required less valium.  The
patient expressed no interest in stopping EtOH consumption.  SW
was consulted but was not able to see the patient before he left
AMA.  He did receive a banana bag in the ED, and thiamine,
folate, and MVI daily.  He was monitored for aspiration and
fall.
.
The patient's abdominal pain was vague and chronic; it was
thought likely to be EtOH pancreatitis vs hepatitis or referred
pain from his broken rib.  CXR showed no pneumonia.  He was
tolerated a regular diet on discharge and his LFTs were stable.
Ibuprofen was administered for rib pain.
.
The patient was slightly hypoxic on admission.  This was thought
to be due to aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA from vomiting in the
ED.  The patient was given albuterol and atrovent nebs.  He
remained afebrile and his oxygenation improved on its own.
.
The patient was also noted to have a pruritic erythematous rash
to trunk and neck.  This was concerning for allergic reaction or
contact dermatitis.  It responded to one dose of benadryl.
.
He was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes.  Initial
EKG showed ST depressions in inferior leads that resolved on
subsequent EKGs.  He was started on aspirin in house.
.
The patient left the hospital AMA abruptly, before he could be
seen or evaluated by the attending medical physician
