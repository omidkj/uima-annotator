Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU from the
[**Hospital 26200**] Hospital for possible further evaluation and
treatment of shock.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-
[**Last Name (un) 4068**] on [**7-14**] with two weeks' history of malaise,
dizziness, fatigue at [**Location (un) 1036**].  Her systolic blood
pressure was reportedly in the 70s.  The patient complained
of feeling "hot" to family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her review of systems is negative for
fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin changes.  Of note,
the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 20445**] on [**2136-7-2**] for lower extremity cellulitis with
cultures positive for pansensitive Pseudomonas, was just
treated with ciprofloxacin and Zosyn.  The course was
complicated by Clostridium difficile, for which the patient
was treated with Flagyl as well as acute renal failure, which
was attributed to mild ATN and prerenal azotemia.  On
[**2136-7-12**], the patient was noted to have bandemia and elevated
BNP.  The patient was treated with dopamine, ceftriaxone,
vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl but became progressively
hypertensive and dyspneic despite Levophed, dobutamine,
BiPAP.  Therefore, the patient was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA, unknown reaction; ASPIRIN, possible
reaction with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] disease.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM [**Hospital1 **]:
1.  Dopamine 2.5 mcg/kg/minute.

5.  Vitamin C.
6.  Protonix.
7.  Zinc.
8.  Zyprexa.
9.  Multivitamin.

12. Flagyl.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right ventricular heart failure
secondary to anthracycline toxicity.

CLL with transformation to B-cell large lymphoma.

[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] disease.

Mitral valve prolapse.

Acute renal failure.

Status post appendectomy.

Status post cholecystectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies cigarettes or alcohol.
She lives at [**Hospital 1036**] Nursing Home.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS ON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Her constitutional
symptoms were abnormal.  She was short of breath.  She had
abdominal pain.  She denied chest pain.  She complained of
dyspnea on exertion.  She complained of dyspnea with lying
flat and orthopnea, and complained of edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  She was somnolent but
arousable, cachetic and frail, in no apparent distress.  She
appeared comfortable with diffuse anasarca.  Vital signs:  On
admission her temperature was 98.2 degrees p.o.  Her blood
pressure was 89/50, respiratory rate was 14, oxygen
saturation was 84 percent on nonrebreather at the outside
hospital.  We are unable to obtain her oxygen saturation by
seeing their oximetry.  Urine output had been zero since
midnight.  HEENT:  Temporal wasting.  Sclerae anicteric.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular muscles were intact bilaterally.  Mucous
membranes were dry.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Her neck
was supple.  Her JVP was 7-8J cm at 45 degrees.  Chest:  With
diminished breath sounds in anterior lower one half of her
lung fields bilaterally with no rales bilaterally.  She had
poor aeration overall.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular regular
rate in 120s with normal S1, S2 with no audible murmur, rubs
or gallop.  Abdomen:  With diffuse anasarca with pitting
edema in the back and abdomen.  Normal bowel sounds
auscultated.  Abdomen was nontender, nondistended, no masses
were appreciable.  Extremities:  Lower extremity ulcers at
shins bilaterally with granulomatous tissue with some
surrounding erythema.  No oozing, 2+ pitting edema.  Cool,
dry, 1+ radial pulse bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Oriented to
self and year, not to location or day.  She followed some
commands, answers occasional questions.  Cranial nerves II to
XII are intact bilaterally.  No focal deficits.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG on [**2136-7-15**] at 4 a.m. showed a
rate of 118 beats per minute, regular, without obvious P
waves, QRS 100 msec, question severe right axis deviation
versus left axis deviation, possible lead reversal.  Her
chest x-ray preliminary showed bilateral pleural effusions
consistent with CHF.  Her KUB showed anasarca, no bowel gas.

LABORATORY DATA:  ABG obtained after multiple attempts,
7.16/49/199/18.  Her CK was 18, troponin
0.08.  Chem-7, sodium 146, potassium 5.1, chloride 114, BUN
19, chloride 93, creatinine 3.7 and glucose of 124.  White
cell count 5.1, hematocrit 35.4, platelets of 38, MCV 111, 91
percent neutrophils, 5 percent lymphocyte, no bands.

ASSESSMENT:  A 78-year-old female who was transferred from
outside hospital at 4 a.m. with hypertension, hypoxia,
tachycardia, anasarca in the setting of CLL, anthracycline-
induced cardiomyopathy, recent lower extremity pseudomonal
infection, recent Clostridium difficile infection, acute
renal failure, pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions,
thrombocytopenia, elevated INR of 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient appeared on transfer to be in
shock likely secondary to sepsis in origin though also
possibility of cardiogenic shock as well.  In any case, the
patient clearly was in multiorgan system failure despite
pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and her prognosis at
the time of transfer appeared grim.  Discussion was held
regarding mutuality of a pulmonary artery catheter with
possible intubation that might alter her case; however, it
seemed unlikely that a PA catheter would add information
which would be able to alter the patient's course.
Furthermore given her significant comorbidities, it appeared
the patient would likely not tolerate intubation.  The
patient was initially treated with vasopressin and Levophed
as well as the broad spectrum antibiotics started at
[**Hospital1 26200**].  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name6 (MD) 714**]
the RN in the CCU, spoke at length with the
patient's daughter, son-in-law, and son for greater than an
hour about the patient's grim prognosis.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] offered
the family the option of aggressive measures including a
pulmonary artery catheter and possible intubation noting that
they might afford some benefit.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] also informed
them of the many significant problems facing the patient and
her overall prognosis.  Ultimately, in light of the multiple
problems facing the patient and her grim prognosis, the
family, specifically the patient's son and daughter felt that
the patient would want to be comfort measures only in this
situation.  At this point, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending, was
notified and the patient was made comfort measures only.  By
11 a.m. on [**2136-7-15**], the patient was pronounced dead.
Telemetry monitor showed asystole and physical exam revealed
pupils, which are fixed and dilated without heart sounds,
respirations on auscultation for greater than 2 minutes.  The
patient was pronounced at 10:35 a.m.  The family including
the daughter [**Name (NI) **] and the son [**Name (NI) **] were present.  The family
declined postmortem examination, and she was also waived by
the medical examiner.
