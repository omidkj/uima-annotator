Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy (EGD) [**2112-2-1**]
colonoscopy [**2112-2-2**]


History of Present Illness:
Hx per OSH H&P. Has history of previous GIB 4 years ago with
colonoscopy demonstrating diverticula in the colon as well as
?duod divertic. Presented on [**1-29**] to OSH with maroon-colored
stools and clots per rectum starting on [**1-28**] and becoming more
frequent on [**1-29**]. The bowel movements were painless and he
denied any abdominal pain. In the ED the patient felt dizzy and
lightheaded. Hct on admission was 37. After admission the
patient continued to have bloody stools but was not symptomatic.
His hct continued to fall with subsequent crits being 32 to 26.
Patient transfused 2 units pRBC. After the crit remained at 26.
Received another 2 units. During this time the patient remained
stable with normal heart rates and blood pressures. However he
had another episode, but more significant, of blood per rectum.
During that time the patient had a syncopal episode and was sent
to the MICU. Received 2 more units of pRBC. Patient is being
transferred to our MICU for further workup including likely GI
intervention vs. surgery.
A Ct scan from the OSH showed extensive diverticulosis without
any active extrav of the contrast.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is alert and oriented,
hemodynamically stable and comfortably.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80y/o gentleman with HTN, DM2, and prior
diverticular bleed who was transferred from an OSH with lower GI
bleed.  He was stabilized in the MICU and then transferred to
the floor.  Workup (CTA, EGD, colonoscopy, tagged RBC scan) were
unable to localize the exact site, but it is likely that the
bleed was diverticular.  Prior to discharge home, his Hct was
stable and he had not had any more bleeding for >24 hours.  He
will follow up with his PCP and Gastroenterologist.

ACTIVE ISSUES

#. LGIB: likely diverticular, though no site of bleed seen.
He had received 7 units pRBCs at the OSH, and he required 2 more
units here (please see "Hct trend" above.  He passed bright
blood and clots (~300cc at a time) about every 12 hours, but
always remained hemodynamically stable.  CTA, EGD, colonoscopy,
tagged RBC scan were performed and confirmed his known
diverticulosis but no active site of bleed was seen.  After
transfer to the medical floor, his bleeding gradually stopped
and his Hct stabilized (was 26.5 at the time of discharge).  He
had no bleeding for >24 hours; his diet was advanced and he was
discharged home.  He will follow up with his PCP and an
appointment was made with a Gastroenterologist of his choice.
During his stay, he was followed by GI and Surgery - in the long
run, he will benefit from continued discussions about the risks
and benefits of colectomy for his diverticular disease.

#. Gastritis on EGD: incidental finding.
No complaints of reflux/heartburn but he was found to have
gastritis on EGD.  Biopsies were not taken due to ongoing GI
bleed.  He should have outpatient H. pylori serology testing.
He was started on a PPI due to the evidence of gastritis (though
if he continues to experience no symptoms, this could possibly
be discontinued).

#. 5.5cm infrarenal AAA on CTA: incidental finding.
Per patient, he is aware of this.  He was advised to follow up
with his PCP for ongoing monitoring/possible intervention.

INACTIVE ISSUES

#. HTN: stable.
His antihypertensives were initially held in the setting of GI
bleed. Throughout his stay he was hemodynamically stable (in
fact, hypertensive to SBP 160).  His home meds were restarted
and his blood pressures were controlled.  He will continue on
Norvasc and Lisinopril.

#. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
He was continued on Lipitor.

#. DM2: stable.
His Prandin was held in-house and he was covered with SSI
Humalog.  He was discharged on Prandin and will follow up with
his PCP.

#. Asthma: stable.
He was continued on Advair.

diverticular disease
