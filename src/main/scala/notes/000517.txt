Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Supraventricular Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96136**] is a 41 yo woman with a h/o hypogammaglobulinemia
who presented from her hematology clinic with tachycardia. She
had been getting IVIG every 3 weeks for her
hypogammaglobulinemia. Prior to each treatment she starts to
feel "congested", develops a cough and feels fatigued. She was
feeling these symptoms over the last day and presented to clinic
where she was supposed to get IVIG today. On initial evaluation
in the clinic she was found to be tachycardic to 180 (regular)
and hypotensive with BP 72/52 and febrile 99F. O2 sat 88-95% on
RA. She was given adenosine 6 mg which did not change her HR and
then diltiazem 5mg IV x 1. After this her SVT broke to sinus
tachy with rate in 130s. She was then sent to ED.
In the ED her initial vs were: T 101.0 132 (sinus tach) 100/57
20 100. On exam she had crackles on the right. She denied
symptoms aside from the cough she normally gets prior to IVIG
treatments. A CXR revealed likely PNA. She was given
vanc/levoquin/flagyl and 4L NS. Her BPs remained 80s systolic so
she was started on levoquin. She remained asymptomatic from her
hypotension specifically she had no dizziness, lightheadedness,
chest pain, or headache.
.
On admission, she had no complaints aside from the cough. She
denied palpitations, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, dysuria, sick contacts, recent travel. She has
an indwelling port that had been accessed in ED but before then
not since she had her last IVIG treatment 3 weeks ago. No
rashes. No chills/fevers/weight changes.

-----------
[**2118-7-21**] ECG:  Sinus tachycardia with non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities.
.
[**2118-7-21**] CXR: CXR: Left-sided portacath tip ends in superior
right atrium. mild CM. Blunting of right costophrenic angle may
represent effusion. rLL atelectasis vs consolidation and
increased retrocardiac density likely atelectasis but infection
can't be ruled out.
.
[**2118-7-22**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Vigorous global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen. Low estimated intracardiac filling
pressures.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96136**] was a 41 yo woman with a h/o hypogammaglobulinemia
admitted s/p an episode of SVT. Brief hospital course was as
follows:
.
# SVT: Ms. [**Known lastname 96136**] was found to be in asymptomatic SVT with
hypotension of 72/52 at her [**Hospital 108307**] clinic. Her SVT
rapidly converted to sinus rhythm following 6 mg adenosine and 5
mg diltiazem. In the ED, she was found to be in sinus
tachycardia with a fever to 101F and because of a concern for
PNA on CXR she was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
azithromycin for empiric coverage of pneumonia. She was also
given 4L of NS and required pressors to maintain her systolic BP
above 90, thus she was admitted to the MICU. In the MICU she was
weaned off pressors successfully after approximately 12 hours. A
TTE was performed which showed normal cardiac function and was
significant for low filling pressures consistent with
hypovolemia. She was initially kept on vanc/levo/azithromycin,
however she remained afebrile throughout her MICU course (36
hours) and her antibiotics were discontinued given her lack of
symptoms, fever, white count, and a CXR that showed chronic
changes seen on prior CXRs. Following her transfer to the
general medicine floor, she was continued on telemetry and
remained in NSR. A review of her prior EKGs revealed paroxysmal
AVRT or AVNRT and an electrophysiology consult was obtained with
reommendation for outpatient monitoring with an event monitor
and ablation if paroxysms persists. On the day of discharge, she
remained hemodynamically stable and was in NSR.
.
# Hypotension: Ms. [**Known lastname 96136**] was initially found to hyptotensive
to 72/52 with fever to 101F, leukocytopenia, and an opacity
noted on CXR concerning for PNA in the ED. However, she remained
afebrile following admission and review of outpatient records
revealed chronic leukocytopenia and chronic CXR finding beleived
to be scarring from multiple episodes of PNA. In addition, it
was discovered that her baseline systolic blood pressure was in
the 90s with isolated clinic readings as low as 82. It was
likely that her normal systolic blood pressure at rest was in
the 80s, especially considering the fact that she remained
asymptomatic and had excellent urine output with systolic blood
pressure readings in the 80s. On the day of discharge, she was
walked up a flight of stairs and around the unit with excellent
oxygen saturation and appropriate increase in blood pressure
following activity noted to be 104/72.
.
# Coagulopathy : She was followed by her hematologist for
suspected factor deficiency and received vitamin K periodically
as an outpatient. This appeared to be a chronic issuse and she
received 5mg of vitamin K daily for three days prior to dischare
with appropriate INR change from 1.8 to 1.2. Ongoing outpatient
follow up with hematologist was advised.
