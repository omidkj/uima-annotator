Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-7-25**]
1. Left atrial appendage resection.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3:  Left internal
    mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and
    reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
    artery and obtuse marginal artery.

History of Present Illness:
66 year old male who presented with worsening shortness of
breath and hypotension. He presented to his PCP's office for
follow up and was noted to be short of breath and hypotensive
with SBP's in the 80's. His symptoms
started approximately 2-3 weeks prior to presentation. He mainly
had difficulty with shortness of breath. This shortness of
breath
would prevent him from sleeping comfortably. He describes
symptoms consistent with orthopnea and PND. He notes that he saw
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a couple of weeks ago and was started on lasix and
aldactone. He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation at
that
time as well. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for
evaluation of revascularization and possible aortic valve
replacement.

CXR [**2198-7-17**]:
Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest obtained.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass
haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema.
The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall
low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation.
There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of
pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive
heart failure.  Bony structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

LHC [**2198-7-23**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal
without any
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in
the
proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80%
stenosis
throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the
origin of the
OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent
left-to-right
collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The
peak
gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin
equation,
the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion.
5. Consideration for AVR-CABG.

LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  Dental
examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth.
The patient refused.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where
the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left
atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and
initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  He
remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved
with diuresis.  Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was
initiated.  This was discontinued when rate was controlled.  He
failed a trial of Precedex.  He self-extubated and was
re-intubated without incident.  He developed a leukocytosis and
was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  There was no
growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  Tube feeds were
started on POD 3.  He was extubated on POD 4.  By this time, all
vasoactive drips had been weaned.  Coumadin was resumed for
chronic a-fib.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Beta-blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight.
ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine,
which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #10
the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous
sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic
antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was discharged  to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
