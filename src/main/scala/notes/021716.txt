Chief Complaint:
Unwitnessed fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
83 y/o spanish speaking man with PMHx dementia, ICH, CHF,
depression and HTN presenting s/p unwhitnessed fall. Pt is
minimally communicative at baseline [**2-14**] dementia, lives at a
nursing home and is dependent of all ADLs (at the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6930**] nursing home vitals were 97.3 HR 79 BP 130/74 RR 20).

His nursing home was [**Name (NI) 653**], nurses heard a bang and he was
found lying with head against side table, sheets wrapped around
legs, not incontinent, no loss of bowel/bladder (baseline
incontinent of urine), no tongue biting, agitated but alert
right after event/ uses walker for ambulation, often
non-compliant; baseline oriented to person; usual place of care
is [**Hospital1 2177**].

He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where CXR was notable for
widened mediastinum on CXR. CTA of the chest was performed to
r/o aortic dissection, and was notable for a thoracoabdominal
aneurysm involving the ascending, descending, thoracic and
abdominal aorta. Vascular surgey was consulted and recommended
permissive hypotension with goal SBP 110s and ICU admission.
There were no EKG changes and no evidence of coronary arterial
involvement. He is not a surgical candidate per vascular
evaluation.
.
His initial vitals in the ED were T 98.2 BP 170/86 HR 60 RR 16
Sat 100%RA. He received lorazepam IV 2 mg x2, labetgalol 100mg
IV x1, lasix 100 mg x1, esmolol and nitroprusside drip were
initiated. Vitals on transfer to MICU were 97.6, 79, 121/81, 19,
98%RA.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 97.3, BP 92/70, HR
84, RR 10, Sat 100%RA.

Review of systems:
Denied fever, chills. Denies headache, Denies shortness of
breath, cough. Denies chest pain. Denies abdominal pain.

Imaging:
CT C spine without contrast:
------------
FINDINGS:  There no evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Severe cervical
spine degenerative changes are present, with moderate loss of
disc space,
anterior and posterior osteophyte formation, and subchondral
cysts at all
levels.  There is minimal anterolisthesis of C3-C4 and C4-C5.
Ventral thecal sac is indented by osteophytes at several levels.
 Marked uncovertebral and facet joint hypertrophy results in
mild-to-moderate foraminal stenoses.

Visualized brain is significant for global atrophy.  There are
trace layering aerosolized secretions in the right maxillary
sinus.  The middle ear cavities are clear.  There is cerumen in
the bilateral external auditory canals.  There are prominent
lingual and palatine tonsils, and several right palatine
tonsilloliths are present.  A non-specific density is noted in
the right vallecula, which may represent secretions or retention
cyst.

There are no pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
Coarse
calcifications of the bilateral carotid bifurcation, right
greater than left.  The thyroid gland appears heterogeneous,
without discrete nodularity.

Imaged lung apices demonstrate a rounded density lesion at the
left lung apex. This is aortic and better demonstrated on the
chest CTA of the same date. There is diffuse emphysema and
pleuroparenchymal scarring.  Incidental note is made of an
azygos lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of fracture of significant malalignment.
Multilevel severe degenerative cervical spine changes.
2.  Partially imaged aortic abnormality.  Please refer to
subsequent CTA.

CT head without contrast:
--------
FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent
infarction.  Ventricles and sulci are diffusely enlarged,
compatible with age-related involutional changes.  A remote
right MCA infarct is present, with encephalomalacia in the right
parietal lobe.  There is relative sparing of the peripheral
cortical layers, compatible with laminar necrosis.
Corresponding ex vacuo dilation of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Diffuse, partially confluent periventricular and subcortical
white matter hypodensities compatible with small vessel ischemic
disease.  Chronic lacunes are noted in the bilateral caudate
heads, caudolenticular junction, and insula. There are no acute
fractures.  Note is made of a remote nasal fracture.  Mild
mucosal thickening at the frontal ethmoid junction and right
maxillary sinus.  The mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities
are clear.  There is cerumen in the bilateral external auditory
canals.  Orbits and intraconal structures are symmetric.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence fractures,  hemorrhage or recent infarction.
2.  Global atrophy, old right MCA infarct, and microvascular
disease.

pelvis XRAY AP:
-----
no fracture

CXR AP:
----
IMPRESSION:  Severe mediastinal widening, concerning for aortic
aneurysm.
Please refer to subsequent CT for further details

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast
-------------
CHEST:  There is an 8-mm hypodense nodule in the right thyroid
lobe.
Moderate, apical-predominant centrilobular emphysema and pleural
parenchymal scarring are noted.  At the lung bases, there is
early fibrosis with subpleural reticulations, architectural
distortion, and traction bronchiolectasis.  Incidental note is
made of an azygos lobe.  The trachea demonstrates a lunate
morphology, which can be associated with tracheomalacia in the
correct clinical setting.  Scattered retained secretions are
noted throughout the airways.  No pleural effusions.

The heart is normal in size, with a small amount of physiologic
pericardial fluid.  Dense calcifications are noted in the aortic
valve.  The central pulmonary arteries are unremarkable.
Multiple prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are
present, but not pathologically enlarged by size criteria.

Note is made of a small sliding hiatal hernia.

ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are unremarkable.
 There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The spleen is normal in size.

The adrenals are normal.  The kidneys are atrophic, but enhance
symmetrically without masses or hydronephrosis.

The stomach and small bowel are normal.

PELVIS:  The a
