brain radiation.  She was stable the night of admisison but the
next day she was put on a non-rebreather for hypoxia and
transferred to the MICU. In the MICU she was diuresed, had a
negative CTA, and was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Tamaflu. Tamaflu

CXR [**9-15**]:
- marked deterioration of the radiographic image.
- preexisting lung nodules have increased in size
- neralized reticular pattern that was previously invisible is
seen,   together with newly appeared small bilateral pleural
effusions
- pattern suggests the presence of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
- in the medial aspect of the middle lobe, a small area of
hypoventilation has newly appeared.
- Despite the multiple lytic bone lesions seen on the CT
examination from [**2124-8-24**], none of these lesions is
detectable on the chest radiograph.
.
CTA [**2124-9-17**]
1. Worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity
in a
perihilar and upper lobe distribution, given rapid interval
progression, may represent pulmonary edema or multifocal
bronchopneumonia. Recommend short term follow-up to document
resolution given known underlying metastasis. No evidence of
pulmonary embolism.
2. Unchanged diffuse osseous, hepatic and pulmonary metastases.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia: The patient was tranferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypoxia
requiring a non-rebreather to stabilize her oxygen sats.  She
had a convincing story for a viral infection as her and her
husband had URI symptoms and cough for the past few weeks.  The
differential initally was broad and she was started on a heparin
gtt due to concern for PE.  She was also started on broad
spectrum antibiotics and anti-flu [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (vanc, cefepime, and
tamiflu).  Induced sputum was sent to rule out PCP as she had
recently been weaned off steroids in the setting of undergoing
whole brain irradiation.  Sputum was negative for PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]
urinary legionella antigen was sent and was negative.   EKG had
no ichemic changes and cardiac enzymes were negative for MI.
She underwent a CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did show a
marked worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass
opacity in a perihilar and upper lobe distribution.  LENIs were
also negative for DVT.  Tamiflu was stopped when her flu DFA
returned negative. On exam she did not appear volume overloaded.
 A TTE was done and showed and EF of 75% and no evidence of wall
motion abnormalities.  She was given standing albuterol and
ipatropium nebs.  Her hypoxia slowly improved and she was
satting in the mid 90's on 6L NC. Upon abmulating she sated 95%
on 6L and 91% on 4L. She was discharge on home O2 and VNA
services. She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Breast cancer:  Patient received one treatment of chemotherapy
while hospitalized. She tolerated the treatment well. She was
discharged on zofran, ativan, compazine for possible
post-chemotheraphy nausea.
.
# Code Status: Prior to transfer she was DNR/DNI.  Upon
discussion, she was willing to be intubated for acute pneumonia
but specifically states that she does not want to be on a
ventilator long term. She has discussed this decision with her
HCP, her husband.
