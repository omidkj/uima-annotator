Admission Date:  [**2171-4-18**]       Discharge Date:[**2171-4-24**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
congestive heart failure who woke up 5 AM on [**2171-4-17**] with
4 out of 10 substernal chest pain.  She called Emergency
Medical Services two to three hours later.  The pain in her
chest awoke her from her sleep and radiated into her back.
Her electrocardiogram in the field showed some inferior ST
elevations and ST depressions.  She was treated with
sublingual Nitrogen, nitroglycerin and the pain was decreased
on arrival to the outside Emergency Department.  The patient
did note some shortness of breath, nausea, and vomited times
one in the Emergency Department.  She was treated with
Heparin, Aspirin, Integrilin and Plavix.  On the morning of
[**2171-4-18**], the patient vomited bright red blood.  The
heparin and Integrilin were stopped.  At that point the
patient's chest pain and electrocardiogram changes recurred.
The patient was given a heparin bolus and then transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  The patient went to cardiac catheterization
on arrival to the [**Hospital6 256**] where
she was found to have three vessel disease, and had three
stents placed to her left anterior descending.  In the
Catheterization Laboratory the patient was transfused 1 unit
of packed red blood cells and her breathing remained stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Type 2 diabetes, diet-controlled;
2.  Congestive heart failure with normal ejection fraction on
an echocardiogram in [**2170-12-18**]; 3.  Hypertension; 4.
Question of history of atrial fibrillation; 5.  History of
common bile duct stone; 6.  Diverticulitis; 7.  Peptic ulcer
disease; 8.  Gastritis; 9.  Osteoarthritis; 10.  History of
pancreatitis.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Zantac 50 q.d.; Atenolol 25 q.d.; Lasix

daily.  Her lawyer, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 805**] is her health care proxy.
She is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate and this is
documented in the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to
the CCU revealed vital signs with blood pressure of 116/64
with a mean arterial pressure of 86, oxygen saturation 96% on
5 liters.  Heartrate 88.  In general the patient is alert and
oriented, somewhat agitated, trying to sit up.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat, pupils are equally round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
Oropharynx with dry blood.  Nasogastric tube in place.  Neck,
no jugulovenous distension appreciated.  Lungs, bibasilar
crackles with no wheezes or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular, Regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen, soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, warm with 1+ dorsalis
pedis bilaterally, right venous and arterial sheaths in
place.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Good capillary
refill.  Neurologic examination, the patient is moving all
extremities, speaking but not always making sense.

LABORATORY DATA:  Nasogastric tube lavage was positive for
bright red blood which did not clear with 250 cc.

Laboratory data on arrival to [**Hospital6 2018**] included a white count of 23.5, hematocrit of 36.5 and
platelets of 340.  Sodium was 134, potassium 3.8, chloride
98, bicarbonate 18, BUN 44, creatinine 1.1, glucose 187,
magnesium 1.2, phosphorus 5.7.  CK was 2219, MB 400, MB index
of 18 and troponin greater than 50.  An arterial blood gases
in the Catheterization Laboratory was 7.37, 42 and 79.  Her
urinalysis was negative.  Her CKs from the outside hospital
initially CK on [**4-17**], was 129, later on [**4-17**], CK was 1503
with an MB of 171 and MBI of 11.4.  At 12 AM on [**4-18**], CKs
1736, MB 199, MBI 11.5.  The patient had a troponin on the
first of 11.

Results of the cardiac catheterization revealed a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 32, PA pressures of 63/29 and RA
pressure of 15.  Cardiac index was 1.8.  The patient had
three vessel disease with 30% left main coronary artery
lesion, and 80% mid left anterior descending lesion,
approximately included the left circumflex that had three
stents placed and an occluded right coronary artery.  The
patient was given Dopamine in the Catheterization Laboratory
for hypotension.

Electrocardiogram from the patient's baseline on [**2169-12-18**] has normal sinus, normal access.  On [**4-17**], on arrival
to the outside hospital she had ST depressions in V1 through
V3 which were about 1 mm in size.  At 8 AM on [**4-18**], her ST
depressions in V1 through V4 were increased to 2 mm and later
on [**4-18**] she had persistent ST depressions in V2 to V5 of 2
mm.  Chest x-ray on admission, post catheterization shows
congestive heart failure with interstitial edema but no frank
pulmonary edema.  Swan tip was in place.  Nasogastric tube
was in place and calcifications in coronaries were noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who is
status post ST elevation, inferior posterior myocardial
infarction complicated by hematemesis while on
anticoagulation.  The patient is status post catheterization
with three VD and three stents placed to the left circumflex.

Cardiovascular - Ischemia, the patient is status post a
inferior posterior myocardial infarction with CKs peaked of
2219.  She is status post three stents to her left
circumflex.  The patient was placed on Plavix 75 q.d. and
Aspirin.  Initially beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were
held while blood pressure was unstable in the immediate post
catheterization setting.  Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors
were eventually able to be started and these were titrated up
such that at the time of discharge she was on Lopressor 25
b.i.d. and Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.  The patient developed chest
pain on the morning of [**4-19**] which showed some exaggeration
of her ST depression, and pain was relieved with one
sublingual Nitroglycerin.  It was discussed with the
Cardiology Team and decided that the patient should not
return to the Catheterization Laboratory at that time.  She
had no recurrence of chest pain.

Pump, the patient is status post inferior posterior
myocardial infarction.  Echocardiogram on [**4-19**] showed an
ejection fraction of 25%, symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
2+ tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient was put on ACE
inhibitor and beta blocker for her congestive heart failure
as well as Lasix titrated up to 40 b.i.d. at the time of
discharge.  She was also on potassium repletion.

Blood pressure, the patient had some hypotension in the
Catheterization Laboratory but once arriving to the CCU and
to the floor her blood pressure was stable.

Gastrointestinal - The patient is status post upper
gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of Integrilin and
Heparin.  The patient was transfused a total of 2 units of
packed red blood cells and her hematocrit stayed stable
throughout her hospital stay.  She had no further
gastrointestinal bleeding and her nasogastric tube was
removed.  She was seen by Gastroenterology who would not
intervene at this time.  She was tolerating p.o. diet at the
time of discharge and still pacing some guaiac positive
stools as expected.  The patient needs to continue on Plavix
times one month and aspirin for life.

Heme - The patient's hematocrit despite the gastrointestinal
bleed remained fairly stable.  She received 3 units of packed
red blood cells and remained hemodynamically stable.

Infectious disease - The patient was noted to have elevated
white count, urine culture from [**4-18**] grew out Escherichia
coli and Proteus.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin on
[**4-18**].  Of note, she also developed some green sputum on [**4-21**], and was treated fo
