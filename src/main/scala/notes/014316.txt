steroids at baseline admitted with shortness of breath. Patient
was discharged on [**11-7**] for COPD flare on steroid taper by 10
mg/ week, currently at 30 mg daily. She begain feeling SOB
yesterday evening and took several nebs. She had difficulty

.
CXR [**11-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Severe emphysematous changes with superimposed
pneumonia vs
atelectasis within the left lower lung. Recommend PA and Lateral
for further evaluation.
.
ECG [**11-21**]: sinus tachycardia, rate 136, no significant change
from prior
.
CXR [**11-23**]:
Left lower lobe is still collapsed. New consolidation at the
base of the
right lung medially could be contralateral atelectasis or
pneumonia. The
pattern suggests difficulty clearing secretions or recurrent
aspiration.
Upper lungs are hyperlucent suggesting emphysema. Heart size is
normal.
Pleural effusion, if any, is small.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo female with severe COPD on chronic steroids admitted with
SOB secondary to COPD exacerbation.
.
#. Shortness of breath:  Most likely COPD exacerbation in
setting of steroid taper (now at 30 mg/day of prednisone) with
concominant LLL pneumonia on CXR.  As the patient had been
admitted recently, this pneumonia was suspected to be a hospital
acquired pneumonia.  She also had been treated with levaquin
multiple times in the past for COPD flares.  Based on those two
reasons, the patient was started on azithromycin in addition to
vancomycin and zosyn for HAP.  She briefly required BIPAP on
admission, however did not require other non-invasive or
invasive airway during her ICU course.  She was quickly
transitioned to 4-5L NC and sats remained stable at 88-94%.  She
is on 4L at baseline.  She was initially maintained on nebulizer
treatments of albuterol and atrovent, however then switched to
Xopinex given her significant tachycardia.  She was also started
on a short course of high dose steroids of solumedrol 125 IV q 8
hours for 4 days.  She was then switched to a long prednisone
taper which is currently at 30mg daily.  She was started on
bactrim prophylaxis for chronic steroid use and frequent
exacerbations requiring high doses of steroids.  She was
evaluated by PT and found to be very deconditioned in the
setting of significant lung disease and it was felt that she
would benefit from acute pulmonary rehab.  She completed 8 days
of vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP and her WBC count trended down
and she remained afebrile once transitioned to the floor.  Her
PICC was removed prior to d/c given no further need for IV meds.
 She should continue bactrim ppx.  She will require a slow
steroid taper, currently at 30mg daily.  Her inhalers were
continued on discharge.
.
#.  Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to hospital acquired
pneumonia worsened by high dose steroid use.  Trended WBC and it
normalized.  Monitored fever curve.  Continued  azithromycin,
vancomycin, and zosyn. Azithromycin was discontinued on transfer
to the floor.  Blood, urine, sputum cultures were negative at
the time of discharge. WBC was 14 on the day of discharge and
the patient remained afebrile.  Her slight leukocytosis was
attributed to steroids given she looked clinically well.
.
# Anxiety: Patient was continued on ativan prn.
.
#. Osteoporosis:  History of vertebral fractures. Continued
calcium and vit D.
.
#. Tachycardia: Patient has longstanding tachycardia.  Was
euthyroid on last admission, had negative CTA on [**2196-11-1**].  Most
likely worsened by increased albuterol use.  No evidence of
dehydration.  Monitored on telemetry and HR improved with
antibiotics and improvement in her pulmonary status.
.
#. Left rib pain:  Concern for rib fracture given osteoporosis,
however x-ray's negative.  Oxycodone was used as needed for
pain.
.
# Ppx: HSQ, bowel regimen, calcium/vitamin D, bactrim
.
