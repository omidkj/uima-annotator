Intern Admission Note:
.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo male with
PMH as listed below who is being transferred from the MICU.
Refer to initial MICU note for more details. He presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with fever, dyspnea, and hypotension. He was
thought to be in septic shock secondary to a pneumonia. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**1-13**] for further management. He was
initially sedated and unresponsive and required pressors to
maintain his blood pressure. He then had significant run of
hemodynamically stable VT which was unresponsive to
antiarrythmics and he required 1 shock. He was transferred to
the MICU for possible temporary wire placement.
.
Of note, pt has history of VT s/p ablation and ICD placement in
[**2-16**]. The ICD was removed in [**10-16**] secondary to infected leads.
He was hospitalized again in [**12-16**] for hypotension secondary to
RP bleed.
.
In the MICU he was agressively treated with antibiotics and
given IVFs given clinical picture consistent with sepsis.
Possible sources of infection included pneumonia and sacral
decubitus ulcer. Pt underwent bronchoscopy which showed collapse
of LLL. Pt afebrile and hemodynamically stable upon transfer to
medical floor this afternoon.
.

.
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo male with PMH significant for CAD,
CHF, VT s/p ablation and ICD placement in [**2-16**] w/ ICD removal
for infected wires in [**10-16**], transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] for
septic shock now extubated.
.
1)Sepsis/ID: Likely secondary to sacral decubitus ulcer and
pneumonia. WBC elevated at 26 on admission, now 20 this AM.
Likely elevated in setting of steroids. Blood cultures positive
for E coli, sputum growing Enterococcus and Acinetobacter, foot
culture growing Enteroccus and E coli, sacral decubitus growing
staph species, GNRs (ESBL klebsiella), diphtheroids. Refer to
OMR for sensitivity data. Currently afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. ID following closely.
- MRI of lumbar/sacral spine given sacral decubitus ulcer and
underlying osteomyelitis
- Ct Meropenem and Tobramycin; doses modified this PM as per ID
- Check Tobramycin level after 3rd dose
- f/u ID reccs
.
2)Respiratory failure: Secondary to VAP. Bronchoscopy on [**1-19**]
revealed large mucus plug in LLL with progression to LLL
collapse on repeat bronchoscopy on [**1-21**]. O2 sat currently
stable.
- Aggressive chest PT
- Routine nebs
.
3)VT: patient has a h/o VT s/p ablation. Underwent ICD placement
but was removed for infected wires. Patient had episode of VT in
the setting of Levophed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. No responsive to
Procainamide and required 1 shock.
- Ct Mexiletine
- Per EP: If patient is in VT will try Lidocaine 75-100mg/kg
bolus followed by 1-2 mg/kg maintenance
.
4)CAD: s/p CABG in [**2163**] and PCI of proximal and distal left
circumflex. Patient did present with elevated troponins at OSH
in the setting of sepsis.
- Ct ASA, Lipitor, beta-blocker, and ace-inhibitor
.
5)CHF: ECHO in [**9-16**] with EF~25-30%. Patient has evidence of
fluid overload in his lower extremities and crackles on
pulmonary exam.
- Ct beta blocker and ace-inhibitor, titrate up as HR & BP able
to tolerate
.
6)Sacral decubitus ulcer: Patient likely has osteomyelitis since
the ulcer is probable to bone. Plastics was consulted and did
not feel he was a surgical candidate given his hemodynamic
status.
- MRI of lumbar and sacral spine, as per ID reccs
- ? reconsult plastics pending MRI
- Kinair bed
- Ct [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing
- kinair bed with q3hour rotation
.
7)Thrombocytopenia: Patient has history of HIT, diagnosed in
most recent admission. [**Month (only) 116**] be medication related secondary to
Linezolid.
- Ct to monitor
- Transfuse if plt<[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
.
8)Gout: Patient's L knee was recently tapped by rheumatology on
[**1-18**] and [**1-20**]. Aspirated fluid consistent with gout. Patient was
started on [**Month/Year (2) 2768**] and Colchicine in MICU. L elbow joint
erythematous, edematous, and painful on exam.
- Ct [**Month/Year (2) 2768**] taper
- Ct Colchicine
- Daily joint examinations
.
9)Hypertension: Patient's regimen was initially held given
hypotension and sepsis. Restarted on beta-blocker and
ace-inhibitor. Tolerating well.
- Ct current regimen
.
10)FEN: Ct tube feeds, ground diet with thin liquids
.
11)Prophylaxis: No DVT prophylaxis given HIT, PPI
.
12)Code: FULL, but will verify with HCP
.
13)Access: LIJ central line
.
14)Communication: With patient, health care proxy
.
15) Dispo: Pending clinical improvement

Saturday
*Triggered for hypotension, gave 1 unit of blood, blood pressure
remained in high 80s.  He has been hypotensive most of the day
in the 80s, gave him 250 cc of fluid, concerned for fungal
infection (started him on meropenem), if continues to be
hypotensive, consider give stress dose steroids.  Attending
wanted paracentesis to rule out SBP or fungal SBP given
abdominal distension and pain.  By abdominal ultrasound unable
to find a place to tap him, tonight going for ultrasound guided
paracentesis.   D/ced his NPH as its been held for several doses
now and he has normal blood sugars.
