Expired [**2105-12-30**]

Pertinent Results:
[**12-7**] CT Head:
Large right basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension. No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. 8-mm
leftward shift of midline structures. Please refer to subsequent
CTA head for further details.

[**12-7**] CTA head:
Large right putaminal intraparenchymal hemorrhage causing
subfalcine herniation, originating from an arteriovenous
malformation fed via the rightlateral lenticulostriate arteries
and drained by subependymal veins. Catheter angiography is
recommended to evaluate the AVM anatomy in further detail.

[**12-8**] Cerebral Angiogram:
IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 16745**] [**Known lastname 93799**] underwent cerebral angiography which
revealed a 3 x 3 x 2 cm nidus in the right basal ganglia which
predominately drains into the deep venous structures and into
the straight sinus. Based on the angio architecture this would
be a Spetzler grade IV AVM and would not be amenable for surgery
or embolization therapy. This was discussed with the patient and
the plan would be to repeat an angiogram in a month's time in
anticipation of radiosurgery.

[**2105-12-13**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-7**] through 9:

Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly more pronounced today, but
there is no
pulmonary edema or change in borderline pulmonary vascular
engorgement. I see no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right
subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.

[**2105-12-14**] LENIES: No DVT in both lower extremities.

[**2105-12-16**] Head CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared with [**2105-12-7**], there has been a right
frontoparietal
craniectomy, and there is interval increase in transcranial
herniation of
brain.
2. Redemonstration of right basal ganglionic hemorrhage with
intraventricular
extension.
3. Stable appearance of left transfrontal external ventricular
drainage
catheter with its tip in the region of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]; there
is no
hydrocephalus.

[**2105-12-16**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Little change in basal ganglionic hemorrhage with
intraventricular
extension.
2. Ventricular shunt catheter terminates in the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left
lateral ventricle, slightly less centrally than the prior exam.
No
hydrocephalus.
3. Unchanged transcranial herniation of brain at the
frontoparietal
craniectomy site.

[**2105-12-18**] LENIS:
1. No deep vein thrombosis identified in either arm.
2. Thrombophlebitis of the right cephalic vein and also of the
left basilic and left cephalic veins, all of which are
superficial veins

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2105-12-19**]
1. 9 mm of leftward shift of the normally midline structures
(compared to 3 mm before).

2. Interval decrease in the size of a left intraventricular
hemorrhage.

3. Unchanged right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2105-12-20**]
1. Interval minimal increase in leftward shift of midline
components since
[**2105-12-19**], with slightly increased effacement of the
right lateral
ventricle. Stable mild transgaleal herniation through the right
craniotomy
site.
2. Unchanged size and appearance of a large right basal ganglia
hematoma. No new hemorrhage detected.
3. The quadrigeminal and suprasellar cisterns remain preserved.
4. Unchanged positioning of a left-sided VP shunt

LENIES: [**2105-12-21**]
IMPRESSION: No DVT in right or left lower extremities

CT Head [**12-24**]

1. Continued evolution of right basal ganglial hematoma with
stability of
surrounding edema.

2. New, depressed appearance of brain parenchyma at the
crainectomy site with increased leftward shift of midline
structures and mild compression of brain stem. Although this
indicated decrease in intracranial pressure, paradoxical
enlargement of the left lateral ventricle.

CXR [**12-24**]

 A right-sided PICC tip terminates at the lower SVC. A tubular
structure projecting over the left hemithorax across the midline
into the
right hemi-abdomen most compatible with VP shunt. An endogastric
tube courses inferiorly with its sideport projecting over the
gastric bubble. The heart size is large, possibly exaggerated by
AP technique. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

[**12-24**] Stool Cx
Negative for CDIFF

[**12-24**] CSF Cx
Gram stain: No Polys no orgs.

[**12-25**] NCHCT
IMPRESSION: Since the previous CT examination, there is decrease
in
depression at the level of the craniectomy defect. Decreased
mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is seen. Otherwise,
the examination is stable.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93799**] was intubated emergently in the Emergency department
after vomiting in the CT Scanner. After review of his imaging
studies and emergent left frontal EVD was placed and the patient
was taken to the Operating room emergently for a right
hemicraniectomoy, details of the procedure can be found in the
operative report.

Post operatively the patient was transported intubated to the
intensive care unit.

ICU Course:

On [**12-8**] he underwent a diagnostic angiogram to better
charecterize the right sided BG AVM which was too deep to
saftely be embolized.

On [**12-9**], he was successfully extubated and the subgaleal JP
drain was removed.

on [**12-11**], A CT of the head was performed which showed decrease in
the size of the hematoma. A clamping trial of the EVD proved
unsuccessful with his ICPs rising to the mid 20s.

On [**12-12**], patient spiked a fever to 101.1, blood, urine and CSF
cultures were sent;Dilantin was changed to Keppra to eliminate
the source of fevers.

On [**12-13**], EVD clamped and unclamped secondary to elevated and
sustained ICPs.

He was seen by speech and swallow and was cleared for po intake
with supervision.  He also had screening lenies which were
negative. Another clamp trial was performed which was well
tolerated for *** amt of time.

On [**12-15**] the patient was much more spontaneous verbally and
neurologically improved. His cultures remai
