TELEMETRY: no episodes of SVT present

ECG [**2104-5-13**]: SVT at 180 bpm. L axis. Possible retrograde P wave
in lead II after QRS indicating that AVNRT is a likely etiology.
LVH present. Diffuse ST depressions likely secondary to LVH and
rapid rate.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2104-5-13**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is a restrictive paramembranous ventricular
septal defect with a large proximal septal aneurysm measuring
1.5
x 1.0 cm. There is a turbulent jet. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function.
Paramembranous ventricular septal aneurysm with restrictive
ventricular septal defect. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Biatrial
dilation.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**2104-5-11**]:
CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST: Partially imaged thyroid gland is
unremarkable.  There is small amount of fluid within the
pericardial recess, demonstrating Hounsfield units of up to 18.
Aorta, pulmonary artery, heart, and pericardium are
unremarkable.
Heart is not enlarged. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy. There are bilateral anterior
ground-glass opacities
throughout both lungs, most compatible with contusion in setting
of trauma.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures with surrounding
hematoma and air are noted on the left side. A tiny right
basilar
pneumothorax is present with a tiny focus of air in the right
pleural space inferiorly (3:55). There is also a tiny left
pneumothorax with a trace amount of hemothorax. There is also
some subcutaneous emphysema and air along the lateral thorax
musculature.  Bilateral dependent atelectatic changes are seen.
There is no mediastinal shift. Airways are grossly patent. Small
amount of fluid within the esophagus can place the patient at
risk for aspiration.
ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: Focal area of decreased
enhancement adjacent to the falciform ligament in the liver
likely represents focal fat infiltration. There is no evidence
of
liver injury. Mild periportal edema is seen. The gallbladder,
spleen, pancreas, adrenals, kidneys are unremarkable with no
evidence of trauma. The aorta and iliac vessels are
unremarkable.

There is no lymphadenopathy. There is no retroperitoneal
hematoma. Reflux of contrast in the left gonadal vein ending in
pelvic varices can be seen in pelvic congestion syndrome. The
uterus is lobulated containing fibroids. The urinary bladder is
grossly unremarkable. There is no bowel obstruction or evidence
of bowel wall trauma. There is no mesenteric hematoma or
evidence
of mesenteric injury. Rectum is unremarkable.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are displaced fractures of the third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight left ribs. There are also
non-displaced fractures of the right second, third, fourth,
sixth
ribs. Fifth rib fracture on the right side is displaced.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral rib fractures with bilateral pulmonary
contusions, tiny bilateral pneumothoraces.
2. Fibroid uterus.
3. Reflux of contrast in a dilated left gonadal vein ending in
pelvic varices is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in
pelvic congestion syndrome.

LEFT FEMUR/ KNEE/ HIP FILM [**2104-5-11**]:
Comminuted and displaced distal femoral and patellar fractures,
with knee dislocation

CT HEAD [**2104-5-11**]:
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality. The ventricles
and
extra-axial spaces are within normal limits for age. There is no
fracture.  Left vertex subgaleal hematoma is moderate-sized.
Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly
clear.
There is partial ossification of the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Left parietal subgaleal hematoma. No acute
intracranial
abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 54184**] is a 53 year old woman with a self reported history
of an unspecified seizure disorder as well as a history of
congenital VSD, SVT/palpitations, RA, hypothyroidism and anxiety
who presented after a motor vehicle accident on [**2104-5-11**] after
having a seizure while driving her car.  She sustained left [**2-25**]
rib fractures, right [**1-26**] rib fxs, open L supracondylar femur fx,
right distal tib/fib ankle fx, and a right patellar fx.  Her
ribs were managed nonoperatively and she was taken to the OR on
[**2104-5-12**] for repair of her orthopaedic injuries and again on
[**2104-5-22**].

Etiology of pt accident is unclear as pt does not recall any
aspect of the incident. Pt has history of fainting and both
cardiac and questionable neurologic work up sin the past. Thus
as part of her syncope work up cadiology and neurology consults
were called.

Neuro: During her hospital stay the patient was evaluated for
her self reported history of seizures.  The work-up was
unremarkable and there were no further "seizures".  Per
neurology - the patient does not have documented hx of seizures
and prior work-up has been negative including MRI of brain with
and without contrast and EEG. LOC episodes most likely cardiac
but given family reporting episodes witnessing LOC an EEG was
repeated and shows mildly slow rhythm of 7Hz likely due to pain
meds but also intermittent, focal L
