Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath, Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
50 female with h/o COPD on 4L home 02, idopathic cardiomyopathy,
CRI and bipolar d/o who presented to the ED today with acute
onset SOB, which started this am, hemoptysis, chronic
mucopurulent cough and tachycardia. THe hemoptysis was about
"the bottom of a cup" and is present every time she coughs
something up. At baseline she has a greenish sputum, that is
unchanged from prior. She denies any CP, other than her usual
CP. She reports fevers several days prior for two days. She had
one episode of vomiting yesterday, when she brought up food
contents, but denies any hematemesis. She denies headaches, abd
pain, nausea, diarrhea, melena, dysuria. She has occ orthopnea
and sleeps on 3 pillows. She has stable atypical CP, unchanged
from prior. She reports a "40lb weight loss over 40 days". she
reports her granddaughter was recently sick with "pneumonia".
.
In the ED the pt was satting 88% on her home 4L. She received
combivent, prednisone 60 and azithromycin in ED. An ABG was done
and showed 7.34/60/106 which is close to the patient's baseline.
The pt was also found to be in acute renal failure and a CT was
not advisable. A VQ scan was ordered and the pt was started on a
Heparin gtt. 1L NS was given.

EKG: Sinus arrhythmia with atrial and ventricular premature
beats. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-5-29**] baseline
artifact is not seen and rhythm change is new.
.
Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler imaging is consistent with
normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2198-4-20**], the left ventricular function has
normalized.
.
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2199-5-31**], [**2199-5-29**].
Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged; right
heart border obscuration again seen, as seen on previous
examinations. Again identified is severe apical emphysema. This
may accentuate the appearance of lower lobe vascular crowding.
Linear atelectasis identified at the left lung base. No pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax. Osseous structures appear unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of severe apical emphysema and
lower lobe vascular crowding, without significant change since
[**2199-5-27**] examinations.
.
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The marked upper lobe bullous emphysema
is unchanged. This accentuates the appearance of lower lobe
vascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation. No pleural
effusions are present. The cardiac size, mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Biapical bullous emphysema without pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
# COPD exacerbation:  Patient was treated with IV steroids,
azithromycin, and [**Year (4 digits) 1988**] nebs with improvement back to her
baseline.  She was discharged home on a slow prednisone [**Year (4 digits) 15123**].
She is on continuous oxygen at home at baseline.
.
# Hemoptysis:  Given patient reported no risk factors for PE and
had no lower extremity swelling on exam, work-up for PE was
deferred.  Patient improved quickly to her baseline with
treatment of her COPD flare and her hemoptysis resolved.
Patient denies any history of weight loss, but CT chest without
contrast (given poor renal function) could be considered to
further investigate for evidence of malignancy.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's creatinine returned to her
baseline off her ACE and with supportive IVF.  She was
discharged off her ACEI, given her potassium has been running
high.  She will follow-up with her primary care doctor to
discuss restarting this medication if her creatinine and
potassium remain stable.

# Type 2 diabetes: Patient's sugars were difficult to control
while patient was on steroids.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and
recommended starting NPH, in addition to increasing the
patient's home glipizide.  The patient received teaching with a
glucometer and was able to check her sugars confidently prior to
[**Last Name (un) **].  She was given a schedule to wean her NPH as her
steroid dose is decreased and she will have close follow-up at
[**Last Name (un) **].
.
# Somnolence/Pysch:  Patient was noted to be intermittently
somnolent.  The concern in the ICU was for C02 retention;
however, repeat ABGs were no different from her baseline.
Patient's neuroleptics were held with improvement in sx.  She
remains on Depakote; risperidal held; and seroquel reduced to 50
mg po qhs.
.
# CHF:  Repeat Echo actually demonstrated improvement in EF to
normal.  Blood pressure well controlled on her home diltiazem,
in addition to newly started nifedipine in the setting of
elevated bp's off her ACEI.
.
# EPS:  During her hospitalization noted to be intermittently
jittery.  Initial concern was ?myoclonic jerks. Repeat ABGs
without change in C02.  Seen by Neuro/Psych who felt etiology
likely secondary to EPS and steroids.  Changes to neuroleptics
as described above.
.
# Sinus tachycardia:  On the floor, patient had rare bursts of a
SVT which appears to be sinus tachycardia.  Cardiology was
consulted for
