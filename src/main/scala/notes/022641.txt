History of Present Illness:
Please see original MICU Admit note dated [**2136-3-16**].  In brief, Mr.
[**Known lastname 96706**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o a-fib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG X
2, and recent hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 112**] for C. diff colitis who
initially presented with hypotension and supratherapeutic INR.
Per wife, pt had ongoing diarrhea prior to presentation. In [**Name (NI) **],
pt's BP 60/30, given 2L IVFs without improvement in BPs and pt
started on pressors with improvement of SBPs to 100s. RIJ
placed, given vancomycin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, flagyl, and
10 units vit K for INR > 20. NCHCT and CT abd/pelvis without
bleed.
.
In the MICU, given 2 units FFP. Due to continued hypotension,
neo and vasopressin were added to levophed. [**Last Name (un) **] stim wnl. Had
brief episode of SVT to 180s, resolved with carotid massage.
Cardiac enzymes showed flat CKs, but elevated CK-MB (18), MBI
(23.1), and troponin peak to 0.95 in setting of acute on chronic
renal failure which was thought to be pre-renal in etiology.
Intubated on [**3-20**] for worsening mental status and airway
protection. Infectious w/u thus far negative beyond CXR with ?
retrocardiac opacity, fluffy infiltrates, and pleural effusions.
He was treated for HAP with IV vanc/cefepime, kept on IV cipro,
and treated for c. diff with po vanc/flagyl. Pressors weaned off
on [**3-21**], extubated without event on [**3-22**]. The patient was called
out to the medical floor on [**3-24**].  Upon transfer to the floor,
his vital signs were T: 97.0, BP: 126/65, HR: 93, RR: 20, O2 95%
3L NC.
.
On the floor, the patient had blood pressures in the 90s
systolic, with HR in the 80s-110s, with SaO2 persistently in the
high 90s. Initially, he was found to be more tachycardic, and
his outpatient lopressor was re-started to control his atrial
fibrillation. The patient had completed an 8 day course of
cefepime and cipro for pneumonia, and these antibiotics were
discontinued. The patient received 10 mg IV lasix in the AM on
[**3-25**] to promote diuresis, given that the patient was felt to be
intravascularly depleted with third spacing after fluid
resuscitation. The patient's WBC had been followed, and over the
past 3 days was 23-->31-->28.1.  Differential on [**3-24**] showed 91
% neutrophils, 1% bands, 3% lymphs.  All blood and urine
cultures were no growth to date, including repeat C. diff.
toxin. Pt received a 250 mL NS bolus for BP systolic 88.
Nightfloat called again for BP 73/50s. 1 L NS hung wide open,
with pressures transiently bumping to 90s systolic, but BP noted
as low as 60s systolic.  On exam, patient was noted to have
upper respiratory noises, but SaO2 persistently high 90s on 3L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, cuff pressures 70s systolic originally.
Patient still has CVL from prior MICU admit and was started on
levophed. Arterial line placed which demonstrated BPs 140s
systolic (on levophed) so levophed was turned off. BPs then
110s/50s (map > 60).

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with h/o recent C diff, CAD s/p CABG,
atrial fibrillation who who presented initially with
supratherapeutic INR and hypotension in setting of C. diff, and
who now is re-admitted to the ICU with hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: Etiology most likely due to sepsis.  Pt.'s
initial presentation to ICU on [**3-16**] was septic shock.
Differential sources at the time included C diff or pulmonary.
Pt completed 8 day course of ciprofloxacin and cefepime,
continued on flagyl, IV vancomycin and po vancomycin. Blood
cultures no growth. Has R IJ placed at admission. Patient wa
maintained on pressors and it was not possible to wean of due to
hypotension. Repeat blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum
cultures, c. Diff were send, however without identification of
any pathogens. Started Zosyn for ? of aspiration event. C Diff
was treated with Flagyl and po vancomycin for 14 days after
[**3-24**], and also covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia with
vancomycin. Patient had PEA arrest on [**2136-3-28**]. Goals of care
discussed with family.  Patient was continued to receive full
care but no resuscitation if heart stops.  Patient remained on
Levophed, with difficulty with titration as patient dropped
pressures with turning.  Likely initial trigger was sepsis.
ECHO [**3-29**] no right heart strain, largely unchanged from prior.
CE trending downward, likely elevated in setting of CPR and
renal failure.
.
#. Acute mental status change: Patient not waking up much since
extubation.  Had CT head on [**3-20**] which was negative for acute
intracranial hemorrhage. Patient may had difficulty clearing
sedatives, although has been off for several days. Likely due to
sepsis or pre-septic.  Continued on Flagyl, vanc IV and po.
Added Zosyn for broader coverage.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for respiratory
failure, but extubated on [**3-22**].  Was reintubated [**2136-3-28**] during
code. Patient with loud respiratory noises, secretions, coarse
breath sounds on exam. Empirical treatment for hospital acquired
pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
.
# Renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.6-2.0.  Cr now stable at
2.1  FeNa supported prerenal etiology on prior MICU admit. He
was not on maintenance IVFs, but bolus for UOP as needed. Dose
meds per CrCl < 15.
.
# Volume status: pt overloaded during LOS and pitting edema on
physical exam.  Audible wheezing. Given IV Lasix on floor.
During ICU course held Lasix, given hypotension.
.
# Supra therapeutic INR: On admission, likely related to recent
poor nutrition and diarrhea plus medication changes with
Coumadin. During the course corrected & therapeutic.
.
# CAD s/p CABG X 2: Not on aspirin at home per current
medication record. Re-cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of
hypotension as above. All of which negative.
.
# CHF: EF 15-20% on echo [**3-17**], down from reported prior of 45%
EF. Representing cute decompensation in the setting of sepsis
and possible fluid overload. Cardiac ischemia ruled out, and no
new valvular disease

During the course of MICU stay it was not possible to wean
patient off pressors and ventilator. His mental status remained
unchanged and he remained unresposive. On [**2136-4-7**] decission was
made by patients family (with the support of the medical team)
that patient should receive comfort messures only. Patient
deceased on the same day due to cardiopulmonay arrest.
