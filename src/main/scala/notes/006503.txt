The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild focal hypokinesis of
the inferolateral wall. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is preserved (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. T
