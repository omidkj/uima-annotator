Pertinent Results:
[**2133-10-23**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was heavily calcified
with a
distal eccentric 40% stenosis. The LAD had focal moderate
calcification
and was diffusely diseased. There was a proximal 30% stenosis
and 50-60%
stenosis in the mid vessel, and sent apical and septal
collaterals to
the RPL and RPDA. The LCx was diffusely diseased with total
occlusion
after OM2 with late filling of the LPL via left to left
collaterals. The
OM2 had a moderate 40-50% stenosis. The RCA had a proximal 40%
stenosis
followed by total occlusion in the proximal stent. All the
coronaries
were small caliber.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic
arterial
blood pressure (SBP 115 mm Hg). The left ventricular filling
pressure
was mildly elevated (LVEDP 17 mm Hg). There was no gradient upon

pullback of the catheter from the LV into the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed mild anterior wall hypokinesis
and
severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral and inferior walls, with
an EF
of 36%. The degree of mitral regurgitation was unable to be
assessed
given ventricular ectopy.

[**2133-10-28**] ECHO\
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic apex, severely
hypokinetic mid-basal anterior, antero-septal and lateral wall.
The remaining left ventricular segments are hypokinetic. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Improved global and focal systolic function (Epinephrine
infusion). Pesrsistent wall motion abnormalities
2. Preserved right ventyricular systolci function.
3. Mitral regurgitation is now mild.
4. Intact aorta

CXR: [**2133-10-31**] Bilateral atelectasis, left greater than right,
have improved. There is less mediastinal widening. There is
better aeration of the lungs. Sternal wires are aligned. There
is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac size is top
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-10-22**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. Plavix, aspirin,
heparin and a statin were started. A cardiac catheterization was
performed which revealed severe three vessel disease. Given the
severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was owrked-up
in the usual preoperative manner. Plavix was allowed to clear
from his system. On [**2133-10-28**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta
blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. He transferred to
the floor POD1, chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per
protocol. He remained in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically
stable. He autodiuresed, electrolytes repleted. He tolerated a
regular diet. He was seen by physical therapy and was discharged
to home on POD4.

Medications on Admission:
