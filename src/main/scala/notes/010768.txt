Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-9-10**] 7:56 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: s/p ? aspiration-r/o infiltrate
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man s/p urgent cabg x5 remains intubated.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ? aspiration-r/o infiltrate
INDICATION: Aspiration, recent CABG.
Comparison is made to films dating back to [**2106-8-12**], the
most recent being [**2106-9-7**].
PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 8:10 A.M.: The
tracheostomy tube and right subclavian catheter remain in
unchanged and adequate position. There has been interval
improvement in left hazy opacity indicating improved pulmonary
edema. The left pleural effusion is slightly smaller. The right
lower lobe consolidation persists and may represent aspiration
pneumonia. The persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents
atelectasis associated with the left pleural effusion, but may
also reflect a component of consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in pulmonary edema. Unchanged
right lower lobe pneumonia, likely aspiration. Left lower lobe
atelectasis versus additional focus of pneumonia.

Date/Time: [**2106-8-16**] at 12:28
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00
Test Location: West SICU/CTIC/VICU
Technical Quality: Adequate
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 25% to 30% (nl >=55%)
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
Patient was intubated and sedated on a propofol drip as per CSRU
orders.
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2106-8-13**].
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the  RA/RAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV function depressed.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. No atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch.  Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
(1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Mild to
moderate ([**1-5**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-5**]+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic  (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored  by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored  by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was
provided by benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). No  TEE related complications. The rhythm
appears to be atrial fibrillation. Emergency study performed by
notified of the echocardiographic results by e-mail.
Echocardiographic results were reviewed with the houseofficer
caring for the  patient. Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
left ventricular systolic function is severely and globally
depressed (LVEF=  25-30 %). Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. There are  simple and complex (>4mm)
nonmobile atheroma in the aortic arch and descending  thoracic
aorta. There is spontaneous echo contrast in the descending
aorta and arch consistent with a low cardiac output state. The
aortic valve leaflets (3)  are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Posterior mitral leaflet systolic prolapse with mild
to moderate  mitral regurgitation. Severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function. Depressed right ventricular
function. Mild aortic regurgitation.  Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2106-8-13**], findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74006**] NTG gtt was weaned and he subsequently had chest
pain. The NTG was restarted, he was started on a heparin drip.
He underwent preop testing including vein mapping and carotid
ultrasound. He was taken to the operating room on [**8-13**]. On
induction of anesthesia he arrested, he then underwent an
emergent CABG x 5. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition on epinephrine, milrinone,
