central line placement

History of Present Illness:
87F history of C. difficile colitis since [**2179-8-9**] currently in
rehabilitation facility receiving p.o. vancomycin and Flagyl who
presents with hypotension. Per patient, she had increased bowel
movements this past weekend (had actually been improving in
frequency last week) and was found to have systolics in the 80s
at the rehabilitation facility. Denies fevers. She states her
abdominal pain as being constant and has not changed and her
during the last few days. Patient has been compliant on her
vancomycin/Flagyl regimen. She states she hasn't been staying
hydrated.
.
Also of note, per daughter, at rehab she had an asthma
exacerbation last week and received 5 days of solumedrol taper,
which stopped 2-3 days ago. She states the physcians that
started the steroids verified with ID that this would not
exacerbate C diff.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.5 HR 96 BP 70/50 Pox 97% ra.
She has a chronic indwelling foley and had a UA that showed
large leuk, many WBC, many bacteria and was given ceftriaxone.
KUB was done, which did not show toxic megacolon or dilated
loops of bowel. Labs were significant for lactate 3.4, Na 127,
BUN 59, Cr 1.9 , WBC 12.6 with 13% bands, INR 6.5. Got 4L IVF in
ER-->systolics high 90's-100's, though of note BP's usually
130's 140's. Close to time of transfer, systolic BP's dropped to
80's. She was asymptomatic, but the ER wanted to place a CVL and
start pressor. Pt refused femoral CVL and remarked she wants to
be DNR/DNI. She also reports she has met with palliative care in
the previous weeks. She did agree to levophed being run through
her existing PICC line. On transfer, VS: HR 111, RR 19-20, Pox
98% RA, BP 92-102/30's-40's. Access is 18g EJ and a R PICC.
Unclear why she has a R PICC line.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt states "this is too much." She
reports abdominal pain and diarrhea. She is conversive and
confirms she is DNR/DNI.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo F with w/ h/o afib on coumadin, recent
extended course at rehab for severe C dificil who presented with
septic shock. Originally, this was thought to be secondary to
recurrence of severe C dificile, but she subsequently was found
to have polymicrobial bacteremia, likely secondary to gut
translocation/microperforation. Her bloodstream organisms (as
above) were quite resistant, and she was treated with meropenem
and daptomycin, as well as IV flagyl/PO vancomycin for C
difficile.
Upon initial presentation, she required aggressive volume
resuscitation and two pressors. While she was able to wean off
of pressors, she ultimately was >20L positive for the
hospitalization. On [**2179-11-3**] she was started on lasix gtt and
diuril [**Hospital1 **] for diuresis, but with only minimal accomplishment.
The next step to improve her volume status would likely have
been CVVH, which were not in line with the patient's goals of
care.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 91371**] that if she could not achieve a functional
status where she was home and independent, as she was prior to
hospitalization, she would not want to continue maximal medical
care. It was [**Last Name (Titles) 91371**] to her that this goal of independence
seemed fairly unlikely. She and her family requested palliative
care consult with plans to discuss her discharge and goal to not
be rehospitalized. During that meeting, decision was made to
move towards comfort measures only and all antibiotics and
supportive care were discontinued (she continued only on lasix
gtt for comfort). She passed away on [**2179-11-4**] with her family at
the bedside.

Medications on Admission:
amiodarone (per rehab notes, loaded over weekend, now continuing
