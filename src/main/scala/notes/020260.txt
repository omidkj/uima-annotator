Allergies:
Quinidine / Iodine / Indocin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo F with a past medical history of SSS s/p pacer,
hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, AV
Replacement, presents to the ED with weakness, found to be
febrile to 102, with a distended tender abdomen. She said that
the abdominal pain started today ([**2162-8-5**]), her stools have been
relatively normal, no brbpr/hematochezia. In the ED, she
underwent a CT abd/pelvis which showed evidence of
diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, and a small amount of free
fluid in the abdomen. Out of concern for a possible GI source,
the patient was to receive cipro/flagyl, but got cipro and
subsequently got hives. She was then given a dose of zosyn.
Surgery saw the patient in the ED and felt that her abdominal
exam, initially was concerning, but over time had improved and
given no obvious findings on CT, did not feel that there should
be any surgical intervention at this time.
.
She was to be admitted to the floor initially for further work
up, but her initial BP of 115/93 dropped to the 80's without
compensatory HR elevation. She then received 2L of NS, despite
concern that she was volume overloaded. A RIJ was attempted, but
was unsuccessful. BP's returned to the 110's but then just prior
to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], they were back in the high 80's systolic,
satting 99% 2L.
.
Notable labs were no leukocytosis but a small left shift, mild
anemia, thrombocytopenia, lactate of 1.5, creatinine of 1.6, TB
1.7 in the setting of normal LFT's. She is transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for stabilization of her hypotension and further work up of
her fevers.
.
Currently, at time of ICU admission her BP is 115/42, and she is
asymptomatic with a temp of 98.6. She c/o abdominal pain. She
also claims she had chest pain in the emergency department, but
it has been going away gradually over the last few hours. She
denies loose stool.

**Pertinent [**2162-8-5**] ICU admission imaging as below:

KUB: FINDINGS: Single view is somewhat limited by body habitus.
There is an overall generalized paucity of bowel gas with no
definite dilated loops of small bowel evident. There is no
ascites or organomegaly detected.  Degenerative changes are
noted throughout the lumbar spine, particularly at the
lumbosacral junction. Surgical clips are noted in the upper left
hemipelvis. Phleboliths are noted throughout the lower pelvis.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
.
CXR: Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2162-5-13**] show
mild interstitial edema slightly improved compared to prior
exam. Bibasilar atlectasis persists. The heart size remains
moderately enlarged, unchanged, with incidentally noted dense
mitral annulus calcification. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. Post surgical changes related to median
sternotomy are pressent. Dual leads of a left chest wall
pacemaker terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Very mild interstitial edema slightly improved
compared to prior exam.
.
CT Abd/pelvis (prelim): diverticulosis without itis. no
obstruction. small amount of free fluid in the abdomen, which
may relate to volume overload. Liver, small and nodular
suggestive of underlying cirrhosis. No free air or LAD. s/p cck.
Mild body wall anasarca.
.
EKG: V-paced @ 75, left axis. TWI in AVL. No changes from prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with history of CHF (diastolic dysfunction),
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD, AVR with stenosis, DM,
PPM, pulmonary fibrosis on 2.5L O2 at baseline presented [**8-5**]
with fevers, diarrhea, and hypotension. She was rehydrated with
IVF, and subsequently experienced pulmonary edema. In MICU,
diuresed and treated empirically for possible GI source for
fevers. On floor, was further diuresed and treated for possible
diverticulitis. Brief hospital course, by problem, is as
follows:
.
1. Hypotension, now resolved: On presentation, the ICU team felt
the patient's low blood pressure (systolic in 80s) were
secondary to early sepsis etiology, given fevers, but on further
labs and cultures there was no clear source and no leukocytosis.
She responded transiently to 2L fluids, but then seemed to have
worsened pulmonary edema on chest film. Despite this, she had a
drop in her BP again. Was resuscitated with IVF. It was thought
that given her underlying heart disease, she could not maintain
the forward flow for such a sudden increase in venous return.
Additionally, she did not have a compensatory increase in her HR
to aid in increasing her cardiac output. Given hypotension and
acute renal failure with low serum sodium on labs, etiology of
hypotension was thought to be due to volume depletion. Pulmonary
embolism was also considered, however, the patient was on
chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and AVR so this
was unlikely. Pericardial effusion was also explored but no
evidence of this on exam. While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was given gentle
IVFs, urine lytes assessed, monitored urine output with goal
>35cc/hr. Diuretics were initially held. Furosemide 80mg twice
daily per home reg
