Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsive, ? seizure vs stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated and extubated


History of Present Illness:
(on transfer to cardiology service)
Ms. [**Known lastname 110272**] is an 85-year-old female with a history of dementia,
hypertension who was found unresponsive on [**2192-3-15**] thought to be
due to seizure and has since been diagnosed with an acute
infarct in the right basal ganglia/insula and then devloped high
degree AV block after verapamil administration.

Please see admission note for full details. Briefly, she was
noted to be unresponsive with right leg movements on [**2192-3-15**] in
the evening. Initial blood pressure at at outside hospital was
200/120 mmHg, and she was intubated for airway protection. Head
CT showed no hemorrhage. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where MRI
brain showed an acute infarct in the right basal ganglia,
insula, and semiovale. She was started on aspirin 325mg daily
and atorvastatin 40mg daily. She was extubated over the weekend.


On [**3-19**], she was noted to have an episode of supraventricular
tachycardia at a rate of approximately 120 bpm (see below). She
was given 120mg PO verapamil. About 10 minutes later, she was
noted to have a junctional rhythm in the 50s. At 10:40 AM, about
30 minutes after this, she was noted to have three 7-second
pauses on telemetry; she was poorly responsive per the nursing
staff, and complained of chest pain. Her son notes that she
extended her arms as if she were sensing an electric shock. A
few minutes later, she had a noninvasive BP of 74/30 mmHg. She
then progressed toward a junctional rhythm in the 50s-60s. She
was given 2gm calcium gluconate to reverse the verapamil dosing.


On cardiac review of symptoms, she does not recall the details
of those events. She lives with her grandson, who does not
recall her having episodes of chest pain or tightness, dyspnea,
palpitations, or lightheadness or dizziness. All other ROS
negative.

Currently, patient feels well.  Denies sob, chest pain, abd
pain, light headedness.
