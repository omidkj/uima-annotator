Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elective coronary artery bypass grafting.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft time one, aortic valve
repair, mitral valve repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 69 year old Caucasian
male admitted with multiple episodes of congestive heart
failure with prior multiple admissions, all of which have
been medically managed.  The patient had first episode of
congestive heart failure approximately three years ago
requiring hospitalization.  The patient was subsequently
re-evaluated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a potential coronary
artery bypass graft procedure.

The patient had a formal cardiac catheterization at the [**Hospital6 14475**] on [**2165-10-2**].  The patient
noted recent increased chest pain and increased dyspnea and
lightheadedness.  An echocardiogram done at that time
demonstrated findings of severe aortic stenosis, and 80
millimeter aortic valve gradient and also moderate aortic
regurgitation.

The catheterization revealed significant two vessel coronary
artery disease, significant aortic and mitral valve disease.
There was 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.
There was a 70% stenosis of the non-dominant right coronary
artery.  There is evidence of one over two severe aortic
stenosis and moderate aortic regurgitation.  There was
evidence of moderate mitral valve regurgitation.  Ejection
fraction at that time was noted to be 58%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for congestive heart failure times two years,
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Mitral valve regurgitation.
4.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stent approximately five years ago.
5.  Status post myocardial infarction.
6.  Coronary artery disease.
7.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
8.  Status post appendectomy.
9.  Status post partial gastrectomy.
10. Status post repair of umbilical hernia in [**11-22**]. Status post repair of ventral hernia.
12. Status post T4 and T5 surgical disc decompression and
disc fusion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Diltiazem 120 mg once a day.
3.  Dilantin 100 mg four times a day.
4.  Ranitidine 150 mg twice a day.
5.  Furosemide 20 mg q. day.
6.  Zocor 20 mg q. day.
7.  Atenolol 25 mg q. day.
8.  Glucotrol 2.5 mg q. day.
9.  Klonopin 0.5 mg twice a day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a retired military and is
actually a construction worker.  The patient states that he
lives alone.  The patient has a remote tobacco use, quitting
approximately 20 years ago.  Prior to that point, he smoked
five packs per day.  The patient states he has occasional
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient was afebrile; pulse 70;
blood pressure 140/60; weight 214 pounds.  In general, he was
well appearing, slightly anxious but in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Mucous membranes were moist.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Neck examination was supple; no masses were
palpated.  Lung examination clear to auscultation
bilaterally; no wheezes or rhonchi noted.  Cardiac
examination is regular rate and rhythm with III-IV/VI
systolic ejection murmur noted at the left lower sternal
border.  Abdominal examination:  The patient is obese with
midline surgical scar, well healed.  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremity examination with no
edema.  Extremities were warm.  Pulses were two plus femoral
pulse bilaterally and one plus posterior tibial and two plus
radial pulse bilaterally.  There were no carotid bruits
noted.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  On [**2165-12-3**], the patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times one / aortic valve repair / mitral
valve repair.  The aortic valve was replaced using a 23
[**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor First Name **] tissue valve.  The mitral valve ring
angioplasty was done using a #28 [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty band
and the coronary artery bypass grafting was done with a
reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the left
anterior descending coronary artery.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications during the case.  The procedure was performed
by Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] and was assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14969**].

Postoperatively the patient was stable and was sent to the
CSRU on a dobutamine and propofol drip.  The patient was
extubated on the same day of surgery.  This was done without
any complications.  Postoperative day number one, the patient
was weaned off of his dobutamine completely.  The patient did
have an episode of bradycardia requiring pacing.  He had an
underlying junctional rhythm of approximately 44 to 48 beats
per minute and he was able to maintain his blood pressure
with this rate without the need for further pressors.

The patient was weaned off his oxygen to two litres nasal
cannula and was able to maintain his oxygen saturation to
greater than 95%.

On [**12-12**], postoperative day two, the patient was
transferred out of the CSRU to the Floor.  The patient was
doing quite well clinically, denying any chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or weakness.  The
patient continued to have bradycardia with a junctional
rhythm.

The patient was seen by Cardiology for a full evaluation of
his bradycardia.  The patient was determined to have a sinus
node dysfunction but remained asymptomatic with a stable
junctional escape rhythm.  The patient was also seen by
Electrophysiology Service and it was determined that there
was no need for an immediate pacemaker placement.  The
patient was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Event Monitor.

On postoperative day number three, the patient continued to
do well and was tolerating clear liquids and was pacing
flatus.  The patient's pain was well controlled with oral
medication and he had been out of bed and ambulating with
Physical Therapy.

On [**2165-12-13**], which is postoperative day number four,
the patient had his wires pulled and there were no
complications associated with this procedure.

Over the next couple of days, the patient continued with
improvement in his physical status progressing to walking
independently and being able to walk up and down stairs
without any difficulty.

The patient continued to remain in a junctional rhythm but
remained asymptomatic.

On postoperative day number six, the patient continued to do
well clinically.  He was tolerating his diet without any
difficulty.  Blood pressure maintained approximately at
120/60 although he was still in a junctional skip rhythm
approximately 40 to 60 beats per minute.  The patient
remained asymptomatic.  The pain was well tolerated on oral
pain medications.

There were no events recorded by the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts Monitors.

As a result, the patient was discharged to home to follow-up
with his primary care physician in one to two weeks and the
Cardiothoracic Team in approximately four weeks.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged to home to
follow-up with his primary care physician in one to two
weeks.

The patient was instructed to follow-up with De. [**Doctor Last Name **]
in four weeks.  The patient was also additionally instructed
to follow-up with his Cardiologist in six weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was advised that he was allowed to shower but
not allowed to take a bath or swim for one month.
2.  The patient was instructed not to apply lotions, cream,
ointments, or powders to his surgical incision.
3.  The patient was also advised not to lift anything heavier
than ten pounds for one month.
4.  The patient was instructed not to drive for one month.
5.  The patient was also asked to return in three weeks for
removal of his staples.
6.  The patient will be discharged with home nursing care for
medications, incision checks, vital sign monitoring.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post mitral valve repai
