CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Melena.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for superficial
antral ulcers in [**6-/2199**], hypertension and PEs recently
started on anticoagulation who presents with melanotic
stools.  Significantly, the patient had recently been
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**2200-4-18**] to [**2200-4-21**] with shortness of breath and was
found to have bilateral PE's on CTA.  Studies at that time
were negative.  The patient was started on Coumadin for
anticoagulation.  The patient was doing well until two days
prior to this admission when she noted that she was more
short of breath and fatigued. Then one day prior to
admission, the patient noted dark black tarry stools.  The
patient denied any new abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

In the emergency room, the patient's blood pressure was
112/58 with a heart rate of 84.  Her hematocrit was found to
be decreased from 37 to 25.7 over the course of four days.
INR was therapeutic at 2.5.  The patient was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells and received 1 mg of IV
vitamin K to reverse her anticoagulation. Gastrointestinal
was consulted and saw the patient.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was

platelets 266, INR 2.5. Chemistry: Sodium 139, potassium 4.2,

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient has been admitted
   with melenotic stools in the setting of anticoagulation
   for bilateral PE's.  She was then admitted to the Fenard
   Intensive Care Unit initially for close monitoring.
   Gastrointestinal was consulted.  They performed an
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2200-4-27**] which showed an
   acute crater 10 mm ulcer in the stomach body containing
   pigmented material suggestive of recent bleeding and a 10
   to 12 mm ulcer with a visible vessel in the stomach body
   with stigmata of recent bleeding.  These were treated with
   epinephrine injection and BICAP electrocautery.
   Successful hemostasis was obtained.  Over the course of
   the first day of admission, the patient had recent a total
   of 3 units of packed red blood cells.  Despite this
   transfusion, her hematocrit increased only from 25.7 to
   29.9 and then began to slowly turn down.  Therefore, on
   [**2200-4-28**], the patient was transfused another 2 units of
   packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in her
   hematocrit to 34.2.  On [**2200-4-28**],  the patient had her
   first stool since admission to the hospital which was
   guaiac positive.  On [**2200-4-29**], a repeat
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed by
   gastroenterology which revealed 3 crater nonbleeding ulcer
   ranging in size from 7 mm to 12 mm in the antrum.  All
   three ulcers were a clean base and not bleeding. No ulcer
   was found in the stomach body and it was thought at that
   time that the previous report may have noted a mistake in
   location.  No old or fresh blood was seen.  The patient's
   hematocrit remained fairly stable throughout the remainder
   of admission with her hematocrit on the time of discharge
   33.8.  Throughout the admission, the patient was continued
   on IV Protime pump inhibitor two times daily.  She was
   discharged to home on a protime pump inhibitor.  The
   patient will follow up with gastroenterology for repeat
   endoscopy in [**2200-7-6**].

1. Pulmonary embolisms on anticoagulation:  Prior to this
   admission, the patient had recently been admitted to the
   [**Hospital1 69**] and found to have
   bilateral pulmonary embolisms. She was started on
   anticoagulation with Coumadin at that time.  On admission,
   her anticoagulation was reversed in the setting of a
   gastrointestinal bleed.  On [**2200-4-26**], an inferior vena
   cava filter was successfully placed without complications.
   The patient will remain off all anticoagulation at this
   time.

1. Diastolic dysfunction:  The patient had no active
   congestive heart failure issues during the admission.  Her
   ACE inhibitor was held during the admission in the setting
   of a gastrointestinal bleed and initially unstable
   hematocrit.  It was restarted at the time of discharge.

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was not
   significantly elevated during admission and her
   antihypertensives were held in the setting of a
   gastrointestinal bleed. These were restarted at discharge
   when her hematocrit had stabilized.

1. Osteoarthritis:  The patient had pain controlled with
   Tylenol and p.r.n. Marcaine while in the hospital.  On
   discharge, she will use scheduled Tylenol and follow up in
   rheumatology clinic. Repeated discussions were held
   regarding the importance of avoiding all nonsteroidal anti-
   inflammatory drugs given her history of gastrointestinal
   bleeds.

1. Glucose intolerance: The patient has a history of glucose
   intolerance.  This has been followed by her primary care
   physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has not been started on any diabetic
   medications or insulin. She was covered with a regular
   insulin sliding scale in the hospital and was discharged
   to home only with a diabetic diet.

1. Prophylaxis:  IVC filter and Pneumoboots.

1. Code:  DNR/DNI.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric ulcers.
2. Osteoarthritis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Past pulmonary embolism.
5. Glucose intolerance.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
