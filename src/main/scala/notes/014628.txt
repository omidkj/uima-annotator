Admission Date:  [**2126-1-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-1-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-9-5**]       Sex:  M


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for hypertension,
disease who is status post a large anterior myocardial
infarction, status post cardiac catheterization, who is being
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for observation and
management.

The patient was in his usual state of health until he stopped
his aspirin for approximately one week in order to receive a
the sudden onset of substernal chest pain at 12:45.  It was
rated a [**9-19**], and it radiated to his left arm.  It was
associated with shortness of breath.  There was no nausea or
vomiting.  The patient immediately presented to the Emergency
Department at the [**State 1558**].  An
electrocardiogram done in the Emergency Room showed marked ST
elevations in the precordial leads, in I, and [**State **] with
corresponding ST depressions inferiorly.  He was given
aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, Lopressor intravenously,
and he was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.  He was started on
tenecteplase and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.

Immediate catheterization upon arrival to [**Hospital1 346**] revealed a 60% left anterior
descending artery lesion which received successful
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  No left
ventriculogram was performed.  There were no arrhythmias, and
hypotension was not seen.  Pressures on entering were
pulmonary artery pressures of 51/20, with a wedge pressure
of 22, cardiac output of 6.45, and a cardiac index of 3.15.

Post catheterization, he was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for further care.  Upon arrival at the Coronary Care
Unit, his blood pressure and heart rate were normal, and the
patient denied any chest pain.  He did acknowledge some
discomfort in his chest and graded it a [**1-20**].  There was no
radiation, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.  He also
noted some groin discomfort.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2109**] for which he
was not treated with Coumadin.
3.  The patient had a colonoscopy last week; the results of
which were pending at that point in time.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient takes atenolol 50 mg
p.o. q.d., he takes Procardia 90 mg p.o. q.d., and
aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married with children.  He denies any
tobacco use ever, and he drink two to three beers per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:   His brother had a myocardial infarction at
approximately the age of 65.  There is no other history of
heart disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On arrival to the
Coronary Care Unit, physical examination revealed vital signs
with temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 134/80, heart
rate 63, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 98% on 4
liters nasal cannula oxygen.  In general, he was lying flat,
resting comfortably, breathing easily.  He was obese, in no
acute distress.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
were dry without lesions.  Neck revealed he had jugular
venous pulse to approximately 11 cm.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm. Normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  No murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with
slightly decreased breath sounds at the bases.  Abdominal
examination revealed he was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Groin was in the
femoral clamp post catheterization and discontinuation of the
femoral sheath.  Extremities revealed his distal pulses were
2+ in all four extremities without any edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 12.2, hematocrit of 39.6, platelets of 334.  Blood
urea nitrogen 14, creatinine 0.8; the remainder of his
laboratory results were pending.  The differential on his
white blood cell count was 92 neutrophils, 1 band,
5 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A creatine kinase was 2584, MB 112, for
an index of 4.3.  The catheterization results showed
pressures with pulmonary artery of 51/20, wedge 23, cardiac
output 6.45, cardiac index of 3.15.  The left main had a mild
tapering left anterior descending artery with 60% proximal
lesion, 90% ulcerated lesion after the first diagonal split
off, moderate diffuse disease distally, a nondominant left
circumflex, and a right coronary artery with mild disease.
He was bolused with heparin, nitroglycerin, and diltiazem
during the procedure.

Electrocardiogram prior to procedure showed sinus rhythm
at 75, ST elevations in precordial leads I and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
depressions in III and aVF, poor R wave progression, and a
Q wave in V1 through V4.

Electrocardiogram post procedure showed normal sinus rhythm
at 60, improved ST elevations in V1 through V4, I, and [**First Name3 (LF) **].
No ST depressions in the inferior leads and the poor R wave
progression previously seen.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 69-year-old male with a history of
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and no known coronary
artery disease who presented with large anterior myocardial
infarction, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the left anterior descending artery and
stenting, who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
observation.

PLAN/CARDIOVASCULAR:  Serial electrocardiograms will be
obtained each day.  Creatine kinases will be followed until
they are trending down for two consecutive creatine kinases.
The patient will not be placed on a 2B3A inhibitor since he
received thrombolytics at an outside hospital prior to
catheterization.  Aspirin will be continued, Plavix 300 mg
was given, and then he will be continued on Plavix 75 mg p.o.
q.d. times 30 days.  The patient will be continued on a
heparin drip for 48 hours.  The patient will be started on a
statin, and an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker will be as
the heart rate and blood pressure tolerate it.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram will be obtained prior to
discharge.  If the patient has apical akinesis, the patient
will be anticoagulated for approximately three months with
Coumadin.  He will be maintained on heparin until he receives
his echocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On hospital day two, the patient was
started on low-dose Lopressor and captopril; these will be
slowly increased over the next few days.  His creatine
kinases peaked at 3824 with a MB fraction of 268 on the
evening of [**1-25**].  The patient was given one dose of
Lasix for diuresis.  Other than that, he was comfortable and
in good condition, and he was transferred to the floor.  He
was also started on Coumadin 5 mg in the evening for likely
apical akinesis and 3-month anticoagulation.

On hospital day three, the patient's heart rate went up
to 150.  An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed that
the patient was in atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
given Lopressor intravenously which controlled the
ventricular response, and the patient returned to [**Location 213**]
sinus rhythm a few hours after this event.  Also on hospital
day two, a large groin hematoma was noted.  An ultrasound was
obtained that showed no pseudoaneurysm.  Hematocrit was checked
which was unchanged from prior.

On hospital day four, a Physical Therapy consultation was
obtained, and the patient ambulated down the hallway and up
stairs without any significant problems, and he was deemed
safe for discharge.

An echocardiogram was also obtained that showed an ejection
fraction of approximately 30%.  It showed severely depressed
left ventricular function, hypokinesis of the anterior free
wall, anterior septum, and apical hypokinesis and akinesis.
There was also 1+ mitral regurgitation and borderline
pulmonary hypertension.

On hospital day five, the patient's INR was still 1.2.  His
Coumadin was increased to 7.5 mg the night before.  The
patient was continued on the heparin.  He w
