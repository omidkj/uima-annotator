Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-5-20**]
RIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Compared to the prior study, there
is new diffuse alveolar opacification predominantly in the right
lung. These findings are most concerning for infection.
Hemorrhage, edema or worsening of underlying interstitial lung
disease is unlikely given the asymmetry. Small right pleural
effusion is noted. No pneumothorax is present. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pulmonary
vasculature are not significantly changed.

IMPRESSION: Interval development of diffuse alveolar
consolidation in the
right hemithorax concerning for infection. Hemorrhage, edema or
worsening of underlying interstitial lung disease is less likely
given asymmetry.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-5-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening interstital and air space opacities. Could reflect
exacerbation
of known fibrotic NSIP or in the right clinical setting would
include an
infectious process.
2. Stable mediastinal adenopathy.
3. Stable low-attenuation renal lesions, however, are
incompletely
characterized given non-contrast setting.
4. The previously described suspicious right middle lobe
subpleural nodule is only partially imaged.
5. Smaller LLL subpleural cyst.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-5-25**]
IMPRESSION:
Overall improvement in diffuse widespread ground-glass opacities
suggestive of resolving bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage. Multiple
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive.
Right central venous catheter terminating in the right
brachiocephalic vein.

DIAGNOSIS:
Renal biopsy, needle: Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis
in the setting of P-ANCA positivity, see note.

Note:
Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex and
medulla, containing approximately 10 glomeruli, of which 2 are
globally sclerotic.  Of the remainder, 5 show segmental necrosis
and/or cellular/fibrocellular crescents.
There is mild-moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy.  Mild chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring.
Intact tubulointerstitium shows mild chronic inflammation.  Red
cell casts are noted.
Arteries show moderate intimal fibroplasia.
Arterioles show moderate mural thickening and hyaline change. No
active vasculitis is noted.
Immunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex,
containing approximately 5 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally
sclerotic.  There is no staining for IgG, IgA, C1q.  Mesangial
IgM (1+), C3 (trace), and Kappa and Lambda (both 0-trace) are
seen.  3 glomeruli show crescents on fibrin stain.
1+C3 is seen along tubular basement membranes and in vessels.
Albumin is non-contributory.
Electron microscopy:  Findings will be issued in an addendum.
Clinical: ? MGUS.  SCr was WNL in [**10-20**].0 on [**5-12**], and now
2.4.  Pulmonary process, intubated.  [**Doctor First Name **] negative, P-ANCA
positive.
Gross: Received are needle core(s) of light brown tissue.  The
specimen is viewed in the dissecting microscope, identified as
renal by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3535**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and divided into material for light
(formalin fixation) and electron microscopy and
immunofluorescence studies.
PAS and [**Doctor Last Name **] stains were done to evaluate basement membranes -
Masson's trichrome stains were done to evaluate interstitial
fibrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old woman with history of IPF and MGUS who presented
with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue.  She became in
a stable condition after aggressive treatment in ICU for acute
lung disease and ARF secondary to P-ANCA associated small vessel
vasculitis (Wegener's' granulomatosis versus microscopic
polyangiitis).  She has continued improvement on Cytoxan and
prednisone.

She was initially treated for presumed pneumococcal pneumonia
with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Images were consistent
with worsening bilateral airspace disease.  Multiple cultures
were taken with no growth to date. The initial clinical
suspicion at that point was multiple myeloma, evolving from her
known monoclonal gammopathy given evidence of renal failure and
profound anemia, complicated by pneumococcal pneumonia in the
setting of deficient humoral immunity. Shortly following
presentation, her oxygen saturation fell to 82 percent. She was
placed on a NRB and was transferred to the ICU for possible need
for mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory
failure. The ABX spectrum was broadened to Vancomycin and
Cefepime. Chest CT on [**2112-5-22**] showed patchy consolidations,
septal thickening, and multiple areas of traction
bronchiectasis. She eventually required intubation for presumed
