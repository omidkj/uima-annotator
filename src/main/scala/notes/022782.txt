CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old female who
was initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in an office visit
on [**2142-4-30**] for a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Patient was encouraged by her daughter to seek followup and
evaluation. The aneurysm was 1st noted 4 years ago at the
time of her coronary artery bypass by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
It was found to be in a 4 cm range. This is progressively
enlarged and it is now at 6.5 cm in maximal diameter. She
does admit to having intermittent episodes of chest pain and
had a nuclear medicine scan which showed a small area of
reversible ischemia and larger fixed defect with a mildly
reduced ejection fraction. Patient has had episodes of
congestive failure in the past.

Patient is known to have a chronic anemia related to GI
bleeds of uncertain origin. Hematocrit usually ranges between
25 and 32. Patient also is known to have hepatic cirrhosis of
undetermined etiology, and she has been followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] in the past. Her albumin is 3. Her PT is approximately
14. Her platelet count is 70-80 range. She has not undergone
a repeat coronary angiography because of her inability to
tolerate Plavix secondary to her GI bleeding. Patient does
admit to chronic low back pain and denies any other specific
symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for hypertension, type 2 diabetes x18 years and insulin
dependent, does admit to history of gallstones, asymptomatic,
history of spinal canal stenosis, history of angina, coronary
artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history includes CABG
and tonsillectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Cardizem - manifestations not documented. Plavix
- GI bleed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well appearing, elderly lady
in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 150/80, pulse 58.
HEENT exam was unremarkable. Chest was clear to auscultation.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm. Abdominal exam is soft.
There is no shifting dullness or fluid wave. Her aneurysm is
faintly palpable. Her abdomen is slightly protuberant and is
nontender. Pulse exam: She has palpable femorals bilaterally.
Popliteal pulses are nonpalpable. She has strongly palpable
right DP and a very diminished left DP.

Patient now was admitted for elective abdominal aortic
repair.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the preoperative
holding area on [**2142-7-6**]. She underwent an endovascular
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with repair of the left
external iliac avulsion with a bypass from the left iliac
stent graft to the common femoral artery. She had bilateral
femoral endarterectomies and a patch angioplasty to the right
common femoral. Patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition.

Patient was transferred to the SICU for continued care.
Patient returned on [**2142-7-8**] to the OR for a right groin
washout. She remained in the SICU for vasopressor support and
ventilation. Patient was transferred to regular nursing floor
on [**7-12**].

On [**7-23**], patient had an episode of shortness of breath.
This was very consistent with congestive heart failure.
Patient was diuresed with improvement in her symptoms.
Patient was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] during her hospitalization for
glycemic management. Patient returned to the OR on [**2142-7-25**] for a right groin wound washout and primary closure.
PICC line was placed on [**2142-7-26**] for long-term
antibiotics.

Patient's wound culture grew E. coli and Staph-coag negative
MRSA. Patient was continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The patient's wound showed continued improvement. Patient
will be discharged to home with IV antibiotics for a total of
6 weeks. Antibiotics were started on [**7-9**], will continue
through [**8-20**]. Patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as directed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular repair,
   iliac avulsion left status post bypass graft from iliac
   stent to common left femoral artery, status post bilateral
   femoral endarterectomies with a right femoral artery
   angioplasty.
2. Blood loss anemia corrected.
3. Type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent controlled.
4. Coronary artery disease with congestive failure
   postoperatively compensated.
5. Right groin seroma with infection treated.
6. Hypertension controlled.

6h. p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg daily, Sarna lotion to effected
