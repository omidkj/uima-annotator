CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx s/p ct's removed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx s/p ct's removed
AP CHEST 2:15 P.M. ON [**11-26**]

HISTORY: Chest tubes removed. Rule out pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-23**] and 9:

Endotracheal and pleural tubes. Swan-Ganz catheter and
nasogastric tubes have been removed. Lung volumes are lower but
left lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Chest tube artifact
noted in the left lower lung. Small right pleural effusion
persists. Relative interval widening of the mediastinum,
probably a function of lower lung volumes, but volume overloaded
is likely.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Indeterminate RV wall thickness. Moderately
dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. No MS. Eccentric MR
jet. MR vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.

Conclusions
Pre bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
inferior basal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet which is severe and wraps up
to the top of the left atrium. There is pulmonary systolic vein
flow reversal. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is
>=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is a paced, on phenylepherine, milranone,
and epi infusions. Biventricular function appears normal with a
hyperdynamic aspect post cpb on ionotropes. There is a mitral
annular prosthesis in situ s/p mitral valve repair. The ring
appears well seated without regurgitation or perivalvular leak.
Peak gradients range from [**7-24**], mean gradients range from 6-8 mm
Hg with a cardiac out put of [**6-23**] Lpm. Aortic contours remain
intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 131**] was transferred from [**Hospital6 2910**] and
CABG was planned for the next morning. He was taken to the
operating room on [**11-24**] where he underwent a CABG x 4 and MV
Repair. He was extubated the morning of post op day 1. His
milrinone was weaned to off by POD #1. He was transfused 1 unit
for HCT 24. He was transferred to the floor on POD #2. He did
well postoperatively and was ready for discharge home on POD #5.
