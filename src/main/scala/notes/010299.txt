History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old female who is transferred to the
MICU following intubation yesterday for decreased oxygen
saturations on Post op day 3 for VATS and wedge resection.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year, she noticed the sudden onset of right
sided pleuritic chest pain, a nonproductive cough and shortness
of breath, and presented to the ED where a CXR was obtained that
was consistent with PNA. She then completed a course of
levofloxacin but about a month later, she continued to have
shortness of breath and cough. For this reason, a CT was
obtained that showed subsegmental pulmonary emboli and other
nodules. The same CT scan of the chest revealed that in the
upper right abdomen, there was a large right lower pole renal
mass with renal vein invasion.  That prompted another CT of the
abdomen which demonstrated this mass.  There was also some
paraaortic lymphadenopathy. She was then evaluated at [**Hospital 65383**]
clinic on [**12-13**], where she was seen to be very dyspneic and was
admitted.
.
Regarding the CT scan, the location of most of these pulmonary
nodular infiltrates was peripheral and less accessible to
bronchoscopy. In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient
agreed to video assisted lung biopsy. The patient underwent VATS
on [**12-16**] and was successfully extubated following the procedure.
Frozen section unfortunately disclosed what appeared to be an
infiltrative poorly differentiated carcinoma with evidence of
lymphangitic tumor involvement and the tumor emboli in the
vessels.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then sent out to the floor where she developed
progressive hypoxemia despite nebulizers, diuresis and
nonrebreather. She was transferred to CSRU on POD 3 and
intubated for O2 sat 82% on NRB. Chest CT that day revealed
worsening lung opactities. She was also diuresed and started on
cefepime and flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA. She is now
transferred to MICU for vent management.

.
ROS: The patient denies any previous history of hematuria or
urinary tract infection.  She reports some weight loss, which is
5 pounds in the last week and about 20 pounds over the last 6
months.


Past Medical History:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Motor vehicle accident with ankle surgery bilaterally.
4.  D&C in [**2115**].
5.  Negative Pap and mammograms.
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Surgeries after MVA [**2142**]. Dilation and
curretage in [**2115**].


Social History:
She quit smoking about 30 years ago and smoked for 5 years,
about a pack a day.  Alcohol socially. Born and raised in [**Location (un) 21541**] and lives with her husband of 45 years.  She is a retired
worker in a candle factory and her husband worked in
construction.


Family History:
Negative for malignancies.  She is married; 3 children, ages 40,
41, and 45.

.
EKG: NSR with PVC, NL axis, RBBB, Twave inversion V1, III, no ST
segment changes.
.
CTA [**12-19**]:
1.  Subsegmental pulmonary emboli are not significantly changed
from [**12-13**]. Marked progression of consolidative and
interstitial changes of the right lung.  These findings may be
infectious in nature, and edema and neoplastic change are also
within the differential diagnosis. Post-surgical changes in the
lingula, with a small left anterior pneumothorax.  There is also
a small amount of air in the left major fissure. Coronary artery
calcifications.
.
CXR [**12-20**]: Interstitial edema has improved, more markedly in the
left lung than the right partially obscuring multifocal nodules
and mass like areas of consolidation. Small right pleural
effusion persists.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small cavity in
the right mid lung is presumed at the site of wedge resection.
Heart size is normal and mediastinum is midline.  ET tube,
nasogastric tube, and left subclavian line are in standard
placements respectively.
.
Echo [**12-19**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
>60%. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.]  There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened with probably no
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which likely represents
a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion
cannot
be excluded.

Bone scan [**12-15**] 1. No evidence of osseous metastatic lesions.
2. Focus of increased tracer uptake within the neck, likely
representing degenerative change.  3. Increased tracer activity
noted within the left hip and both ankles, consistent with the
patient's history of prior trauma and surgery within these
regions.

[**12-14**] LENI: No right or left lower extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with new finding of renal mass and lung
nodules, who was admitted for shortness of breath, found to have
pulmonary emboli, and who required intubation post VATS for
hypoxemic respiratory failure. On transfer to the MICU service
we treated her with aggressive fluid hydration for decreased
urine output, keeping her CVP in the 20's, given her preload
dependance due to right heart failure. She developed a metabolic
acidosis which corrected with hydration. We eventually started
her on a dobutamine drip to increase cardiac output and urine
output. She responded well to this intervention.  We kept her
anticoagulated with coumdain given her PE.
.
# Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**12-19**] for pO2 of 50. Hypoxia
thought to be secondary to PE and lymphangitic carcinoma and
possibly infection. PFTs consistent with restrictive lung
disease and decreased diffusion capacity, likely secondary to
PEs and carcinoma. Now on AC at FiO2 50% and PEEP 8 with some
continued hypoxemia.
- continue current vent settings as her hypoxemia will not be
resolved as the canc
