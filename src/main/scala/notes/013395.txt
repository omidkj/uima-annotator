Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Shellfish / amlodipine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16851**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic painful right heel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. A ultrasound guided [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] access of the left common
    femoral artery.
2. Angiography of the right lower extremity.
3. Catheter placement into the distal superficial femoral
    artery, the contralateral superficial femoral artery,
    and proximal popliteal artery.
4. Contralateral percutaneous angioplasty and stent
    placement in the right distal superficial femoral
    artery.
5. Right heel debridement.
6. Placement of tunneled right internal jugular hemodialysis
catheter.
7. Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
60F with PVD with femoral stents placed [**9-18**], CAD s/p CABG [**6-16**],
dCHF, T2DM, HTN, HCH, Hep C, asthma, nephrotic range proteinuria
and recent foot debridement was directly admitted from [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
clinic with concern for ischemic RLE. Received right superficial
femoral stent placement and on the way to PACU became
unresponsive with HR 40s , pulseless, and apneic. Neither a O2
saturation nor a blood pressure tracing from the A-line was
unable to be registered. Immediate ACLS was initiated with CPR,
and epinephrine x2 and atropine x1 were given with ROSC after
5-10 minutes. She was reintubated, started on levophed, and
transferred to the ICU. Patient was unresponsive, raising
concern for anoxic encephalopathy. Head CT was negative for
intracranial bleeding, and she was initiated on therapeutic
hypothermia, sedated with versed/fentayl, paralyzed with
cisatracurium, and maintained CMV ventilation. TTE on [**8-27**]
showed a LVEF 50-55%, PCWP >18, less vigorous global ventricular
function, and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Overnight, she
was hemodynamically labile with episodes of hypotension (61/35
at 9PM) and hypertension as well as bradycardia (low 50s).
Vital signs normalized and she was extubated with altered mental
status, volume overload, and urine output of dark brown color.
She was transferred to medicine.

STUDIES:
ECG ([**2188-8-27**], post-code): Sinus rhythm with left axis deviation.

Incomplete right bundle-branch block and diffuse non-specific ST

segment flattening throughout.

Head CT ([**2188-8-27**]): No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or acute
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
territorial infarction.

EEG ([**2188-8-27**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring
study because of continuous slowing of the background activity
with 5-7 Hz theta and occasional [**2-12**] Hz delta activity. There
are occasional brief periods of suppression in EEG activity
lasting 1-2 seconds. These are indicative of moderate to severe
encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology. In this patient, hypoxic
ischemic brain injury, hypothermia and use of sedative
medications are all potential causes of diffuse slowing.

ECHO ([**2188-8-27**]): TTE, Indication: Cardiac Arrest. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**]
dilated, elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) secondary to mild
global hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension, estimated 53mmHg. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study dated [**2188-1-21**] (images reviewed), global left
ventricular systolic function appears less vigorous. The degree

of aortic regurgitation has progressed to mild-moderate. Other
findings are similar.

ABI ([**2188-9-15**]): On the right side, monophasic Doppler waveforms
were seen at the right femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and
dorsalis pedis arteries. On the left side, monophasic Doppler
waveforms were seen
