the junction of the SVC and innominate vein.  Patchy
opacifications are seen in the right upper and lower lobes and
perihilar edema is seen suggesting the presence of failure and
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 71 yo F with MMP h/o PVD s/p right AKA [**2123-9-24**],
DM, CHF, CAD s/p stents, chronic atrial fibrillation, and
multiple other medical problems, presents with hypotension and
tachycardia.
.
1. Hypotension and Tachycardia - patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from rehab on [**2123-10-8**] with symptoms of hypotension,
elevated WBC and tachycardia. Patient had recently undergone a
right AKA on [**2123-10-4**].  Pt was febrile at rehab with question of
bloody stool as well as dirty U/A. The patient was started on
levaquin and Flagyl at [**Hospital 100**] REhab and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Based upon impression of chest film on admission, PNA did not
seem as likely originally, C. Diff was sent as patient had
previosuly been on antibiotics in hospital. [**Hospital Unit Name **] surgery was
[**Hospital Unit Name 4221**] to see the patients Rigth AKA who agreed it did not
look like a source of infection. As the patient [**Last Name (un) 19692**] hypotensive
on admission in the ED a femoral line was placed and the patient
was started on a dopamine drip. On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the
patient met SIRS criteria with increased HR to the 150's while
on dopamine. Dopamine was titrated off and Levophed was started
as a pressor instead. Hypotension was thought likely to be
secondary to SIRS vs. Afib with RVR. On [**2123-10-10**], the patient
was weaned off levophed and remained hmeodynamically stable. The
patient was transferred to the floor without pressors or fluid
support, tolerating a PO diet. Patient had a left subclavian
line placed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] that was found to be erythematous. A
PICC line was placed for continued antibiotics and the Left
centeral line was discontinued.
.
2. ID: initially thought to have a UTI and was treated with
levo, vanc because of recent hospitalization and flagyl while
awaiting c. diff studies given history that she has had c.diff
colitis in the past.  Upon
