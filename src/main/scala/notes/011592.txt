Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest, acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dialysis

History of Present Illness:
78 yoF presents from OSH with acute renal failure (Cr 9) and
hyperkalemia (K 8.3) s/p cardiac arrest. According to her
family, patient was in her usual state of health until yesterday
evening when she reported nausea, vomiting, and back pain.
Family had been at Foxwoods the weekend prior but otherwise no
travel. No sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] exotic food but did eat at
Fudruckers. Patient had episodes of diarrhea on Friday which
resolve.
.
Patient reported to family that she vomited once the night prior
to presentation and felt somewhat improved. The following day
the patient reported to family that she continued to have
abdomen and back pain and ached all over. At ~ 6 pm on the
evening prior to transfer, she was found to be lethargic,
confused, and complaining of abdomen and back pain. EMS was
called.
.
Upon arrival, patient was found to be hypotensive. She was
transferred to an OSH where she developed a wide complex
bradycardia and then became pulseless. ? of whether patient was
briefly transcutaneously paced. Patient was intubated and
treated with epi/atropine and CPR and then evolved into VT. She
was then given amio. Dopamine was started for hypotension. At
the OSH, labs were notable for pH 6.65, lactate of 17.3, WBC
21.1 w/ 3% bands, 73% PMNs, Hct 37, plts 413, Cr 9.5, K 8.2,
bicarb 5. According to family, patient had been seen by her PCP
last week at which time her K was 5.5 and her Cr was normal (?
1.0).
.
She received 2 amps D50, 15 units insulin, 1 amp CaGluc, [**6-5**]
amps bicarb, and kayexalate. Also received 1 gram of Rocephin
for elevated WBC. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via
[**Location (un) 7622**] for emergent dialysis. During [**Location (un) 7622**], patient
fluctuated between a narrow complex rhythm (? accelerated
junctional rhythm) and a wide complex tachycardia and was
intermittently hypotensive requiring dopamine.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was hypotensive with SBP in
80s which quickly dropped to 50s. She was started on levophed
and dopamine with response in BPs to 120s. At that time she was
in a narrow complex rhythm. Due to reports of abdominal pain,
she was sent for a stat CT torso as well as a CT head and was
then transferred to the MICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 yoF with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, s/p cardiac
arrest
.
# acute renal failure: unclear etiology. Ddx prerenal,
intrarenal, postrenal. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT
abdomen. Suspect hypotension/ATN given remainder of
presentation. Hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias indication
for emergent dialysis.
- HD line placed for emergent CVVH
- appreciate renal input
- hyperkalemia treated with CaGluc, 1 amp bicarb push with 3
amps in D5W, insulin gtt, kayexalate
- U/A, culture, microscopic exam
- urine lytes, eos
- No need for renal u/s given nl CT
.
# metabolic acidosis: severe acidosis with pH 6.7. Combined AG
acidosis and metabolic alkylosis. AG 48. delta bicarb 19. AG
acidosis likely lactic acidosis. Metabolic alkylosis likely
secondary to bicarb administration at OSH. ? contribution of
Metformin to lactic acidosis.
- 1 amp bicarb now
- D5W with 3 amps bicarb wide open
- hyperventilation
- CVVH against high bicarb bath
.
# hypotension: unclear cause. Likely sepsis given significant
leukocytosis although no clear source. Could explain renal
failure. Potential source most likely GI given symptoms. Must
also consider ischemic contribution given elevated cardiac
enzymes although less likely. Received dose of Rocephin.
- blood cultures
- U/A, culture
- stool cultures
- broad coverage with vanco, cefepime, flagyl
- cont volume resuscitation with D5W+3amps bicarb until CVVH
then switch to NS
- cont pressors: levophed/vasopressin. consider further pressors
for increased BP support.
.
# s/p cardiac arrest: suspect PEA secondary to hyperkalemia vs.
acidemia. Only briefly pulseless by report although current exam
concerning for CNS damage.
- hyperkalemia/acidemia treatment as above
- cont tele monitoring
.
# mental status: concerning neurologic findings on exam
including fixed dilated pupils and involuntary motor activity:
posturing vs. myoclonic seizures.
- maintained BP with fluids and pressors
- maintained hypothermia for neurologic protection
- likely Neuro consult
- consider MRI, EEG
- No need for seizure tx currently
.
# leukocytosis: as above, unclear source. Infectious vs. stress
response. Hypothermic currently. Suspect infectious given
hypotensive presentation.
- pan culture as above
- cont broad spectrum antibiotics
- trend WBC
.
# cardiac enzyme elevation: elevated troponin difficult to
interpret in setting of ARF but CKs also elevated with positive
MBI. However, not necessary unexpected s/p cardiac arrest, chest
compressions, and reported transcutaneous pacing.
- trend cardiac enzymes
- no anticoagulation, If enzymes trended up, would consider
heparin
- hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor
- hold statin until LFTs return with concern for shock liver
- hold aspirin given coagulopathy
.
# DM: on metformin at home.
- hold metformin
- insulin gtt for now. Can transition to sliding scale prn
.
# htn: hypotensive currently requiring pressors
- hold lisinopril
.
# asthma: albuterol/atrovent MDIs while ventilated
.
# FEN: NPO.
