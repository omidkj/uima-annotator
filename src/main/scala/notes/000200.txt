Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old woman who
was referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization due to
recent complaints of chest discomfort and shortness of
breath.

The patient reports that she has been under increased stress
since late [**Month (only) 216**] and has noticed intermittent symptoms of
chest pressure and shortness of breath.  These symptoms are
now recurring on a daily basis, and these symptoms resolve
with rest.

On [**2166-10-21**] she was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] for
increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure.  She ruled
out for a myocardial infarction.  She underwent further
cardiac testing that suggested that she had coronary artery
disease, and she was referred to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Blood urea
nitrogen was 21, creatinine was 0.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
pulse was 50 and blood pressure was 117/45.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination was unremarkable.  The
neck was without bruits.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs.  The lungs were clear.  Extremities
revealed normal peripheral pulses.  No vascular disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2166-11-27**] which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with mild diffuse
hypokinesis, a 60% to 70% distal left main occlusion, a 70%
proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, a 70%
left circumflex occlusion, a 90% first obtuse marginal
occlusion, 70% ostial right coronary artery occlusion.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2166-11-28**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times four; left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
left radial to posterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, with a sequential graft to the
first diagonal.  Please see the Operative Note for further
details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on the first postoperative night.  The
patient required some volume resuscitation as well as a
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.

On postoperative day one, the patient's hematocrit was noted
to be 21.8.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells.  The patient was on an insulin infusion to
maintain adequate blood glucose control.  The patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit due to labile blood
pressures.  The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet,
and the patient was placed on her nocturnal CPAP settings
which she tolerated well.

On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred from
the Intensive Care Unit to the floor in stable condition.
The patient required some aggressive diuresis and aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  The patient began ambulating with Physical
Therapy, and it was determined that the patient would need
[**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation.  The patient was intermittently
complaining of shortness of breath which she stated was at
her baseline.  This shortness of breath was improved with
diuresis and the use of nocturnal CPAP which she was on at
home.  The patient's chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were discontinued without complications.

A chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions as
well as bilateral atelectasis.  The patient was cleared for
discharge on [**2166-12-5**] to a rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum was 97.2, pulse
was 69 (in sinus rhythm), blood pressure was 145/68, oxygen
saturation was 94% on room air, respiratory rate was 25.
Neurologically, grossly intact.  Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm.  Positive rub.  No murmur.  Lungs revealed breath
sounds were clear anteriorly; posteriorly with minimal
crackles at the bases.  The abdomen was obese.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Nontender and nondistended.  The extremities
were warm with 1+ edema.  The sternal incision was clean and
dry without erythema.  Left radial artery harvest site was
clean and dry with Steri-Strips intact.  There was no
erythema or drainage.  The vein harvest site in the right
thigh was clean and dry and without erythema or drainage.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  On [**2166-12-5**]
hematocrit was 31.8.  Potassium was 4.3, blood urea nitrogen
was 19, and creatinine was 0.7.
