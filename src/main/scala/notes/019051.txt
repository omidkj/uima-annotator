Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheobronchomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy.
2. Flexible bronchoscopy.
3. Tumor destruction with micro debrider.
4. Y stent placement.
5. Change of tracheostomy tube to a Portex #7.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57 year-old man with severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia noticed during a prior ICU admission.  The
patient was having difficulty in liberation from mechanical
ventilation.  He ultimately was requiring intermittent positive
pressure ventilation.  He was sent to rehab and presents today
for placement of a Y-stent.  Intraoperatively, granulation
tissue
surrounding his tracheal stoma was debrided and a 16-13-13
Y-stent was placed (tracheal limb 10cm, Right mainstem limb
1.8cm, and left mainstem limb 3cm).  A tracheostomy (Portex #7)
was then placed under bronchoscopic visualization into the
stent.
The patient is being admitted to ICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 57 year-old man with severe diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia noticed during a prior ICU admission.  The
patient was having difficulty in liberation from mechanical
ventilation.  He ultimately was requiring intermittent positive
pressure ventilation. He was sent to rehab and presented for
rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, tumor destruction
with micro debrider, Y stent placement, change of tracheostomy
tube to a Portex #7. Post-operatively patient did well. His
post-op course was notably complicated by acute renal failure
with creatinine trending up to 2.5 and significant pulmonary
edema.

CVS: Patient was hemodynamically stable, responding to BP
regimen with SBPS 120s throughout his admission. He had a
troponin leak initially, thought be due to some myocardial
ischemia during transient intraoperative hypotension which
resolved. He also developed significant pulmonary edema which
likewise resolved with autodiuresis and positive pressure
ventilation.

PULM: Multiple attempts to wean patients were made. Patient
tolerated TM but subsequently dropped his O2 Sats to 80's on HD5
and was subsequently placed on CPAP (PSV at 6/6).

GI: Tube feeds initiated without events.

RENAL: BUN/Cr began rising to 1.9 on POD1. Urine lytes were
consistent with a pre-renal acute failure. Renal was consulted
and noted muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular
necrosis. On POD3 urine eosinophil's came back positive which
introduced the possibility of AIN. On POD 4-5 patients Cr began
trending down and urinary outputs continues to improve. Renal
u/s done was normal with no evidence of hydronephrosis.

HEME: Hct gradually trended down post-operatively possibly due
to dilution. Prior to discharge Hct was stable at 21->22->21,.
Per discussion with the ICU team the transfusion criteria was
set to < 21

ID: Sputum cultures grew with rare Gram + SA, 1+ Gram negative
diplococci, patient was started on antibiotics and maintained
stable vital signs prior to admission.
