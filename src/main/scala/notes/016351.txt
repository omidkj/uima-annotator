Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with multifactorial chronic hypoxemia and dyspnea
thought due to diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension thought
secondary to a chronic ASD and COPD on 5L home oxygen admitted
with complaints of worsening shortness of breath.
.
The patient is a poor historian and therefore history was
obtained in part from medical record and in part from interview
with Russian interpreter and the patient.
.
The patient has chronic severe dyspnea requiring numerous
inpatient hospitalizations. She reports that her breathing was
bad at baseline but appeared acutely worse over the past 2 days.
She denies any associated symptoms including no chest pain,
diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, fevers, worsened lower extremity
edema or weight gain. The patient does note that her lower
extremities were more erythematous and uncomfortable than
normal. By patient report this episode is entirely the same as
her prior episodes of acute on chronic dyspnea exacerbation.
Reports compliance with all of her medications.
.
The patient initially presented to the [**Hospital1 2177**] ED with complaints of
SOB. Vitals on presentation there are unavailable as are all
records of assessment and treatment. Written report by nurses
upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] describe CXR at [**Hospital1 2177**] consistent with
volume overload and treatment with furosemide 40mg IV,
nitropaste 1inch and aspirin. She refused foley placement. Labs
and EKG were largely unremarkable and she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 73 132/72 22 95% 4L. The patient
refused/did not tolerate BiPAP therapy. She received an
additional dose of furosemide 40mg IV.
.
Of note, the patient is frequently admitted with respiratory
distress and hypoxemia likely in part due to poor medication
compliance. Most recently, she was admitted from [**2140-5-9**] -
[**2140-5-18**] when she was successfully diuresed though did require
overnight transfer to the ICU for hypoxia. During that
hospitalization, cardiology consult recommended a right heart
cath for evaluation of response to sildenafil but the patient
refused. Pulmonary consult recommended an empiric, compassionate
sildenafil trial due to severe dyspneic symptomology preventing
outpatient living. This trial was to occur as an outpatient
under her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the patient did tolerate an inpatient
trial without hypotension. During that hospitalization, the
patient's home amiodarone was discontinued out of low likelihood
for amiodarone toxicity.

Past Medical History:
- Atrial septal defect repair [**6-17**] complicated by sinus arrest
with PPM placement.
- Diastolic CHF, estimated dry weight of 94kg
- AF s/p cardioversion x 2. Previously on amiodarone
discontinued due to paced rhythm during hospitalization in
[**2140-4-23**]. Not anticoagulated due to history of hemorrhagic
CVA.
- HTN
- GERD
- TAH/BSO ('[**33**]) for fibroids
- Prior hemorrhagic CVA
- Pulm HTN (RSVP 75 in [**11-24**]) thought secondary to longstanding
ASD
- CRI (baseline Cr 2-2.5)
- COPD on home O2 (5L NC) with baseline saturation high 80's to
low 90's on this therapy.
- OSA, not CPAP compliant
- Mild mitral regurgitation
- Microcytic anemia
- Hypothyroidism
- S/p APPY, s/p CCY ('[**33**])
- Gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP, sphincterotomy
- Elevated alk phos secondary to amiodarone

Social History:
Lives alone in senior living housing, has daughter-in-law who
brings her groceries, has VNA once a week. No tob, EtOH, IVDU.


Family History:

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs: Temp 95.5, HR 61, BP 119/56, RR 22 93% 4L
.
Gen: NAD, Obese.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79 yo Female with multifactorial chronic
hypoxemia thought due to chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary
hypertension likely secondary to ASD and reported COPD on 5L
home oxygen now admitted with shortness of breath that improved
after aggressive diuresis.  Pt initially admitted to ICU,
diuresed as described in d/c summary [**Hospital 15787**] transfered to floor
for further care of hypoxia and dyspnea as noted below.  She was
arranged for home VNA for daily services (with russian-speaking
nurses as prior) on [**2140-7-22**], [**Hospital **] medical status improving,
however given patients repeated admissions [**Last Name **] problem is
chronic management of diastolic CHF and patient was kept an
additional day to try and optimize supports for discharge.
Attempts were made to arrange family meetings with daughter in
law and social work to again discuss goals and rational of
chronic management of diastolic heart failure in an attempt to
avoid repeated hospitalizations.  However, over the weekend
after attempts for the prior day (x3 and repeated attempts x2 on
the day of discharge) there was no return communication from
listed contacts after messages were left to discuss discharge
planning. Discharge instructions were discussed with Russian
interpreter who knows ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] well and ms. [**Known lastname **]
wished to be discharged to continue care at home with russian
speaking VNA. discharge instructions and follow-up were
discussed with aid of interpreter and ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] expressed
understanding. Follow-up instructions were given and detailed
instructions were given for home VNA. Ms. [**Known lastname 15676**] had no
further questions regarding her discharge planning and had no
additional requests or contacts for me to contact in attempts to
corroborate discharge plans in an effort to reenforce importance
of medical compliance.  Follow-up with her pcp is scheduled in
the near future and may be the best venue to discuss rational of
chronic management of heart failure and medical compliance.

#. Hypoxemia and Dyspnea: Given evidence of pulmonary edema on
imaging and hypervolemia, likley secondary to acute on chronic
diastolic CHF in setting of poor pulmonary substrate secondary
to severe pulmonary hypertension and possible COPD. The patient
reported symptomatic improvement with diuresis and had O2 sats >
90% on 5L which is home O2 requirement. Patient had overall
significant improvement in symptoms, was able to ambulate up and
down [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**Hospital1 **], maintaining an average o2 sat 90% (on 5-6L 02
(her home baseline).
IV lasix was changed to po and new regimen of 80mg every am and
40mg every pm was started with instructions for daily weights
and additional am lasix as needed for weight gain and to contact
PCP.

Starting digoxin 0.125 mg was considered, however, was defered
to her outpatient pcp/cardiologist, given her chronic kidney
disease and need for close monitoring and at this time, there is
concern that the short-term potential harm of inconsistent or no
monitoring or follow-up of
