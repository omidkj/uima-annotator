History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] is a 56 year old gentleman who was involved in a
single car motor vehicle collision with a tree on the day of
admission. He was a restrained driver. There was significant
vehicle damage noted, with the patient's head having gone
through the windshield. Per EMS report, Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] was alert
and talking at the scene. He initially complained of lack of
sensation below his nipples and was not observed to have any
spontaneous movement of his extremities. He was intubated en
route from an outside hospital after he began to complain of
difficulty breathing. He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and sedated,
as well as hemodynamically stable. Upon arrival, a CT scan
revealed fractures of C1, C2, C3, and C4 with significant cord
compromise. He was admitted to the TSICU where he was
subsequently seen by trauma orthopedics, trauma spine and
neurosurgery.

Pertinent Results:
TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS POR   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70285**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Widened mediastinum, this may be due to the patient's
rotated position, however, further evaluation with a chest CT is
recommended.
2.  Endotracheal tube tip at thoracic inlet, advancement of tube
is
recommended.
3.  No acute fractures or dislocations are identified.
-------

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70286**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture traversing through the large anterior osteophytes
at the C2-C3 level and extending into the body of C2 with severe
lordotic angulation and high grade narrowing of spinal canal.
The integrity of the cord and
ligaments can be further evaluation by MRI.
2.  Fractures of the left anterior and posterior arch of C1.
-------

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70287**]
CONCLUSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities. Please also
seen cervical
spine CT report for details of cervical spine findings.
-------

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70288**]
IMPRESSION:
1) No CT findings suggestive of acute traumatic injury
throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
2) Bibasilar consolidation most likely consistent with
aspiration.
3) Fatty infiltration of the liver.
-------

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST
Clip #
IMPRESSION:
1.  Significant cord compression at C3-4 level with cord edema
versus
contusion. This is most likely due to disc protrusion at this
level.
2.  Fractures involving C1, 2, and 3, as noted on the prior CT
and better
evaluated on the prior CT.
3.  Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligamentous injury along
with
prevertebral hematoma in the upper cervical spine.
------

MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No obvious injury to the thoracic spine.
2.  Right lung consolidation.
------












Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] was admitted to the TSICU upon transfer from
[**Location (un) **]. He was hemodynamically stable and was taken to the CT
scanner for definitive studies of his cervical spine injuries.
He remained intubated. On hospital day #2, he was taken to the
OR for stabilization of his cervical spine fractures by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of the spine service. An IVC filter was placed at that
time. The patient was placed in a halo to allow for future head
movement and stabilization of his C1 fracture. He tolerated the
procedures well and returned to the TSICU where he continued to
improve. Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] was started on nasogastric tube feeds on
hospital day #3, which he tolerated well.  On hospital day four,
the patient consented to placement of a tracheostomy tube and an
open G-tube and he returned to the OR for placement on hospital
day 6. Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] continued to improve and was screened and
accepted for rehab, however, prior to discharged he developed a
fever and was pan-cultured. He was found to have gram negative
rods growing in his sputum and blood. Antibiotics were started
and he gradually improved. The gram negative rods eventually
speciated to two variants of E.Coli which were pansensitive. He
was treated with culture directed antibiotics and improved
appropriately. In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname 70284**] did have sporadic
episodes of bradycardia which were felt to be related to
dysautonomia from his high cord issue. These did not require
symptomatic treatment. He remained trach/vent dependent, with
stable neurologic examination (including mental status)
throughout his hospitalization.
