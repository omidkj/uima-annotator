History of Present Illness:
HPI: 69 yo with end stage MS.  In [**12-8**], developed left arm
numbness and was found to have right frontal subarachnoid
hemmorhage. This was biopsied due to concern for mass, but
biopsy showed only blood.  On [**2154-2-1**], he was admitted to psych
at outside hospital with depressed mood secondary to increased
lower extremity pain. During that admission he was transferred
to ICU due to fever and hypotension. Urine culture grew yeast.
He was stabilized and discharged to nursing home on [**2154-2-9**] with
a 5 day course of fluconazole.
.
The next day ([**2154-2-10**]), he devoloped altered mental status and
presented to OSH.  At the OSH hospital ED he was initially
unresponsive with a fever of 103, however he soon regained
alertness. Dexamethasone, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin were
administered for suspicion of meningitis. Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to complex medical problems.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he became obtunded and was intubated.  His
vitals were 89, 112/77, 18, 96% on NRB. Head CT showed no change
in previously documented frontal SAH. Neurosurgery saw the
patient and recommended medical management. CXR showed
infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia or aspiration. He then
became hypotensive in the ED, and sepsis secondary to pneumonia
or UTI was presumed. Vancomycin and Zosyn were started for broad
coverage.  Femoral line was placed after difficulty placing
central line, including arterial trauma with small right neck
hematoma. He was maintained on Levophed and Dopamine and
admitted to the ICU.
.
On admission to the ICU, his vitals were T97.5  92/57  65  14-18
 99% on 100%FiO2, PEEP 5, TV 600. By the next day, he was weaned
off pressors and extubated. On the day of medicine floor
transfer ([**2154-2-13**], patient was noted to be somnolent. ABG was
normal. Gabapentin was discontinued, and somnolence improved.
Upon transfer to floor, he is alert and responds to questions
appropriately, but complains of intense right leg pain which is
subsequently relieved by 2mg IV Morphine. He is oriented to
person and place, but not year.  He denies chest pain, shortness
of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation.


Past Medical History:

not followed up recently and is not sure if his defibrillator is
functioning)
-MS: dx 10 yrs ago by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 76767**] in [**Location (un) **]; has not
followed

walk, he has been unable to move his legs for the last 1-1.5 yrs
and so at baseline is wheel-chair bound
-hx of trigeminal neuralgia on left, tx Tegretol and Neurontin
-TURP 1 yr ago
-on home O2 x few years up to 4L per day for comfort
-COPD
-Afib
-Hypothyroid
-Recent psychiatric admission for suicidality from severe pain
-Aspiration PNA
-Dysphagia


Social History:

(stopped in [**2114**]), no EtOH, no recreational drug use; former
attendant for handicapped individuals prior to diagnosis of MS.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

[**2154-2-10**] Head CT: FINDINGS: The heterogeneous hematoma in the
high right frontal lobe posteriorly appears unchanged in size
and configuration with mild surrounding vasogenic edema. Its
size actually appears to have decreased slightly measuring 22 x
16 mm today as compared to 26 x 18 mm on the prior study.
Evidence of bur hole in the high right frontal region from prior
brain biopsy is again note. There are no findings to suggest new
hemorrhage. Periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensity is noted diffusely, unchanged. There are no new
areas of abnormal enhancement. Ventricular size and
configuration is stable. Note is made of a prior left occipital
craniotomy. Since the prior study, there has been increasing
mucosal opacification particularly in the ethmoids which are
nearly totally opacified, but also increased mucosal thickening
within the sphenoid air cells, and near total opacification now
within the maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Slightly smaller right frontal hematoma compared to
previous study of [**2154-1-21**]. No abnormal enhancement. No
other areas of intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2154-2-11**] ECHO: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls
and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40
%). No intraventricular thrombus is seen. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
