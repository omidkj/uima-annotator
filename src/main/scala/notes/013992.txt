Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-1-8**] Cardiac Catheterization with IABP Placement
[**2169-1-9**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to
diagonal, vein grafts to LAD and OM) and Mitral Valve Repair
utilizing a 28mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] Annuloplasty Ring on IABP


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36010**] is a 72 year old female who presented to the ER with
unstable angina. The chest pain started at midnight, and
described as a "hard" pain, without associated shortness of
breath, nausea/vomiting, or diaphoresis. She awoke 4 hours later
with excruciating [**10-27**] pain. 911 called.  EMTs gave ASA, NTG.
[**10-27**] CP on arrival to the ER. In the ER, she was found to be in
rapid atrial fibrillation.  EKG evolved to normal sinus rhythm
associated with ST elevations inferiorly and deep ST depressions
anteriorly. She was subsequently heparinized and emergently sent
to cath lab.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for similar, though less
severe symptoms with exertion this past week. At baseline, she
is not very active. However, in the course of her daily
activities, she had not had exertional symptoms prior to the
past week. Otherwise, she denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. On review of symptoms, she denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has
had 2 prior miscarriages. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.


Past Medical History:
Congestive Heart Failure(Diastolic), Coronary Artery Disease,
Acute ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension


Social History:
Social history is significant for prior tobacco use, having quit
in her 20s. There is no history of alcohol abuse. She lives at
home with her husband of 55 years. She is employed by [**Company 4916**].


Family History:
There is no family history of sudden death. Mother had MI at 64.

[**2169-1-8**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
left
main and diffuse 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
a 30%
proximal and 50% distal stenosis.  The LAD had an 80% proximal,
90% mid,
and 80% distal stenoses.  The inferior branch of a major
diagonal had an
80% stenosis.  The LCx had a 90% ostial, 60% OM2, and 70% ramus
stenoses.  The RCA had a 60% ostial, 80% proximal, and 95% mid
stenoses
with left to right collateral branches supplying the distal RCA.

2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed eleveated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 30 mm Hg.  The PCWP was elevated with a mean of 24
mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 52 mm Hg.

Systemic arterial pressures were normal, with aortic systolic
pressure
of 137 mm Hg.  Cardiac index was depressed at 2.02 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed LVEF of 45% with inferobasal
akinesis.  There was moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
4.  Intraaortic balloon pump was successfully placed.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2169-1-15**] 8:41 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman s/p CABGx3
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
HISTORY: CABG, evaluate for effusion.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD. The patient is status post sternotomy,
with prosthetic valve. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded. Probable
atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic angle. There are small
bilateral effusions, greater on the left, with collapse and/or
consolidation in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe.
No chf is identified.

Compared with one day earlier, right cardiophrenic atelectasis
is worse. Otherwise, no significant change is detected.
