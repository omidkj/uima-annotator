History of Present Illness:
57 year old gentleman alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
varices,
encephalopathy, DM, anemia, depression .
s/p recent umbilical hernia repair on [**2106-6-7**] complicated by
recurrent small bowel obstruction in setting of bilateral
inguinal hernias.  He then returned on [**2106-7-23**] with anorexia
and
abdominal pain and found to have recurrent bowel obstruction. On
[**2106-7-24**], he had left direct hernia repair.(Sac was not opened)
In the post operative period, he became increasingly
encephalopathic and was admitted to the SICU.  Following the
operation, he was found to have oliguric acute kidney injury .
He was febrile. Transferred from [**Last Name (un) 1724**] last night.

Imaging:

[**2106-7-24**] showed a large left indirect inguinal hernia
  with high-grade small-bowel obstruction as well as hyperemia
suspicious for       ischemia, large right indirect inguinal
hernia, thickening of the cecum and       ascending colon, felt
to perhaps reflect hepatic colopathy, cirrhosis,
 splenomegaly and portal hypertension with a large degree of
portosystemic   varices, increased amount of ascites now felt to
be moderate as well as     bilateral large hydroceles.

Brief Hospital Course:
 57M history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by varices,
encephalopathy, DM, anemia, depression s/p hernia operations
complicated by [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
of decompensated liver disease/encephalopathy, acute renal
failure, and respiratory distress. He was admitted to the MICU
initially and was pan-cultured including paracentesis to r/o
SBP. Empiric vanc/zosyn  were started. PD fluid culture isolated
E coli and Klebsiella.  Hepatology and Transplant/hepatobiliary
Surgery were consulted.

On [**7-27**], he was taken to the OR for small-bowel perforation and
incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
who performed the following:

1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Reduction of incarcerated left indirect inguinal hernia.
3. Small-bowel resection.
4. Anastomosis repair of indirect inguinal hernia.
5. Left testicular spermatic cord resection.
6. Drainage of multiple intraabdominal abscesses.

Postop, he was transferred to the SICU intubated for management.
CXR showed multifocal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy showed no major abnormality, wash out culture
isolated + GPC. Vanco and Zosyn continued.

[**7-29**] CT of head for AMS was negative for acute changes. There
was an old left frontal lobe infarct and old left basal ganglia
lacunar infarct versus prominent perivascular space. Neuro exam
improved. Lactulose and Rifaximin was started for
encephalopathy.

Fluconazole was added on [**7-31**]. This was continued thru [**8-4**].

CXR on [**8-1**] showed improvement. He required intermittent
Levophed and albumin. He had brief run of afib that resolved
with 5mg lopressor and was likely from low potassium.

On [**7-29**] Zosyn was changed changed to meropenem. TPN was started
for nutrition. On [**8-3**], he was extubated and shovel mask was
used. Tube feeding
