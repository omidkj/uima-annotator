History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104502**] is a 61 year old woman with hx of ESRD s/p failed
transplants on HD, CAD s/p PCI s/p STEMI [**1-/2204**], sCHF (EF 30%),
scleroderma, HTN, recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 104609**] with
chest pain and fluid overload, presenting with chest pain and
dypnea at rest.  Patient felt good on the day prior to admission
with some fleeting episodes of minimal chest pain in the
afternoon.  The night prior to admission, she was sitting up
awake, feeling like she could not sleep.  She then had onset of
substernal, burning "heartburn" that was constant without relief
from nitroglycerin or inhalers.  This radiated up to her throat
but not to her limbs.  THe patient felt that her pain felt
slightly better when leaning over forward.  Along with her chest
pain, she had difficulty breathing that was consistent with her
symptoms of CHF exacerbation prior to her past hospitalization.
She also notes difficulty walking today and has been unable to
weigh herself for the past two days. Last HD session was Friday,
[**9-14**] before discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]. She called into her primary
care clinic this morning who suggested that she come to the ED.

.
During last hospitalization, patient was admitted to the CCU
because she was requiring BIPAP in ED, underwent ultrafiltration
on night of admission. Troponin was mildly elevated at 0.22 from
baseline 0.09. Symptoms were improved after ultrafiltration
session; symptoms were attributed to GERD and acute CHF, as they
occured primarily while patient was supine. ECHO demonstrated EF
30%, so patient was started on metoprolol succinate 25mg QHS,
and it was recommended that she start lisinopril 2.5mg as an
outpatient, as tolerated by blood pressures.
.
Pt was also hospitalized [**Date range (1) 104610**] for fluid overload and
respiratory distress requiring intubation. Of note, patient was
admitted [**Date range (1) 46888**] with STEMI. She was admitted for chest pain
and shortness of breath with elevation of cardiac enzymes
(trop-T peak 2.45, MBI 13.5); on the second hospital day, she
developed shortness of breath, felt to be her anginal
equivalent, and ECG showed ST elevations V2-V4, so she was taken
emergently to cath lab; cath showed diffuse CAD but no culprit
lesion, so patient was medically managed with plavix and
increased atorvastatin dose, maintained on heparin gtt for
48hrs, no intervention.
.
In the ED this hospitalization, initial vitals were as follows:
97.6 85 109/54 26 100%on 4L NC. No further chest pain. Exam was
notable for decreased breath sounds, no evidence of
consolidation. EKG showed NSR @ 84 bpm, with left axis
deviation, normal PR interval, normal QT interval, borderline
long QRS with interventricular conduction delay, left
ventricular hypertrophy, J-point elevation in V1-V3, <[**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression c/w strain in V6.  No changes from prior EKG on
[**2204-9-14**].  Labs significant for Trop-T of 1.19 but CK 29 and
CK-MB 3, as well as Hct 26.8 (c/w recent baseline). Lactate
normal at 1.7. CXR (PA&lateral) shows diffuse interstitial
edema. Patient took her ASA 325 mg PO at home this morning.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was visibly tachypneic, vitals
BP 103/50, RR 32, HR 92, 98%4LNC.  She was started on a heparin
drip.  She was then tranferred to the CCU because of tachypnea.
Vital signs on transfer were 97.8 105/60 82 28 97% 4L.
.
On arrival to the CCU, initial vital signs were 96.0 106/60 91
30 93% 4L.  The patient said that her breathing felt better with
supplemental oxygen, but complained of chest pain.
Nitroglycerin had been held secondary to SBPs around 100.
.
