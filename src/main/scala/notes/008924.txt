HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 87-year-old male
with history of peripheral vascular disease and coronary
artery disease, who presented to the Emergency Department
with the history of diarrhea for the past 1.5 weeks.  The
patient had a stool test that was positive for Clostridium
difficile, and was started on metronidazole as an outpatient.
He continued to have diarrhea with bloody stools beginning
one day prior to admission.  In addition, he had increased
weakness and decreased oral intake.

In the Emergency Department, he was found to be hypotensive
with a hematocrit of 18.2, INR of 6.7, and white blood cell
count of 31,800.  The patient was given intravenous fluids,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl, as well as oral Vancomycin.  He was
admitted to the CCU with the request of his outpatient
cardiologist, and due to his hemodynamic instability and
decreased hematocrit.

Of note, the patient had a recent SFA stent placed two weeks
prior to admission, and had been on intermittent antibiotics.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Peripheral vascular disease with stent of the left SFA and
lower extremity ulcers bilaterally.
2. Coronary artery disease:  Stress test from [**2173-9-22**]
showed a moderate inferior wall defect, which was partially
reversible.
3. CHF with ejection fraction of 33%.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Chronic atrial fibrillation.
7. Chronic renal failure.
8. Cataract surgery.
9. Diabetes.

2. Digoxin 0.125 mg 3x a week.
3. Niferex one q.d.
4. Nephrocaps one q.d.
5. Flomax 0.4 q.d.
6. Aspirin 325 q.d.
7. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
8. Lasix 40 mg 3x a week.

12. Rocaltrol 0.25 q.d.
13. Diltiazem 120 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with his daughter and is a
retired dentist.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Was notable for vital signs as
follows:  Afebrile, heart rate 22, blood pressure 81/36,
respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Otherwise, examination was notable only for jugular venous
pulsation elevated at 10 cm and bilateral pitting edema in
the lower extremities to mid calves.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count of 31,800 with 89
polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and 5 bands.  Hematocrit of
18.2 down from 32.2, INR of 6.7, PTT of 51.7, and creatinine
of 2.1 up from 1.4, BUN of 73, up from 32.  CK was 110, MB 7,
and troponin T was 0.17.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary
vasculature and upper zone redistribution.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 90 with right
bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI bleed:  In the CCU, the patient was found to have
guaiac positive stools and an INR of 6.7 with persistent
melena.  In light of these findings, the patient was
transfused to a goal hematocrit of 30 and anticoagulation was
held.  Blood pressure responded to fluid replacement.  The
patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units
of FFP, and vitamin K.

An EGD was performed on [**10-7**], which showed ulcers in
the lower third of the esophagus just above the GE junction
and duodenitis.  The patient was placed on IV Protonix.  The
INR improved to 1.5.  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable, though his stools remained guaiac positive.  The
melena did resolve.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service on
[**10-9**].  The patient will need colonoscopy as an
outpatient to further evaluate the cause of his bleed.

2. Peripheral vascular disease:  Patient was thought not to
be a good candidate for revascularization surgery due to his
comorbidities.  He received wound care with wet-to-dry
dressings b.i.d.  Nutrition consult was obtained to recommend
supplements for wound healing.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], debridement will
be addressed as needed on an outpatient basis.

3. Cardiovascular:  Once the patient's hematocrit was stable,
his Plavix and aspirin were restarted.  Patient was continued
on captopril and metoprolol.  He was continued on digoxin for
rate control.  Captopril should be switched to Zestril as an
outpatient for more convenient dosing.

4. Infectious disease:  The patient's white blood cell count
decreased and he remained afebrile.  His diarrhea decreased
on antibiotic treatment.

5. Renal:  Creatinine was mildly increased during his
hospitalization, but was trending down at the time of this
dictation.
