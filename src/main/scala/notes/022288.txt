Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16983**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Gamma Nailing of Left Femur under GA on [**2128-6-16**]


History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman with metastatic breast cancer to brain, spine,
pelvis and femurs, recent NSTEMI, HTN, presents with L hip pain.
She developed acute onset of severe left hip pain [**8-30**] the night
prior to admission.  She  suffers chronic bone pain from bone
metastases but this was significantly worse.  She was unable to
weight bear without significant pain.  She had no history of
trauma or falls.

Patient taken to OR on [**2128-6-16**] for L ORIF.  Intra-op course was
complicated by 750 cc blood loss and hypotension requiring 1L
NS, 2 units of PRBCs.  Patient received 2 more units of PRBCs
upon arrival to the floor.  Her Hct never responded
appropriately and on  [**6-18**] it dropped from 29 to 23 with
increasing tension on her L thigh.  Patient subsequently
hypotensive with SBP in the 80s despite receiving 2L IVFs.  She
was transfused another 1 u PRBCs and 1 L NS and her SBP
recovered to 120s.  She was taken back to OR for I& D and had
200 cc drained.  Upon return from OR her SBP remained stable in
110s.  Patient also had her lovenox restarted.

Pertinent Results:
[**2128-6-13**].  MRI of left hip.
1.  Limited examination for detection of subtle fracturs due to
diffuse
extensive metastatic disease. Given this limitation, there is no
evidence for acute femoral neck fracture.
2.  Subacute fracture through the left greater trochanter and
left iliac
crest, better evaluated on the CT of [**2128-6-12**].
3.  The right hip is status post gamma nail and intramedullary
rod placement.  Surrounding right hip joint fluid is most likely
postoperative in nature.
4.  Extensive subcutaneous edema.
5.  Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2128-6-22**]. CT head.
No acute abnormality is detected including no hemorrhage or
hydrocephalus or herniation. There has been interval decrease in
the size of midline shift.
Multiple metastatic foci within the both occipital lobes and
both frontal
lobes appear unchanged.
Multiple bony lytic lesions within the left frontal bone, right
temporal bone and right side of C1 appear unchanged.
.
[**2128-6-23**].  CXR.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity and underlying infiltrate
cannot be
excluded in this location.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
prominent.  The patient has a right-sided Port-A-Cath.  There is
no signs for overt pulmonary edema.  There is increased density
to the bony structures, (particularly the ribs and the proximal
right humerus) consistent with known blastic metastases.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 71 Year old female with metastatic
breast cancer to the brain, spine, pelvis and femur admitted
with left hip pain.  Sheound to have an impending pathologic
fracture and went to the OR on [**6-16**].  Surgery was complicated by
hypotension requiring pressors and dropping hematocrit.  She was
felt to be bleeding into hip so she was taken back to the OR on
[**6-17**] to cauterize small arterial bleed in mid-thigh. She
developed delerium during the hospital stay thought to be due to
polypharmacy (opioids, klonipin, steroids) and possible
pneumonia.
.
1.  Impending hip fracture, s/p ORIF.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has extensive
bony metastases to left femur.  Left hip MRI showed an avulsion
fracture of the greater trochanter and an iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture,
both of which were subacute.  Patient went the OR on [**6-16**] with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] to stabilize femur.  Following surgery, she was
hypotensive requiring pressors, had decreased urine output,
falling hematocrit and increased tension in her left hip.  She
was thought to be bleeding at surgical site in her left hip so
was taken back to the OR on [**6-17**] for caterization of small
arterial bleed.  She was hemodynamically stable for the rest of
the hospital stay.
.
Pt. was also seen by radiation oncology.  She was scheduled to
get simulation on [**6-25**] and will begin XRT the following week.
.
2. Delerium. Patient became delerious on [**6-16**]. Delerium was
thought to be due to benzos, opioids, and anxiety of surgery. He
mental status continued to wax and wane.
.
On [**6-26**], she became even more severely delerious.  She was no
longer oriented to herself, she would perseverate on topics, she
was unable to name basic objects or follow commands.  Otherwise
exam is nonfocal and unchanged from the past.  Delerium is
likely multifactorial.  Delerium may be due to use Klonapin,
high doses of opioids, and steroids (for WBRT)in a patient with
brain metastases.  Furthermore, the patient developed a rising
[**Known lastname **] count and CXR could not rule out a retrocardiac opacity,
suggesting that PNA could be contributing to delerium.  UA was
negative.  Patient also has hyponatremia due to SIADH.  A head
CT did not show an acute cause of mental status changes.
Delerium resolved after stopping Klonapin and beginning
antibiotics for pneumonia.
.
3.  Pain.  Pt.'s pain was controlled with Oxycontin and
oxycodone PRNs.
.
4.  Hypothyroidism.  Pt has known hypothyroidism, however a TSH
was rechecked and found to be elevated (11), with low T4.
Synthroid was increased to 50mg qday.
.
5.  Left foot weakness/numbness.  Patient reports left foot
numbness and has [**2-23**] strengh on dorsiflexion and plantarflexion
of left foot that is unchanged from previous Rad Onc note.  MRI
of the lumbar spine confirmed there was no change from previous
MRI of the spine and showed NO cord compression.
.
6.  HTN.  Patient is on metoprolol and lisinopril for
hypertension. Hypertension was well controlled with the
exception of hypotension following surgery.
.
7. Breast cancer. Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] has metastatic breast cancer with
metastases to the brain and bones.  She recently underwent WBRT
and continued dexamethasone taper throughout hospital stay.
Patient got a dose of Velban on [**2128-6-15**].  It is not clear if she
will continue to get treatment with Velban, but the original
plan was to get weekly Velban.
.
8.  CAD.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] had recent NSTEMI (one month ago).  Her
cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated following surgery and her
post-op EKG showed ST depressions in the setting of hypotension.
 Small troponin leak is likely due to demand ischemia.
.
9. Anasarca.  Patient became edematous following surgery because
she was given a significant amount of fluids to keep her blood
pressure and urine output stable.  Diuresi
