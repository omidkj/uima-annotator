PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 98
degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 72, her blood pressure
was 162/68, her respiratory rate was 26, and her oxygen
saturation was 97% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
in no apparent distress.  Her speech was slurred secondary to
increased tongue swelling.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
No jugular venous distention was noted.  Her tongue was
visibly swollen.  Otherwise, her oropharynx was clear.  Her
sclerae were anicteric.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
an irregularly irregular rhythm.  There was an audible first
heart sound and second heart sound.  There was a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Pulmonary
examination revealed bilateral respiratory wheezes;
otherwise, clear to auscultation.  The abdomen was obese,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were active bowel
sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no edema.  Her
neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.  She was able to speak in coherent
sentences.  Her cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed her hematocrit was 36.7, her white blood
cell count was 7.4, and her platelets were 326.  The
patient's sodium was 140, potassium was 3.6, chloride was
106, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 17,
creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 118.  In [**2180-8-5**] she had pulmonary function tests which were normal with
mildly decreased diffusion capacity.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Her chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.

An echocardiogram in [**2181-9-4**] revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  TONGUE SWELLING ISSUES:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for concern of angioedema.  The
patient was observed closely overnight and treated with H2/H1
blockers.

Her ACE inhibitor was held.  All her by mouth medications
were initially held, and the patient was kept nothing by
mouth until the swelling improved.  There was no evidence of
stridor.

On hospital day two, the patient continued to be stable, and
her tongue swelling significantly improved.  The patient was
seen by the Allergy Service for consultation regarding the
cause of the angioedema.  The allergist felt that this was an
acute onset of angioedema most likely secondary to her ACE
inhibitors.  The Allergy Service felt that this could
occurred even after being on the ACE inhibitor for months or
years.  There was no evidence suggesting any other allergies
or food allergies.  Per the Allergy Service recommendations,
the patient was continued on Benadryl and famotidine for at
least three more days.  The patient did not need any further
steroids since she had improved.

The patient was discharged to home with an EpiPen to be used
in case of recurrent angioedema of the tongue, and she was
advised to call 911 if this were to happen.  In addition, C4,
C2, and C1 inhibitor functional assays were sent as well as
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid-stimulating hormone,
and T4.  These tests were to be followed up at the [**Hospital 228**]
[**Hospital 9039**] Clinic appointment on [**11-20**].

On hospital day three, it was felt that the patient was
stable enough to be discharged to home with the previous plan
in place.

2.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE ISSUES:  Pulmonary
function tests in [**2179**] revealed the patient had no evidence
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; however, the
patient did have some response to albuterol steroids.
Therefore, she likely has reactive airway disease.  The
patient was continued on albuterol nebulizers while in the
hospital for symptomatic relief.  The patient did report that
she felt wheezy; however, the patient's symptoms seemed to be
controlled with her inhalers.  The patient was told that if
her wheezing became worse she should call her primary care
physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was on Coumadin
which was initially held while the patient was nothing by
mouth.  However, this was restarted on hospital day two, and
her INR remained 1.8 prior to discharge.

4.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient had a slightly elevated
blood pressure up to 168/90 despite treatment with atenolol.
Given that the patient was reporting some wheezing, we did
not increase her atenolol dose.  Therefore, the patient was
started on amlodipine 2.5 mg by mouth once per day, as her
ACE inhibitor had been discontinued secondary to angioedema.
The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for further blood pressure management.  In
addition, the [**Hospital6 407**] was to visit the
patient on the day after discharge for blood pressure checks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

services.
