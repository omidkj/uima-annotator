dyspnea, tachypnea

hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
78 M w/ ESRD on HD MWF, CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->OM1 and
OM2) and St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] ([**12-12**]), sCHF w/ LVEF 30%, admitted from
[**Hospital 100**] rehab today for sudden onset dyspnea, which began upon
awakening this AM at 0900. Yesterday, he was in his USOH and
underwent HD w/ removal 2.7 L fluid as well as HD on Monday
where about 2-3L fluid was removed. RN noted that he was visibly
short of breath this AM w/ RR 50s at the [**Hospital3 **]
center where he has been living since his hospital d/c on [**3-19**].
He had been hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 89672**] for S.aureus and VRE
bacteremia and decompensated sCHF w/ subsequent initiation of
CVVH.
.
Today, the pt had been c/o dyspnea, which was worse with sitting
up and improving somewhat while lying supine, with very mild
midline substernal chest pressure.  He was noted to have gained
weight despite HD yesterday as he was 149 lbs on [**4-6**] and 159 lbs
on [**4-8**] and [**4-9**]. His wife also reports increased facial
"puffiness" and increased sacral and B/L UE edema. At rehab, he
was given 5u insulin for FSBS 500, 2mg morphine and 40mg IV
lasix for volume overload, although patient is anuric at
baseline and has ESRD requiring HD 3x/ wk. Denies pleuritic
pain, hemoptysis, cough, fevers, chills, or other complaints. In
the ED, he appeared uncomfortable and was placed on supplemental
O2. There he was noted to have a Troponin of 0.47, which is
around his baseline and BNP of >70,000 and appeared volume
overloaded on exam. He was evaluated by nephrology in the ED who
recommended MICU admission for 2h ultrafiltration session
followed by HD in the AM.
.
In the ED intial VS: 97.7 98 132/83 36 89% 2L NC.

VS prior to transfer: 97 101/73 35 99% 2L NC
.
CXR was c/w volume overload although underlying RLL PNA could
not be excluded, so he was given IV vancomycin and was written
for levofloxacin and clindamycin. He was also given ASA and
supplemental Oxygen.
.
In the MICU, pt appeared uncomfortable and tachypenic, with use
of accessory muscles of respiration and complains of lethargy.
His wife reports that he may have had sick contacts as he has
been living at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**3-19**] when he was treated for dyspnea thought to be [**3-6**] volume
overload and for VRE bacteremia w/ PO [**Month/Day (2) 11958**]/flagyl. During
this admission, pt had been made CMO on HD9 due to multiple
comorbidities; this was reversed HD13 as patient appeared more
alert.
.
Patient states he had sudden onset of feeling weak, tired and
short of breath this morning. He states he has had his "flu and
pneumonia" shots. He denies chest pain, fevers/chills,
nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort or diarrhea. He denies
having had a cough or bringing up sputum although was
intermittently coughing during the interview. All other ROS
otherwise negative.

Patient s/p 2 wks IV ganciclovir. Coumadin for afib held and was
restarted the nigth prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
--More recently on [**2-5**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, due to persistent
diarrhea, the patient was empirically started on Flagyl for
cdiff colitis

IMAGING:
[**4-11**] CXR:
1. Findings suggest fluid overload, possibly due to CHF with
moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and right greater than
left bilateral pleural effusions. Right base opacity may
represent combination of layering fluid and atelectasis, given
that the patient is semi-erect, however, underlying
consolidation is also of concern. Additionally, patchy left base
retrocardiacopacity is seen, which could be due to aspiration,
infection, chronic atelectasis.
2. Left PICC line continues to be high riding.
.
ECHO [**2137-4-16**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded; the septum may be hypokinetic but is not fully
visualized. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. A bileaflet aortic
valve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regu
