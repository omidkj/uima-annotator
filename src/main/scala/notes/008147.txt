Service:  C-MED

ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While the patient was prepared to go to
rehabilitation on [**12-13**], his urine and [**3-6**] blood
cultures grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus.  The
patient underwent surface echocardiogram which did not show a
vegetation on his aortic valve.

In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service, the
patient was started on a 6-week course of intravenous
vancomycin for presumptive endocarditis.  The patient's
history of cardiopulmonary disease prevented safe intubation
for transesophageal echocardiogram.

The patient was to continue vancomycin 1.25 g every 24 hours
until [**2161-1-18**].  No other changes were made in his
medications.
