Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2192-11-23**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior
cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well
seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Trace AR. [The amount of AR is normal for this AVR.]

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe anterior and septal
hypokinesis/akinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 30%). There is a small (1.0 x 1.0) round echogenic mass,
attached to the apical side of the anterolateral papillary
muscle. The mass likely represents a torn/curled up mitral
chorda tendinae. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is
normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate
regional systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Normally-functioning
mechanical aortic prosthesis. Small LV mass, likely a torn
mitral chord.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-11-23**],
regional left ventricular dysfunction is new. Stenotic native
aortic valve has been replaced with a bileaflet prosthesis. A
small LV mass is unchanged in location and appearance.
