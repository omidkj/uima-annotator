Allergies:
Vitamin K

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
RML collapse, bilateral pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
large volume paracentesis
diagnostic paracentesis
hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
47M h/o ESLD [**2-17**] alcohol abuse and HCV, ESRD on HD, who presents
after large volume paracentesis of 8L and dialysis in [**Hospital1 8**].
Treated with 12.5gx4 of Albumin. Pt had a CXR on [**2175-11-28**] with
showed right middle lobe collapse. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] (Renal) has been
unable to get in touch with him about this result. He was
contact[**Name (NI) **] at dialysis yesterday and was directly admitted for
w/u of pulmonary process. Upon admission, patient was alert and
oriented to person and hospital. However, as the evening
progressed, he became more somnolent. Patient later desatted on
room air to 84-88%RA which went up to 96% on 6L face mask. ABG
was done. pH was 7.38, pCO2 48, p02 of 62%. Repeat CXR again
demonstrated R middle lobe collapse, thought unlikely to be
result of infectious process. Patient was intially started on
levaquin empirically, but after he decompensated, coverage was
advanced to Vanco, Zosyn. Sputum gram stain from [**12-1**] was
positive for 4+ GPCs in pairs and chains.

Past Medical History:
--GI/liver
Cirrhosis [**2-17**] untreated HCV, alcohol abuse, not transplant
candidate
Esophageal varices s/p [**12-20**] banding
h/o SBP

Schizotypal personality disorder

Social History:
# Personal: Lives with wife.
# Substance abuse: Denies current tobacco, ETOH, or drug use.
Heavy ETOH use in past, prior IV drug use in [**2148**], but last
reportedly [**4-21**].  Former smoker.


Family History:

# Maternal aunt with DM.

Physical Exam:

EXT: Tense edema to the knees bilaterally with some chronic
venous stasis changes.
NEURO: AAO x 2 (knows name and [**Hospital1 18**]).  He was very somnolent
and poorly attentive.  Moving all extremities, but not
