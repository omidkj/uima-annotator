Chief Complaint:
"I couldn't breathe" x 1 day

History of Present Illness:
   86-year-old woman w/ HTN, hypothyroidism, AAA presents w/
shortness of breath x 1 day.  She was in her USOH until 3 days
ago, when she developed insidious onset of nasal congestion,
runny nose, and cough occasionally productive of scant yellow
sputum.  She reports minor subjective fever initially that has
resolved.  These symptoms have persisted until now.  Over the
past 2 days, she has developed increased dyspnea on exertion.
There is no dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, or PND.  This morning,
she had a prolonged episode of coughing which caused significant
dyspnea, prompting her to call her PCP for advice.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**]
was concerned about her dyspnea and advised her to present to
the ED for evaluation.  She denies any weight loss, chills,
myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
hematochezia, black stools, dysuria, chest pain, or
palpitations.  She does report difficulty w/ balance over past
months requiring her to use a cane for walking.
   In the ED, she was observed to have a large melanic stool
without any associated symptoms.  Vital signs were stable.  She
was treated w/ ceftriaxone 1gm and azithromycin 500mg for
possible PNA.

CXR: Left basilar opacity that may represent atelectasis altho
pneumonia not excluded. Probable emphysema.

CTA chest:
  1. Slightly limited examination for evaluation for pulmonary
embolus, although no large central pulmonary embolus is present
and no definite evidence of more distal pulmonary embolus is
visualized.
  2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, including multiple
subcentimeter pretracheal and precarinal nodes, and enlarged
right hilar and subcarinal nodal masses.
  3. Four millimeter nodule within the left upper lobe
laterally. Comparison with any possibly available prior imaging
is recommended. Short-term CT follow-up is recommended.
  4. Bronchiectatic changes predominantly in the lower lobes
bilaterally.
  5. Large hiatal hernia.

[**2188-2-22**]: Angiogram
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of active extravasation of the contrast material
as above.
2. Embolization of the left L3 lumbar artery per surgical team
request.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea:  she was admitted w/ dyspnea in setting of URI
symptoms that was most consistent w/ viral URI, as there was no
fever and no infiltrative process on chest CT.  She was tested
for influenza w/ DFA of nasal aspirate.  Meanwhile, she was
treated w/ ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible CAP.
On HD#2, DFA returned as positive for influenza A.  As the pt
had been afebrile w/ no signs of infxn, pneumonia was thought to
be unlikely and abx were d/c at that time.  She remained dyspnic
w/ upper and lower airway wheezing throughout her early hospital
course, which was thought to be [**2-6**] viral bronchitis.  She was
treated w/ prednisone taper and nebulized albuterol and
atrovent, w/ good symptom control.  However, she required
continued O2 by NC to maintain O2 sats >93% throughout the first
half of her admission.  By d/c, she was weaned off O2 and was
breathing comfortably on room air without requirement for
albuterol or atrovent.  At d/c, she is maintaining good O2 sat
on room air and is not dyspnic.

2. GI bleed:  she was observed to have melanic stool in the ED,
without any GI symptoms.  She was guaiac positive at that time.
This was most likely [**2-6**] indolent upper GI bleed.  On admission,
coumadin was held and heparin was started for anticoagulation
given her AVR.  Treatment was started w/ IV protonix.  Plans
were made for EGD/colonoscopy to evaluate for source of
bleeding, but these procedures were delayed due to the pt's
dyspnea and relative risk of sedation.  Her HCT was observed to
drop significantly, which was likely [**2-6**] retroperitoneal bleed
as below, and not related to GI bleed.  After her admission, she
had no further melena or hematochezia.  After stabilization of
retroperitoneal bleed, she underwent EGD and colonoscopy, which
demonstrated evidence of esophagitis w/ no active bleeding.
Protonix was changed to oral formulation, and sucralfate was
added for improved treatment of esophagitis.  She had no further
evidence of active GI bleeding during her admission.  Her
sucralfate was stopped. She will need to continue protonix twice
daily after d/c.

3. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  on HD#4, her HCT was observed to
have dropped overnight from 27 to 21.  This was concerning for
active GI bleed.  She was transfused w/ 2units PRBCs, w/
appropriate HCT increase to 29 after transfusion.  However, her
HCT again decreased overnight from 29 to 22 with no melena or
hematochezia to explain the blood loss.  Lab workup showed no
evidence of hemolysis.  Abd CT demonstrated large left
retroperitoneal hemorrhage, 11x5 cm in size, w/ radiographic
evidence of acute on chronic bleeding.  Heparin was d/c, she was
transfused w/ an additional 2units PRBCs, and was transferred to
the MICU for close monitoring.  Surgery was consulted, and
recommended holding anticoagulation with close monitoring of
HCT.  The pt had appropriate response of HCT w/ PRBC
transfusion, and HCT remained stable for 3 days off
anticoagulation.  As HCT had stabilized, she was transferred
back to the Medicine floor and Surgery recommended resuming
heparin for anticoagulation.  Heparin was resumed w/ close
monitoring of PTT, and HCT was monitored closely.  However,
after resuming heparin the pt had another decrease in HCT
concerning for active bleeding.  Heparin was stopped
immediately.  Repeat CT scan showed enlarging left
retroperitoneal bleed tracking down into pelvis and left thigh.
CTA was done to localize source of bleed, and showed active
contrast extravasation from the left L3 lumbar artery.  IR was
consulted, and performed embolization of left L3 lumbar artery,
though there was no evidence of active bleeding from the artery
at the time of the procedure.  She tolerated the procedure well.
 HCT was follow closely after embolization, and remained stable
for
