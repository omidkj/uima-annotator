CRI on HD, HTN, recent ARDS, intubation transfered here from
[**Hospital3 3583**] for catherization re: elevated troponins. Pt
initially presented with acute SOB was intubed in ED for ARDS
and found to have b/l pneumonia. Pt was found to have increasing
tropoining 2.3 -> 3.9. EKG are difficult to interpret due to V
pacing. Pt was also hypotensive and was on Dopamine drip. His
course was further complicated by ARF and rising WBC with
fevers. Pt was treated with Vanco, Ceftaz, Ceftriaxone, Azithro.
He was eventually extubated. Immediately after there was further
concern for undergoing ischemia and worsening LV. Pt has been
receiving his cardiac meds intermittenlty during his stay at the
CCU. Last night ([**12-21**]) back on the floor, patient experiences
CP, his anginal equivalent, and was transfered back to CCU on
NTG drip that relieved his pain.

There now appears to be a large amount of intraperitoneal blood.

The liver also appears markedly abnormal, although the
examination is limited
by lack of contrast streaking and beam hardening artifact. The
major
differential within the liver, particularly within segments VI
and VII rests
between contusion or infarction, with the former favored.
