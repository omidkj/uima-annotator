Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
PICC line


History of Present Illness:
72 F with insulin dependent diabetes having refused fingersticks
lately and her daughter reportedly refusing to administer
insulin went to OSH with altered mental status. She was
intubated and found to have glucose > 1000 and hyperkalemia
without an anion gap. She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. In our ED, she was noted to have HR 83,
124/68, 14, 100%, cvp 11 and possible pancreatitis. A left IJ
was placed, an insulin drip was begun at 6 units per hours, and
750 mg of levaquin with IVF was administered. Blood and urine
cultures were obtained and she was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Of note, no
paperwork was delivered with patient so initial history was per
OMR notes from [**2181**]. Later, in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her daughter would
expand on the presentation and would state that the patient had
become agressive, scratching her caregivers (family) and
throwing diapers at them.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in
[**2177**].
2. Chronic atrial fibrillation.
3. History of CVA in [**2181-3-6**] with left arm paralysis
4. Insulin dependent diabetes with neuropathy and retinopathy.
5. Patient is legally blind.
6. Hypertension.
7. History of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to ulcers.
8. History of a scull fracture as a child.
9. History of chronic anemia.
10. History of urinary tract infection.
11. History of depression anxiety.
12. superficial femoral perineal artery bypass with
nonreversible saphenous vein graft [**2181**].
13. s/p left BKA [**2180**] for nonhealing heel ulcer and
14. Dyslipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for:
1. Coronary artery bypass graft at [**Hospital6 54007**] in the year [**2177**].
2. Cataract surgery with loss of vision.
3. Right below the knee amputation in [**2181-11-5**].


Social History:
The patient is a married female. She usually lives with her
daughter. She does not smoke. She does not drink. She has had
blood transfusions in the past.

Family History:
 unknown

Physical Exam:
T 97.4 BP 87/65 with HR 65 O2 100% on AC PEEP 5 TV 400 RR 14

HEENT: dry mm, eyes deviated up and to left, minimally reactive
pupils
Neck: supple, no bruits, left IJ in place without erythema
Cor: irreg irreg, no murmurs
Chest: CTAB no crackles, right nipple inverted
Abd: soft NT ND decreased bowel sounds
Ext: s/p bilateral BKAs, moving arms, right brachial reflex 2+
left diminished.
Skin: multiple escars, 3x4 cm over right hip, 4x6 under left
pannus,
2x3 on back, 6x8 cm erosions under left breast


Pertinent Results:
EKG: low voltage a.fib at 80, left axis, poor R wave
progression, TWI V3-v6, no ST changes.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2185-3-16**] 4:02 AM
Portable AP chest dated [**2185-3-16**] is compared to the prior from
[**2181-12-25**]. The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube
terminates 3.9 cm above the carina. The heart size is normal.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is stable
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There is patchy opacity in
the left retrocardiac region, which could represent atelectasis
and/or aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned. Left
lower lung lobe patchy airspace opacity likely represents
atelectasis and/or aspiration.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**3-16**]

CONCLUSION: Extensive areas of diminished density within the
cerebral hemispheres suggesting prior infarcts. If a new infarct
is suspected, MR is a more sensitive imaging modality to detect
acute brain ischemia.

CT SCAN ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**3-22**]

IMPRESSION:
1. Left parapelvic cyst, with no evidence of renal abscess or
hydronephrosis.
2. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive atelectasis.
3. Large ascites, generalized anasarca.
4. Fluid and stranding surrounding the pancreatic head, with
heterogeneous enhancement, consistent with pancreatitis; there
is no evidence of complication.
5. Abnormal appearance of the sigmoid and distal descending
colon with hausrtral edema, a non-specific finding in a setting
of ascites; however, this may be seen in pseudomembranous and
other colitis, and should be correlated clinically.
6. Mildly distended gallbladder with enhancing borderline wall
thickening. This, too, is non-specific, and follow-up son[**Name (NI) 867**]
should be considered, if there is clinical concern for
cholecystitis.
7. Multiple splenic infarcts

[**2185-3-16**] ECHO

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall, and apex
(EF ~ 35%).
The remaining segments contract well. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent
with coronary
artery disease. Mild mitral regurgitation.
