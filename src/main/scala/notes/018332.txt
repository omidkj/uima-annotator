Micro: Blood cultures from [**2186-4-30**] - pending as of discharge

Imaging: [**2186-4-30**] CXR - Study is limited secondary to patient
motion. No definite pleural effusions are seen. No pneumothorax
is identified. There is suggestion of central perihilar vascular
congestion, which may reflect a component of mild CHF. The
cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax are seen. A portion of the right
hemicolon appears interposed between the diaphragm and the
liver.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 75F PMH DM2, schizoaffective d/o,
hypertension, CHF admitted with respiratory distress likely
secondary to pneumonia.
.
Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with signs and symptoms
of pneumonia.  As she is a nursing home resident, she will be
treated with 8 day of IV antibiotics for hospital acquired
pneumonia.  She rapidly improved her oxygenation.  Blood
cultures were negative at the time of discharge.  She was
evaluted by the speech pathologist who recommended pureed solids
with nectar thickened liquids.  She continued to received
bronchodilators for a reactive airways component to her
pneumonia.
.
Congestive Heart failure: The patient presented as euvolemic to
slt dry.  Her diuretics were held and can be restarted as needed
as the long-term care facility.  She ruled out for MI and had no
significant events on telemetry.
.
Hypernatremia: This was likely related to low oral intake,
perhaps with a component of diabetes insipitus from her lithium.
Her calculated free water deficit was ~2 liters.  She should
have daily electrolytes monitored as she has this deficit
replaced.  Her first liter of replacement was ordered in the
discharge papers.
.
Schizoaffective disorder: She will remain on her home
medications.
.
Diabetes Mellitus type 2: The patient's blood sugars were
controlled with insulin sliding scale.  As the patient's oral
intake improves, consideration should be made for a long acting
basal insulin.
.
FEN: Speech pathology recommendations as above. Free water
repletion as above.
.
Code status: DNR, DNI per patient's guardian.
.
Disposition: Discharged to return to long-term care facility.
