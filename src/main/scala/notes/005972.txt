History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with newly discovered cardiomyopathy admitted
in [**Month (only) 116**] to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with cellulitis. TTE at the time showed
moderate focal and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with  multivessel coronary artery disease and
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. He reports
fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion such as climbing 2
flights of stairs. He also reports left leg swelling which does

catheterization. Cardiac catheterization found to have coronary
artery disease and referred to cardiac surgery for
revascularization.

Discharge labs
ECHO:
PRE-BYPASS: Essentially perserved LV systolic function with no
segmental wall motion abnormalities and no significant valvular
abnormalities or other significant unexpected findings.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Diastolic dysfunction present with pseudonormal transmitral
diastolic spectral Doppler profile with lateral mitral annular
tissue Doppler e' = 6.7 cm/sec. Intact interatrial septum. No
clot in LAA. Normal appearing coronary sinus.
POST-BYPASS:
LVEF > 55% no segmental wall motion abnormalities. Otherwise
unchanged.

Final Report:  In comparison with the study of [**6-30**], the right IJ
sheath has been removed.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists in this patient with intact midline sternal wires.
There is continued hazy opacification bilaterally, more
prominent on the left, with preservation of pulmonary markings
consistent with bilateral layering pleural effusions and
underlying compressive atelectasis.  This appears to be
increasingly prominent on the left, though this could merely
reflect differences in patient position.
In view of the prominent bilateral effusions, the possibility of
supervening pneumonia would be extremely difficult to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2168-6-29**] where the patient underwent Coronary
artery bypass graft x3, left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to diagonal
and obtuse marginal arteries. Endoscopic harvesting of long
saphenous vein.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
not initiated in the immediate post-operative period due to
sinus bradycardia in the 40's requiring temporary pacing until
he recovered his native rhythm. He subsequently developed rapid
afib with conversion pauses requiring a permanent pacemaker
which was placed on [**2168-7-8**]. He will complete a 5 day course of
keflex s/p pacer. He was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication. The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD # 10 from his CABG
and POD#1 from his pacer the patient was ambulating with
assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 4103**] on
the [**Doctor Last Name **] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
