   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-2-4**] 2:30 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with s/p CABG/AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o effusion
CHEST

HISTORY: CABG, AVR, rule out effusion.

Two views. Comparison with the previous study done [**2170-2-1**].
Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural
effusions are again demonstrated. The patient is status post
median sternotomy and CABG, as before. Mediastinal structures
are unchanged. Compared with the previous study, the right
pleural effusion has probably decreased somewhat.

IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in pleural fluid on the right. No
other significant change.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be
fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic
arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS
(AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Severe mitral
annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. See
Conclusions for
post-bypass data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated and elongated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9 cm2).
Moderate to severe
(3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Based on mean mitral valve
gradients of [**7-26**],
there is likely at least moderate mitral stenosis. Pressure half
time was not
useful to measure the MVA pre-bypass given the significant AI.
Using Flow
convergence/PISA techniques and pressure half time after
replacement of the
Aortic valve, the MVA is estimated to be between 1.3-1.7 cm2
(moderate MS).
Moderate to severe (3+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen,
with a coanda
wrapping to the posterior wall of the left atrium.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Patient is AV paced, on phenylepherine infusion.
1. Overall biventricular function remains preserved. Septal wall
motion is
consistent with av pacing.
2. Mitral regurgitation appears mild to moderte, mitral stenosis
is unchanged.
3. There is a bioprosthetic arotic valve insitu. There is no
Aortic
insuffiency or stenosis. There is no perivalvular leak.
4. Aortic contours are intact.
5. Remaining exam is
