Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
63 y/o woman with PMH significant for severe COPD O2 dependent
since [**2185**], requiring multiple intubations, OSA, morbid obesity,
CHF with orthopnea, chronic microcytic anemia with baseline of
30, previous episodes of likely GI bleed (melenic stools and
anemia) attributed to NSAIDs gastritis and occurring while on
coumadin for DVT, adrenal insufficiency, HTN. On the occasion of
these presumed bleeds, there was inability to perform endoscopy
at [**Hospital1 **] due to anatomy and inability to lie flat. She thus did not
receive EGD or colonoscopy, but both were planned as outpatient.


This time Ms [**Known lastname **] comes with 3 days SOB, prod cough (greenish
white sputum), generally "feels like COPD" according to patient.
She is also dizzy, + nausea. No CP She denies tarry black
stools, has had no maroon stools, no nausea, vomiting, worsening
of her heartburn, lightheadedness, syncope before the worsening
SOB.

In the ED, she got nebs, trial of bipap which she did not
tolerate, solumedrol for COPD. Also started ctx/levoflox for a
concern of a CXR left sided effusion, and additionally received
40mg IV lasix and her respiratory status improved. Finally, her
Hct was 20; GI aware. Plts 89, usually mid-100s & ordered 2
units of blood. Prior to transfer, VS were HR 96, BP 113/47, RR
27, Sat 97% 6L O2 (uses 3L at home).

CXR: [**2-26**]
markedly low lung volumes and poor penetration. pulmonary
vascular prominence c/w pulmonary edema. Increased hilar
prominence and peri-hilar haziness also c/w picture of pulmonary
edema. Increased opacity in left mid-lung zone which may
represent pneumonia, atelectasis, or asymettrical edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly, stable. No evidence of sizable pelural
effusion or pneumothorax.

EKG: SR nml axis, nml intervals, J point elevated in V2-V3 is

Brief Hospital Course:
63F with COPD, chronic GI bleeding, presents with dyspnea,
productive cough, and hypoxia, as well as Hct 20 and low plts.

#COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary COPD exacerbation secondary
to viral illness due to low temperature, no leukocytosis and
duration of onset. Of note, the patient is on 3 L NC at home.
She was treated with a 5 day course of levaquin which ended on
[**3-1**].  She was also started on a 5 day course of 40 mg of
prednisone which will end on [**3-5**]. Gram stain and cultures show
OP organisms only. She was continued on albuterol nebs, home
Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and leukotriene inhibitor.  She
underwent a TTE yesterday which showed moderate AS with a valve
area between 1-1.2 cm2, so her SOB is unlikely to be secondary
to AS.
The patient was transferred from the MICU to the medicine
service where she continued to clinically improve and in order
to maximize her pulmonary status, the patient was discharged to
pulmonary rehab.
-The patient will benefit from inpatient pulmonary f/u given her
severe obstructive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation,
obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension.
.
#Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed a.fib with RVR while
in the hospital and denies a past history of a-fib.  She was dry
at the time of onset, so she was given IVF and started on 12.5
mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].  She converted back into sinus. Given her
severe underlying pulmonary disease, the patient's metoprolol
was changed to diltiazem.
Given the patient's GI bleed and transient nature of her a-fib,
she was not started on cardioembolic prophylaxis with either
aspirin or coumadin.  This was discussed with the patient.
.
#GI bleed: The patient was found on admission to have a Hct of
20 and guaiac positive stools.  She had a history of GI bleeds
on coumadin.  She was transfused a total of 6 units of PRBC
during her hospitalization and evaluated by GI. She was initally
treated with a PPI gtt until her Hct stabilized.  Her Hct has
been stable for a few days and her stool are guaiac negative.
GI recommended an endoscopy to evaluate for an UGI bleed,
however as this would entail intubation given the patient's body
habitus, the patient wished to choose conservative management
and will not undergo the endoscopy.  She will need monthly Hct
checks as an outpatient. Patient may be iron-deficient with low
MCV (78), although TIBC is high-normal and serum ferritin is
normal.  She was started on iron supplementation started at
325mg PO daily.
.
#Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of ??????not being the
same person she was 8 days ago.?????? She was able to walk across a
room to a commode, but has not been able to do so since her
illness began. Likely due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be
decompensated CHF, or poor sleep due to ICU stay or obesity
hyperventilation/OSA.
PT was consulted and believed that the patient would greatly
benefit from pulmonary rehab.
.
# Abdominal pain/diarrhea: The patient developed crampy
abdominal pain while hospitalized.  This could be due to a
peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the past and would
explain anemia or also be due to C.diff in the setting of recent
diarrhea.  She was continued on the PPI [**Hospital1 **] and stool was sent
for C.diff which is pending.  H. pylori Ab is pending.
.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE which showed a normal
EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).  Also mod plum
hypertension.  Amlodipine was discontinued as beta blocker has
been started and pressures have been stable in the 110??????s
systolic.  Her lasix was initially held due to negative fluid
balance and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
She was started on diltiazem as above and continued on her home
lasix on discharge.
.
# OSA: The patient i
