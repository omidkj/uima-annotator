Chief Complaint:
Patient transferred from an outside hospital for management of
multiple abdominal abscesses

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Abscess Drain placed [**2177-2-18**] at OSH.
2. Drain repositioned on [**2177-2-21**] into abscess cavity.
3. Exploratory Laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, Drainage of
abdominal wall abscess, End left colostomy on [**2177-3-5**]


History of Present Illness:
64M with h/o colon cancer s/p resection [**2175**]. Pt presented to
OSH on [**2177-2-17**] with crampy lower abdominal pain. CT scan on
admission showed pre-sacral 15x50cm fluid collection with foci
of air in collection, an additional [**Hospital1 **]-lobed 5x2.5cm fluid
collection in the R lateral pelvis, as well as a 1cm collection
medial to the pelvic collection. An attempt for CT guided
drainage was made
only yielding a scant amount of fluid. Pt was started on
Imipenem-Cilastatin 250 [**Hospital1 **] on [**2177-2-17**]. On [**2-19**] the pt was
rescanned and a drainage catheter was successfuly placed in one
fluid collection and left to gravity. Drain cultures growing
Gram-negative rods, Gram-positive rods and Gram-positive cocci
per OSH. WBC 21.7 on [**2-17**] down to 15.2 on [**2-18**].

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-2-19**] 9:39 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man with h/o CHF, baseline CXR
FINDINGS: There is moderate hyperelevation of the hemidiaphragms
on both the right and the left side. At the right lung base, the
presence of mild-to-moderate pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. Hypoventilation of the right lung base. On the left,
there is no reliable evidence of pleural effusion. However,
there is also mild hypoventilation in the retrocardiac area. The
visible parts of the cardiac silhouette indicates mild
cardiomegaly. No signs of overhydration, no signs of pneumonia
in the adequately visible parts of the lung parenchyma.
.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2177-2-20**] 12:46 PM
Reason: PO/IV contrast - please evaluate abdominal abscesses
CONCLUSION:
1. Free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis along with several small
collections along the anterior abdominal wall as well as in the
pelvis as described above.
2. Catheter in a presacral nearly completely drained collection.
3. Enlarged nodular left adrenal gland is suggestive of adenoma
and an MRI or non contrast CT could be performed to confirm this
diagnosis.
4. Small atrophic kidneys with cysts.
5. Atelectasis and consolidation at the lung bases with bibasal
effusions.
6. Expansion of the cortex of left femoral shaft with a
ground-glass appearance suggestive of fibrous dysplasia.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-2-20**] at 2:05:16 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal systolic function and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

FISUTLOGRAM INJ THRU SINUS TRACT  [**2177-2-21**] 11:25 AM
Reason: ?fistula
IMPRESSION:
1. Malpositioned pigtail catheter terminated in the ileoanal
pouch. After consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**], the catheter was
exchanged over a wire and repositioned to terminate in the
presacral collection.
2. Multiple additional intra-abdominal abscesses without direct
connection demonstrated to the presacral collection.
3. Unchanged appearance of the bones, with lucent lesion of the
right acetabulum and of the left proximal femur.

POUCHOGRAM  [**2177-2-26**] 3:17 PM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old man s/p j pouch creation for colon ca now with
pelvic abscess
IMPRESSION: A leak posteriorly from the rectum to the area
drained by the catheter with other fistulae demonstrated
posteriorly.
.
Sigmoidoscopy
Date: [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2177-2-28**]
Findings:
 Other The patient is status-post sigmoid resection. The
anastamosis was examined and there was no sign of disease
recurrence. Adjacent to the anasatamosis there was both a blind
pouch (with suture) and a probable fistula with purulent
material (above and to the left on the picture). The colon was
unremarkable on examination to 80cm. There was an raised and
erythematous area on the anal verge.
Impression: The patient is status-post sigmoid resection. The
anastamosis was examined and there was no sign of disease
recurrence. Adjacent to the anasatamosis there was both a blind
pouch (with suture) and a probable fistula with purulent
material (above and to the left on the picture). The colon was
unremarkable on examination to 80cm. There was an raised and
erythematous area on the anal verge.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 80cm
Recommendations: Return to hospital [**Hospital1 **]
