CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and ST myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year-old
woman with known coronary artery disease (ST myocardial
infarction in [**2168**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty in [**2168**], [**2171**] to obtuse marginal one, LCX obtuse
marginal one) with acute onset of right sided chest
discomfort afternoon of presentation, which waxed and waned
for 30 minutes.  Onset of pain was at rest and associated
with diaphoresis, nausea.  No vomiting and no radiations.
The patient states had chills over the last week with a red
swollen right second toe, but no fevers.  In review of
systems she also notes shortness of breath, two pillow
orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion with about ten steps.  In
the Emergency Department she was found to have 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevations in her inferior leads (lead 2, 3 and AVF) and was
taken to catheterization, which showed a 99% stenosis at the
origin of the right posterior descending coronary artery.
This lesion was stented with a 2.25 times 20 mm pixel stent
with resultant 0% residual stenosis and brisk flow.  Left
ventriculography showed posterior basal severe HK, no mitral
regurgitation and left ventricular hypertrophy of
approximately 65%.  Her hemodynamics showed PA pressures of
56/35, wedge of 31, cardiac output of 3.88 and index of 1.86.
During the procedure the patient had transient hypotension
and bradycardia, which responded to Atropine and Dopamine
transiently.  She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit
for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Weight 108.9 kilograms,

saturation 98% 5 liters nasal cannula.  General, obese female
appearing fatigued and in no acute distress.  HEENT slightly
dry mucous membranes.  Neck no JVP.  No bruits.  Lungs faint
rales at bases, distant breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops
appreciated.  Abdomen obese, normoactive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Skin psoriatic patches with
erythema on trunk although on extremities, left wrist/dorsum
hand with swelling/warmth.  Also noted in thenar eminence.
Right second metatarsal and length of second toe with
erythema, edema and warmth, tender to movement, but no skin
breakdown seen.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute,
ST elevations of 2 to 3 mm in leads 2, 3 and AVF with ST
depressions of 1 to 2 mm in lead V2.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CK 94, MB of less then 0.01
rising to CK of 589 with an MB of 11 and index of 8.3%.
Chemistries notable for creatinine of 1.1, white blood cell
count of 20 with 88% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, 2
monocytes, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 481.  TTE in [**2180**]
showed normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities.  [**4-11**] cardiac
catheterization as per history of present illness, also noted
left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex
with mild luminal irregularities.  Right coronary artery with
right posterior descending coronary artery pixel stent 2.25
times 20 mm, RA mean 25, wedge 34, PA 60/36, LVEF 60% with
severe HK of posterior basal wall.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease/ischemia/ST myocardial
infarction:  The patient was taken to the catheterization
laboratory and stent placed with normalization of
electrocardiogram.  Her CK peaked at 1040 with MB of 149
(14.3% MB index) and troponin T of 3.71.  The patient was
medically managed also with aspirin, Plavix, high dose
statin, beta-blocker and ace inhibitor.  During her recovery
period she experienced reinfarction of this area with in
stent rethrombosis.  This was documented by repeat
catheterization showing 100% occlusion of the placed stent in
the right posterior descending coronary artery.  She had
repeat CKs cycled, which peaked at about 300.  At the time of
her repeat infarction that she noted chest pain associated
with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, but became chest
pain free about 30 minutes after.  There was no further
intervention made during her second catheterization given
that the patient was chest pain free and likely had finished
infarcting the area.

2.  Pump issues:  The patient had a TTE on [**4-12**], which showed
EF of 40%, normal left ventricular wall thickness cavity size
and hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior and lateral walls.
She had mild AV and MV thickening, but no aortic
regurgitation or mitral regurgitation.  She was gently
diuresed initially given her elevated wedge pressures, but
maintained euvolemic throughout the remainder of her
admission.

3.  Rhythm:  Immediately after her infarction she was noted o
have several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia,
which were note noted in the subsequent days of her
admission.

4.  Blood pressure issues:  Her blood pressure tolerated her
new cardiac regimen with systolics running 110s to 120s.

5.  Arthritis:  The patient was seen by rheumatology who
tapped her left wrist.  No crystals were seen.  It was
determined that she likely had psoriatic arthritis, but
wrist/foot films are pending.  She was started on low dose
Vioxx with decrease in the signs and symptoms of
inflammation, but with residual tenderness.  She will follow
up with her outpatient rheumatologist at discharge.  Per
rheumatology team her psoriasis was flaring at this time and
this could be the reason for her arthritis on admission.

6.  Psoriasis:  Dermatology was consulted given the patient's
severe pruritus all over her body.  She was started on
steroid ointment with Clobetasol and Dovonex though this was
not available by pharmacy.  She will need close follow up
with outpatient dermatologist and was recommended not to
continue the steroid cream for greater then one month without
evaluation as this could lead to skin breakdown and
superinfection.

7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease:  The patient was
continued on Pantoprazole.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to home with
primary care physician to set up cardiac rehab.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Psoriasis.
6.  Arthritis likely psoriatic.

4.  Sarna lotion prn.
5.  Atorvastatin 80 mg po q.d.
6.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q.d.
7.  Toprol XL 50 mg po q.d.
8.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg prn up to three tablets

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will call primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for appointment in the next week.  She
has an appointment with him also on [**4-27**] and an appointment
