None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 13276**] is a Russian-speaking [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/ CAD, CLL
(baseline WBC's 20s), CHF who p/w increasing SOB, fever and
cough. Per the pt's daughter, the pt began to complain of SOB 1
day PTA, with intermittent cough X 2 months. She was seen in the
ED in [**Month (only) **], had a CXR performed which was negative for PNA. On
the morning of admission, the daughter noted that her mother was
not "acting like herself", refused to eat breakfast, and was
complaining of feeling hot and not being able to breathe. On the
day of admission, the pt continued to feel SOB and hot while
standing, became pale, and fell to the floor. No head trauma or
LOC. The daughter then called EMS.
Denies recent sick contacts, increase in salt in diet. The
daughter does report the pt's LEs have been more swollen over
the past few days and called her PCP who instructed the pt to
take 1 [**1-16**] pills of Lasix (for total of 120 mg po) on the
morning of admission. At baseline, the pt experiences chest pain
which is relieved by a nitro patch and is able to walk short
distances slowly in her daughter's apt without feeling SOB. The
pt was recently treated for a UTI with a 5 day Cipro course. ROS
negative for recent headaches, dizziness, abdominal pain, n/v/d,
dysuria, urinary frequency.
.
In ED, her vital signs were T104.3 BP 99/43 P138 R25 93% on RA.
She appeared hypovolemic and was given 2L NS. CXR w/ CHF and ?
pneumonia. Patient started on vanco/ceftriaxone/azithromycin.
She was also found to have anemia and received 1u PRBC. She
complained of chest pain, probably due to demand ischemia, with
transient 1mm STD's noted on lateral leads of EKG, which
resolved on f/u EKG, as did her CP within an hour.

urine culture: klebsiella oxytoca
blood cultures: no growth
CXR:
Stable appearance of the chest without acute pulmonary process

TTE:Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No MR seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2163-9-20**], the LV function appears to
have improved.

Renal ultrasound:
CONCLUSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts. No hydronephrosis or
calculi. Markedly enlarged spleen with an area of increased
echogenicity. Although IV contrast usage would likely be
difficult in this patient with renal failure, but a CT scan or
MRI suggested for delineating anatomy in the upper abdomen.

EKG: sinus tachycardia, IVCD with poor R wave progession, [**Street Address(2) 11342**] depressions in I, avL, V6 that subsequently resolved 1 hr
later.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Her blood pressure stabilized and her mental status
improved, allowing transfer to the floor in stable condition [**8-17**]
9 PM.  Echo [**8-17**] showed normal LVEF >55% with normal LV size and
no significant valvular disease (some aortic valve leaflet
thickening).

[**Age over 90 **]yo female h/o CAD, CHF, CLL, CRI presented with fevers,
lymphocytosis, cough, increased SOB, and hypotension.

1) SOB: On further eval of CXR, pt believed to have increased
opacity in LLL.  Blood cultures were no growth.  Pt had lateral
ST changes in ED but cardiac enzymes remained negative, so
believed from strain.  No other events.  Pt given 9 days of
antibiotics  (levofloxacin 250mg qday as renal function
improved) with plan to complete 10 days total.  Pt continued to
have cough.  Given albuterol/atrovent nebs and cough suppression
with some relief.

2) UTI: Pt's urine grew klebsiella.  Treated with levofloxacin
as well.

3) Hypotension: Believed secondary to dehydration and infection.
 Improved with hydration.  BP medications initially held and
eventually added back.

4) CLL: WBC elevated here to 30s.  Baseline reportedly in the
20s.  On aranesp as an outpatient.  Pt's hematocrit was around
26.  With h/o CAD goal Hct closer to 30.  Pt consented and
received 1 U PRBCs with increase to 28.6.  Pt denied any
symptomatic improvement.

5) Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's baseline Cr
1.2-1.4; on admission was 1.9.  Improved with hydration to 1.2.
Renal ultrasound showed bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of
obstruction or hydro.

6) Aflutter/CAD: Initially medications held.  Now back on
diltiazem, disopyramide, ASA.  Pt also on lasix 80mg qday.  BP
well controlled with these agents.  Spoke with patient's VNA who
reported patient has had cough with lisinopril previously, so
will not restart.  Also will hold doxazosin as blood pressure
well controlled.  If patient does need another [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the
future, might consider [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  No beta blocker as has
stimulated bronchospasm in past.

7) Derm: Pt has numerous moles over body; dermatology was asked
to evaluate.  Believed lesion in L lower abdomen was seborrheic
keratosis.  Lesion R lat upper calf: diff dx incls blue nevus,
combined nevus, or possibly evoling neoplasm.  Deep shave biopsy
done; can follow up as outpatient.  Also given Penlac for
toenail fungus, to be applied once daily.

8) FEN: Patient's potassium was well maintained without
supplement.
