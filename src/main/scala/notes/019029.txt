non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2130-11-22**] with the following findings.  A right-dominant
circulation with severe 3-vessel disease.  The left main
coronary artery was free of flow-limiting narrowing.  The
left anterior descending artery was 60% occluded with tandem
lesions in the medial segment and an 80% distal stenosis.
The first diagonal had a 50% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex had an 80% distal stenosis.  The right coronary
artery had a 60% proximal narrowing, 70% tandem lesions in
the medial vessel, and 90% distal stenosis.  The patient had
markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures.  The patient
was also noted to have mild inferior hypokinesis with an
overall preserved ejection fraction of 62%.

The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital1 190**] and returned on [**2130-11-29**] for surgery.
