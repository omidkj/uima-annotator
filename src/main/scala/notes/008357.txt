Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
enlarging vegetation on tricuspid valve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tricuspid valve vegectomy


History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with history of recurrent prosthetic
tricuspid valve endocarditis with remote repair of tricuspid
valve, tricuspid valve replacement at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2169**] and most
recently a redo tricuspid valve replacement in [**2169**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue valve in [**2184**] for MSSA and Enterococcal prosthetic valve
endocarditis.
.
She was admitted in early [**2188-11-16**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**]
tricuspid prosthetic valve endocarditis with pulmonary embolic
phenomena. She was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] [**11-18**], with
respiratory distress and found to have multiple pulmonary septic
emboli on CT scan and tricuspid valve vegetations on ECHO. She
was in shock at the time of transfer. Blood cultures drawn on
[**11-18**] grew GPC and yeast(GPC ultimately found to be CONS
contaminant) and she was started onto echinocandin therapy on
[**2188-11-19**]. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing
managment. At the time of transfer, she was on echinocandin
therapy alone as her antifungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and was persistently
fungemic. She was transitioned to ambisome on [**11-20**] as monotherapy
and then micafungin was added back on [**11-29**]. Her fungemia
quenched on [**2188-11-29**]. She was on ambisome and micafungin from
[**Date range (1) 59965**] and then was subsequently transitioned to micafungin
monotherapy on [**12-13**] soon after discharge to rehab. During this
admission, she was determined to be a non-operative candidate.
.
Her echo on [**2188-12-4**] revealed a 1.8 x 1.1 cm tricuspid
vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation. At rehab, she
had a persistent oxygen requirement prompting chest film. When
abnormalities were noted on that study, she had a CT scan of the
chest done on [**2189-1-7**] which revealed a question of possible
new cavitary lesion related to ? possible new septic emboli when
the CT was compared with the initial CT done at [**Hospital3 3583**]
on [**2188-11-18**].
.
Plan was for patient to have ECHO on day of admission followed
by appointment
in [**Hospital **] clinic. Due to transport issues, patient was unable to
make
it to [**Hospital **] clinic appointment. Given the findings of increased
size
of vegetation(4.9 cm in greatest dimention) on todays ECHO in
the
context of her overall clinical status and findings on chest CT,
decision made to transport to ER from ECHO for admission. At the
time IDs recommendations were:
-mycolytic and routine blood cultures(multiple sets)
-Continue Micafungin 100 mg IV Q 24 hours
-Would add liposomal amphoterocin B at 5 mg/kg/day
-Evaluation by Cardiology and Cardiothoracic surgical services
-Would consult ID for further detail regarding evaluation and
treatment plan
.
In the ED, initial VS were 100 84 98/56 16 100% 6L Nasal Cannula

As per call-in by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7443**] (pager [**Numeric Identifier 59966**])Pt was attending outpt
echo from [**Hospital 59967**] rehab hosp, + SOB. 62 year old female with
chief complaint of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] endocarditis, now with
persistent oxygen requirement, worsened chest CT and worsening
tricuspid vegetation on most recent echo on micafungin.Needs
admission to start onto combination salvage antifungal therapy
and reconsideration of cardiothoracic surgical intervention

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
ECHO ([**1-30**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The coronary sinus is dilated
(diameter >15mm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. A bioprosthetic tricuspid
valve is present with thickened leaflets and increased gradient.
There is a moderate size (7mm) long mobile
echodensity/vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Mild tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shad
