metal

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
mechanical fall, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2159-7-9**] - Open reduction and internal fixation left distal
radius fracture 2 or more fragments. Open reduction and internal
fixation left ulnar fracture. Open carpal tunnel release left
arm.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year-old Female with a PMH significant for COPD
(baseline 90-92% without home oxygen), RA (treated with
methotrexate, prednisone) who is s/p mechanical fall with
contact to the left wrist at her rehabilitation facility
(treated for pneumonia recently) this morning. Her fall was
witnessed, without LOC, and she was noted to have evidence of
deformity on left wrist examination. She denies neck pain or
head injury. She was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] [**2159-7-9**],
the morning of admission, for orthopaedic surgery evaluation
given she had radiographic evidence of a 1 to 2-cm displaced,
left distal radius and ulna fracture with parathesias, which was
concerning for median nerve impingement.
.
In the ED, VS 97.6 83 136/70 18 86% 4L. She was triggered for
hypoxia given that her oxygen saturations dropped to the 70%
range on room air, this responded to supplemental oxygen. She
was not tolerating BiPAP in the ED. EKG demonstrated multifocal
atrial tachycardia. She was given albuterol-ipratropium nebs,
methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 given concern for COPD
exacerbation. She was empirically given Azithromycin 500 mg IV,
Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Vancomycin 1 g IV x 1. The patient
also received Ativan 2 mg IV once. A CXR showed evidence of
hyperinflation consistent with her known COPD-emphysema, with
opacification in the LLL concerning for PNA with L > R bilateral
pleural effusions. She was seen by Orthopaedic surgery who felt
there was concern for median nerve impingement, opted for closed
reduction with splinting in the ED with plans to bring her to
the OR. She underwent medical optimization in the ED in
preparation for her procedure.
.
Currently, she is without complaints and is preparing to
transport to pre-op holding. She denies dyspnea or productive
cough. She is reclined flat without trouble breathing. She
denies fevers or chills.

IMAGING:
[**2159-7-9**] WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT - post-reduction film - fractures
involving the distal radius and ulna with persistent
displacement. Distal radial fracture fragment abuts the lunate
and displaces
the scaphoid, thereby distorting the proximal carpal row.
.
[**2159-7-9**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Hyperinflation reflects
obstructive lung disease, probably emphysema. Dense
opacification in the left lower lobe, obscuring the left
hemidiaphragm is pneumonia or, less likely atelectasis. Small
bilateral pleural effusion is greater on the left. There is no
pneumothorax.
.
[**2159-7-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON - No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. Bilateral left more than right small-to-moderate
pleural effusion. Lingular atelectasis most likely due to
secretions and unlikely to represent infectious process. Minimal
bibasilar atelectasis. Endobronchial secretions in particular in
the lower lobes. Coronary calcifications, hemodynamical
significance is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] rib fractures. Compression fracture
of the mid thoracic vertebral body, chronicity undetermined.
They are better appreciated on the sagittal reformats as
compared to chest radiograph. Severe emphysema. Minimal
outpouching of the left ventricular apex might be consistent
with small apical aneurysm, please correlate with prior history
of myocardial infarction.
