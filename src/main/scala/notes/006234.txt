Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, CAD, diabetes and
peripheral vascular disease with LE ulcerations presenting with
nausea and generalized weakness.  The patient's overall health
and functional status have been declining over the last [**4-29**]
weeks, described by the family as decrease in walking due to
sense of instability, difficulty with stairs, difficulty
writing, insomnia and general tiredness, including falling
asleep during ADLs and frequently during the day.  Her
cognition, in general, has been intact until recently when her
family has noted mild clouding.

Her brother passed away three days ago and the patient was able
to travel to the funeral in [**Hospital1 789**].  Per her family, she has
been eating and drinking normally, and taking her medications.
She complains of leg pain and pain in her bottom.  On the day of
admission, she was in her most recent normal state of health.
She ate breakfast and took all her pills. She tried to have a BM
prior to a lunch party and was unable to get off the commode.
She complained of nausea, shortness of breath and dizziness.
Her family notes that she was particularly fatigued after this
and would fall asleep while speaking.  They called her PCP who
recommended she come to the ED for evaluation. She normally sits
on the toilet for 1-2 hours per day, and did this today, but
when she went to get up she felt weak, nauseated and slightly
short of breath.  She presented to the ED for evaluation.

In the ED, vitals were:  98.8 58 110/70 18 100.  Laboratory
evaluation revealed a potassium of 2.8 for which she received 40
mEq KCl, an indeterminate troponin, CRI at baseline renal
function, and a leukocytosis with marked bandemia.  She was
found to have cellulitis associated with chronic LE ulcerations
and was treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  CXR and UA
were unrevealing for sources of infection.  She was found to
have brown, trace guaiac positive stool.  While awaiting a bed
on the medicine floor, the patient's heart rate dipped to 39.
ECG obtained revealed a junctional rhythm.  Her blood pressure
varied between SBP 90 to SBP 170.  Her HR stabilized in a sinus
bradycardia with rate in 40s (without intervention).  Her mental
status remained stable. She complained of some back pain.  It
was reported that the patient was sleeping at the time of the
bradycardia.  She was given 1 L NS at 200 cc/hr and 1 L NS with
40 mEq KCl at 150 cc/hr.

Per HHA, right leg erythema and ankle wound new over last
several days. Other LE changes stable.

Resp: crackles 1/3 up bilaterally, no wheeze, no ronchi
Abd: + BS, s/nt/nd

Pertinent Results:
Admission Labs:

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart
failure.

RUQ Ultrasound: Slightly limited study, but no sign of biliary
ductal dilatation. Pulsatile flow in the portal [**Hospital3 5703**] could
suggest a degree of right heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 22152**] was admitted for generalized weakness and nausea but
taken to the medical ICU because of an incidental finding of
bradycardia in the emergency department.
 After holding her home dose of beta blocker for less than
twenty-four hours, she was transferred to the floor.

# Gram Positive Bacteremia:
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 22152**] was found to have Gram Positive Bacteremia,
identified as corynebacterium stratium.  Portal of entry was
likely skin/soft tissue.  Due to prolonged QTc and bradycardia
on admission and transfer to the floor, she was evaluated for
Diphtherial infection with toxin-induced myocarditis and placed
on droplet precautions.
    Patient had not received an updated TDap immunization as an
outpatient, and she is somewhat immunocompromised due to her age
and her chronically uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, but she was
thought to have very unlikely exposure to diphtheria. Patient
states that she has had no pharyngeal symptoms in the past
month. Per family, she has had a cough which is only associated
with difficulty swallowing. Diphtherial toxoid tests were drawn
from the serum, and a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for culture
and sent to the [**Hospital3 14659**] for diagnosis.

A Transthoracic Echo was done, which showed no signs of valvular
vegetations or endocarditis.

    Patient was initiated on intravenous penicillin therapy for
the bacteremia, which would empirically cover diphtherial
infection as well as other species of Corynebacterium; when
culture results showed only intermediate sensitivity to
penicillin, patient was started on intravenous vancomycin
therapy, which is to be continued at a therapeutic level for two
weeks, counting day 1 as [**2144-7-19**].
This was presently being dosed ever 48 hours given her clearance
less than 30cc/min.

Patient was followed by Infectious Disease team, who stated that
there was no indication for diphtheria anti-toxin due to the low
possibility of a diphtheria diagnosis and the dangerous
potential for serum sickness if given. The ID team recommended
also that she get repeat blood cultures after finishing course
of antibiotics to ensure they are negative; otherwise,
Transesophageal Echo and treatment for endocarditis could be
considered but would involve additional risk. Droplet
precautions for possible diphtheria were removed prior to
discharge because of the extremely low likelihood of the patient
having the specific illness.

#. Gastrointestinal Bleed, likely gastritis
The patient developed semi-formed melenotic stools during
admission. She was briefly anticoagulated during part of her
stay, but this occured following cessation. She required
