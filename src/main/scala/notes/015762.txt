Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for pleurex catheter placement for drainage of left
pleural effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Placement of pleurex catheter
- Placement and removal of chest tube
- Placement and removal of right internal jugular central line
- Placement and removal of Swanz catheter
- Pericardial window and pericardial drain placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11707**] is a 66 year old woman with history of metastatic
breast cancer (diagnosed [**2175**], history below) who presented on
[**2186-5-9**] (two days prior to transfer) for left-sided VATS with
subsequent pleurex catheter placement for recurrent presumed
malignant left-sided pleural effusions. She reports that she
first developed shortness of breath several months  ago ([**Month (only) 216**]
[**2184**]) and was found to have a left-sided pleural effusion, and
she underwent thoracentesis; subsequent cytologic analysis
showed malignant cells consistent with known adenocarcinoma. The
shortness of breath had improved temporarily but recurred within
several weeks; the pleural effusion had reaccumulated. She was
admitted on [**5-9**] after successful thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy,
and placement of a Pleurex catheter.

During the admission, she was noted to be in and out of atrial
fibrillation, alternating from tachycardia to sinus bradycardia,
and with systolic blood pressures in the 70's - 90's. Cardiology
was consulted and recommended increasing the beta blocker while
holding lisinopril and Lasix. Given the tachycardia and
hypotension, an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating large
pericardial effusion and evidence of RV collapse. She went for
pericardiocentesis on [**5-10**]. Drainage from the pericardium was
initially brisk but then slowed down and stopped as of 6pm on
[**5-10**]. She was loaded with amiodarone. The morning of [**5-11**], she
continued to be hypotensive. Echo showed small anteroapical
pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. Her creatinine
was noted to be increasing (from 1.4 to 1.9 to 2.3) with
continued hypotension despite multiple fluid boluses (totaling
~2L). She is transferred to the CCU for further management.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

She denies chest pain (other than at the site the pericardial
drain), dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dizziness, syncope, PND, orthopnea.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING

EKG on admission to hospital demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
64bpm with no ischemic changes; after procedure with

TELEMETRY demonstrated: Atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response.

HEMODYNAMICS: CVP 18, transduced through CVL.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2186-5-9**] demonstrated:  LV
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). RV
cavity is small. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. There is a large pericardial
effusion 2.8cm. RV diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology. Compared with the prior study of
[**2186-3-21**], the pericardial effusion is larger with some evidendce
of RV collapse. The left ventricular systolic function is
similar.

[**2186-5-10**] Cardiac Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pericardial effusion with hemodynamic evidence of tamponade
physiology.
2.  Successful pericardiocentesis, with drainage of 460 mL
bloody
drainage and resolution of pericardial effusion (drain left in
place).

[**2186-5-10**] Pericardial Fluid:
Positive for malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma.

[**2186-5-11**] ECHO:
LV systolic function appears depressed. There is a small
primarily anteroapical pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2186-5-13**] ECHO:
LV systolic function appears depressed. Tricuspid regurgitation
is present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension
