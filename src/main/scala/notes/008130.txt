Radiology Report CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2166-5-31**] 3:00
AM

IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex
with decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of
pneumonia.
.
Chest CT [**2166-5-31**]:
thoracic spine without focal osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe,
likely from
aspiration.
2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without
diaphragmatic defect.
3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle
lobe (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT
torso of [**2165-10-24**], however followup in one year by CT is
recommended.
4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4
cm apparent
cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
placement. This
lesion is not well characterized on this study, though is most
suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well
characterized by
non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient
is a potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month
follow-up CT could be performed.
7) Severe scoliosis.

[**6-2**] Portable CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Hypoxia and tachypnea.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2166-5-31**].

There is no significant change in the very high position of left
hemidiaphragm
with slightly improved aeration of the remaining not atelectatic
part of the
left upper lung. The right costophrenic angle was not included
in the field
of view but the imaged portion of the right lung demonstrates no
significant
abnormalities. Significant thoracolumbar scoliosis is unchanged.
The patient
is after insertion of IVC filter. The presence of motion
artifact degrades
the quality of the study making the precise diagnosis of the
fine details
impossible. If clinically warranted repeated radiograph is
recommended.

1. Cough: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic on
presentation to floor. Unclear whether could be unresolved pna,
