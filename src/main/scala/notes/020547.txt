History of Present Illness:
85F with CAD s/p PCI, AFib on coumadin, breast CA s/p radical
mastectomy, recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 100413**] for cough and
dyspnea due to a left pleural effusion and pericardial effusion
complicated by pericardial tamponade. Underwent
pericardiocentesis [**10-16**] with removal of 400 cc serosanguineous
fluid - WBC 2778 (86%PMN 6% lymph 8% mono) Hct 2.0 Tprot 5.1
gluc 105 LDH 461 amylase 24 albumin 2.7. Pericardial drain
placed but removed prior to discharge. Left-sided thoracentesis
[**10-17**] with removal of 600 cc fluid - WBC 660 (11% PMN 5% lymph
77% macro 4% reactive mesothelial cells) RBC 470 Tprot 3.5
(serum total protein 5.3) gluc 97 LDH 88 (serum LDH 153).
Cultures from these sites have been no growth to date and
cytology from both taps was negative for malignant cells.
Referred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU for acute dyspnea and markedly
diminished breath sounds on the left. ABG on NRB 7.42/58/189/37.
Diverted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital temporarily for hypotension and
hypoxemia (BP and O2sat not documented). Stabilized then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96.7 HR 71 SBP 105 RR 22 O2sat100%NRB.
WBC# 22.1 (from 25.9 on [**10-24**]) with 92% PMN, Hct 23.9 (27.4 on
[**10-24**]), INR 3.8, lactate 1.2, Na 127, K 5.9, Cl 89, CO2 34, BUN
32, Cr 2.1. EKG showed sinus with 1st degree AV conduction delay
and old inferiolateral T-wave inversions, but no QRS
prolongation or peaked T-waves. CXR showed complete
opacification of the left hemithorax without mediastinal shift,
and a small to moderate right pleural effusion. Non-contrast
chest CT showed left lung collapse and simple pleural effusion
and increased pericardial effusion since [**10-19**]. Bedside U/S
reportedly showed a circumferential effusion but no evidence of
tamponade. BP nadir 87/40, given 500 cc NS bolus, improved to
101/50. Given vancomycin 1 g, zosyn 4.5 g IV, 1 amp D50, 10U
regular insulin, 1 amp CaGluc. Thoracic surgery consulted, plan
for thoracentesis vs. pigtail catheter when coagulopathy
corrected, as well as for possible VATS pericardial window &
talc pleurodesis on [**10-28**]. Cardiology consulted but repeat
pericardiocentesis deferred. Vital signs prior to transfer 97.2
86 110/51 19 100% on 100%NRB.
.
Upon arrival in the MICU, patient is without complaints.
Endorses shortness of breath with minimal exertion and cough

palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, edema,
or rash.

Reports:

EKG ([**10-26**]): Normal sinus rhythm. Non-specific T wave changes in
I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6.Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2120-10-17**], except for slowing of the rate and a change from
atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, there is no
diagnostic interval change.

Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
70 188 84 380/397 -9 41 -122

CT chest ([**10-26**]):
1. Complete collapse of the left lung with interval increase in
moderate to
large left- sided pleural effusio. Possible mucus plugging in
distal
left-sided bronchi; although underlying obstructive bronchial/
peribronchial mass is not excluded and follow-up study is
suggested.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
3. Increased pericardial effusion. Small amount of pericardial
air likely
secondary to recent pericardial fluid drainage. Clinical
correlation is
recommended.
4. Dilated ascending aorta again seen, not optimally evaluated
given lack of IV contrast.
5. Stable compression deformities of the thoracic spine.

Echo ([**10-27**]):
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated . Left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is a small, primarily
anterior partially echofilled space c/w an organized pericardial
effusion.. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-24**],
the effusion is slightly/minimally larger but without evidence
of hemodynamic compromise.

Immunotyping of pleural fluid ([**10-30**]): Non-specific T cell
dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features
of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation
with clinical findings is recommended. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

Pleural fluid samples: All samples had no malignant cells. They
appeared reactive in nature.

Echo ([**11-8**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
trivial/physiologic posterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings
of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-28**], no
major change is evident.

Pelvic U/S ([**11-8**]): IMPRESSION: 3.1 cm adnexal simple cyst,
slightly increased in size from the prior CT, but with no other
concerning features.

Chest xray ([**11-11**]): IMPRESSION:
PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since
[**10-29**], most
recently [**11-7**]:

Small residual left pleural effusion change. Severe left lower
lobe atelectasis changed in distribution, and probably worsened
since [**11-7**]. The right pleural effusion may be present.
Atelectasis at the right lung base is milder than the left and
improved since [**11-7**]. Right upper lobe is clear. The
axilla partially obscured, probably unchanged. Thoracic aorta is
large and calcified but also stable.
