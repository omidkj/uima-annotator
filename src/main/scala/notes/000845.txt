Chief Complaint:
stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
67 yo woman with DM, HTN, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] initially admitted
to Neurology for stridor, now being transferred to the MICU for
continued management of stridor.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 89696**] for
management of a myasthenic crisis.  During that admission, the
patient was in the Neuro ICU.  She was intubated for eight days
during that stay.  She was treated with plasmapheresis and
immunomodulators, cellcept, mesthinon and prednisone.  Her
symptoms improved and she was discharged to rehab.  She was
discharged from rehab on Saturday and felt in her normal state
of health until Tuesday night.   On Tuesday, she felt acutely
short of breath.
.
In the ED, ENT was consulted who was able to rule out upper
respiratory source of stridor.  They thought that she had
evidence of mild edema from reflux.  She was admitted to the
Neuro service for observation.  She was treated with racemic
epinephrine, however did not have complete relief.   As her
stridor did not improve, Pulmonary was consulted.  They were
concerned about her respiratory status and thought she should be
monitored more closely in the MICU.
.
Before the patient arrived in the MICU, a CT neck/chest was
performed which showed evidence of severe tracheal narrowing
distal to the vocal cords.  She feels persistent dyspnea, worse
with expiration.
.

CHEST XRAY IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
CT TRACHEA
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal, fixed stenosis of the trachea at the level of the
thoracic inlet as characterized above.
2. Secretions in the right main stem bronchus as well as in the
right lower lobe bronchus, with resultant air trapping in the
right lower lobe.
3. Coronary arterial calcification.




Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
67 yo female with history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], DM, HTN, HLD,
Glaucoma and cataracts with recent hospitalization for MG crisis
s/p intubation, admitted for stridor, found to have significant
tracheal narrowing.  Underwent ballowing for tracheal narrowing.
 Pt was discussed with neurology attending Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9485**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
who agreed to coordinate follow up during a rapid prednisone
taper in preparation of reconstructive tracheal surgery in the
near future. Pt was ultimately scheduled to follow-up in
musculoskeletal neurology clinic for management of taper.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
#  Tracheal Narrowing:  Likely secondary to intubation during
recent hospitalization.  The patient's symptoms improved with
heliox, likely because of improvement in turbulent flow.  IP
consulted and took patient to OR she was foujnd to have tracheal
narrowing to 5mm. Balloon dilation was completed post procedure
diameter was 1.2cm. Her stridor returned with exertion the
following day. A second bronchoscopy revealed 1.0cm and stable.
Her stridor was stable for the duration of the hospital stay.
Combined follow-up with IP and thoracic surgery arranged for 2
weeks post discharge for discussion of recontructive surgery. A
rapid prednisone taper was initiated to prepare for surgery.
.
#  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]:  Well controlled after recent crisis.
Continued on prednisone, Mycophenolate Mofetil 500 mg PO BID,
Pyridostigmine Bromide 60 mg PO/NG Q6H, (per neurology will need
to be on this medication for prolonged period of time until
cellcept is therapeutic). Prednisone was tapered in preparation
for future surgery. Follow-up with outpatient neurology was
arranged to manage medication therapy in setting of recent
crisis and plan for prednisone taper.

#  HLD:  Continued Pravastatin 10 mg PO DAILY
.
#  DM:  Continued metformin and insulin, when restart diet will
