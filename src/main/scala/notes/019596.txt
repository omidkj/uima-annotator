three flight of stairs. He is sleeping with one pillow and
denies LE edema.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-12-9**] 8:06 PM
IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly. Similar appearance of pacemaker
device. No significant interval change.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  [**2177-12-9**] 1:23 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely acute fracture at the base of the fifth metatarsal.
Would correlate with point tenderness in this region when the
patient is examined.
2. Angulation and evidence of prior fracture at the distal shaft
of the fifth metatarsal.

[**2177-12-10**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed with aneurysmal basal
to mid infero-lateral and inferior walls. The antero-septum and
anterior walls appear to contract well (the apex is not well
seen) No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2177-6-26**], the overall LVEF has probably
improved and the severity of TR detected has decreased.

.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2177-12-14**] 12:15 PM
FINDINGS: There is no significant change in the marked
cardiomegaly or the dual lead pacemaker with defibrillator lead.
There has been slight interval progression in the right-sided
patchy alveolar infiltrate that could represent asymmetric edema
or infection.
IMPRESSION: Slight worsening in right-sided infiltrate.
.
[**12-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
Improving asymmetrical pulmonary edema, left basilar atelectasis
and left effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yom h/o DCM, cardiac arrest and Ventricular tachycardia
presents to ED after recurrent sudden LOC with ICD shocks ~4
times. Course complicated by increased O2 requirements.
.
## Increased Respiratory Requirements:
Initially admitted to the CCU for the VT/defibrillation. After
short stay on floor, readmitted to CCU for possible CPAP however
only needed non-rebreather and was transferred back to the floor
on nasal cannula.
.
Felt to be due to pneumonia - CAP vs nosocomial PNA. Covered
with broad spectrum antibiotics. Started on zosyn and
azithromycin [**12-15**]. Will finish 12 day total course of abx.
Changed to PO levoquin upon discharge.
-Continue diuresis with home dose of PO Lasix 60mg QAM.
-Continued coumadin for goal INR between 2.0 and 3.0.
.
- Patient steadily improved with respect to his O2 requirements
over the last 4 days of his hospitalization. He was switched
from a shovel mask to nasal cannula and was comfortable on 3L
and able to ambulate on this O2 requirement without dyspnea.
Afebrile and blood, urine culture data negative.
.
CARDIAC
## Ischemia:
Continued on [**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Coreg 3.125 [**Hospital1 **]. Switched to
captopril 12.5 TID for easier titration while in house and
resumed on home dose lisinopril 5mg PO QD prior to discharge.
.
## pump:
Continued coumadin for goal INR [**2-6**] for low EF/hx of afib.
Continue PO lasix upon discharge.
.
## rhythm: Slow VT (130's). In ED, VT 130 bpm -> ATP failed ->
18J shock successful.
Electrophysiology service was consulted and continued to follow
the patient throughout his hospitalization. He was loaded with
lidocaine in ED requiring dopamine drip initially. Dopamine drip
was rapidly weaned off and patient switched from lidocaine drip
to mexiletine 150mg PO Q8hrs. During hospital stay, no
recurrence of episodes of VT/syncope. Aggressive lyte repletion
with potassium goal of 4.5. Serial EKGs were checked and patient
was monitored on telemetry. Discharged on mexilitine and
amiodarone.
- INR goal [**2-6**]
.
## Hypothyroid: Continued synthroid.
.
## Prostrate cancer: s/p TURP on monthly lupron injxns
.
## Left ankle fracture after a fall ([**2177**])/now R metatarsal fx:
tylenol for pain. Orhtopedics was consulted. No operative
intervention indicated. Walking boot to assist in ambulation.
.
## CRF: Baseline Cr: 1.6-1.8
.
## FEN
- heart healthy, low Na diet
- aggressive electrolyte repletion -> K goal of 4.5
.
## PPx
- therapeutic on coumadin
- bowel regimen
.
## Code
- patient was full code in house
