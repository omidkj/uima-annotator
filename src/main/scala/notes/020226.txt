Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Pacer infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-5-31**] removal of ICD generator
[**2164-6-3**] removal of biventricular leads


History of Present Illness:
51 y.o. with familial non ischemic cardiomyopathy , HTN, AF,
with heart block s/p BIV pacer with gen change on [**2164-5-4**]. By
reports fromt he OSH, his EF was initially 35% which improved to
normal following BiV. Sent home with keflex post gen change.
Apparently the patient developed some loose stools and stopped
takign the keflex.
.
Presented back to RI on [**5-28**] with fever, rigors, hypokalemia,
creat of 1.8, and pacer pocket draining small amt of serous/sang
from medial aspect of incision.
.
A TEE was reportedly neg for veg. On evenign prior to transfer
patient developed a fever to 102 and rigors. HR to 150 with
telemetry showign widecomplex tachycardia. Out of concern for VT
he was Lidocaine 100mg x2, Amiodarone 300mg x2 and received a
125j DCCV with premedication with versed with no effect. Then
they evaluated an old EKG which showed preexisting LBBB. His
rhythm was then classified as SVT with abberency. They gave him
6mg adenosine followed by another 12mg with no effect. They then
gave him 5 mg lopressor which slowed the rhythm to 120's. He was
started on vanc and zosyn. Blood cultures from admission grew
out GNRs in 2 out of 2 bottles and wound culture from his pacer
site grew out GNR as well.
.
Patient was also noted to have thrombocytopenia with platelets
of 100 on admission trending down to 61 by HD #3. He received no
heparin products while at the OSH on this admission. Prior
heparin my have been given several weeks ago during his
generator change. He also had reported anemia with Hct down
trending from 38.2 to 32.1 to 30.6. Work up was notable for
normal retic count, elevated LDH, Elevated haptoglobin, negative
direct coombs, elevated D-dimer, elevated fibrinogen adn normal
coag panel. At time of transfer he was reportedly feeling well
and HD stable.
.
On arrival to the ICU he was febrile to 103 and rigoring with HR
in the 150-180. He had two tenuous PIVs. He became acutely
delirious with severe agitation and combativness and refused
placement of peripheral IVs. His HR remained elevated and was
wide complex and regular/irregular with intermittent pacing
consistent with SVT with abberency. He was HD stable. Patient
was given 5mg IV lopressor x1 with correction of his HR to
160's, also received 1G IV tylenol through one remaining
peripheral and 0.5mg of IV ativan. With the assistance of the
CVIC intensivist a 16 guage PIV was placed in his left forearm
and he was bolues 1L LR. His HR and mental status normalized
significantly. He was given 1G IV vancomycin and 500mg Meropenam
IV. The EP fellow was contancted to discuss the possibility of
emergency explantation for source control. Given his improved
clinical status and HD stability the explantation was scheduled
for first thing in the morning.
.
Central access was discussed with the patient but he adamently
refused. We were able to obtain excellent peripheral access and
clinical stabilization and improvement so no further access is
being sought at this time.

PERTINENT REPORTS:
[**2164-5-30**] CXR: Biventricular pacemaker is demonstrated with the
leads terminating in right atrium, right ventricle and
epicardial location of the left ventricle.  No definitive
interruption of the pacemaker leads is demonstrated, but
proximal lead to the pacemaker battery, there is questionable
irregularity in the defibrillator lead that should be further
assessed with dedicated radiographs and lateral views as well.
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are
essentially clear except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
Mild degree of volume overload cannot be excluded.  No
appreciable pneumothorax is seen.

[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to
be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
TEE performed for ICD lead extraction. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defe
