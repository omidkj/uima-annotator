Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25288**] is a 76-year-old
gentleman, with a history of prior coronary artery bypass
grafting in [**2126**] with subsequent stenting, and a history of
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of
approximately 25%.  His medical history also includes carotid
disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco history,
ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus.  He was admitted on [**2-16**],
the day prior to assessment as an outpatient to evaluate and
assess his exercise tolerance testing which was abnormal.  A
cardiac cath showed severe AS with an aortic valve area of
0.76 cm2, LVEDP 32, 90% left main, 100% LAD, 100% circumflex,
100% right lesion.  Vein graft to the RCA had a 50% stenosis.
The LIMA was patent.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] of
CT surgery for consideration of redo coronary artery bypass
grafting and aortic valve replacement.

The patient had recently reported an increased level of
fatigue.  He is exhausted after short periods of activity.
He had no chest pain, or dyspnea, but the picture also
included significant limb claudication bilaterally.

EXAM:  He was alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
He was neurologically intact with no JVD or bruits, but a
cardiac murmur from his aortic valve transmitted to bilateral
carotid arteries.  He had a grade III-IV/VI systolic ejection
murmur.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  He had well-healed midline scars.
His pedal pulses were nonpalpable but his feet were warm.

PREOP LABS:  White count 5.6, hematocrit 37.0, platelet count
139,000, sodium 137, K 4.0, chloride 103, bicarb 27, BUN 28,
creatinine 1.8, blood sugar 119.  LFTs were normal.  UA was
negative.  INR 1.1.  Chest x-ray showed no significant
process.  At the time of evaluation, carotid studies and echo
were pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Known firstname **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] and went home and came back.  He was readmitted on
[**2-23**].  On [**2-23**], the patient underwent redo
sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a
vein graft to the acute margin, sequentially to the PDA, and
a vein graft to the distal LAD.  In addition, the patient
also had an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.  Subsequently,
in the operating room the patient also had insertion of right
ventricular assist device for RV failure.  The patient had an
intra-aortic balloon pump placed at the same time as right
ventricular assist device was placed.  A balloon pump was
placed in antegrade fashion into the thoracic aorta.  The
operation was performed by Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**].  Please refer to the operative note.  The patient
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in fair condition
on a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] insulin drip at 15
U/h, and a propofol drip at 15.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained in the
Cardiothoracic ICU on perioperative antibiotics, on an
amiodarone drip at 1 mg, milrinone at 0.5, Neo at 0.5.  The
patient was started on aspirin.  He was also on a CIS drip
0.08, insulin at 9, and propofol at 30.  He had a T-max of
97.9.  He was in sinus bradycardia in the 50s, with a blood
pressure of 110/45, PA pressures 42/29, with an index of 2.1.
The RVAD flow was at a 5 liters with a VAD rate of 67, and
the patient remained in stable condition but critically ill
with multiple drug support, on the RVAD, and the intra-aortic
balloon pump.  White count was 7.5, hematocrit 31.8, K 3.8,
BUN 26, creatinine 2.0, INR 1.4.  The plan was to try and
wean the vent as tolerated and do CVVH with Quinton catheter
and assess as per routine.

The patient was seen by the renal fellow on the [**2-24**], as the patient had become hypotension and oliguric
over that 24-hour period prior to being seen by renal.  They
were asked to consult for volume management, noting his
baseline creatinine of 1.718 was now 2.2.  The patient's
chest was open at the time in the ICU.  A chest x-ray showed
pulmonary edema.  They made recommendations for renal
medication.  The patient was also seen by case management.
The patient was also seen by the renal attending who again
agreed with dosing the medications according to CVVH, and
noted the alkalosis that was going on at the time.  The
patient was also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], his
cardiologist.  At the time, the patient was on amiodarone,
vasopressin and milrinone.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] made mention at the
time of talking to the family that the patient's outlook was
very guarded.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was started on heparin,
was receiving CVVH with a Quinton catheter.  Pressure control
ventilations were started with some success to decrease the
FIO2.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells and was given albumin.  He remained on amiodarone,
milrinone, Neo, ativan, cisatracurium, fentanyl, heparin,
insulin drips.  The patient also had restarted Protonix, and
continued with perioperative Kefzol.  The RVAD flow was at
5.2.  Blood gases 7.46/32/130/23 and a base excess of 0.  At
the time, the patient's index was 3.4 with PA pressures of
36/26, and a CVP of 11.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm
with a blood pressure of 101/47.  Creatinine, however, began
to rise significantly and went from 2.0-3.2, as the patient
remained in acute renal failure.

The patient was seen again the same day by renal fellow.  The
patient continued going in and out of atrial fibrillation.
He continued with CVVHD.  Also on the 17, the patient
developed third degree AV block with some atrial rhythm, but
fluctuated between sinus and atrial fibrillation.
Electrophysiology service from cardiology placed an
intravenous atrial pacing wire because the epicardial A-lead
was not working.  Epicardial V-lead was working properly
though.  The patient's EP attending is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**].  Please refer to their procedure note.
The patient was also seen by renal attending.

The patient very early in the morning at 1:00 am on [**2-26**] was seen by general surgery on consult for evaluation of
continuing decrease in urine output, increasing acidosis.  A
TE that day showed LVEF of approximately 10-15%.  The patient
was on multiple drips with pressor support and epinephrine.
pH continued to worsen and got as low as 7.20 with a base
excess of -8, and a lactate of 15.  The INR had started to
rise.  General surgery was consulted for the possibility of
an abdominal process going on, as the AST had also begun to
rise.  General surgery noted and assessed
