Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
He states that he "just
feels slow" and his voice is lower than usual. He also reports a
headache that is a [**3-1**] that starts in the R shoulder and
radiates up the neck across the cheek over to the R eyebrow. He
states it is worse in the morning and is relieved throughout the
day. He also reports some dizziness and intermittent episodes of
visual disturbances. He describes the visual disturbances as
"black outs" that last approximately 1 minute and leaves him
feeling unsteady. He denies any nausea or vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right temporal craniotomy for tumor resection.


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with PMHx of ACOM aneurysm and SAH in [**2139**] presents
to clinic c/o fatigue since middle [**Month (only) 547**]. He states that he
"just
feels slow" and his voice is lower than usual. He also reports a
headache that is a [**3-1**] that starts in the R shoulder and
radiates up the neck across the cheek over to the R eyebrow. He
states it is worse in the morning and is relieved throughout the
day. He also reports some dizziness and intermittent episodes of
visual disturbances. He describes the visual disturbances as
"black outs" that last approximately 1 minute and leaves him
feeling unsteady. He denies any nausea or vomiting. MRI of head
showed a new large R temporal lobe mass. He was directly
admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical intervention.

DISCHARGE EXAM:
Awake and alert, CN 2-12 grossly intact. Speech clear. Motor
exam full.
Incision: C/D/I and closed with staples.


Pertinent Results:
MRA BRAIN:
The head MRA demonstrates a small coil pack within the region of
anterior
communicating artery. No evidence of recanalization of the
aneurysms
identified. A small basilar tip aneurysm is again identified. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen. There is displacement of
the right middle cerebral artery and elevation of the M1 segment
secondary to mass in the temporal pole.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm recanalization. Basilar tip
aneurysm
again noted.

MRI BRAIN:
There is now a new large area of edema identified in the right
temporal lobe extending to the basal ganglia region. There is
irregular rim-enhancing mass identified on post-gadolinium
images, measuring approximately 6 x 4 cm in the anterior,
posterior, and transverse dimensions. There is mass effect on
the right lateral ventricle with mild midline shift. There are
no other areas of abnormal enhancement seen. No acute infarct is
identified. Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of
abnormalities on the ADC to indicate low defect slow diffusion
within the region of mass.

[**7-10**] Post op Head CT:
Status post resection of the right temporal lobe mass, with
continued mass
effect and only minimal improvement in leftward midline shift.

[**7-11**] Post op MRI:1. Status post right temporal craniotomy and
partial tumor resection, with
residual nodular enhancement consistent with residual tumor.
Minimal interval improvement in mass effect.
2. New area of slow diffusion within the right temporal lobe,
posterior to
the resection cavity, consistent with an acute infarction.
3. Bifrontal subdural fluid, blood and air, causing mild mass
effect on the frontal lobes.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service on the floor
and had a stable course preoperatively. Some question about left
ankle swelling prompted us to obtain a left lower extremity
doppler to rule out a DVT which was negative.

He was seen by Neuro oncology for recommendations. We will have
him follow up with them post operatively and when we have a
tissue diagnosis.

He was taken to the Operating room on Monday [**7-10**] for resecton
of his right temporal mass which was performed without
complication. He was transferred to the PACU in stable condition
and remained there overnight for close neurological observation.
A post op CT was performed and not hemorrhage was appreciated.

On [**7-11**] He remained neurologically intact. His post op MRI was
performed. He was cleared for transfer to the floor. Physical
therapy was consulted to assist with discharge planning.
Physicial therapy cleared the patient for discharge home with
family supervision which he will have.

Patient will follow up in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office for a wound check
and in brain tumor clinic for treatment of his brain tumor.
