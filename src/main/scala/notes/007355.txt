History of Present Illness:
85-year-old woman recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-6-1**] for
CHF exacerbation who presents with hyponatremia and shortness of
breath. The patient had been started on several new medications
during her previous admission, including torsemide. Since her
previous discharge, the patient continues to have a cough that
is mildly productive of clear sputum. She does not use oxygen at
home and denies feeling short of breath there. She has been
feeling somewhat more fatigued.  The patient reports that her
symptoms are similar to those during her previous admission.
She denies any fever or chills. She further denies any dysuria,
but does complain of constipation. The patient was brought to
the Emergency Department because her sodium had been dropping
over the last week on outpatient labs. She denies any confusion
or seizures.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.6 87 130/63 16 90% RA.
The patient became progressively short of breath.  She was

was started on Zosyn for UTI following recent hospitalization.
For concern of HCAP, vancomycin also started.

Pertinent Results:
- OSH chest CT w/o contrast ([**2135-4-1**] @ [**Hospital6 **]):
There are bilateral thyroid nodules. There is no pneumothorax.
There are predominantly bibasilar subpleural reticular
abnormality with small cystic spaces which are probably due to
senescent lung changes and/or mild fibrotic changes. There is no
pleural effusion. No lung mass or consolidation is seen. The
heart is globally enlarged. There is coronary artery
calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85-year-old woman with a history of diastolic
heart failure presenting with dyspnea and hyponatremia.
.
# Respiratory distress- On admission, patient was found to be
90% on room air. She was placed on BIPAP and admitted to the
MICU. She was ruled out for MI. There was a concern for
pulmonary edema from CHF, given crackles on exam, pitting edema,
and CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema, but diuretics initially
held given hyponatremia. Shortly after admission to the MICU,
BIPAP was discontinued and the patient's respiratory status was
stable on 4L NC and face mask of 50% FiO2. With improvement of
hyponatremia, IV torsemide 5mg [**Hospital1 **] was given with a good
response and patient was weaned to 3-4L O2 NC.  She was
transferred to the medical floor.  On the floor, the patient
continued to be diuresed with IV torsemide.  However, she
remained hypoxemic with a 2-3L O2 requirement.  She was
discharged to a long-term care facility for continued diuresis.
The patient should have electrolytes checked every other day
with continued aggressive diuresis.  Patient continues to be
4lbs above her dry weight.  At baseline, did not require
supplemental oxygen prior to admission.  The patient should
follow-up with outpatient pulmonology for evaluation of fibrotic
changes seen on chest CT.
.
# Hyponatremia- The patient was admitted with a sodium of 120.
Hyponatremia was likely secondary to excess water intake in
presence of diuretics following past hospital discharge. TSH,
T4, and random cortisol on admission were are normal, excluding
endocrine abnormality as a cause of hyponatremia. The patient
was water-restricted to 1L/day, and hyponatremia began to
improve.  She was given protein shakes TID and was discharged to
a LTAC on a water restriction of 1.5L/day.  On day of discharge,
her sodium was 134.  Please check electrolytes every other day
with continued aggressive diuresis given history of
hyponatremia.
.
# Urinary tract infection-Urinalysis on admission was strongly
suggestive of continued urinary tract infection.  The patient
was given 1 dose of Zosyn in the ED, and 1 dose of macrobid in
the MICU before switching to IV ceftriaxone.  She took seven
days of ceftriaxone.  Urine culture then returned positive for
coagulase negative staph.  The patient received PO
Nitrofurantoin x 3 days.
.
# Atrial fibrillation-The patient was continued on her home rate
control medication of diltiazem.  However, due to issues of
tachycardia, diltiazem was changed from 240 mg ER daily to 60mg
PO QID.  Home atenolol dose was converted to metoprolol tartrate
for tighter control.  The patient was continued on her home
warfarin in house.  Once transferred to the floor, INR became
sub-therapeutic.  Patient's warfarin dose was doubled to 4mg
daily.  On discharge, INR should be tightly monitored.  If the
patient becomes supratherapeutic, she should be changed back to
her home dose of 2mg daily at 4pm.
.
# Hypertension: Stable.  The patient was continued on diltiazem.
 Extended release formulation was converted to short acting
formulation, as above.  Atenolol was converted to metoprolol
tartrate.
.
# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium and vitamin D throughout
admission.  Patient should resume alendronate as an outpatient.
.
# Constipation - Patient continued on senna, colace, miralax.
PRN bisacodyl was started for constipation.
.
#Transitional issues:
Prior to discharge, the patient's INR was 1.5.  Her warfarin
dose was doubled to 4mg daily.  On discharge, INR should be
tightly monitored.  If the patient becomes supratherapeutic, she
should be changed back to her home dose of 2mg daily at 4pm.
Please check electrolytes every other day, as patient is on
aggressive diuresi
