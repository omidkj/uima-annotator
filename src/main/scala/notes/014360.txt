Final Report
CHEST X-RAY

HISTORY: Evaluate for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.

One portable AP view. Comparison with the previous study done
[**2127-12-6**]. Lung
volumes are low. There is streaky density at the lung bases
consistent with
subsegmental atelectasis as before. A small right effusion
persists. No
pneumothorax is identified. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and
mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right internal jugular
sheath remains
in place. There is no significant change.

IMPRESSION:
No significant change.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 - 50 %), with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on NTG.
Good biventricular systolic fxn. !+ TR, 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta
intact.
Other parameters as pre-bypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2127-12-1**] and underwent cardiac
catheterization.  He also had vein mapping and on [**2127-12-4**] he had
a redo CABGx3(SVG->OM, Ramus, an PDA).  The cross clamp time was
102 mins. and total bypass time was 176 mins.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition.  He was extubated on his operative night and required
aggressive respiratory therapy post operatively.  He was
diuresed and was transferred to the floor on POD#4.  His chest
tubes were discontinued on POD#2 and his epicardial pacing wires
were discontinued on POD#3.  He was transferred to rehab in
stable condition on POD#5 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  All
post-operative appointments were advised.
