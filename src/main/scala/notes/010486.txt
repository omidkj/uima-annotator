.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2184-6-18**] which revealed:
LMCA 50%
LAD 70% mid disease w/ distal filling via LIMA, occluded small

No intervention done. While on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 developed sustained VT,
prior to episode BP was 153/80 and during VT he felt slightly
tired but had good mentation, BP of 103/60. The lowest BP
recorded was systoilc 56 but rechecked immediately was normal.
He was given a small dose of lidocaine (unk) prior to getting a

TTE ([**2184-6-19**])
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
anterolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 25-30 %).No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with extensiver
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary and graft angiography revealed the following
findings. The
LMCA revealed 50% distal disease. The LAD revealed a mid 70%
disease
with distal vessel filling via LIMA; occluded small DIAG1. The
LCx
revealed severe proximal disease with occlusion after severely
diseased
small OM1; small OM fills via SVG. The RCA revealed severe
proximal and
mid disease; distal vessel fills via LAD collaterals.
2. Graft angiography revealed the following findings. The SVG-OM
was
normal and no evidence of free RIMA anastamosed to this graft to
DIAG.
The LIMA-LAD was normal. The three old SVGs were occluded.
3. Aortography showed no apparent additional grafts noted
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 178 mmHg and a
DBP of
86 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary artery disease: see above comments
2. Patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM grafts; aortography did not reveal
any
additional grafts in this asymptomatic patient with NSTEMI
3. R 5Fr femoral artery sheath to be removed post procedure

CXR ([**6-21**])
In comparison with study of [**2180-9-24**], there is continued
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary
vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure in this
patient with previous CABG and intact midline sternal wires. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

CXR ([**6-25**])
Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.
Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable. Heart size is enlarged,
unchanged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable. Lungs are essentially
clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted on the current
study and small amount of pleural fluid cannot be excluded
better seen on the lateral view. Correlation with upright PA and
lateral radiographs is recommended.

Cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ([**6-22**])
Impression:
1. Severely increased left ventricular cavity size with severely
depressed
LVEF of 25%. There was akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral
and
anterolateral walls and apex, with hypokinesis of the
inferoseptum. No
thombus was seen. Late gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images
demonstrating areas of hyperenhancement as described above,
consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease and lack of
viability.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 68%.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
4. Moderate left atrial enlargement. Mild right atrial
enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG x 3 in
[**2162**] with redo CABG in [**2180-9-2**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM
and RIMA to the diagonal arteries), systolic CHF EF 25% presents
w/ syncope found to have incessant sustained Vtach. Pt was
admitted to the ICU and had a failed epicardial ablation and
required a lidocaine drip and was ultimately discharged on dual
antiarrythmics.

ACTIVE ISSUE:
Ventricular tachycardia:
The patient presented with syncope, which was likely due to
Vtach. Shortly after admission to the floor, he had a 1.5 hr run
of sustained Vtach. He was given 150 mg IV amiodarone x 2 with
no effect, and broke with 100 mg of lidocaine. He was briefly
kept on a lidocaine gtt overnight. On [**6-21**], he went to the EP
lab for attempted ablation. The monomorphic Vtach could not be
elicited. However, polymorphic Vtach, which degenerated into
Vfib developed. He underwent CPR and 2 defibrillations - the
second of which brought him into sinus rhythm. He was briefly on
pressors during that event. He was brought back to CCU wher
