History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year-old woman with a history of COPD/?Intersitial
lung disease who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 2358**]. The
patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 1774**] on [**11-12**] with complaints of
shortness of breath and cough. At the time of her arrival, the
patient was noted to be afebrile, hypotensive (SBPs in the 80's)
with an ABG of 7.42, 35, 65 and sating 93% on 3L. CXR was
notable for right/lower and left upper lobe consolidations. Lab
studies showed leukocytosis of 12.5, Hct 34.3, Creat 1.6, BNP
542. She was admitted for a community acquired pneumonia and
hypotension a 10 day course of levaquin was initiated. Over the
first 72 hours of admission, the patient continued to have
increased work of breathing and a productive cough. She was
transition to BiPap, but on HD 3, she was intubated. She
required mechanical ventilation for 7 days after which point she
was extubated. She was stable for a brief 36 hour period, but
continued to have supplemental oxygen requirements and
subsequently desated into the 70's requiring re-intubation on HD
12. While intubated, the patient was noted to become hypotensive
when treated with sedatives. She was started on low dose
neosynephrine for BP control.

During the her [**Hospital6 **] course, a TTE was obatined
and was notable for pulmonary hypertention (PA pressure of 75).
While CT scan was not obtained, it was felt that the patient's
respiratory failure was due to and underlying non-reversable
intersitial lung disease. The patient's family was not
comfortable with this assessment and so transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was
requested.

The patient arrived here intubated, but awake and oriented. She
reports some throat pain and feelings of anxiety regarding her
ET tube. She denies feeling short of breath or any other
discomfort.

Family notes progressive decline in physical abilities and
physical activities over 6 months prior to admission, noting
exertional dyspnea.  Pt became less active than prior.

TTE
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: According to the transfer
records, the patient's initial respiratory failure was felt to
be due to community acquired pneumonia. Her pneumonia had
initally responded to antibiotic therapy; as was evidenced by
her extubation and per report, resolution by CXR (although no
radiology reports were included in transfer documents). Her
reintubation was felt to be due to worsening of a possible
chronic lung disease, however the patient has never had a CT
scan. No evidence of cardiac cause; outside culture data
negative to date. Pt has elevated WBC. Possible causes for
continued respiratory failure include persistant bacterial
pneumonia, viral pneumonia, VAP. Bronchoscopy was unremarkable
and BAL results were negative. Given some concern for pulmonary
edema, patient was cautiously diuresed daily with lasix. CT
Chest consistent with ILD and COPD. Given findings consistent
with ILD and NSIP on CT scan, patient was started on Solumedorol
and transitioned to prednisone on [**12-3**]. Unfortuantely, high
dose steroids did not improve the patient's respiratory
compromise, and she continued to require ventilatory support.
Sputum gram stain with GPC, and so patient was covered
transiently with Vancomycin but nothing grew in sputum culutre
so this was d/cd. Patient did not wean from ventilator, and a
tracheostomy was performed.  Steroids were tapered, and the
patient remained unable to wean from the ventilator.  On
[**2168-12-14**], she developed evidence of ventilator associated
pneumonia with increased ventilatory support requirement,
infiltrate and sputum which ultimately grew Pseudomonas.

# Atrial fibrillation: On [**2168-12-15**] she developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. As this was in the
setting of worsening clinical status, the family did not want
treatment at the time, as the focus of care was shifted to
comfort.

# Hypotension: Pressor requirement related to sedation at
admission. These were able to be discontinued.

# Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid

# Hyperlipidemia: lipitor cur
