Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
X-fer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital- COPD with RML PNA and RUL mass.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided lung biopsy


History of Present Illness:
HPI Summary: 61 YO female with Hx of COPD- bullous predominantly
in RUL that is transferred for a pulmonary second opinion and
RML pneumonia.
.
In [**2100**], pt developed a respiratory infection which was
Tx with PO Antibiotic with mild resolution. However, she
developed a reoccurence of a RML infiltrated. The Pt was
admitted to the hospital for IV Antibiotics- Ceftriaxone and
Gatifloxacin. The patient was discharged and was placed on
Augmentin. She improved clinically and radiographically. The
patient went on vacation in [**Month (only) 216**] and was doing well.
.
End of [**Name (NI) 216**], pt was fatigued and had a CBC which showed WBC of
50K. The pt was referred to [**Hospital3 328**] and a Bone Marrow Bx
showed a reactive process and not consistent with an acute
leukemia. The patient underwent a torso CT which showed
increased size of pneumonitis in RML eventhough symptomatically
was not worse. The pt was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital in
middle [**Month (only) 462**]. After 3 days, the pt had an acute exacerbation
and had to be intubated and was extubated after 2 days in the
ICU. Pt was Tx with Zosyn and gatifloxacin since that time at a
rehab center at the hospital. Sputum at OSH showed yeast forms,
upper respiratory flora and a one sputum showed aspergillous.
.
CT scan after being Tx with Zosyn and gatifloxacin showed some
improvement in the RML, but also had continued sever bullous
emphysematous changes with chronic infiltrate with stable
lymphadenopathy and now a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate with
stable lymphadenopathy and a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate.
In the bulla there appears to be an area suggesting a possible
mass in one of her cavities which certainly could signify
possibility of a mycetoma, aspergilloma, or neoptlams. Sputum
cytologies and bronchosopies x2 at OSH have been negative.
Note: Mycetoma- is a chronic, specific, granulomatous,
progressive inflammatory disease; it usually involves the
subcutaneous tissue after a traumatic inoculation of the
causative organism. Mycetoma may be caused by true fungi or by
higher bacteria and hence it is usually classified into
eumycetoma and actinomycetoma respectively (1). Tumefaction and
formation of sinus tracts characterize mycetoma. The sinuses
usually discharge purulent and seropurulent exudate containing
grains. It may spread to involve the skin and the deep
structures resulting in destruction, deformity and loss of
function, very occasionally it could be fatal.
.

Currently, the patient states she is resting comfortably. + mild
dyspnea.
Denies F/C, N/V, cough, sinus discharge, CP, SOB, abdominal
pain, and urinary symptoms

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61 YO female with COPD and bullous changes x-ferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of her persistent RML
pneumonia/pneumonitis and RUL mass.
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of the
RUL mass by interventional pulmonology.  CT scans were repeated
at [**Hospital1 18**] to better characterize the lesions (see results).  IP
saw the patient; they biopsied and obtained tissue on [**11-12**],
results showed aspergillus.  She was started on Voriconazole.
The patient was oberved off antibiotics for several days (as
felt to be fungal, not bacterial pathogen), whereupon she began
spike high fevers and her WBC count slowly trended upward.
Vanco and ceftaz were started for presumed bacterial
superinfection, then broadened further to include meropenem.  C.
diff was diagnosed, and flagyl was started.  Eventually, she had
to be intubated due to respiratory failure.  In the MICU, she
became septic.  Despite very aggressive antimicrobial and
pulmonary treatments, her conditioned worsened.  After multiple
family meetings discussing the very poor prognosis, the decision
was made to prioritize comfort in her care.  She passed away on
[**2161-11-25**].
