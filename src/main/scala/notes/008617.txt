Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress, hypoxia, intubated


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with PMH of heavy tobacco use, COPD on nightly oxygen
who was found unresponsive earlier this evening.  Daughter is a
chef for a function facility and father came to watch event.
Appeared  ashen and unwell on arrival.  Found sitting on toilet
after not coming out for 8 minutes, unresponisve and cyanotic.
Given O2 and called EMS.  Per OSH report, EMS found patient
sitting on toilet, hypertensive, agonal breathing and
unresponsive. Given Albuterol, Combivent. They attempted
intubation the field without success.  Bag-masked until OSH,
then intubated at [**Hospital1 **].  Intial VS SBP 210/105, HR 102, 100%
on 100%/Ambu.  [**Hospital1 **] PE notable for bilateral tight wheezing.
Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Xopenex given.  EKG SR 96 bpm, normal
axis, large peaked Ts V3, inverted TW II, III/AVF, V6.  Initial
Troponin I 0.1 (indeterminate), WBC 13.6.  CT Brain without
acute abnormality, ICH or mass effect.

In the last week with increased SOB (prompting steroid burst)
and chills.  Today with increased cough, hoarse voice and
shortness of breath.  No prior influenza or recent pneumonia
vaccination.  Per daughter had never seen him go to the doctor
until two months with 'episodes' of shortness of breath, turning
purple and tripoding to breath.

In our ED patient was given 2.5L NS in ED.  Patient was briefly
on Propofol but this was discontinued for hypotension; now on
Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation. CTA with pulmonary effusions,
edema but no thrombus. RIJ placed for progressive hypotension,
but Norepinephrine only started upon leaving the ED with VS
83/57.

Upon arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated, tolerating
ventilator well.

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior and infero-lateral akinesis (prior myocardial
infarction). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

1. Pulmonary edema.
2. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are borderlin enlarged but
likely
reactive.
3. Right adrenal myelolipoma.
4. Renal hypodensities some cysts some too small to
characterize.
Correlation with prior imaging or renal ultrasound in 6 months
is recommended
for further evaluation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2200-1-28**] 9:28 AM
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above
the carina.  The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable.
The tip of the tube projects over the distal part of the
stomach.  The lung volumes have slightly increased. The
distribution and severity of the pre-described parenchymal
changes is unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with h/o COPD, tobacco use, found unresponsive and
cyanotic while sitting on toilet after several days of
progressive SOB; intubated at [**Hospital3 4107**] (first attempted
by EMS); admitted to the ICU upon arrival due to persistent
hypotension and need for mechanical ventilation.

# Respiratory arrest.  Etiology uncertain but would consider
COPD exacerbation (worsening SOB x several days with steroid
burst per PCP); PNA (not visualized on CXR but may be dry);
cardiac ischemic event (EKG without concerning changes but no
prior); PE (CTA preliminary negative); aspiration (but was
upright on toilet) or seizure (but reportedly worsened over
several day period).  Intubated at [**Hospital1 **]; wheezing and tight on
initial exam. CTA negative for PE. Treated with steroid burst,
antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and nebulizer
treatment (Ipratroprium / Albuterol).  Extubated [**2200-1-26**] and
transferred to the regular medical floor on [**2200-1-27**].  On [**2200-1-28**]
he had new respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.  This
was due to a combination of variables including mucous plugging
and treatment with high flow oxygen that decreased his intrinsic
respiratory drive.  He underwent bronchoscopy with removal of
thick mucous secretion.  On [**2200-1-29**] he was extubated without
incident.  He continued on nebulizer therapy and was discharged
with a planned course of antibiotics and 15 days steroid taper.
He was also scheduled to see Pulmonary as outpatient to continue
further treatment for his COPD and continued tobacco use.

# Hypotension: Initially unclear etiology.  Considerations
included sepsis (infectious vs cardiogenic; obstructive but no
PE on CTA) vs. breath stacking with ventilator / COPD vs new
process such as pneumothorax s/p line placement.  Resolved with
discontinuation of Propofol.

# Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 116**] be reactive vs infectious process.  Could
also be ischemia vs seizure (low suspicion).  Cardiac enzymes
were indicative demand ischemia.  Though chest imaging never
developed a true infiltrate, was treated for community acquired
pneumonia.

# COPD: Unclear level of control or severity.  Also on daily
Azithromycin for last 2 months.  Treated for exacerbation as
above.  Discharged with Tiotroprium, Advair, Duonebs and
Pulmonary follow-up.

# Tobacco Use: Recommended stopping tobacco use and was given a
Nicotene patch while inpatient.

# Cardiac Dysfunction: As noted above with some elevated
troponins (peak 0.1
