Imaging:
-CXR ([**2144-7-10**]): Findings consistent with congestive heart
failure.  No
pneumothorax.

-RUQ US ([**2144-7-10**]):
1.  Increased biliary dilatation since the prior study with
debris in the
common bile duct. Recommend MR for further evaluation once
symptoms of acute heart failure resolve.
2.  Right pleural effusion.
3.  Right renal cyst.

-ERCP ([**2144-7-11**]):
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: The major papilla was bulging with pus discharge.

Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in partial opacification. Given
cholangitis further contrast injection was not performed.

Biliary Tree Fluoroscopic Interpretation: Limited cholangiogram
showed dilated CBD approximately 10mm in size. Given cholangitis
further contrast injectuion was not made.

Procedures: Given the finding of large amount of pus exuding at
the ampulla a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Given the finding of cholangitis a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail
biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
introducer kit to facilitate biliary decompression. Good bile
flow was noted after stent placement.

Impression: The major papilla was bulging with pus discharge.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a

Given cholangitis further contrast injection was not performed.

Limited cholangiogram showed dilated CBD approximately 10mm in
size. Given cholagitis further contrast injection was not done.
Given the finding of large amount of pus exuding at the ampulla
a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Given the finding of cholangitis a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail
biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
introducer kit to facilitate biliary decompression.
Good bile flow was noted after stent placement.

Recommendations: Return to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 75-100
cc/hr.
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain,
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP
fellow on call ([**Pager number 8437**])
Continue IV antibiotics.
Repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and biliary evaluation.



Brief Hospital Course:
88 y.o woman with history of distal pancreatectomy, DM who
presents with obstructive jaundice who was found to have
cholangitis now s/p sphincterotomy.
.
#Cholangitis ?????? The patient had labs suggestive of cholestasis
with dilation of the common bile duct to 1.2cm at admission;
Tbili was elevated to 9.6 with Dbili of 7.9.  She underwent ERCP
which showed pus in the bile duct, and she had a spincterotomy
and biliary stent placed.  Her bili started to downtrend after
the procedure.  She was started on Cipro/Flagyl at admission
which was switched to meropenem when she was found to have a
multidrug resistant E.Coli UTI. At discharge, it was changed to
ertapenem for ease of daily administration instead of q8 hour
dosing.  She will need a repeat ERCP in 4 weeks to assess for
improvement with a repeat cholangiogram and removal of the
stent.  Her sensation of abd d
