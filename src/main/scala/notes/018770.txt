CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old Caucasian
female with past medical history significant for three times
myocardial infarction in [**2141**], [**2144**] and [**2146**] and coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2139**] who presented with 8 out of 10
chest pain and nausea, while being transferred to [**Hospital3 1761**], shortly after being transferred from [**Hospital **]
Hospital.  She had been admitted to [**Location (un) **] for an eight day
admission after a fall.  Per patient's husband, the patient
initially had brief syncope, two days prior to first
admission with loss of consciousness.  Shortly after blood
pressure was still 70s/40s.  She presented to [**Location (un) **] two
days later with severe lower back pain.  Per discharge
summary, a bone scan showed no evidence for acute fracture in
the right hand or the pelvis with some arthritis in the hips.
A right hip x-ray was normal.  Lumbar spine magnetic
resonance imaging scan was normal and vertebral spine was
within normal limits.  She had some arthritis of both hips
with normal sacrum.

The patient's typical angina usually is pressure like but she
has had no typical angina for approximately two weeks.  At
that time she had been admitted to [**Hospital1 20954**] Hospital
and ruled in for myocardial infarction at that time.  Cardiac
catheterization was done with grafts open at that time.  At
the day of admission, the patient's chest pain was sharp and
well localized.  Per Emergency Medical Services, she received
three sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin with resolution of
her pain.  Heartrate was between 30s to 40s with systolic
blood pressure between 110 to 130.  Electrocardiogram showed
possible Wenckebach per Emergency Medical Services but on
review it showed mostly sinus bradycardia with occasional
premature atrial contractions.  In the Emergency Department
she continued to have 5 out of 10 chest pain and was made
painfree with nitroglycerin drip.  Electrocardiogram there
showed sinus bradycardia with frequent premature atrial
contractions.  At this time she was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As stated above -  1.  Coronary artery
disease with coronary artery bypass graft in [**2139**] involving
the grafts, left internal mammary artery to V1, saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal.  2.  Myocardial infarction in [**2141**] with
pericarditis, non-Q wave in [**2144**].  Catheterization at that
time showing three vessel disease with patent graft.
Myocardial infarction in [**2146-6-3**] at [**Hospital1 29305**].  3.
Hypertension.  4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Apparently
she has 60 to 70% left renal artery stenosis.  Her [**Hospital1 20955**] discharge summary study was done to show that this
lesion was not hemodynamically significant.  5.  Peripheral
vascular disease, Mrs. [**Known lastname 29306**] has had two carotid
endarterectomies.  The right side was done in [**2141**] and the
left was done in [**2145-4-3**].  This carotid endarterectomy
was complicated by left anterior cerebellar infarct with
minimal residua.  She also had a left femoral-popliteal
bypass in [**2133**] and right iliac angioplasty in [**2133**].  6.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed in [**2133**] as
triopathy.  7.  Congestive heart failure with ejection
fraction of 45 to 50% per echocardiogram in [**2144**].
Echocardiogram at that time in the office showed inferior
akinesis, posterior hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation and
1+ aortic regurgitation.  8.  Pilonidal cyst.  9.
Cholecystectomy in [**2099**].  10.  Cesarean section times two.
11.  Left retinal hemorrhage.  12.  History of seizures.

ALLERGIES:  Hydralazine.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Various family members with myocardial
infarctions and strokes.  Two brothers had coronary artery
bypass graft.  Hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His family has a 100 pack year history but
quit in [**2133**].  She denies alcohol use.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission complete blood count revealed
white blood cell count of 6.3, hematocrit 26, platelets 167,
PT 11.6, PTT 27, INR 0.9, first CK was 66 with a troponin of
1.  Phenytoin of 22.7.  Chem-7 showed the following, sodium
132, potassium 6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 96,
creatinine 2.9, blood sugar 181, albumin 3.1, calcium 9.7,
phosphate 3.8, neb 2.2.  Electrocardiogram on admission
showed possible junctional rhythm, first wondering atrial
pacemaker versus sinus bradycardia with premature atrial
contractions.  There is also left ventricular hypertrophy
with strain and ST depression in leads 1, 2, V5 and V6, as
compared to prior electrocardiogram from [**2145-4-3**].  Chest
x-ray showed mild emphysematous changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Coronary artery disease - Mrs. [**Known lastname 29306**] was
admitted to the CCU for further evaluation and observation.
She was placed on Telemetry and ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  Serial CKs and troponins were significant for
second troponin of 17.3, however, third troponin was .7,
indicating that there was laboratory error in the second
troponin.  CPKs were flat throughout with no MB fraction.
She was placed on Aspirin, Zocor, Nitroglycerin, GT drip and
Heparin.  Beta blocker was held secondary to her bradycardia.
When she ruled out for myocardial infarction, heparin was
discontinued.  Echocardiogram was checked the following
morning showing the following left atrium markedly dilated,
left ventricular cavity size normal, overall left ventricular
systolic function mildly depressed.  Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities included severe inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis along with basolateral hypokinesis.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation was seen as well as
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  Moderate 2+
tricuspid regurgitation was seen with moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There was no pericardial
effusion.

Rhythm - Mrs.[**Known lastname 29307**] presentation to [**Hospital **] Hospital
indicated possible syncopal episode which may have been
secondary to brady or tachyarrhythmia.  Electrophysiology
consult was requested.  She also had a brief history of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 2 to 3 beats in the
setting of inferior myocardial infarction.  As ejection
fraction was suboptimal, electrophysiology study was
seriously considered with possible implantable cardioverter
defibrillator placement to help prevent further
tachyarrhythmia.  However electrophysiology was unconvinced
that this was a tachyarrhythmia as opposed to possible
bradyarrhythmia versus autonomic failure.  Tilt test was
considered at this time.  Physical therapy was made to walk
Mrs. [**Known lastname 29306**] with careful documentation of pulses and blood
pressures.  Pulse had expected increase while walking.  Of
note, blood pressure was decreased by ten points from lying
to standing with no rise in blood pressure from standing to
walking.  Orthostatics were also completed showing increase
in heartrate from lying to standing.  It was the opinion of
the electrophysiology service at that time not to further
pursue electrophysiology study.

Vascular - In the Emergency Department the physician on call
was able to get a history of atypical sharp chest pain which
radiated to the back.  Blood pressure was normal on both arms
with normal pulses.  She had widened pulse pressure likely
due to aortic regurgitation.  Chest
