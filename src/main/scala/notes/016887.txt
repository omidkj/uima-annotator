History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 61404**] is a 53 year old with a PMH significant for DM, HTN,
a-fib with LV thrombus on coumadin, PHTN and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy and CHF with an EF of 15% from [**2133-6-26**], s/p cath
in [**8-/2132**] that showed 80% occlusion in RCA who presented to
clinic today with 2 days of chest pain to [**3-7**] with associated
cough but no shortness of breath. His pain was not associated
with exertion as he has been pretty sedentary at home because of
his condition. He has no energy and is unable to do much over
the last few months. At his PCPs office, he was feeling unwell,
with constant non-radiating chest pain that was centrally
located and persistent. He had not taken any medications at the
time of the appointment. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] checked an EKG that showed a
rate of 138, that was interpreted as sinus tachycardia with no
signs of ischemia. He was given a nitroglycerin tab, which
resolved his chest pain, as well as a chewable aspirin. He was
supposed to get 25mg of lopressor in the office, but Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
unsure if he got it prior to transfer.
.
On transfer to the ED, EMS was concerned for STEMI with ST
elevations in lead V4 on transport, however, the initial EKG in
the ED showed tachycardia with ST depressions in V6. Initial
vitals were HR 133, BP 101/71, RR 28, SaO2 100% RA, T 96.5. His
rate was in the 130s and EKGs showed possible a-flutter. He had
persistent chest pain with nausea and vomiting in the ED. He was
given 1 tab of nitro and lopressor 5mg IV x2. His SBP dropped to
the 60's and he became unresponsive and pulseless, in PEA
arrest. CPR was initiated, he recieved 2 mg of epinephrine, 1mg
of atropine, 1 of bicarb, and then a bicarb drip was started. He
was coded for 7 minutes. He was intubated and placed on dopamine
and levophed drips and transferred to the CCU. Vitals post
arrest on transfer were HR 84, BP 109/70, O2 Sat 97% TV 500,
PEEP 5, RR 14, and Fi02 100%.
.
His lactate was elevated to 8.5 prior to the code, so the ED
ordered a head CT which was negative, and a CT torso to look for
possible infection. He was started on vanc/levo/cefepime in the
ED.
.
In the ED labs showed an metabolic acidosis with an elevated
lactate. Labs were also notable for a HCT drop (35->31), a
supratherapeutic INR (7.4) and end organ ischemia with elevated
transaminases and elevated creatinine.
.
On the floor he was intubated and sedated, on dopamine and
levophed drips. A triple lumen RIJ was placed at the bedside. He
was started on dobutamine in addition to dopa and levophed with
a goal of transitioning the dopa to dobutamine. At the time his
BP was 85/40, HR of 86, and being ventilated on AC 500/5/18/100%
FiO2. He was started on cooling protocol. After the procedure he
was being turned, became bradycardic to the 40's and pulses were
lost. Chest compressions were iniated, he was given epinephrine
and bicarb. He had blood in his endotracheal tube as well as his
OG tube. Pulses returned, and he was maintaining pressures in
the 120s. He became bradycardic a 2nd time and pulse was lost.
CPR was initiated and he was started on an epinephrine drip. His
pulse and pressure returned, and he was sent to the cath lab for
tandem heart placement.
.
Review of systems positive for CP, cough, increased lethargy and
decreased activity over the past few months, nausea and vomiting
in the ED.

Past Medical History:
Cardiac History:
.
Cardiac Catheterizaton [**9-5**] without interventions: A right
dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD and LCx
had mild luminal irregularities. The RCA was diffusely diseased
with serial 20% stenoses and an 80% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
The LAD and RCA had moderate calcifications in the proximal to
mid-vessel.
.
ICD: Single-chamber [**Company 2267**] Teligen 100 ICD was placed

[**9-5**] for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death from VT/VF.
.
Other Past History:
1. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 15% ([**2133-6-26**]), with history of
LV
thrombus on Coumadin. Dry Weight: 164 pounds
2. Hypertension
3. Diabetes
4. HLD
5. Hepatitis B
6. Question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation on Coumadin with
bursts of SVT on pacer interrogation.
7. LV wall thrombis, completed treatment but coumadin continued
likely due to PAF.


Social History:
He moved from [**Country 16225**] to the US and lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with his wife
and son. [**Name (NI) **] is retired from the shipping industry. He formerly
