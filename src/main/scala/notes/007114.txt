Found down.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 87198**] is a 88yo F with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia and
CVA in [**2137**] with residual right hemiparesis who presented to the
ER after being found down in her [**Hospital3 **] facility.
Patient's daughter found her in down in her kitchen surrounded
by blood and called EMS.  EMS felt she was slurring her speech
and noted a right facial droop.

In the ED, initial vitals were stable, and patient had a large
bleeding laceration posterior to her right ear which was
stapled.  Patient appeared dry and was given 1 liter of NS.  She
had CTs of her head and neck which were remarkable for right
retro-aurical hemorrhage and an enlarged thyroid.  Films of her
right ankle showed a bimal fracture which was splinted and
reduced by ortho. CXR was concerning for possible aspiration,
and she received flagyl and levaquin.  Patient was seen by
neurology who felt she likely had a new stroke and was admitted
to the ICU for frequent neuro checks.  At transfer, vitals were
132/53, 74, 27, 99% 2L NC.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient is non-verbal.  Per her daughter, at
baseline, she is talkative and alert with occasional word
finding difficulty but independent of her ADLs.

Physical Exam:
Upon transfer to the medical floor patient was intermittently
answering yes/no questions by shaking her head, with unlabored
breathing. Vital signs were not taken, and further physical
examination was deferred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87199**] is a 88yo F with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia and
prior CVA with residual right sided hemiparesis who presents
with new stroke and atrial fibrillation.

# CVA: acute infarct in left MCA territory, no evidence of
hemorrhage on CT; likely ischemic in setting of atrial
fibrillation. Palliative care was consulted and her family
decided to transition to comfort measures given the patient's
previously stated wishes.

# Palliation: On transfer to the general medicine service all
medications were discontinued with the exception of Digoxin, as
the family felt the patient was uncomfortable with fast heart
rates. Morphine was started for pain and dyspnea control. A
scopolamine patch and hyoscyamine were started on [**2146-10-2**] as
the patient developed increased secretions. She passed away
later that afternoon with her family present.
