Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
hemetemsis and respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, bronchoscopy, EGD

History of Present Illness:
54 yo f with h/o Hep C cirrohsis on inferon presents after 2
days days of vomiting blood. The patient's husband reports that
she has been feeling unwell and having a lot of epigastric
abdominal pain and has had several episodes of hemetemsis over
the past few days. He noted she had a fever to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday and
some chills. He also noted that her skin became more yellow in
the past few days. The patient adamantly refused to come to the
hospital. She has been feeling SOB with a chronic cough that has
not change; her family also reports chronic diarrhea. She does
not have a history of previous varices or UGIB.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99 P 110 BP 138/78 R 16 O2 sat
100% ra. On exam in the ED, she was found to have coffee ground
material in her oropharaynx, jaundice and + asterisix. Consulted
liver and surgery. She then developed 2 more episodes of coffee
ground emesis in ICU. cleared slightly with NG lavage. She
became more confused and she was intubated for airway
protection; however, the intubation was quite difficult, she was
noted to aspirate blood. In the ED, she was given Vancomycin,
octreotide drip and PPI drip. She recieved one unit of FFP but
no other blood products at the time of transfer. Her vital signs
prior to transfer were as follows: T 101.9 HR 137 BP 174/74, A/C
TV 450 RR 14 PEEP 5 FIO2 100%.
.
On the floor, urgent EGD was performed which showed diffuse
duodenal ulcers and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Also fundic
erosions were noted. One large erosion on the lesser curvature
had a clot over it suggesting it as a site of bleed. The site
was clipped. No varices were noted.
Review of systems: unable to obtain [**12-26**] sedation/intubation

Imaging:
CXR ([**2136-7-25**]):
An endotracheal tube has been placed, the tip projects 5 cm
above
the carina. Also new is a nasogastric tube, the side port
projects over the gastroesophageal junction, the tube should be
advanced by several centimeters.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
In both lungs, on the right substantially more severe than on
the left, are aveolar densities. These create multiple air
bronchograms, in the right upper lobe, these changes create a
large area of subtotal parenchymal consolidation. Although the
changes are less severe in the left lung, ill- defined opacities
are predominant in the perihilar lung regions. There is no
evidence of lymphadenopathy and no evidence of pleural
effusions. No cardiomegaly.

Overall the image could be suggestive of parenchymal bleeding or
diffuse
alveolar damage. For ARDS, the assymetry of changes and the
distribution of the right lung pathologies would be atypical.
Another consideration would be severe aspiration with the
patient positioned in the right body position.

CT chest ([**2136-7-27**]):
IMPRESSION: Almost complete consolidation of the right upper
lobe withe
widespread multilobar ground glass opacities and more confluent
consolidations. A component is likely from pulmonary hemorrhage
given the
history, however superimosed edema is also likely and possibly
pneumoia.
Cirrhosis. Splenomegaly likely reflects portal hypertension.

U/S abdomen with dopplers ([**2136-7-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened hepatic echotexture with a nodular contour,
compatible with
provided history of cirrhosis. No focal lesions identified.
2. Patent portal venous system, with directionally appropriate
flow.
3. No evidence of ascites.

Echo ([**2136-7-31**]):
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There may be mild
left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. A mid-cavitary gradient
is identified. Outflow and midcavitary gradients appear to be
due to the patient's hyperdynamic state. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
related to high cardiac output. The mitral
