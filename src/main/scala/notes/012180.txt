History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 86yo male with PMH significant for dementia, CHF
(EF 35%), afib, CKD who is being transferred to the MICU with
increased somnolence and mental status changes. He was recently
hospitalized in [**State 108**] for CHF, afib with RVR, and urinary
retention prompting placement of an artificial urinary
sphincter. Per his daughter's request he was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 55**]. At the NH the patient fell out of his
chair twice requiring Haldol 2mg. He was very agressive and
difficult to re-direct. The patient was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-23**] for further management.
.
In the ED, he was found to be in afib with RVR. CT head was
unrevealing and cxray showed a moderate sized R pleural
effusion. UA was suggestive of a UTI and he was given Levaquin
and Ceftriaxone. He also received Haldol 0.5mg IV x1.

STUDIES:
EKG - atrial fibrillation @ 146 bpm, LAD, no S1 mm ST
depressions V3-V5, no ST elevations, NSSTchanges. No prior EKGs.
.
CXR ([**4-23**]): The cardiomediastinal contour is normal. The heart
is top normal in size, with a left ventricular configuration.
The left lung is clear. There is a moderate right pleural
effusion. The right lung is clear, and there is no current
evidence of congestive heart failure. The bony thorax is
unremarkable.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST ([**4-23**]): There is no evidence of hemorrhage,
edema, mass, mass effect, or acute infarction. However, the
ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related
parenchymal atrophy. In addition, periventricular hypodensity_
especially in surrounding frontal horns of the lateral
ventricles is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. In addition, a right frontal lobe and right parietal
occipetal hypodensity may indicate prior infarction. No fracture
is identified.
.
CXR ([**4-29**]): The heart size is unchanged. Mediastinal position,
contour, and width are unremarkable. There is interval
progression in bilateral pleural effusion, although still small,
and bibasal opacities consistent with atelectasis. No areas
worrisome for pneumonia are demonstrated, although followup of
this bibasal atelectasis is recommended to exclude the
possibility of developing infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo M with h/o dementia, CHF, afib, and recent prolonged
hospitalization who presents with worsening agitation, delirium,
and UTI.

1) Delirium - Based off of history, pt's mental status clearly
waxes and wanes suggesting delirium rather than worsening of
dementia. He has underlying dementia now with delirium and
behavioral disturbance. Patient has life long psychiatric issues
with ? bipolar disorder, which has never been fully worked up
per his family. His delirium is probably [**1-6**] underlying
dementia, hospitalization, UTI, ? hypercarbia, disruption of
sleep/wake cycle, dehydration, pain [**1-6**] to skin tears and
probable pain [**1-6**] to buttocks decubitus. LFTs, TSH, B12, folate
wnl. RPR was non-reactive. UTI was treated as below. Initially
his delirium was treated with haldol, but this caused
hypotension, questionable paridoxical reaction, and was not felt
to be effective. He was transitioned to zyprexa and became
overly somnolent at first [**1-6**] possible over-medication (see
below) but responded well to low dose standing therapy.

2) UTI - Per report from PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] recently treated for UTI with
course of ciprofloxacin. Urine culture on admission revealed
MSSA UTI. He was treated with vancomycin and then transitioned
to bactrim when sensitivities were available. Has sn artificial
urinary sphincter that has been inactivated per daughter's
report. He was evaluated by urology who did not feel there was
evidence of infection of the sphincter. It was recently
instrumented to be inactivated and this event may have led to
his staph UTI. He is incontinent [**1-6**] the inactivated bladder
sphincter and voids by gravity, requiring a scheduled standing
voiding schedule q2-3 hours. He will follow up in urology clinic
as an outpatient. The appointment has already been scheduled.

3) Atrial fibrillation - Pt was on coumadin as well as
metoprolol and digoxin as an outpatient. He frequently went into
RVR up to 150s in the setting of agitation. Again with HR up to
130s upon arrival to floor in setting of agitation. Metoprolol
was titrated up for improved rate control, however on hospital
day 4 he became hypotensive and somnolent, at least in part from
being overly beta blocked as he was on metoprolol 100 mg tid at
that point. In the ICU, metoprolol was decreased down to 25 mg
tid and he was loaded with amiodarone for rate control. Coumadin
was held out of concern for fall risk. Digoxin was discontinued.


4) Somnolence/Hypotension: On the morning of [**4-27**], pt was
triggered for BP of 76/P, responded with 250 cc of IVFs, got
total of 1 L IVFs. Also noted to be more somnolent, ABG
unremarkable but did have periods of apnea where O2 sats would
drop to 79%. Placed on CPAP given h/o OSA and transferred to
MICU for closer monitoring. Somnolence and hypotension were
attributed to over-medication with metoprolol and zyprexa. In
the MICU, metoprolol was titrated down and he was able to
tolerated zyprexa at low doses. After 2 days in the ICU, mental
status was improved and
