CXR ([**2105-8-11**]): The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with
underlying obstructive lung disease. No consolidation or
superimposed edema noted. There is a tortuous atherosclerotic
aorta. The pulmonary arteries are enlarged likely due to
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. The cardiac
silhouette size is within normal limits. No definite effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: COPD with no superimposed acute
pulmonary process.
