tissue)

History of Present Illness:
76 year old female s/p CABG ([**2112**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]), critical AS (Valve
area 0.6cm) and left carotid endarterectomy who presented to
[**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital the evening of [**2126-8-29**] with a chief
complaint of chest pain. She states the pain started while she
was resting in bed and was [**7-17**] in severity. The pain was
associated with diaphoresis and a feeling of impending doom. She
states that she can walk 1 flight of stairs before becoming
short of breath, but often has to rest midway up the stairs. She
recently saw her PCP ([**2126-9-23**]) for worsening dyspnea and
tightness in her chest with exertion. She has had chest pain
1-2x/month, typically when performing housework, for which she
takes Nitro with relief of her pain. A TTE [**5-/2126**] showed: LVEF
45%, hypokinesis of the distal/anterior septum, AV peak gradient
61, mean gradient 37. Given the severity of her current episode
of chest pain, she promptly called an ambulance and was brought
to the hospital. She underwent a cradiac catheterization which
revealed clean coronaries, a patent vein graft and severe aortic
stenosis. She is now being referred to cardiac surgery for a
redo sternotomy with aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 30 %). There is significant inferoseptal,
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The RCC is severely
calcified and immobile. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:

The patient has been extubated, and there has been removal of
orogastric tube, pulmonary arterial catheter, chest tubes, and
mediastinal drains. A right IJ sheath remains in unchanged
position. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are
again noted, in unchanged position and alignment.

The lung volumes are lower. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right, with bibasilar atelectasis, worst in the
retrocardiac
region and increased from prior study. There is no opacity to
suggest
pneumonia. Prior left pneumothorax has resolved. Mediastinal
contours are
stable, with expected post-operative widening and stable
cardiomegaly.
Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Calcification of the
aortic knob is re-demonstrated.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of numerous supportive and
monitoring devices.  Decreased lung volumes, with bilateral left
greater than right effusions and associated atelectasis.
Resolution of prior left pneumothorax. Decreased
vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] was a same day admit and on [**2126-10-15**] was brought
directly to the operating room where she underwent a
redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
note for surgical details.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.

Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. Pt went into afib post op. Amio
was started. pt in afib longer then 24 hrs. Coumadin was
iniated, and now on a amio taper with coumadin for new onset
afib.The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. Gently diuresed toward her preop weight.  She proved
to be somewhat sensitive to coumadin and was treated with FFP
when she was supratherapeutic.

By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.Target INR
2.0-2.5 for A Fib. First blood draw tomorrow [**10-26**].
