production and transferred to MICU for need for NIPPV.
.
Roughtly one week prior to admission reports gradual onset nasal
congestion, Patient called [**Company 191**] triage on [**1-24**] with c/o that
congestion had progressed to his chest, and noted associated
thick secretions.

ECGs:

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2206-1-25**]  8:07:40 PM

Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression, probable normal variant.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2206-1-25**] the sinus rate is slower. The findings are
otherwise similar.


Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2206-1-25**]  7:09:08 AM

Baseline artfact. Probable sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave
progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities, although artifact makes
interpretation difficult. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2204-5-10**] sinus tachycardia and artifact are new.

IMAGING:

- Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2206-1-27**] at 1:56:18 PM      FINAL
-

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow
identified. Dilated ascending aorta.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on [**2203**]
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or
a change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year; if
previously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is
suggested in [**12-27**] years.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 54 year old man with history of current tobacco
use, severe end-stage COPD on home O2 of 2-4L NC, admitted to
the MICU for COPD exacerbation, requiring NIPPV on presentation.

# COPD Exacerbation
Patient was admitted for COPD exacerbation, initially to MICU
for non-invasive ventilation, then transitioned back to nasal
canula over one day.  Patient reports that last exacerbation was
about six months ago, for which he was not hospitalized, but he
created his own prednisone taper based on symptoms, which lasted
a couple of months.  Patient was initially started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of potential LLL
pneumonia.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued in MICU because
pneumonia was felt to be unlikely.  He required albuterol
nebulizers every 2 hours in the MICU, transitioned to every 6
hours on the floor.  He was also started on prednisone 60mg
daily on admission, transitioned to 40mg daily after 4 days.
Prednisone taper as follows:  prednisone 40mg x 4 more days,
then decrease to prednisone 30mg x 6 days, then prednisone 20mg
x 6 days, then prednisone 10mg x 6 days, then back to home dose
of prednisone 10mg every other day.  Patient may uptitrate for
symptoms if needed, but he should call primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] if doing so.  He would like to join outpatient
pulmonary rehab at [**Hospital1 18**] once he meets requirements for smoking
cessation.  Followup appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was set up.
He was also started on alendronate in setting of chronic
prednisone use.

# Tobacco Use
Patient was counseled extensively on smoking cessation.  He will
use nicotine patches at home, starting with 21mg/day patches,
which he states he already has.  He was seen by social work for
extra support.

# DM2
Patient was well controlled on home metformin, but had a few
elevated blood sugars while on high dose steroids.  He was
maintained on insulin sliding scale during hospitalization, but
transitioned back to metformin 500mg daily on discharge.  Blood
sugars should be monitored while on prednisone taper.

# Hypertension
Patient with elevated blood pressures at primary care office on
multiple occasions, not on any medications yet.  Had moderately
elevated blood pressures during hospitalization, ranging
120s-160s systolic.  Will defer starting low dose [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to
primary care physician.

# Depression
Patient became anxious after discussion about severity of his
COPD.  Spoke with social work for extra support. Continued on
home venlafaxine.

Transitional Issues:
- smoking cessation
- dilated aortic root seen on TTE (which was done in MICU to
look for dCHF as potential etiology of shortness of breath) -->
