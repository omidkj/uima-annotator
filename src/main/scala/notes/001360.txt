History of Present Illness:
Initial history and physical is as per ICU team.
.
This is a 48 year-old male with a history of ischemic CM (EF
15%), s/p CCY 5 years ago who initially presented to [**Hospital3 25354**] with mid abdominal pain and jaundice, found to
have CBD dilated to 8mm on ultrasound.  He reports that he
developed mid severe abdominal pain ("gassy") beginning after
dinner on [**10-6**].  He denies N/V/diarrhea prior to admission, but
notes few nonbloody loose stools since admission because he has
not been able to eat.  He further denies chest pain, cough.  He
has had no dysuria or urinary frequency.  He denies change in
skin, scleral color.  He does endorse diffuse pruritis.  Labs on
presentation revealed t. bili of 2.5-->5, alk phos 199, ALT/AST
32/28. WBC was 11K with 5% bands and he was febrile to 102.
Subsequent CT abd/pelvis at [**Hospital3 **] showed CBD dilated to
2cm.  He was started on IV unasyn and flagyl was added for c.
diff coverage given recent hospitalization and abdominal pain.
During his 2 day stay, his creatinine bumped from 1.1 on
admission to 2.7 on day of transfer.  Additionally, he normally
has SBPs in the 90s, but had readings into the 70s prior to
transfer at which time he was asymptomatic.
.
He is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP out of concern for
retained stone.
.
ROS: As above.  Additionally, the patient denies any fevers,
chills, weight change.  His appetite has been okay.  No melena,
hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath.  +2 pillow
orthopnea, no PND.  No lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal
weakness, vision changes, headache, rash (does endorse diffuse
pruritis).
.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year-old male with a history of CAD and ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who presented with abdominal pain and
jaundice with CBD dilatation on imaging.
.
1. Jaundice:  Possible etiologies included acute hepatitis C
versus cholangitis versus choledocolithiasis.  There was
evidence of CBD dilatation on OSH imaging.  Interestingly
however, he wa found to be only mildly tender over RUQ rather
the majority of his discomfort is mid abdomen.  No
rebound/guarding.  T.bili elevation now to 11.5 (normal alk
phos). Could not perform MRCP to further evaluateas patient with
AICD.  Unfortunately an ERCP could not be done because he had a
platelet count of 9 at admission.  he was continued on Unasyn
while in the hospital.  The patient was to be treated/worked up
further but he signed out AMA.
.
2. Thrombocytopenia:  Heme/Onc was consulted for differential
including platelet clumping, DIC, TTP-HUS, medication induced.
No schistocytes were seen on smear.  Unclear whether he received
SC heparin at OSH, but likely used there for prophylaxis.
Platelets at OSH were in the 250s and here, one day later, down
to 9 -> seems less c/w HIT.  Heme/Onc feels this is most c/w ITP
given lack of schistocytes on peripheral smear.  HITT antibody
was negative. The patient recevied was started on steroids.  He
unfortunately signed out AMA before we could evaluate for a
clinical response.
.
3. ARF:  Cr of 1.3 per OSH reports, but 2.1 on initial
presentation.  Creatinine had risen to 2.7 but now normalized
with IVF.  Concerning in the setting of his thrombocytopenia and
fever would be TTP-HUS, but appears to be pre-renal.  Urine
lytes c/w this.
.
4. Hypotension:  Baseline SBPs per patient run 80s-90s.  Had
dipped as low as 70 systolic per OSH but patient was
assymptomatic.  SBPs currently low 90s but suspect this was
related to his severe cardiomyopathy.  Had previous concern for
infectious cause with fever at outside hospital but afebrile
since admit here.  Responded to IVF.
.
5. Chronic systolic CHF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
15%):  Appeared to be well compensated.  The patients
antihypertensive meds and diuretics were initaially held because
of relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) **] will restart them as an outpatient.
.
6. CAD: Held beta blocker b/c of hypotension, held ASA for ERCP,
held statin d/t LFT abnormalities.
.
7. PUD:  Given pt was on PPI as outpatient at which time
platelets were normal, this seemed to be a very unlikely cause
of the patients thrombocytopenia.  PPI was continued.

# Dispo: The patient unfortunately signed out AMA.  On the
morning he left, the patient was dressed and was about to walk
out the door when the nurse stopped him.  I spent about one hour
talking to the patient trying to talk him out of signing out of
the hospital.  Hr told me that he was frustrated about his whole
medical course.  He was frustrated that he was transferred from
Loweell general for a procedure adn that it hasn't been done.  I
explained to the pt that an ERCp could not be done because of
the risks associated with his low platelet counts and that an
MRCP could not be done because of his pacemaker.  I explained to
him that his biggest problem was hi low platelet count and how
we were trying to fix it with steroids.  I explained to the
patient that he would likely DIE if he left AMA.  I warned him
that he was at very high risk of spontaneous ble
