None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: Source: Interviewed daughter through [**Name2 (NI) **] translater:
[**Age over 90 **] YO woman with pmhx only significant for lower extremity
arthritis p/w with SOB.  Pt was in usual state of poor health,
typically cared for dressed/fed/bathed by daughter, when being
assisted to bathroom developed acute SOB.  Tried using
isosorbide and korvalol and valokardin (2 [**Age over 90 **] meds) to
alleviate SOB without effect. Typically has 3-4 episodes of
similar SOB but resolves with medication.  She otherwise denied
recent fever/chills, has had chronic cough w/o sputum
production.  Does affirm 2 pillow orthopnea, denies PND,  Denied
CP/N/V.  On ROS: does have chronic swelling of lower extremity.

Pt last visited Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18685**] 1 wk ago was told she had mild
anemia, and should add iron, o/w no issues. D/W Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18685**] who
will fax latest blood work, otherwise does not acknowledge any
other pmhx.

ECG [**2150-10-27**] 7:36 am: Sinus tachycardia at rate 114
Ventricular premature complex
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities
Poor R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition - is
nonspecific Clinical correlation is suggested No previous
tracing available for comparison
.
ECG [**2150-10-27**] 6:20 pm: Sinus rhythm
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities
Anterior myocardial infarction - possible acute/recent/in
evolution
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged Q-Tc interval -
cannot exclude in part metabolic/drug effect in addition to
ischemia
Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of the
same date, further ST-T wave changes and Q-Tc interval
prolongation present

Tape Number: 2005W467-0:11
Test Location: West [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] [**2-12**]
Technical Quality: Adequate
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.8 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 3.9 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex -
akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - hypo; lateral
apex - akinetic; apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Cannot
assess regional RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include apical, apical, mid anterior
and mid anteroseptal hypokinesis with apical inferolateral
akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

ECG [**2150-10-29**]: Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Abnormal R wave progression - is nondiagnostic but consider
anterior myocardial infarct, age indeterminate
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged Q-Tc interval -
cannot exclude in part ischemia, metabolic/drug effect or
possible central nervous system event. Since previous tracing of
[**2150-10-28**], no significant change
.
ECG [**2150-10-30**]: Sinus rhythm. The QTc interval is prolonged. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave changes most likely
due to left ventricular hypertrophy. There is a late transition
which is also most likely due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
