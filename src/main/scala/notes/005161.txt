SDH with shift

History of Present Illness:
Patient intubated and sedated, history obtained from record and
patient's family

Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 21 y/o man with no PMH as per his family, who is
transferred from OSH for R SDH with shift. He was found by EMS
laying at the side of the road and was reportedly confused and
combative. It is unclear exactly what happened to the patient,
per notes he was struck by a car but he was not found to have
any
other injuries that would suggest this means of injury. He was
intubated by EMS at the scene. He was noted to have a blown
right
pupil at the OSH and given this finding and the head CT, he was
given Mannitol 50 gm. At the OSH, he was also loaded with
Dilantin and received 125 mg solumedrol, vecuronium 10 mg and
ativan. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2192-10-15**]
1. Since the prior examination, interval development of
intraventricular
hemorrhage at the junction of the cerebral aqueduct and fourth
ventricle.
Stable ventricular size and configuration without evidence of
hydrocephalus.
2. Redistribution of a right subdural hemorrhage, which does not
appear to be increased in size, and maybe slightly decreased.
Minimal to no leftward
midline shift. Slight medial prominence of the right uncus, very
early uncal herniation cannot be excluded.
3. Contrast limits evaluation, though within these limitations,
new areas of linear high attenuation in the left frontal region
and right sylvian fissure, may be due to subarachnoid hemorrhage
vs contrast in vessel. Attention at follow-up.
4. Loss of sulcation (although young patient) suggests stable
diffuse
cerebral edema, with preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2192-10-16**]
1. Right subdural hemorrhage, smaller and redistributed since
the prior
examination. It measures approximately 6 mm in maximal
transverse dimension.
2. Further washout of intravenous contrast with no convincing
evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. Stable focus of intraventricular hemorrhage at the junction
of the
cerebral aqueduct/fourth ventricle with stable size and
configuration of the ventricular system and no developing
hydrocephalus.
4. Some degree of diffuse cerebral edema with sulcal effacement-
correlate
with ICP measurements. Follow up as clinically indicated.

CT head [**2192-10-17**]:
1. Subdural hemorrhage along the right cerebral convexity is
less extensive and decreased in density since most recent study
of [**2192-10-16**]. No new focus of hemorrhage is noted.
2. Right frontal approach intracranial pressure monitoring
device is unchanged in position.

CT c-spine [**2192-10-17**]
No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment

MRI C-spine [**2192-10-18**]
Moderate upper cervical prevertebral soft tissue swelling,
certainly could be posttraumatic in etiology. No sign of
cervical cord
injury. Possible minimal traumatic disc injury at C6/7, as noted
above.

MRI Brain [**2192-10-18**]:
The principal vascular flow patterns are identified.
There is a very shallow (1 mm) residual right cerebral convexity
subdural
hemorrhage, overlying the right temporal and parietal lobes.
There is moderate mucosal thickening and/or fluid within the
mastoid sinuses, which presumably reflects the intubated status
of the patient, as well as fluid accumulating within the nasal
and oropharyngeal portions. There is a minimal degree of mucosal
thickening seen within the sphenoid sinus.
CONCLUSION: Extensive areas of restricted diffusion, of concern
for anoxic
damage. Other findings noted above.

CTA NECK [**2192-10-18**]:
Normal CTA of the head and neck.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2192-10-20**]:
Continued diffuse cerebral edema. The apparent hyperdensity
along sulci may be likely due to brain edema. No acute
hemorrhage.

CXR [**2192-10-24**]:
opacification in the left lower lobe consistent with pneumonia

[**2192-10-24**] LENS
no DVT

[**2192-10-25**]
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow
background. There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no
definite
epileptiform features. There was an occasional tachycardia.

[**2192-10-29**] KUB
PFI: Normal bowel gas pattern.

Brief Hospital Course:
21 y/o M found down on side of road by EMS, ? of assault,
presents from OSH with R SDH and cerebral edema. Patient was
admitted to neurosurgery for further management. A bolt ICP
monitor was placed at bedside with opening pressure of 10.
Mannitol x1 was given at OSH and d/t normal ICP, no further
mannitol was given. On examination, patient's pupils were
PERRLA, EO to noxious stimuli and w/d all 4 extremities. On
[**10-16**], patient's head CT showed improvement, ICPs still within
normal range and exam unchanged. He is intubated and c-collar in
place. He has also been febrile with Tmax of 102.3. He was
pancultured.

On [**10-17**] his dilantin level was 9.4. He required mannitol
overnight for increase in ICP's, as he was on a large amoumt of
sedation. CT was performed and this was stable. His WBC count
was 9.1 and he was febrile to 102 overnight. With increase in
sedation, his ICP was 15 in pm.

On [**10-18**], his ICP was well controlled and his bolt was removed
and the ancef was discontinued. His sputum was thought to be
cause of his fever. Cultures were sent. He was cleared for SQH.
Mannitol was decreased to 75TID. A family meeting was held. and
MRI brain and C-spine were discussed. It was decided that if he
was not awake enough to be extubated on [**10-19**] he should have a
trach/peg. His CTA of the neck was a normal imaging study.

On [**10-20**], the patient had a repeat CT for decreased mental
status today, showing continued diffuse cerebral edema and hyper
density along sulci likely due to brain edema. There was no
evidence of hemorrhage. The patient continued to have a poor
neurologic exam off propofol gtt.

On [**10-21**], his exam remained unchanged off propofol sedation.
Fentanyl boluses were intermittently given for pain control and
agitation. Mannitol was discontinued.

On [**10-23**], percutaneous tracheostomy was performed along with a
PEG tube for nutrition was inserted without issue.

On [**10-24**], patient continued to have intermittent low grade
fevers, with episodic hypertension and tachycardia. A BAL was
performed. Empiric antibiotic coverage was initiated for
ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as a UTI. HE was on
Cipro, Vancomycin and Cefepime.

On [**10-25**] he was tolerating a trach mask well and was transferred
to the step down unit.

On [**10-26**] his fever curve was declining, he vanco trough was low
so his dose was increased to 1GM tid. His BAL grew out Hflu so
his antibiotics were tailored to only Vanco and Cefepime.
