Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
vagus nerve stimulator generator replacement [**2196-1-28**]
pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain [**2196-1-29**]

History of Present Illness:
Please see original Neurology Admission Note and MICU [**Location (un) **]
Transfer Note for details.
.
Briefly, 47 y/o man with long standing history of epilepsy s/p
right temporal lobectomy (at age 19) and VNS placement (7 years
ago), h/o EtOH and cocaine abuse who was having increased
seizure frequency in the setting of VNS malfunction. He was
admitted on [**1-28**] for elective replacement of the vagus nerve
stimulator generator.  The procedure went without complication.
Overnight he developed AF with RVR to the 180s with hypotension
to the 80s.  CIWA was 17 with last drink approximately 72 hours
prior. Patient was also noted to be [**Doctor Last Name **] with a CIWA of 17
and is thought that last EtOH drink was 72 hours ago.  He
received 2mg IV ativan with somnolence and apenea afterwards.
He was subsequently transferred to the MICU.
.
His MICU course was notable for an echocardiogram which showed a
large pericardial effusion on [**1-29**].  He was seen by the
cardiology fellow and subsequently underwent pericardial window.
450cc of bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Patient developed
SVT in the cath lab and was treated with 9 mg IV metoprolol. He
was transferred to CCU postprocedurally for monitoring.
.
On arrival, patient complained of spinal back pain from lying on
the operating table. He also reports that his lungs feel
"collapsed" but denied shortness of breath.
.
Review of systems was otherwise negative.

Social History:

STUDIES:
.
ECHO [**2196-1-28**]:
.
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm)
with 35-50% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure
(10-15mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTIC VALVE: No AS.

MITRAL VALVE: No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate to large pericardial effusion. No RA
diastolic collapse. No RV diastolic collapse.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The rhythm appears to be atrial flutter. Echocardiographic
patient.

Poor image quality.The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg with IVC dilation (2.5 cm). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function
appears mildly depressed. There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV with borderline normal free wall function. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
moderate to large sized pericardial effusion (greatest
anteriorly and best seen in the subcostal view). No right atrial
diastolic collapse is seen. No right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen (mild RV compression in the subcostal view is
suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure).
.
Cardiac cath [**1-29**]:
COMMENTS:
Under fluoroscopic guidance, 450 CC of bloody pericardial fluid
was
obtained through subxiphoid approach. Intrapericardial origin of
fluid
was confirmed with contrast injection and intrapericardial
pressure
measurement. Initial pericardial pressure was elevated at 21 mm
Hg and
dropped to 3 mm Hg after remorval of fluid. Pericaridal drain
was
sutured in place for 24 hours.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful urgent pericardiocentesis through subxiphoid
approach for
impending pericardial temponade
.
ECHO [**2196-1-30**]
IMPRESSION: Small amount of echodense pericardial material/fluid
is seen. No evidence of tamponade. Probable regional LV systolic
dysfunction. Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.

Compared with the prior studies (images reviewed) of [**2196-1-29**]
and [**2194-7-23**], the appearance of the pericardium is similar to
that of the post-tap echo yesterday. The basal to mid
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis was probably present in [**2194**]
but image quality is poor on all studies. The right ventricle
appears dilated on studies from yesterday and today - it was
probably normal in [**2194**].

.
LENI'S [**2196-2-1**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler images of the bilateral common femoral, superficial and
deep femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained. There is
non-occlusive thrombus in the mid left popliteal vein and left
peroneal veins, as well as the right posterior tibial vein. The
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and right
popliteal veins demonstrated normal compressibility and
wall-to-wall color flow.

IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in left popliteal, left
peroneal, and
right posterior tibial veins.

CT TORSO [**2196-2-1**] (PRELIM)
1. Pulmonary embolism involving right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] posterior basal
segmental
and subsegmental branches, and subsegmental branch of left lower
[**Month/Day/Year 3630**] anterior
basal pulmonary artery.
2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.
3. Evidence of right heart strain, manifest as reflux of IV
contrast into the
IVC and hepati
