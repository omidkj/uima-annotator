HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old woman who
was transferred on [**5-1**], from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with
abdominal pain.  She had been admitted at the outside
hospital on [**2144-4-18**], and had at that time complaints
of right sided shoulder pain and was found to have asthmatic
bronchitis, and then subsequently found to have Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  Also, she was
treated for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia with Vancomycin.  She had this worsening abdominal
pain and it was decided to be transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up of this.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   During her admission to the Medical
Service, the patient had a General Surgical consultation
which was done on [**2144-5-2**].  The initial impression was
two weeks of abdominal pain with a differential including
ischemic colitis, infectious colitis such as with C.
difficile, diverticulitis.  The patient unfortunately was
unable to take intravenous contrast so her CT scans that were
obtained were all without intravenous contrast making bowel
wall and ischemia more difficulty to diagnose in her case.

The GI Service was following her very carefully as well.  The
patient underwent aggressive intravenous hydration.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was the initial surgical attending of record.  Most of
her pain was in her left lower quadrant and suprapubic.  She
also had some bloody diarrhea and progressive abdominal
distention, which was concerning prior to her transfer to us,
at the outside hospital.  The CT scan of the abdomen that had
been obtained showed a thickened sigmoid.  Barium enema
showed some mucosal ulcerations.

She, during her hospitalization up to the [**5-3**], had
been treated with antibiotics including Vancomycin, Ceptaz
and Flagyl.  The patient had been passing flatus and had
liquid stools.  On abdominal examination she was soft and
moderately distended.  There were no palpable masses
appreciated.  Her rectal examination was guaiac positive with
loose stool present.  There were no palpable masses.  The
patient had a variety of stool studies sent.  She continued
on Levaquin and Flagyl.   Levaquin was added because she was
noted to have a positive urinalysis and for Gram negative
enteric coverage as well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was basically
passing flatus and stool with low grade temperatures and
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] left lower quadrant pain.  The patient
essentially had a PICC placed on [**5-4**], #5 French
dual-lumen large catheter in the right arm.  She did require
a blood transfusion for decreasing hematocrit and was started
on TPN.  She had a pleural fluid tap for an effusion.  She
had a flexible sigmoidoscopy on the 26th.

The flexible sigmoidoscopy showed some pseudomembranes and
the patient was given Flagyl p.o. three times a day.  C.
difficile toxins were sent and the final [**Location (un) 1131**] on the GI
study was an active colitis.  Differential was continued
ischemic versus infectious colitis.

On [**5-6**], she had a right upper extremity ultrasound which
did not show evidence of a venous thrombosis.

All stool cultures were negative.

Of note, incidentally, the patient suffered from audio
toxicity upon her presentation to this hospitalization and it
was unclear exactly the etiology of this audio toxicity as
her hearing was markedly decreased.  After multiple
discussions with the family and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Dr.[**Name (NI) 30985**]
absence, and the GI attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] and their service,
the patient consented to an operation.  Of note, on [**5-7**],
a C. difficile toxin positive but all other things were
negative for C. difficile.

She was taken to the Operating Room after a short trial of
p.o. Vancomycin after the C. difficile toxin became positive.
However, clinically her examination did not improve, so she
was taken to the Operating Room with a preoperative diagnosis
of ischemic colitis and postoperative diagnosis was
gangrenous contained perforated colitis.  She underwent an
exploratory laparotomy on [**2144-5-13**], and had a subtotal
abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy, a Hartmann's sigmoid
procedure and a splenectomy, wash-out of her abdominal
cavity, repair of some serosal injuries to the small
intestine.  The patient's operative findings were that of a
gangrenous contained perforated colon, soilage frankly to the
abdomen, dead splenic flexure adherent to the spleen
requiring splenectomy.

The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.  Her postoperative course was most
remarkable for self-extubation followed by re-intubation
followed by an additional round of elective extubation and
re-intubation, and the patient had been intermittently
treated with Vancomycin for a Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum which she had had at the
outside hospital and was continuing on.  She finally had a
tracheostomy placed for failure to wean off the ventilator.

Her early ostomy functional, patent and productive.  The
patient had been on TPN and was changed to tube feeds at goal
which she tolerated well.  Perioperatively, the patient was
maintained on intravenous Lopressor and gradually she was
switched over to p.o. Lopressor and p.o. Diltiazem, and of
which she had been on a calcium-channel blocker
preoperatively prior to admission.  She has been followed by
Physical Therapy and Nutrition as well as Speech and
Swallowing, which helped place a Passe-Muir valve with some
vocalization but inability to tolerate p.o. and to coordinate
swallowing.

For her Infectious Disease course, she was maintained on
triple antibiotics postoperatively, of Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl, a ten-day course of Vancomycin and
when that was stopped, her white count increased and she
developed fevers ago.  That was restarted after sputum, blood
and urine were sent.  Her blood cultures had been negative.
Her urine grew out Enterococcus which was not thought to be
pathogenic at the time and her sputum continued to grow out
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient was maintained on deep venous thrombosis
prophylaxis of subcutaneous heparin.  She was on Carafate
while intubated, and then she has been on tube feeds at goal.
She is not on any further ulcer prophylaxis.

She received aggressive resuscitation and her postoperative
course involved significant diuresis with maximum of 40 twice
a day of Lasix down to 20 twice a day of NG tube Lasix and
currently she will stop Lasix as she appears to be euvolemic
and has lost all the anasarca that she had accumulated.
