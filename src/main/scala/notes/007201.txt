Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
tongue swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 77yoF with multiple medical problems including
HTN who was started on lisinopril approximately 6m ago who
presented to OSH with right facial swelling that started at 5am.
At the OSH, she was given Benadryl, solumedrol, and Pepcid. This
helped somewhat initially, but then left and tongue swelling
developed. He was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Initial ED vitals:
T 98.8, HR 58, BP 138/84, RR 18, 95% RA. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
initially she got epinephrine, but was ultimately intubated to
protect airway after trying some epi.  She had some hypotension
on propofol, and so sedation was switched to vent/Versed.

Of note, she ate scallops and clams for dinner last night. Her
son does not recall any issues with shelfish in the past,
although she does not eat it terribly frequently because these
foods are often too [**Doctor First Name **] for her. She has a number of medicaion
allergies, although no recent exposure to any of these meds. She
has never had a reaction that has caused throat swelling before
that her son is aware of. She may have had hives before, but her
medication allergies all happened a number of years ago.
.
.
Vitals prior to transfer: T 97, HR 88, BP 146/88, RR 15, 100% on
CMV with FiO2 100%
.
On the floor, she is intubated and sedated. She responds to
voice and is able to follow simple commands.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-9-5**] 1:25 PM
The lungs are low in volume. There is minimal atelectasis in the
left lung
base. Remainder of the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette
is normal. The mediastinal silhouette shows a tortuous aortic
knob. The hilar contours are normal. There may be a small left
pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. An ET tube
terminates with its tip 3 cm above the carina. Multiple clips
are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
IMPRESSION:
Possible small left effusion and left basilar mild atelectasis.
ET tube is appropriate.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F with asthma, HTN, and recurrent episodes of
diverticulitis who presented to OSH with tongue swelling and
despite steroids, histaime blockade, and epi, requried
intubation for airway protections gien worsening angioedema.

# Angioedema: DDx - allergic reaction to shellfish vs ACEi.
ACEi-associated angioedema can happen any time while on the
medication. However, timing is suspicious for allergic etiology.
Pt does appear to have atopic tendencies given asthma and
multiple medication allergies. Lisinopril was added to her
allergy list, and she was told to avoid shellfish. She was
intubated in the ED secondary to severe angioedema. He was
started on 80mg q8 x 24H. She received Benadryl 25mg Q6H, for
the first 24 hours, then had it stopped. Morning after her
admission, her tongue swelling resolved and she was extubated
successfully, started on PO prednisone taper. Patient satting
well on RA and eating a regular diet. She will need follow-up
with allergy to flesh out her reaction, but likely to ace
inhibitors given that shellfish didn't give her trouble in past
and that rxn happened the next morning after a dinner meal.
Also, if her angioedema was secondary to a mast-cell mediated
anaphylactic reaction, we would have expected her to respond to
epinephrine, which she did not.

# asthma: Pt did not require intubation for any intrinsic
pulmonary process. Prior to transfer to the floor she was
satting well on room air. Continue her inhalers with budesonide.

# HTN: Pt was hypotensive in the setting of propofol. H/H in ED
looked hemoconcentrated, improved after 1L NS in ED. Pressures
120s-130s in the unit, but she had low UOP overnight and was
given 2L NS. Her HCTZ was held initially.

# GERD: Pantoprazole IV while intubated. Changed to PO after
extubation.

# s/p ERCP: Held cholestyramine while NPO.

# Cataracts: Her son brought her eye drops in and she used her
own medications while in house.

Pending Tests: none.

Transitional Issues:
Patient will have follow up appt with allergist/pcp. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] stop
ace inhibitors indefintiely.
