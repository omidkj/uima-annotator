History of Present Illness:
 86 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, s/p PM who p/w
SOB/dizziness. Pt reports getting home from the store this
afternoon ~3:30 pm, then went to sit outside when he started to
feel dizzy, lightheaded. Tried to stand up, felt like he was
going to pass out, went inside to rest. Dizziness persisted,
felt like room was spinning. Then felt SOB and anxious. Also
noted lower sternal CP - sharp, radiating to toes. No N/V or
diaphoresis. Called EMS who brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Of note, his medications were changed 2 days ago - amlodipine
d/c'd and started on flomax 0.4 mg Qhs which he has now had x 2
days. He denies any dietary indiscretions in the past few days,
but he had had increased fluid intake. He was outside alot over
the past weekend and has been drinking copious amounts of fluid
over the past few days to stay hydrated. He is able to walk
about 1 block w/o difficulty, his baseline, and denies any DOE,
CP, PND, palpitations, LE edema or other new sx in the past few
weeks. Stable 1 pillow orthopnea.
.
In the ED, he was noted to be htn at 181/99 and mildly hypoxic,
put on 2 liters O2. He was given Asa 325 mg po, nitro 0.4mg SL x
1, lasix 80 mg IV, and MSO4 4 mg IV with improvement of
symptoms. Chest pain resolved with nitro gttp. Several attempts
made to wean nitro gttp but he did not tolerate [**3-5**] recurrent
CP. He put out 2500 cc urine in response to lasix in ED.
.
At time of eval, he denies any chest pain. SOB now back to
baseline. No other c/o.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-6-30**] 5:47 PM
.
COMPARISON: None.
SINGLE PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a
left-sided pacemaker with leads in standard position. The
patient is status post median sternotomy. There is cardiomegaly.
Thoracic aorta is unfolded. There is prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature. There is an ill-defined opacity at the right base.
No pleural effusions are clearly identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with slightly prominent pulmonary vasculature
consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
2. Opacity in the right lower lobe could represent vascular
crowding or atelectasis, early pneumonia is a possibility.
Correlate clinically.
...............................................................
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-7-1**] 7:06 AM
.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-30**]:
Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion have
improved and right lower lobe abnormality has cleared,
indicating as was asymmetric edema, not pneumonia. Transvenous
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in
their standard placements. Transvenous right ventricular lead
and a transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are
also unchanged in their positions. The proximal electrode on the
defibrillator lead ends in the right atrium. Clinical assessment
is advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, s/p PM who
presented with worsened dyspnea/dizziness.  On presentation, the
patient was hypertensive, tachypneic saturating 90-92 on RA and
96-98 on 4L.  He complained of R sided chest pain and was placed
on nitroglycerin drip.  Exam notable for elevated JVP and
crackles on lung exam.  EKG revealed no ischemic changes and
cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.   He was aggressively
diuresed in ED (2.5 L diuresed over 3 hrs, but was unable to be
weaned off of the nitroglycerin.  He was then admitted to the
coronary care unit for CHF management and further
evaluation/treatment.

The patient was successfully weaned off the nitroglycerin drip.
Further diurese overnight was withheld given the aggressive
diuresis in EDHis oxygen saturation improved with resolution of
his tachypnea He ruled out for MI by enzymes and lack of EKG
changes.  His chest pain seemed, in part, related to anxiety and
to abdominal pain (RUQ pain may have been secondary to liver
engorgement from CHF).  His pain was controlled with morphine
and ativan.  He was given IV lasix the following morning.  It
was believed the patient would be best served by transferring
him to the [**Hospital1 2025**] where had been getting all his previous
cardiology care.
.
In summary, this is an 86 year old gentleman with CAD status
post CABG, CHF, s/p BiV pacemaker admitted with CHF
exacerbation.  He responded well to diuresis with lasix and
ruled out for myocardial infarctionl.  His respiratory status
improved and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He
was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] where his primary
cardiologist is located.

Issues and plan from this hospitalization.

.
Cardiac: Primary cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56024**], affiliated with
[**Hospital1 2025**].
1. CHF - Pt with CHF, unknown EF, presented with CHF
exacerbation. This is most likely due to excess fluid intake -
reports drinking copious fluids over the weekend while outside
in the heat. This combined with recent med change may have led
to decompensation in his CHF. Now s/p 2500 cc fluid diuresis in
ED, appears grossly euvolemic.  Given 2500 cc diuresis in the
span of 2 hours in the ED, was not further diuresesd overnight.
Initially on nitro drip overnight, weaned off on day of
transfer. Continued on beta blocker and ace inhibitor. Digoxin
initially held and then restarted after level returned. Cardiac
enzymes cylced to r/o ischemic etiology and have been negative
thus far. TSH was within normal limits.  Patient's fluid status
was monitored and he was fluid restricted. No ECHO data in the
system as patient recieves most of his care at [**Hospital1 2025**]. Records had
not been received at time of transfer.
.
2. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**]. Apparently had cath
since then (? [**2170**]), but records still unavailable (gets care at
[**Hospital1 2025**]). He does describe chest pain here, assoc w/ SOB and
relieved by nitro, however, it is not his typical anginal pain.
He is also extemely anxious with his pain. Cardiac enzymes
negative  x 2, and EKG shows paced rhythm (no prior for
comparison). He was continued on asa, statin, beta blocker and
an ace inhibitor.  Patient had an episode of sharp [**11-10**] burning
substernal/epigastric pain on [**7-1**] which developed after lunch
and lasted several minutes. Patient was also feeling short of
breath at the time, however, was maintaining his O2 sats at 100%
on 2 L NC. He received one SL nitro but by the time he received
the pain had already started to subside. The pain seemed to
resolved with belching. The patient was given Maalox.
