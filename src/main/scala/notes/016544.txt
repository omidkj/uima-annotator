[**2138-7-25**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and
epinephrine and is being v paced.
1. A well-seated mechanical valve is seen in the aortic position
with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 18
mmHg). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. LV function is slightly depressed (global). LVEF= 45%
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Moderate Mitral regurgitation persists.
5. Very poor image quality.

[**2138-8-2**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 55 %).
with normal free wall contractility.
3. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.]
4. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Eccentric posterior directed
jet.
5. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
POST EVACUATION:
Pericardial fluid has been evacuated. No residual loculated
effusion. Ventricles appear better filled.

[**2138-8-6**] CXR
1. No pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
2. Persistent cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. Unchanged left greater than right pleural effusions.



Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital for cardiac surgical
evaluation.  Underwent preoperative workup that included
pulmonary evaluation  Transferred to the operating [****] and
underwent coronary artery bypass graft, aortic valve
replacement, and aortic root enlargement with patch, see
operative report for further details.  He was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  He remained on
vasoactive medications and fluid for decreased blood pressure
and cardiac output.
Was then started on milirone POD 2 for decreased cardiac output
with improvement. He was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated POD 3 without difficulty.  He was then reintubated for
LLL collapse, with left chest tube insertion and bronchscopy
that revealed left main bronchus occlusion with thick
secretions.  He was weaned from pressors but remained on
ventilatory support.  He was bronched again [**7-30**] for thick
secretions right and left bronchus, BAL sent and started on
antibiotics. On POD 8 the patient became hemodynamically
compromised, an echocardiogram at that time revealed signs of
tamponade and he was brought back to the operating room for
exploration and evacuation with releif of tamponade symptoms. He
tolerated the operation well and was again brought to the
cardiac surgery ICU post-op. Over the next several days he
remianed hemodynamically stable was weaned from his inotropes
and pressors and was extubated. He was started on intravenous
heparin for mechanical valve, but coumadin being held until
pacer revision. During this period he was aggressively diuresed,
he remained in the ICU for continued pulmonary toilet and
hemodynamic monitoring. On POD 13/5 he was stable enough to be
transferred to the stepdown floor to await a pacer generator
change.  Patient was brought to the EP lab on [**2138-8-12**] and had an
uneventful generator change and lead revision.  He was restarted
on Coumadin and Heparin the evening of the 26th for mechanical
aortic valve. INR 1.2 on [**2138-8-13**], plan to transfer to LTAC in
[**Location (un) 1110**] so that he may have IV Heparin while his INR becomes
therapeutic.
