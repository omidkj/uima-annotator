Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
insufficiency, and congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 25%, and multiple cerebrovascular accidents, who
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from his
outpatient clinic with an acute worsening of his chronic
renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.  The
three to four days prior to admission, the patient reports
increasing fatigue, decreasing appetite, generalized
weakness, and pruritus.  The patient denies fever, chills,
cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain during this time
period.  The patient reports chronic stable two-pillow
orthopnea with occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The
patient is status post two recent hospitalizations for
congestive heart failure exacerbation and syncopal episode,
with recent changes in his medications including an increase
in his Lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg and the initiation of
amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found afebrile,
with a blood pressure of 88/40, heart rate 64 (irregularly
irregular), and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  The
patient's initial laboratory studies were notable for a
creatinine of 5.8 (baseline creatinine 1.4 to 1.9), potassium
6.4, without electrocardiogram changes, and a urinalysis
suggestive of a urinary tract infection, with normal white
blood cell count.  The patient received 30 grams of
Kayexalate, one amp of calcium gluconate, one amp of
bicarbonate, one amp of D-50 with ten units of regular
insulin, 2 liters normal saline, as well as 2 grams of
ceftriaxone while in the Emergency Department.  The patient
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit secondary to
hemodynamic instability with hypotension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals showed a
temperature of 96.5, heart rate 64 and irregular, blood
pressure 109/76 from 88/44, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air.  In general, the patient is an
obese male, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric
sclerae, extraocular movements intact bilaterally, pupils
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, clear
oropharynx, poor dentition, dry mucous membranes.  Neck
examination:  No jugular venous distention, supple, with no
lymphadenopathy appreciated.  Cardiovascular examination:
Irregularly irregular, with normal rate, normal S1 and S2,
with no murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.  Pulmonary
examination:  Inspiratory crackles at the right base,
otherwise clear to auscultation, with no wheezes or rhonchi.
Abdominal examination:  Obese, nondistended, with normal
active bowel sounds, soft, diffuse mild tenderness to
palpation (chronic), no guarding or rebound, no
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.  Extremities:  No cyanosis,
clubbing, with 2+ right lower extremity edema to the knee and
1+ left lower extremity edema, chronic venous stasis skin
changes, right greater than left, 1+ dorsalis pedis and
anterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, warm and well perfused
distal extremities.  Neurologic examination:  The patient is
awake, alert and aphasic, responding to yes and no questions
with shrugs and nods.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact,
right lower extremity hemiparesis, sensation grossly intact

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, CBC with a white blood cell
count of 11.3, hematocrit 37.7, with an MCV of 90 and
platelets of 324, white blood cell differential with 80.5
polys, 12.0 lymphs, 0.7 monos.  Chem 7 with a sodium of 122,
potassium 5.8 down from 6.4, chloride 93, bicarbonate 17, BUN
87, creatinine 5.8, glucose 114.  Urinalysis notable for
positive nitrite, moderate leukocyte esterase, [**12-19**] white
blood cells, moderate bacteria, [**4-3**] squamous cells, positive
for eosinophils, negative for muddy brown casts.  Urine
culture with greater than 100,000 gram-negative rods,
speciation and sensitivities pending.  Liver function tests
with an ALT of 13, AST 16, alkaline phosphatase 134, total
bilirubin 0.2, amylase 16, lipase 17. Uric acid 11.9.
Electrocardiogram on admission with atrial fibrillation at
79, with left bundle branch block, no acute ST or T wave
changes, unchanged from previous.  Chest x-ray notable for
cardiomegaly with interstitial edema, consistent with
