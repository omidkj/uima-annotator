Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**2171-1-10**] and [**2171-1-13**]


History of Present Illness:
58 y/o female with no significant PMH who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**1-10**] with flu like symptoms. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was treated for a
presumed COPD flare but underwent respiratory decompensation at
that time eventually necessitating intubation for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. Her ABG in the ED was 7.29/47/145. Pt was
treated in the MICU with steroids and azithro. She was extubated
on [**1-13**] but after only 3.5 hours developed tachypnia and
tachycardia requiring reintubation. In further workup, pt's DFA
was negative for flu. A CTA showed severe emphysema and the pt
was continue on steroids and antibiotics. A sputum culture grew
strep pneumonia but the pt did not have an infiltrate on
imaging. On [**1-21**], the pt underwent controlled extubation in the
OR and has been stable from a respiratory standpoint since that
time. Pt failed her speech and swallow eval in the MICU and is
currently receiving tube feeds. On [**1-22**], the pt was called out
to the floor and is being transferred to the APG service at this
time.

Past Medical History:
1. Urinary incontinence

Social History:
Pt is married with two children. She works part time as a travel
[**Doctor Last Name 360**]. Pt has smoked 1 PPD for 40 years. Occasional ETOH. No
drugs.

CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST ([**2171-1-10**]):
REPORT. A good quality CT pulmonary angiogram was obtained. The
CT pulmonary angiogram is negative for pulmonary embolism. There
is mild prominence of the aortic wall on contrast examination
possibly due to anemia. No other evidence of aortic pathology is
seen. There is some mild calcification of the descending
thoracic aorta. The patient is intubated and the tip of the ET
tube is in good position approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
A prominent pericardial recess is seen. A few small pretracheal
lymph nodes and hilar lymph nodes are seen. The largest lymph
node identified is in the right hilum and measures 12 mm in
short axis. Probable small goitre is seen.
There is profound centrilobular and panacinar emphysema present,
particularly in the upper zones, typical of cigarette smoking.
Some small paraseptal change is also identified, particularly
peripherally. Some minor bibasilar atelectasis is identified,
but there is no other pulmonary parenchymal abnormality seen.
The visualized portions of the bones appear normal.
CONCLUSION:
1. Profound emphysematous change.
2. Patient intubated.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Probable mild goiter.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2171-1-10**]:
Sinus tachycardia
Significant baseline artifact precludes accute assessment of ST
segment
Nondiagnostic inferolateral ST-T wave changes
Probably no significant change but suggest follow-up tracing

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2171-1-23**]):
FINDINGS: A single frontal view of the chest is centered over
the mid abdomen. A central venous line overlies the mid SVC. The
NG tube courses well below the diaphragm, although the tip is
not visible for technical reasons. The heart size and
mediastinal contours are stable. The imaged portions of the
lungs appear grossly clear.
IMPRESSION: NG below the diaphragm, tip not visible.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW ([**2171-1-24**]):
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided
for the speech pathologist, who administered barium solid and
liquids of various consistencies to the patient.
There is mild impairment of bolus formation, bolus control and
AP tongue movement, with premature spilling of thin liquids.
There is also consistent penetration and occasional aspiration
of thin liquids. Cough was spontaneous, but only partially
effective. Reduced base of tongue retraction resulted in residue
in the valleculae during the entire examination, for all
consistencies. This was reduced when the patient took a one sip
or swallow at a time, swallowed, cough, and swallowed again.
IMPRESSION:
Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphasia, with aspiration of
thin liquids, and residue in the valleculae for all
consistencies. For more details, please refer to the speech
pathology report of the same date.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2171-1-24**]:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No
AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic  valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial  mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is  normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal study.















Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o female transferred to APG after a prolonged hospital
course for a COPD exacerbation requiring intubation x2. Now much
more stable from a pulmonary standpoint.

1. Respiratory failure- Pt's respiratory failure appears to have
been due to a COPD exacerbation. DFA was negative for flu. No
evidence of a pneumonia. It is very concerning that a lady this
young has such severe emphysema although she does have a long
smoking history. Consider further testing to evaluate as an
outpatient such as an alph-1-antitrypsin. For now, will slowly
taper prednisone over the next week. Continue scheduled inhalers
and PRN nebs. Monitor oxygen status closely and wean oxygen for
saturation equal to or greater than 93%.

2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus- Pt has been newly diagnosed with DM
since admission. Had planned to involve [**Last Name (un) **] and do home
diabetic insulin teaching. However, p
