History of Present Illness:
37 yo female w/ pmhx significant for tuberous sclerosis and
seizure disorder who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Group A strep
bacteremia and possible pneumonia, concern for impending ARDS.
The patient reports that she was feeling in her USH up until
Sunday ([**10-19**]) when she experienced fever, abdominal pain,
nausea and emesis. The pt continued to feel poorly and went to
the ED on Monday ([**10-20**]), where she was found to be febrile up
to 104 RR 24 and tachycardic HR 137. WBC with 10 K wbc and 11 %
bands. She had an abnormal UA c 5 wbc . CxR was nl. The pt was
admitted for IV antibiotics/ and hydration to treat possible
pneumonia/UTI .She was given Ceftriaxone and LEvofloxacin.
Patient remained persistently febrile and on [**10-21**] her
respiratory status worsened. She was subsequently transferred to
MICU for monitoring. Never intubated. Blood cultures from [**10-20**]
turned positive for Group A strep, and the patient was started
on Ceftriaxone/ Clinda/ and PCN G. Urine culture with gropu B
streptococcus. Non contrast abdominal CT revealed markedly
enlarged R kidney w/ numerous adipose tissue densities, no air
fluid levels/ gas present, enlarged spleen. ID consult was
obtained, and the etiology of strep A was undetermined. It was
recommended that she be started on IV Ig and possibly APC, and
an MRI be obtained to further characterize renal lesion.
.
On arrival the patient denies any difficulty breathing. Reports
some flank pain on the right. No N/V, no chest pain. + feeling
LH. Recent loose stools, denies blood in stool.

aches or joint pains, had a non productive cough, no headache,
n/v. No recent trauma, wounds, areas of skin breakdown

CXR:
 Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
Interval improvement on the right.  Persistent left effusion.

US kidneys:
1.  Grossly deformed and enlarged right kidney due to the
presence of multiple
AMLs. The largest is at the upper pole measuring over 11 cm but
showing no
signs of hemorrhage.  In the middle third of the right kidney,
there is an
indeterminate lesion measuring 4.3 cm.  This may be a somewhat
lipid poor AML
but further evaluation is recommended with MRI to exclude
possible renal cell
carcinoma, since we have no other studies for comparison.

Small bilateral effusions and status post left nephrectomy.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal, and  there is right-to-left flow of saline contrast,
indicating a patent foramen  ovale. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are  normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve  leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no  aortic regurgitation. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.  The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is  normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Normal global and
regional
biventricular systolic function. Patent foramen ovale.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:
36 yo F with tuberous sclerosis presents with Group A Strep
bacteremia, sepsis now resolved.
.
# Bacteremia: Unclear the source of her Strep A group
bacteremia, echo without vegatations. Pt will need to continue
Pen G. Has PICC line placed. will continue PCN 4 MU IV Q4H for
coverage for 14 days total.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient hypoxic on admission, requiring NRB to
maintain O2 sats. Likely due to paneumonia or early ARDS. was
put on albuterol/ atrovent nebs. was weaned off O2. was satting
well on RA at discharge
.
# Renal CT scan findings: pt w/ fatty infiltrate on CT scan
(w/out contrast) from OSH. Reviewed w/ our radiologists, who
believed the fatty infiltrate likely represents angiomyolipoma,
c/w her h/o tuberous sclerosis. Could get MRI for further
imaging as outpatient
.
# H/o Seizure d/o: continued home lamotrigine
.
# Proph: pneumoboots, SC Heparin
.
# F/E/N: ADAT, moniter and replete lytes PRN
