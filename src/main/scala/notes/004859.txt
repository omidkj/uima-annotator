CXR ([**2103-3-21**]): Endotracheal tube remains in place, terminating
approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and
pacemaker leads remain in place. Again, note is made of mild
cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is tortuous. Again, note is made of
CHF with interstitial edema. Note is made of left lower lobe
consolidation, associated with effusion, increased compared to
the prior study. Marked degeneration of right shoulder is noted.

ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2096-3-26**], there has been no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. PNA/SEPSIS:  pt was admitted w/ lethargy and was suspected to
have infectious cause.  Given hx of cough, [**Date Range **], elevated WBCs,
and infiltrate on CXR, she was dx with community-acquired PNA.
She met MUST criteria for sepsis (a. suspected infection, b.
[**Date Range **] > 100.4 and elevated WBCs, c. lactate > 4.0) secondary to
PNA.  Urine did not suggest UTI.  Pt is s/p colostomy, however
no apparent GI Sx on admission.  No other source evident.  She
was empirically tx w/ceftriaxone + azithromycin to begin a 14
day course for community aquired pna, and with metronidazole for
possible aspiration pna given ms changes of unknown duration
before admission.  She was initially admitted to the ICU and was
intubated and treated w/ mechanical ventilation for respiratory
support.  On HD#2, the pt showed respiratory improvement and was
extubated.  She was then transferred out to the Medicine floor
for further care.  Sputum culture & Gram stain; Legionella
culture, Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture; Influenza A/B
by DFA; Blood culture; Urine culture and U/A were all negative.
NP aspirate viral culture was positive for influenza B, so the
pt was placed on droplet precautions on the medical floor.  She
showed progressive improvement in her resp status w/ antibiotic
rx.  She was afebrile for >72 hours before d/c.  Her O2
requirement decreased progressively during her admission; at
d/c, she is maintaining O2 saturation >96% on 1 liter per minute
of O2 by NC.  She has persistent cough controlled w/ tessalon
perles and dextromethorphan w/ codeine to allow sleep.  CXR on
the day before d/c showed improvement in pulm vascular
congestion, but persistent LLL infiltrate.  At d/c, she has
completed 7 days of ceftriaxone and flagyl.  Ceftriaxone will be
changed to levaquin upon d/c.  She will need to continue
levaquin and flagyl for 7 days after d/c to complete a total 14
day course of abx.

2. ACIDOSIS:  On admission AG=15.5, lactate=4.5, delta-delta=0,
thus a primary lactic acidosis, secondary to sepsis.  After
treatment w/ abx and fluid resuscitation, her anion gap
resolved, but she was left w/ a non-gap metabolic acidosis,
which was hyperchloremic and most likely [**1-17**] normal saline
administration.  Renal fxn was monitored and the pt's acidosis
resolved spontaneously before d/c.  At d/c, there is no evidence
of metabolic acidosis, and anion gap is normal.

3. RENAL FAILURE:  she had acute on chronic renal failure on
admission, w/ creat increased above baseline of 1.3.  This was
likely [**1-17**] ATN as a complication of sepsis.  FENA was 2.3%,
supporting a dx of ATN.  She was treated supportively, w/ IV
fluids as needed to maintain hydration, and renal fxn improved
to baseline by d/c.  At d/c, creatinine is at baseline of 1.3.

4. NSTEMI:  she has no h/o CAD, but was observed to have
elevated CK and troponin on admission diagnostic of NSTEMI.  She
never had chest pain or EKG changes during her admission.  Upon
discovery of elevated troponin, the pt was started on heparin
gtt and completed 48 hours of heparin therapy for NSTEMI.  She
was also treated w/ daily ASA.  Low dose metoprolol was added
during this admission, which she has tolerated well.  Cardiac
enzymes were followed until they peaked and began to trend down.
 At d/c, there is no evidence of active ischemia.  The pt should
continue ASA, metoprolol after d/c.  Her
