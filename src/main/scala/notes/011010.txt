Perforated Bowel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
65 F h/o DM-2, refractory Crohn's diagnosed in [**2158**] p/w severe
abdominal pain.  She has a history of Crohn's colitis and is
currently undergoing pre-operative planning for surgical
intervention with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] on the Colorectal Surgery service.
She now p/w [**10-12**] sharp abdominal pain involving her lower
abdomen and back.  She reports this started 1 day ago as a
typical Crohn's flare in her LLQ but has progressed and is not
worse than any previous flare.  She has had associated nausea
without emesis.  She has not had any changes in bowel function
and denies fevers or chills.  She has been unable to tolerate
anything except clear liquids.  In the ED her WBC is 32 and she
has a lactate of 6.4.  She is hypotensive with SBP in 80's and
is currently receiving IVF resuscitation and was started on
levophed.  After 3 liters of IVF her SBP is now 117 and the
levophed is being weaned.  Her lactate is down to 4.

She was diagnosed with Crohn's in [**2158**] and was started on
infliximab for about one year but lost response.  She developed
a perianal fistula on [**5-/2159**] which has been healing.  She has
also been tried on Humira, cyclosporine, mesalamine and
prednisone without success.

She recently presented to the ED with similar complaints on
[**2160-6-30**] and had a WBC of 34.  She was admitted to GI and
underwent colonoscopy which revealed a polypoid lesion 2-3 cm in
diameter at 25 cm into sigmoid colon.  Biopsies obtained
revealed a degenerating crypt consistent with her diagnosis of
Crohn's. On [**2160-7-2**] she underwent CT ABD which revealed adjacent
stranding
containing small foci of extraluminal air consistent with
contained perforation, with stranding extending anteriorly with
loops of small bowel suggestive of fistula formation.  She was
treated with IV antibiotics in house and prednisone and
discharged with a 2 week course of antibiotics and prednisone.
She is currently not taking any medications for her Crohn's and
reports being off steroids for approximately 3 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo F with Crohn's disease with a known contained abscess in
the pelvic inlet who
was scheduled for elective surgery in the near future, presented
with acutely worsened abdominal pain and hypotension requiring
large volume fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.  Her CT scan
was consistent with a bowel perforation and she was taken to the
OR for exploratory laparotomy, ileocecostomy, low anterior
resection with an ileostomy,mucous fistula by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a
bladder repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**]. The case was complicated as
documented in the operative note and there was a bladder
laceration repaired by urology. Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were placed.
The abdominal wound was irrigated, closed with suture at the
facia and left open given significant obesity and gross
contamination. The patient was admitted from the operating room
to the surgical intensive care unit. The patient was intubated
and monitored closely by the surgical and intensive care unit
teams.

In the ICU a wound VAC was placed, which was changed every three
days by the surgical team.  Her intraoperative fluid culture
grew E. coli and klebsiella and her post-op blood culture grew
E. coli and she was started on IV ciprofloxacin/Flagyl.  She
continued to have leukocytosis and a mini-BAL was performed
which later grew yeast.  At that point her antibiotic coverage
was broadened to vancomycin/ciprofloxacin/flagyl/fluconazole.

The patient was transferred from the surgical intensive care
unit to the inpatient floor on [**2160-8-25**] on intravenous
ciprofloxacin/metrodiazole. The patients lab values and fever
curve were closely monitored and the patient was noted to have a
consistently elevated white blood cell count. In an effort to
determine the cause of this consistently elevated white blood
cell count the blood cultures were drain, peritoneal fluid from
the [**Location (un) 1661**]/[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was sent for culture, the patients
sputum was cultured, and patient was sent for a CT scan of her
torso and abdomen to rule out intra-abdominal abscess. The CT
torso/abdomen showed no obvious intra-abdominal or intrapelvic
abscess with filling defects within the segmental and
subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries
is concerning for PE.  Because of dry cough, shortness of breath
with exertion, and atelectasis the patient was started on
standing Combivent nebulizing treatments.

For treatment of the patient's pulmonary embolism a heparin drip
[**2160-8-27**] was initiated and the patient was started on 5mg of
Warfarin on [**2160-8-28**] to bridge her to an INR of [**2-6**]. The
patient's INR level on [**2160-8-29**] was 1.5 and the patient recieved
5mg of Warfarin. On [**2160-8-30**] the patient's INR value was 2.7 and
the heparin drip was discontinued and the patient received 3mg
of Warfarin. The patient's INR value on [**2160-8-31**] was 6.4. At this
time the Warfarin was held and the patients INR continued to
climb with a value of 7.3 on the afternoon of [**2160-8-31**], 7.8 on
[**2160-9-1**], 7.7
