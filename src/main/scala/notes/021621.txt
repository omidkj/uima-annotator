Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
75 yo F with h/o chronic GI bleed thought [**1-4**] small bowel
angiodysplasia requiring serial transfusions over several
months, cirrhosis with grade II varices, diastolic dysfunction,
COPD on home oxygen, DM admitted to ICU with hypotension after
paracentesis.
.
Patient underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis on [**2142-1-5**] and
had 5.3L fluid removed. Her starting HCt was 23.1 and she
recieved 1u PRBC prior to paracentesis. Her initial blood
pressure was 197/97. She was doing well until she went to the
bathroom 4 hour post tap when she suddenly became diaphoretic,
nauseaous and acutely dropped her blood pressure to 95/40 for
about 30 minutes. Her oxygenation remain stable at 98-99% on 3L
and her HR also remained stable at 80-90, T 96.9. SHe complained
of abdominal pain at that time which was relieved by bowel
movement. She denies chest pain/pressure/dizziness. She denies
diarrhea/vomiting/other blood loss within the past several
days.She had stat Hct, CXR and KUB. SHe was given another unit
of blood and fluid through 18gauge needle and her blood pressure
stabilized. Her Hct post 1u transfusion is 27. Her blood
pressure stabilized to 110s-140s. BS was 104.  Pt was then
transfered to the MICU for observation.  While in the MICU, Pt
remained stable received 4 units of packed RBCs with HCT
subsequently stablizing- currently 34.  In addition, Pt has been
hypoglycemic and decision was made to hold her glyburide-
otherwise MICU course was uneventful.
.
On ROS, she reveals that she had not been sleeping well for the
past few days due to orthopnea. She claims that she has been
taking her lasix. She has been using her home 3L oxygen almost
all night for the past few nights. She denies ever having chest
pain. She denies cough/sputum/abdominal
pain/nausea/vomitng/urinary problems/dizziness/headahce in the
recent past.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. hypotension: currently resolved but may be due to a number of
reasons.  Likely hypoglycemia in the setting of stress and liver
disease given diaphoresis and consistently low blood sugars
while in the unit; in addition there is likely a vasovagal
component as the pt had a peritoneal tap 4 hrs before
hypotensive episode with likely fluid shift and redistribution.
Patient also has known history of GIB, however, HCT is
responsive to transfusion of packed red blood cells.  Sepsis
could also cause this picture but UA and blood cultures negative
so far.  Pt has no ischemic EKG changes. No acute respiratory
changes to suggest PE. Pt's response to fluid resuscitation
while in the unit suggests relative hypovolemia/decreased tone.
Pt was transferred to the floor and remained clinically stable
without hypotension.

2. hypoglycemia- Pt's finger sticks were found to be in the 50s
and 60s while in the unit.  She respond to glucose infusions and
have improved with resolution of hypotension.  Concern for
hypoglycemia prompted the medical team to hold Glyburide while
on the floor.  Her blood glucose has since improved and patient
will be discharged home on lower dose of Glyburide- 5 mgpoqd.
.
3. leukocytosis- pt likely has underlying chronic infection
given COPD- in addition underlying atelectasis and stress
response may explain transient leukocytosis.  Leucocytosis has
since resolved.
.
4. diastolic dysfunction: Pt's medications were continued while
on the floor- Lasix, diltiazem, lisinopril, Metoprolol,
Atorvastatin
.
5. vaginal itch- pt complained or vaginal
