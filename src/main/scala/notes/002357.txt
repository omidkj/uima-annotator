[**6-21**] CXR PA and lat:
1. Mild/moderate pulmonary edema
2. Patchy area of consolidation in left lower lobe - atelectasis
or pneumonia.
.
[**6-22**] bilateral lower ext u/s:
Very limited study secondary to patient body habitus. No
definite evidence of DVT is identified.
.
[**6-23**] CT chest/abd:
1. Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Markedly limited examination due to patient's body habitus.
No definite stones seen within the renal collecting systems. No
evidence of hydronephrosis. Periumbilical hernia and small left
ventral wall hernia containing omental fat. No evidence of bowel
obstruction.
.
[**6-23**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis (however views are technically suboptimal
for assessment
of regional wall motion). Estimated left ventricular ejection
fraction ?55%.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are probably
normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant
aortic or mitral regurgitation is detected but views are
technically
suboptimal.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 F with history of sarcoidosis complicated by prior airway
obstruction and chronic trach, DM1 and triopathy, CABG, HTN, MI,
morbid obesity, most recent discharge [**5-20**], here with SOB which
is improved.
.
# SOB: Likely associated with acute on chronic underlying
restrictive defect, obesity hypoventilation, pulmonary
hypertension, and LLL infiltrate. She has not taken steroids PO
for her sarcoidosis in years. She completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin for Community acquired pneumonia.  She will
complete a 10 day course of cefpodoxime for combo treatement of
CAP and complicated pseudomonas UTI.  Case was discussed with
sleep/pulm and thought that she likely had nighttime hypoxia
secondary to obesity.  We discharged her with home oxygen and
for a home overnight oximetry in 1 monthto evaluate and follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**].
.
# N/V: Patient was treated for constipation with good result.
She was treated for gastroparesis with return to home reglan
doses and antiemetics prn.  On benzotropine for effects of
reglan.
.
# Cardiac:
Ischemia: NSTEMI on [**6-21**] by enzymes and ruled out on [**6-26**] for
nausea. She has history of CABG, MI. Case was discussed with
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-22**], and recommended medical
management; continued ASA, metoprolol (slightly lower dose than
admission) and statin.  Echo was suboptimal.
Pump: Has diastolic dysfunction with EF 55%
.
# ARF: Cr improved with IVF. FeNa <1, c/w pre-renal azotemia.
Urine Eos + rash with levo possible AIN.
.
# UTI (complicated):  patient has chronic indwelling foley and
pseudomonas in urine.  Initially treated with ceftaz starting
[**6-23**] and transitioned to cefpodoxime to complete 10 day course.

.
# DM1: Has had since age 16. Patient is on glargine 64 QHS on
home regimen, started at 40 and increased to 60 day of discharge
and discharged on home regimen.
.
# Chronic pain and anxiety issues:
- On Vicodin, Ativan, and Fioricet.
.
FEN: No IVF, replete K/Mg, DM diet
