.
Urine culture ([**8-19**]): No growth.
.
CTA([**8-20**]):  IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate right effusion, with ground-glass opacity in the
right upper lobe.
3. Cardiac enlargement, and reflux of contrast into distended
hepatic veins. The appearance is suggestive of cardiac failure
overall.
4. Similar thoracic and lumbar compression fractures.
5. Unchanged appearance of multiple aortic aneurysms, with
extensive atherosclerotic disease.
6. Occlusion of the right external iliac artery, which does not
opacify with contrast.
.
CXRAY([**8-19**]): New right-sided pleural effusion.
.
CXRAY ([**8-21**]): Interval improvement in the right-sided pleural
effusion.
.
EKG ([**8-19**]):  Atrial fibrillation at 64.  ST depressions in
V2-V6.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course on the floor:
1) Dyspnea:
- On [**8-19**], patient presented with increased shortness of
breath.  Patient has several cardiac risk factors and on
examination, she had an elevated JVP, worsened chest xray and
BNP levels consistent with a CHF exacerbation (BNP 11,888, when
previously 6264).  Initially, she required 4L of NC oxygen
supplementation, but she was slowly weaned to 2L and then room
air, where her oxygen saturations were 95%.
- In the ED, patient related no chest pain.  Her troponins were
negative, and EKG revealed no evidence of acute coronary
compromise.  On the basis of elevated D-dimer, CTA was
performed, which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus.
- During admission, goal was to gently diurese patient, as she
received nephrotoxic contrast during CTA. Net fluid goal was
-500cc to -1 liter daily and achieved through IV lasix 20mg,
initially, and then switched to 40mg PO and then 20mg PO.
Continued to hold lisinopril and switched atenolol to
metoprolol, as atenolol is renally cleared and creatinine
clearance likely to decrease, acutely, from nephrotoxic contrast
administration.
*
2) Congestive heart failure:
- Patient was transitioned from atenolol 25mg qd to metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] during hospitalization, as there was concern that
patient's kidneys would become compromised following CTA.
- Goal was gentle diuresis during hospitalization.  Achieved
through IV lasix and then slowly titrated to PO lasix. During
hospitalization, patient's heart rate increased to 130's.
Corrected with 250 cc bolus of NS.

*
3)  Peripheral Vascular Disease:
- During admission, noted that patient did not have palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses.  Feet were warm and sensation was intact.
 Physical examination findings were supported by Doppler
ultrasound--no dorsalis pedis pulses auscultated, but patent
posterior tibialis pulses, bilaterally.  Ct of abdomen and chest
noted an "unchanged appearance of multiple aortic aneurysms,
with extensive atherosclerotic disease.  Occlusion of the right
external iliac artery, which does not opacify with contrast."
Senior resident [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] conveyed these findings with
patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
*
4) Hypernatremia:
- Sodium levels slightly elevated upon admission, but through
gentle diuresis normalized.
*
5) Hypothyroid:
- Continued synthroid during admission.
*
6) Osteoporosis:
- Continued Vitamin D (increased to 800u) and fosamax q wk.
Initially held calcium supplements, given serum calcium equal to
10.  Albumin 4.0.
*
CCU course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU on [**8-24**] for hypotension. She
was noted to have had a 10-point Hct drop in the prior 24 hours
and a CT showed a hematoma in the anterior rectus sheath. She
was started on pressors, but after discussion with the family,
given her DNR/DNI status and their knowledge her wishes at end
of life the decision was made to change goals of care to comfort
measures only. Pressors were withdrawn and the patient expired
on [**2177-8-26**].
