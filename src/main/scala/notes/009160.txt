Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 M w/ pmh of DM2 on BIBA to ED after MVC w/ negative
trauma w/u but found to be persistently hypoglycemic and on
glipizide so admitted to ICU for D10 gtt, blood sugars stable
thereafter, and patient saturating well on room air (96%).
Started patient on outpatient metformin and instructed to follow
up in 1 to 2 weeks with his primary care provider.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Likely from alcohol consumption in the setting
of glipizide and lack of other po intake.  He tolerated a
regular diet and his blood glucose normalized without IV

sugars remained stable above 100.  Patient was started on

# Anemia: Unclear baseline or etiology. Denies melana or blood
stool. No hematuria. Per patient, has had both upper and lower
endoscopy w/o any pathology. Would follow up as an outpatient.

discontinued on HCTZ and told to follow up with primary care
physician as to restarting.

# HTN: On multiple agents as outpatient.  Held HCTZ at end of
stay as noted above,   continued fosinopril, HCTZ, amlodipine,
