Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Coffee Ground Emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2113-4-13**]

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M with h/o remote traumatic brain injury, HTN, and h/o
Barrett's esophagous presents from nursing home after witnessed
coffee ground emesis X 1. He was found the morning of admission
with coffee grinds on pillow. When the nursing home staff got
him up for the day he had one episode of emesis that was noted
to be dark black and a large dark brown bowel movement without
any bright red blood and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the emergency department, VS were T 97.6 HR 83 BP 179/89 RR
20 POx 100 on RA. His exam was remarkable for pale appearing,
benign abdomenal exam, and guiac negative stool. He received 1L
NS and was typed and cross with plan 2 units. Two 18g PIVs were
placed. He received 40mg IV pantoprazole and IV zofran. An NG
levage was attempted with induction for emesis with return of
coffee grounds and NG tube was placed to suction. GI was
consulted with plan for EGD in the MICU.
Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], HR 120, w/ frequent
PVCs/bigeminy, and SBP 130s.
.
History was obtained from care givers and medical record due to
patient's baseline mental status.

pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing. He states he has a
long-standing cough unchanged from baseline.

.
EGD [**2113-4-13**]:

Segmental erythema and erosion of the mucosa were noted in the
antrum. These findings are compatible with erosive gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Ulcers in the lower third of the esophagus
Medium hiatal hernia
Erythema and erosion in the antrum compatible with erosive
gastritis
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: [**Hospital1 **] PPI
check h-pylori serology and treat if positive.
schedule a f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 6 weeks to aarange for
a repeat EGD and biopsy of esophagus. clinic# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]
Avoid ASA and NSAIDs.
.
CXR [**2113-4-13**]:

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. Mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels and
perihilar haziness is consistent with a mild degree of
interstitial edema. There is no focal consolidation,pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema.


.
TTE [**2113-4-14**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis
and basal inferior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Suboptimal study.
.
CXR [**2113-4-14**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2113-4-14**]

HISTORY: Mild wheezing. History of asthma, suspect CHF.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2113-4-13**]:

Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Heart size is normal and
there is no
pleural effusion. Previous vascular congestion has cleared since
[**4-13**].
There is no pulmonary edema.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 yo M with remote traumatic brain injury who
presented with hematemesis.
.
#. Upper GI bleed: Pt presented with complaints of coffee ground
emesis and dark stools. He received 2 U PRBC on arrival to the
ED and was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring. He had no
further episodes of bleeding s/p EGD on [**4-13**] which revealed
esophageal ulcers, gastritis, and [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus. His hct
remained stable at 38. He was treated with a PPI [**Hospital1 **]. H pylori
serology was negative. He has required no further transfusions
and hct has remained stable. He should remain off any aspirin or
ibuprofen/motrin etc. until follow up with GI in 6 weeks.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC on admission was 12.5, possibly secondary to
stress response. He had no fever and no infiltrate on CXR to
suggest pneumonia. Leukocytosis resolved.
.
#. HTN: On admission pts lisinopril was initially held. He was
restarted on it, but his SBP remained elevated up to 170-180.
His lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily and he was started
on Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily (as TTE noted changes consistent with
CAD so he would benefit from being on a beta blocker). SBP the
following day was only 100 and creatinine rose from 1.3 to 1.7,
so his lisinopril was decreased back down to 5 mg daily. With
the addition of the Toprol, BP was well controlled in the low
100s.
.
# Acute systolic CHF: Pt had noted mild interstitial edema on
admission CXR. On transfer from the ICU to the floor, the pt was
noted to have wheezing and was satting 93% RA at rest. BNP was
elevated at 1527. He did not appear to be in any respiratory
distress. TTE showed pt has an EF of 45% with  mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral
hypokinesis and basal inferior hypokinesis (consistent with
CAD). The patient was given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 on  [**2113-4-13**] and
again on [**2113
