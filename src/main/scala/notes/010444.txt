Patient is a 64M with HTN, UC with polyarticular arthritis s/p L
TKR and prior DVT who was sent to ED from PCPs office.  On the

including chest xray and ekg and was sent home.  They examined
his leg, but it was not obviously swollen at that time.  He
serindipitiously had a PCP apt on day of admission.  His PCP saw
him and sent him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with concern of pe/dvt.

in

trop 0.13, MB flat. EKG was tachy without evidence of ischemia.
LENIs with right DVT, CTA with PE.  Patient was given Heparin
bolus and started on gtt. Given clot burden, d/w IR and Micu
fellow and retrievable IVC filter to be placed.
.
In the MICU patient is comfortable but a little anxious.

[**2-13**] LENIs:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral,
and popliteal veins were performed. There is near-occlusive
thrombus in the right common femoral vein and occlusive thrombus
in the greater saphenous, superficial femoral, and deep femoral
veins. The right iliac veins and IVC could not be assessed due
to the patient's body habitus. The right popliteal vein
demonstrates normal flow.
There is normal flow in the left common femoral, superficial
femoral, and
popliteal veins. Compressibility and augmentation were not
assessed on the
left given limited assessment of the IVC.
IMPRESSION: Occlusive clot of the right superficial femoral,
deep femoral and greater saphenous veins extending into the
common femoral vein. Iliac vessels and IVC not adequately
assessed due to patients body habitus.
.
[**2-13**] CTA:
There are bilateral central and segmental pulmonary emboli.
There is no
evidence of an aortic dissection. There is approximately 6 mm
pulmonary nodule in the lingula. There is a 7 mm pleural-based
pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. There are scattered
subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes. There is no pericardial
or pleural effusion. The right ventricle diameter appears
greater than 1.5 times that of left ventricle, in keeping with
right ventricular strain.
The visualized liver and spleen appear unremarkable. Hiatus
hernia.
.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:
There is a well-circumscribed sclerotic focus in the body of T2
and a similar focus in the left sixth rib posteriorly. These
most likely represent bone islands.
.
CONCLUSION:
1. Bilateral central and segmental pulmonary emboli.
2. 6 mm pulmonary nodule in the lingula and a pleural-based 8-mm
nodule in
the right lower lobe should be assessed/followed up with a chest
CT in three months to ensure stability/change in size.
3. Right ventricular strain.
.
[**2-13**] IVC Filter OP Report:
Successful deployment of IVC filter in infrarenal position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 64M with extensive right DVT burden and
hemodynamically stable PE.
.
# PE/DVT: Patient with history in setting of provokation in
[**2150**].  Now with significant burden without any risk factors
except prior DVT.  Patient needs age appropriate cancer
screening.  This could include repeat PSA (last in [**2152**]) and
repeat c-scope (last in [**2153**], but pt has UC which has been
active intermittently over his lifetime predisposing to CRC).
Would consider outpt heme consult for discussion of testing for
genetic, acquired thrombophilias and to discuss length of
anticoagulation. Treated with IVC filter placement and heparin
drip, discharged on lovenox to coumadin bridge.
.
# HTN: Normotensive, no change in home regimen.
.
# UC: Continued mesalamine.
.
# Arthritis: Continued prednisone
.
# GERD: Continued PPI
