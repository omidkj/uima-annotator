Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**]
Chief Complaint:
port occlusion and iatrogenic right atrial perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
angiography and Hickman catheter manipulation
right heart catheterization
swan ganz catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 65 yo F w/ metastatic colon cancer to the
anterior abdominal wall and peripancreatic region on previously
on 5FU/leucovorin and [**Known lastname **], admitted following iatrogenic
right atrial perforation during IR procedure to recannulate her
port.
.
The patient's port had been malfunctioning from presumed SCV
thrombus.  During her procedure there were multiple attempts to
strip the catheter; then it was suspected that the right atrium
may have been perforated; dye was introduced and extravasated
into the pericardium.  Stat echo showed trivial pericardial
effusion without evidence of tamponade.  She then had R heart
catheterization and swan ganz catheter placement for closer
monitoring.  She remained hemodynamically stable.  Following the
procedure she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or
dizziness.  There was a prior history of intermittent facial
swelling that was of unclear etiology.

IMAGING:
[**2161-7-17**] C. Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamics slightly elevated right sided filling
pressures
with RVEDP of 13 mm Hg.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was
slightly
elevated (20/23/20).
2.  No evidence of cardiac tamponade.
3.  Evidence of contrast extravasation into pericardial space.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No evidence of cardiac tamponade.
2. Contrast extravastion into pericardial space.
3. PA catheter left in place for ongoing hemodynamic monitoring.

4. Observe overnight in CCU.
.
ECHO [**2161-7-17**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 69629**] is a 65 yo F w/ metastatic colon cancer
with iatrogenic RA perforation during attempt to recannulate
malfucntioning port. previously stable, newly found SVC
thrombus, bilateral PE who developed and increasing pericardial
effusion on anticoagulation.  Anticoagulation was stopped and
patient transferred to the CCU for closer observation on
[**2161-7-21**].  Patient had no further signs of tamponade with
resuming therapeutic Lovenox.
.
# Pericardial Effusion/RA Perforation. Iatrogenic perforation of
the RA initially without significant effusion, no sign of
tamponade.  She was monitored in the CCU without event.  On
[**2161-7-19**], she was noted to have upper extremity and facial
swelling concerning for SVC thrombus.  MRV was performed which
showed nearly complete occlusive SVC thrombus, and saddle PE in
the right/left pulmonary arteries. The patient was therefore
started on heparin gtt after discussion with the cardiology
consult service. The patient initially did well, with TTE on
[**7-20**], early [**7-21**] with minimal pericardial effusions. However, TTE
repeated later on [**7-21**] demonstrated increased pericardial
effusion with evagination (but not collapse) of the RA. At that
time the patient was HD stable, stable oxygenation, though with
episodes of breakthrough sinus tachycardia to 120s-140s.  The
heparin gtt was stopped for concern of bleeding into the
pericardium from the previous RA perforation. She was again
transferred to the CCU for monitoring.  Cardiothoracic surgery
was also consulted and advised against any surgical
intervention. She continued to be hemodynamically stable with
mild sinus tachycardia.  She was started on Lovenox without
further incident.  Serial echocardiograms were performed and
were stable.  She will have followup echocardiogram as an
outpatient.
.
# SVC thrombus: She had onset of dramatic upper extremity and
facial swelling within two days of the procedure.  This was
concerning for SVC syndrome due to thrombus around her occluded
port (still in place).  This finding was confirmed by MRV.  She
was anticoagulated with heparin with the events above.
Following monitoring in the CCU, Lovenox was started with
continued stability of the pericardial effusion.  She had
gradual reduction in her upper extremity swelling.  She had a
repeat MRV after 1-2 weeks which showed little change in the
thrombus.  Interventional radiology was consulted for possible
intervention and presented the patient with options.  She plans
to continue with anticoagulation and further consider IR or
surgical intervention if her swelling does not resolve.  She
remains with mild upper extremity and intermittent facial edema.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: MRV performed for SVC syndrome as above
also revealed pulmonary embolus straddling the right and left
main pulmonary arteries.  She remained hemodynamically stable
without oxygen requirement.  She was anticoagulated with heparin
gtt with the events above.  She will be discharged on Lovenox as
above.
.
# Tachycardia: She became intermittently tachycardic with sinus
rhythm at various points during her admission.  She becomes
tachycardic to the
