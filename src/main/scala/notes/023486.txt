Pertinent Results:
[**10-24**] Cardiac Cathterization: 1. Three vessel coronary artery
disease. 2. Severe mitral regurgitation. 3. Normal ventricular
function.
.
[**10-31**] [**Month/Year (2) **]:PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip @ 0.2
mcg/kg/min,Epinephrine drip @0.15 mcg/kg/min. The patient is s/p
27 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. The valve is
well seated with no peri or paravalvular regurgitation. The
cardiac index is 2.3 with a mean gradient of 3mm hg across the
mitral valve. The LVEF is now 35% with akinesis in the
inferior/inferoseptal distribution likely from air down the RCA-
weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE COURSE:

Mr. [**Known lastname 8520**] is a 74 year old male with known CAD s/p CABG
([**2152**]), HLD, rheumatic vavlular disease s/p MVR (porcine) at
[**Hospital1 18**] ([**2164**]), COPD, Afib s/p MAZE, AAA who presented to OSH one
week before transfer with complaints of 3 weeks of worsening SOB
and DOE and newly discovered 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7968**] LVEF (50%) and
global hypokinesis.
.
# SEVERE MITRAL REGUGITATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 8520**] on [**Known lastname **] was noted to
have 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. He presented with 5 months of SOB and DOE,
worsening over the 3 weeks prior to admission with significant
change in TTE and mitral valve function. (He had a TTE in
[**Month (only) **] with 1+MR). He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation. During his hopsitilization had a LHC that
demonstrated severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8574**] vessels (see report above). He
was diursesed gently with 20mgIV lasix for 2 days, and
afterwards his diuresis was stopped. Cardiac Surgery was
consulted who recommended replacement of his biprosthetic valve.
His surgery was performed.
.
# COPD: Patient was diagnosed with exacerbation at OSH, and he
reported wheezing on admission to OSH. He was started on
Azithromycin, Cefppodoxime, and Solumderol at the OSH for 4 days
which was stopped on admission due to his clear lung exam and
the thought that his DOE was likely due to his severe MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] was continued on his home Advair, Spiriva, and given
Ipratropium and Albuterol PRN for control of COPD.
.
# HISTORY OF AFIB: AFib s/p MAZE procedure. Patient was
asymptomatic, maintained a regular rate, without any
palpitations. His home dose of Verapmil 240mg was split into
80mg Q8hrs due to the severe MR and concern for decompensation.

# CAD S/P CABG: Patient had a CABG in [**2152**] with repeat cath in
[**2164**] showing 3 [**Year (4 digits) 8574**] vessels and 1 diffusely diseased graft.
LHC on this hopitilization demonstrated [**Year (4 digits) 8574**] vessels (see
report above). He was continued on his ASA 81 qdaily, and also
continued on his home dose of lovastatin 40mg.

# Leukocytosis to 14. Patient asymptomatic, afebrile, admission
WBC of 12 with neutrophilia (pt was on steroids previously).  He
had a negative urine culture, and a CXR on [**10-26**] that did not
demonstrate any cardipulm abnormality.
.
# INSOMNIA: Patient was on melatonin at home. He was given
standing trazodone QHS 25mg to help with insominia.
.
# Hypertension: Patient had elevated blood pressure on transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was started on lisinopril 2.5, and then increased
to 10mg QD, but then had systolic BP in 90's upon ambulation.
His lisinopril was [**Hospital1 7968**] to 2.5.

SURGICAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2171-10-31**] where
the patient underwent Redo Sternotomy (3rd time cardiac
surgery), Redo Mitral Valve Replacement (27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic
tissue).  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
The patient has a long-standing history of COPD.  He was
extubated, but quickly developed respiratory distress and was
re-intubated.  He underwent bronchoscopy- which did not reveal
mucous plugging.  He eventually was weaned from the vent and was
extubated on POD 3.  Va
