Brief Hospital Course:
82yo man with IgG-lambda multiple myeloma s/p 2nd cycle
melphalan/prednisone/bortezomib, CHF, CAD s/p CABG and
pacemaker, and DM admitted for cough, weakness, and pneumonia.
He has had two recent hospitalizations (at B&W Hospital) since
starting chemotherapy: one for dehydration, then soon after for
acute CHF.  He needed a RBC transfusion ~1wk ago (previously
five months ago for chronic AVM GI bleeding).  He was started on
levofloxacin for pneumonia the day before admission, but the
following day he was having difficulty breathing and coughing
and weakness had substantially worsened.  He was admitted to the
ICU due to hypoxia and altered mental status and given cefepime,
vancomycin, and levofloxacin.  Vancomycin was stopped [**2171-10-2**].
Abx changed to cefpodoxime and levofloxacin upon discharge with
home O2 during ambulation.
.
# Pneumonia: RLL infiltrate on CXR and bilateral pleural
effusions (L>R), lactate 3.4, tachypnea to 30s, MAP 60s, good
urine output, trop negative, U/A negative.  Started cefepime,
vancomycin, and levofloxacin.  Improved altered mental status.
Vancomycin was stopped [**2171-1
