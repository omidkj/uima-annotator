right-handed Hispanic gentleman with a history of
hypertension and severe left ventricular dysfunction with an
ejection fraction of 20%, possibly due to viral
cardiomyopathy.  He was seen by his primary care physician
last week because of shortness of breath.  Chest x-ray was
obtained two days ago without significant changes.  The
patient was put on Zestril and Lasix which were medications
he had stopped taking because he had no more pills.  On the

fever, chills, blurry vision, headache, difficulty talking,

4.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

is alert and attentive on the mental status examination.  He
is oriented times three.  No language deficits elicited.  His
visual acuity was slightly impaired.  There is no ataxia.
Vision appears on the surface.  No hallucinations and no
delusions.  On cranial nerve examination, his pupils are
equal in size at 2.0 millimeters and react directly and
indirectly to light.  There is no Horner's.  There is no
diplopia, ptosis, nystagmus with extraocular movements.  His
eyes can look to the left.  His fine touch sensation on the
face - There is an obvious left facial droop.  Hearing is
normal.  The palate elevates symmetrically.  The patient can
shrug his shoulders and turn his head against resistance.
The tongue deviates slightly to the left.  On motor
examination, he has no atrophy, asymmetry or fasciculations.
The arms and legs seem to have no abnormal tone.  The
musculature on the right upper and lower extremities seems to
have good strength.  The left arm is weaker than the leg.  On
coordination examination, he has impaired finger to nose
examination on the left due to weakness.  On the reflex
examination, he was hyperreflexia on the left Achilles and
biceps.  Toes are downgoing on the right and upgoing on the
left.  On the sensory examination, he has decreased fine
touch and pin prick/temperature on the left but not absent.
Gait was deferred.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
8.8, hematocrit 47.8, platelet count 380,000.  Sodium 140,
potassium 4.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, blood urea
nitrogen 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 156.  CK and troponin
are negative.

Magnetic resonance scan showed acute infarct of right insula
with decrease on the right middle cerebral artery likely
suggesting infarction at the M2 signal in the right middle
cerebral artery.  Chest x-ray showed probable congestive
heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was monitored in the Intensive
Care Unit after receiving TPA.  His deficits all resolved
after the TPA administration.  He did complain of a headache
while being anticoagulated on Heparin and Coumadin.  So a CT
of the head was checked and found to show no bleed.  He was
ruled out for a myocardial infarction but a repeat
transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild right and left
atrial enlargement.  There was no aortic stenosis, patent
foramen ovale or clot noted.  He had severe left ventricular
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20%.  A carotid
ultrasound was done but no report was written in the chart
and is still pending on the computer upon discharge.  The
patient became near therapeutic on the Coumadin with an INR
of 1.7 and he desired to leave.  He is to have his INR
checked one day after discharge and to follow-up with his
primary care physician on his INR.  A lipid panel was checked
and found that his cholesterol was 179, triglycerides 107,
HDL 41, LDL 117.  Therefore, he was started on a statin given
the elevated LDL on the lipid panel.  The goal was to have an
LDL less than 100.  The patient's blood sugar was checked and
kept under 200.  He was initially on Nitroprusside drip to
keep his pressure below 200 and then he was weaned off the
drip after he started his Captopril.  It is recommended he
stay on his ace inhibitor for blood pressure control given
that it is good stroke prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right middle cerebral artery stroke.
2.  Cardiomyopathy likely secondary to virus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. three times a day.
2.  Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
