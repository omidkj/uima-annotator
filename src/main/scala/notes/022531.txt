Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent on [**2121-12-13**]

History of Present Illness:
82 year old female with CAD s/p MI x 4, [**Last Name (un) **] CM EF 25%, AFib on
coumadin, HTN, DM, COPD, history of blood clots presents with
chest pain and unresponsive episode, VFib arrest s/p shock.
After shocked, she went into sinus bradycardia, given Atropine
and went into AFib and started on iv Amio.  Patient states that
at 4 a.m., she routinely wakes up to take her Tylenol w/ codeine
for hip pain.  She noticed that she had some substernal chest
pain as well as bilateral shoulder and back pain.  She denies
nausea or diaphoresis.  She ate breakfast and then told her
husband about her symptoms and he had her come to the hospital.
On EKG, ST elevations seen V1-3, she was given ASA, iv Heparin
and transferred from OSH for cath.  Patient has known CAD with
multiple prior PCIs most recently in [**2112**] but no information on
these.  Patient has known cardiomyopathy and EF 25%, she has
apparently adamantly refused AICD placement in past.  She has
also apparently had problems with nausea on [**Name (NI) 8213**] (prinivil).
     During cath, patient was noted to have a 5.5cm abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  She had a mid LAD stent placed.

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2121-12-13**]
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe coronary artery disease.
2. Tortuous right iliac artery.
3. Large AAA.
4. Succesful placement of a bare metal stent in the LAD.
5. Successful Angioseal.
COMMENTS:
Of note, the patient had siginificant peripheral vascular
disease
including a severely tortuous right iliac artery and a large
AAA.
Three introducer sheaths and a minimum of six catheters were
used.
Catheter control was extremely difficult and we were unable to
engage
the left main coronary artery with a guiding catheter.
Ultimately the
left main was engaged with a 6 French JL5 diagnostic catheter
and
switched to a guide over a stabilizer wire.
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
significant coronary artery disease. The left main coronary
artery had
evidence of mild coronary artery disease. The left anterior
descending
artery was without angiographic evidence of coronary artery
disease in
the proximal segment. The mid-LAD had a calcified 80% stenosis
prior to
D2. The distal LAD was without angiographic evidence of
significant
obstructive coronary artery disease. The left circumflex artery
was
totally occluded proximally. The right coronary artery was not
engaged,
it was known non-dominant.
2. Peripheral angiography revealed a severly tortuous right
iliac artery
and a large AAA.
3. Successful direct stenting of the LAD with a 2.5 x 15 mm
MiniVision
BMS. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection, and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
4. Successful closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy
with an 8
French Angioseal device.
.
Echo [**2121-12-15**]:
EF 20-25%.
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferolateral, inferior and apical
akinesis with apical anterior hypokinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with CAD, CM EF 25%, AFib on coumadin, HTN, DM, asthma,
history of blood clots/pulmonary embolism presents with chest
pain and unresponsive episode, VFib arrest s/p shock.  She was
found to have ST elevation MI.  Patient was transferred from OSH
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and had bare metal stent to
mid-LAD.
.
CV: Ischemia: Continue ASA, Plavix (to continue for at least 1
month), statin.  Patient is s/p bare metal 2.5x13 mm stent.  No
Integrelin given.  Started Toprol xl. Peak CK 619 on [**12-13**], peak
MB 74.
    Pump: Echo with EF 20-25% (known history of cardiomyopathy
with EF 25-30%).  Started low dose Lisinopril.  Patient was on
Digoxin in past and PCP notes considering discontinuing this
medication but patient was reluctant in past.  Have stopped
Digoxin (on Beta-blocker).  Euvolemic, continue home lasix dose
of 40 mg po qday.
     Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm (first degree AV block),
history of AFib, monitor on Telemetry.  Patient started on
Amiodarone drip on  [**12-13**] overnight post-cath given asymptomatic
28 beat run of VTach.  Patient has refused ICD placement in the
past and continues to refuse.
.
Pulm: History of asthma, but not on inhalers.  Monitored O2
sats.  Atrovent nebs prn.  CXR with atelectasis vs infiltrate,
given patient remained afebrile throughout hospital stay,,
likely atelectasis.
.
DM: RISS, monitor finger sticks.  Restarted Amaryl, outpatient
medication.
.
FEN: cardiac/diabetic diet, repleted lytes prn.  Continue
Calcium and Vitamin D.
.
Heme: was on anti-coagulation with Coumadin for AFib and Blood
clots/PE (?blood dyscrasia).  Held during the first few days of
hospitalization given supratherapeutic INR.  Restarted Coumadin,
home dose to be followed by outpatient physician as before.
.
AAA: Abdominal aortic aneurysm 5.5 cm seen on cardiac
catheterization.  Patient and family aware.  Patient states she
does not want surgical intervention on this in the future and
expressed her desire to be DNR/DNI (discussed this with both the
patient as well as her husband).
.
Dispo: Patient has follow-up appointment scheduled with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1655**] in one week.  She is to follow-up with
her primary care physician and to have her INR/PT followed as an
outpatient while on Coumadin.  She sh
