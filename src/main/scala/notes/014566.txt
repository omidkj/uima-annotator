Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain and dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion and transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year-old Female with a PMH history significant for
CAD (s/p CABG in [**2102**]; LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-OM1 and s/p
multiple PCIs with most recent cardiac catheterization in [**1-/2114**]
showing widely patent grafts), systolic CHF (EF 20-25% in [**2106**]),
HTN, HLD, diabetes mellitus type 2, PVD who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with 1-week of abdominal pain associated with some
dyspnea and chest discomfort.
.
The patient notes that she had the acute onset of progressive
hypogastric discomfort that heightened to a [**10-29**] in intensity
and was dull and achy in character; exacerbated by movement and
positional. She also associated this with some nausea, two
episodes of vomiting this AM (non-bilious, particulate,
non-bloody) and some chest discomfort for the past week. The
chest pain is a tightness that does not radiate, is a [**5-29**] in
intensity and is relieved with reclination and worsened when she
roles to the right side. She denies fevers or chills, no
diaphoresis but some mild palpitations. She denies headaches or
vision changes. No lightheadedness or dizziness. She denies
dysyuria or hematuria. She has no leg swelling or clot history.
She denies sick contacts or URI symptoms recently.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], where she received Aspirin 162 mg PO x 1,
Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO, Morphine 6 mg IV, Zofran 4 mg IV,
Pantoprazole 40 mg IV and Lovenox 70 mg SC x 1. Her laboratory
studies were remarkable for a WBC 8.9, HCT 38.8, PLT 182. Sodium
132, potassium 3.9, creatinine 1.9 (baseline 1.1-1.4), normal
LFTs, INR 1.3 with lactate of 1.6 and a negative U/A. An EKG
showed A.fib @ 113, LAD/NI, TWI in leads aVL, I and TWI in
lateral leads (V5-6). A CXR showed a top-normal heart size, with
no pleural effusion or consolidation. Troponin-I was 0.12. BNP
was 220. The atrial fibrillation was of unknown timing and thus
cardioverted was deferred and rate control was employed. She
subsequently became hypotensive and an urgent bedside 2D-Echo
showed an EF estimated at 10%. A right IJ-CVC was placed.
Levophed gtt was started given her hypotension. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 96.2 94 117/80 16 98%6L. Exam was
notable for mild epigastric tenderness, guaiac negative brown
stool. Laboratory studies demonstrated WBC 11.2, HCT 41.9, INR
1.2. Her bicarbonate was 21 (AG-metabolic acidosis of 14),
creatinine of 2.2 and lactate of 2.1. Repeat Troponin was 0.04.
Repeat U/A was unremarkable. An EKG showed A.fib @ 98, TWI in I,
aVL worse compared to prior. A CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Bedside 2D-Echo showed no pericardial effusion and sub-optimal
squeeze. FAST was negative. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was
obtained showing right greater than left-sided pleural effusion,
mild ascites with fat stranding centered around the omentum with
concern for infarct, diverticulosis, normal appendix and a 2-mm
non-obstructing left nephrolith. She received Vancomycin 1 g x
1, Flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, Metoclopramide, Zofran and Morphine.
Cardiology and ACS-Surgery were consulted. She was admitted to
the CCU for further management on Levaphed gtt at 0.2.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she denies chest pain or trouble
breathing. Her abdominal pain is mild and improved.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.
