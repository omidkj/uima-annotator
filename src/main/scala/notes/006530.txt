History of Present Illness:
72 y.o. Female w/ h.o. longstanding RA on chronic Prednisone, A.
fib not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, ILD [**2-21**] ?RA, tachy-brady
syndrome s/p PPM, initially seen at [**Location (un) 620**] for SOB s/p
intubation for acute resp failure transferred for further
respiratory management.
.
On review of pt's records as well as discussion with the husband
it appears that Ms. [**Known lastname 52029**] initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**1-16**] with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea. Per pt's
family she had no cough, fevers, chills she had an oxygenation
saturation in the low 80s which lead to her ED visit. In the
[**Location (un) 620**] ED she was noted to be hypoxic saturating mid 80s on RA,
she placed on 4L n.c. which resulted in an increase to mid 90s.
She has a baseline home oxygen requirement of 2l. For her work
up she underwent a CXr which showed a Rt [**Location (un) **] effusion, left
lung was clear. Given the level of her hypoxia and history of
immobilization she underwent a CTA which showed no P. Embolism
but did show b/l [**Location (un) **] effusion r>>L. Rt [**Location (un) **] effusion also
showed left middle and lower lobe collapse. Her initial hypoxia
was thought to be [**2-21**] her b/l [**Month/Day (2) **] effusions in addition to
her underlying parenchymal disease. She appeared clinically dry
on admission. It appears she underwent an Echo which showed an
EF of 50-55%, moderately reduced RV systolic function, moderate
pul HTN, 3+ TR. On [**1-18**] it appears there was concern with her
pCO2 increasing to high 60s, pt was placed on BiPAP with no
change in her pCO2. She was intubated electively for possible
hypercapneic failure. On review her pH at that time was
7.35-7.41, HCO3 41-43. During intubation she was noted to go
into A.fib with RVR with rates in the 130s and SBP in the 80s.
.
With regards to her A. fib, she was noted to go into RVR
requiring Amiodarone 150mg IV over 10 minutes x 2 and then a gtt
with minimal improvement. Metoprolol, diltiazem were held given
hypotension. Digoxin was also held given level of 2.75. After
she was given her digoxin and restarted on her Dilt and
Metoprolol she converted into sinus rhythm.
.
She was also noted to be hypotensive following intubation that
was attributed to diuresis prior to intubation and anaesthesia
medications. Following intubation she was given NS boluses until
her BP returned to 120s. It is unclear if the increase in BP was
due to rate versus prior diuresis versus ?adrenal insufficiency.
Pt was given Solumedrol stress dosing in addition to the bolus.
.
She underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis to determine the
etiology of her effusions. Effusion was exudative with cloudy,
viscous material amber in colour. 4800 nucleated cells, 1%
Neutrophils, 30%lymphs, 69% monos, Glc 108, TP 2.5, TGL 17, LDH
318. Culture was pending at time of transfer, gram stain showed
0-1polys but no organisms. Cytology pending, Rh factor and
complement levels were unable to be added.

IMAGING:
CXR:These views are markedly limited secondary to difficulty in
positioning patient and due to her large body habitus. The
cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged, but stable since [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2157**] study. There is a tracheostomy tube whose distal tip is
approximately 2 cm from the carina; however, this may be
distorted due to projection. There are bilateral [**Year (4 digits) **]
effusions with a left retrocardiac opacity. There is an element
of [**Year (4 digits) **] overload. There are severe degenerative changes of the
right glenohumeral joint. A left-sided pacemaker is identified.
.
TTE: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-3-21**], the
degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased. The degree of
tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The other findings are
similar.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM,
A. fib with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c
for PNA initially admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] for dyspnea s/p intubation
for hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative [**Location (un) **] effusions.
.
##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was
electively intubated for concern of hypercapnea. Given pH
readings were 7.39-7.41 in the setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect
that pt may have chronic CO2 retention from OSA and Obesity
Hypoventilation Syndrome. The presumed etiology of initial
decompensation was bilateral [**Location (un) **] effusions. Pt had
thoracentesis at OSH which showed exudative picture, however
this was done after very aggressive diuresis. Repeat
thoracentesis was done and showed transudative effusions, more
consistent with clinical picture which was CHF. TTE showed
LVEF>55% and stable MR. It was considered likely that forward
flow was overestimated b
