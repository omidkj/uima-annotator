Chief Complaint:
SOB, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72408**] is a 79 yo female with COPD,CHF, dementia who was
transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab due to increasing SOB and
abdominal pain. Per PCP note, pt has had increasing "moans",
SOB, and abd pain/distension over past week, which is a change
from baseline. She was seen by psychiatry at NH, who questioned
psychotic depression and started Seroquel and Paxil. Pt also had
non-contrast Abd CT at [**Hospital1 882**] on [**3-1**], which reportedly showed
"no acute process." She had CXR on [**3-1**] which showed "interval
improvement" of bilateral opacities. Per the pt's daughter, pt
had pneumonia in [**1-9**] and has had gradually decreasing function
since then. The daughter also reports pt's mental status has
decreased significantly over the past week. She has had frequent
"panic attacks." R arm contracture has also occurred over the
past several weeks, however the daughter is unsure of the cause.


In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have a PNA on CXR and was started on
BiPAP for hypercarbic resp failure. Her BP initially was up to
206/88, but this decreased without antihypertensive therapy.
Temp was up to 100.6, with O2 sat 92% on 4L NC (increased to
100% on BiPAP). Her code status was reportedly reversed from
DNR/DNI to only DNR (but intubatable). She was given Solumedrol
125mg IV, 2L NS, Levofloxacin 500mg IV, and Morphine 2mg IV.

She currently is not able to converse due to resp distress,
agitation, and BiPAP machine, however she nods "yes" to almost
every question.

Past Medical History:
1)Primary intermedullary ependymoma/astrocytoma, spinal cord
tumor (in the process of being worked up per daughter, s/p XRT
and steroid taper at [**Hospital1 2025**], oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
2)Remote hx of brain tumor s/p VP shunt placement
3)h/o thoracic aneurysm
4)s/p recent PNA
5)COPD
6)CHF (unknown EF)
7)MVR (bioprosthetic MV)
8)Atrial fibrillation (on coumadin)
9)dementia
10)h/o urinary retention (had foley cath at rehab)

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Pt needs total care with ADL's. Other
social hx not obtained.

Family History:
Fam hx of depression.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 99.5 BP 147/110 HR 87 RR 17 O2sat 100% on BiPAP
10/4/40%
Gen: pt in resp distress, using accessory muscles, on BiPAP,
awake, alert, moaning
HEENT: OP slightly dry, but not fully examined due to BiPAP
machine
Neck: Supple. JVD approximately to earlobe
Cardio: irregularly irregular, 2/6 SEM @ apex
Resp: diffuse exp wheezes bilaterally (although difficult to
discern from pt making "squeeking" noises while exhaling)
Abd: soft, nt, mildly distended, +BS, no rebound/guarding
Ext: trace BL LE edema. LUE ecchymoses
Neuro: awake, alert, R arm with contracture. Knows she is in
"hospital", but unable to speak further due to agitation and
BiPAP machine. Asked her to squeeze my fingers, and she nodded
"no".

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**3-4**]): Retrocardiac opacity, possibly representing
atelectasis versus focal consolidation. Likely small bilateral
pleural effusions.

2)CT abdomen/pelvis ([**3-4**]): 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bibasilar consolidation, likely atelectasis, although
evolving infection cannot be entirely excluded. Moderate right
and small left pleural effusion. 3. Coronary artery
calcifications. 4. Multiple hepatic cysts. 5. Sigmoid
diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis

3)CT Head ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to motion. No acute
intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect. No evidence of
dilatation of the ventricles.

4)Abdomen xray ([**3-10**]): No evidence of obstruction.

5)ECHO ([**3-17**]): Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Minimal aortic stenosis with
mild regurgitation. Normally-functioning mitral bioprosthesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. EF 70-80%.
.
6) CT abdomen/pelvis [**3-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Airspace opacity of the dependent bilateral lower lobes is
thought more likely to represent atelectasis; however,
underlying infection cannot be definitively excluded.
2. Small right pleural effusion and minimal left pleural
effusion.
3. Multiple well-defined hypodense foci scattered throughout the
liver, the larger of which are consistent with cysts. Several
smaller lesions are too small to definitively characterize.
4. Numerous sigmoid diverticula without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
.
7) CXR [**3-16**]:
Feeding tube present, with distal tip directed cephalad in the
fundus. Right PICC line remains in place in the superior vena
cava. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are widened but without
change from the prior radiograph. Previously reported pulmonary
edema has slightly progressed with increased perihilar haziness.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, best visualized on the
lateral view, small in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72408**] is a 79 yo female with COPD, dementia, here with PNA,
hypercarbic respiratory failure, abd pain, and abnormal EKG.

1) Respiratory failure: Patient presented with respiratory
acidosis and was admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring.
Respiratory decompensation likely occurred in the setting of
pneumonia seen on cxray, COPD, and CHF exacerbation. She was
placed on Levaquin, then vancomycin and zosyn. Zosyn and
Levaquin were stopped and she was continued on Vancomycin for 2
weeks since sputum cultures grew MRSA. Her oxygen saturations
improved with antibiotics and agressive diuresis. She also
completed a short Prednisone taper for her COPD. Per daughter,
she requires at least 2L at baseline at rehab. She was continued
on 2L NC with O2 sats in high 90s.  She was continued on lasix
PO and this was progressively decreased to 20mg daily.

2)Abdominal pain: Patient presented with several week history of
diffuse abdominal pain. All imaging studies, including CT scan
abdomen/pelvis, were negative for acute pathology that could
explain her symptoms. It was thought that she was constipated.
She did have bowel movements that were extremely loose in
nature. Lactate was normal and guiac negative suggestive of
mesenteric ischemia being unlikely. GI was consulted and they
recommended a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which was unchanged. She
was started on oxycodone standing and narcotics were tapered due
to effects on her bowels. Her bowel regimen was optimized with
Colace, senna, and Miralax. Her abd
