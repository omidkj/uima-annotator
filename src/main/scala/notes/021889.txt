Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 5261**] presented to the ED on [**5-10**] in need of an immediate
surgical intervention.  After an extensive discussion with her &
her daughter, [**Name (NI) **], she opted for an exploratory laparotomy,
fully aware of the likelihood of a protracted hospital stay with
placement of tracheostomy and feeding tubes.  An exploratory lap
was performed, where a markedly dilated ascending & transverse
colon filled with inspissated stool was found.  There was a
perforation near the splenic flexure with spilled stool, and a
subtotal colectomy was performed with an end ileostomy, distal
pouch & feeding tube placement.  She was sent to the SICU,
intubated.  The rest of her hospital stay can be reviewed in an
organ based approach.

NEURO:  She was immediately sedated postop with propofol.  Her
pain was controlled with codeine & tylenol and ultimately with
tylenol alone.  She was given trazodone QHS to help with sleep.
Psych was consulted for mild postop delirium.  Before discharge,
she was alert and oriented.

CV:  Cardiology consulted for TWI on POD6.  CE neg x3.  Echo
WNL.  Hypertension treated with lopressor & hydralazine.

RESP: This was Ms [**Known lastname 5261**]' major [**Last Name **] problem.  Despite being
extubated on POD2, she required frequent chest PT, suctioning &
neb treatments postop.  She cleared well & was lucid two times,
and was sent to the floor, only to bounce back twice in
respiratory distress.  The first of these decompensations was
due to pneumonia, and the second from volume overload/CHF, for
which she was reintubated on [**5-21**].  She underwent an open
tracheostomy on [**5-23**], and her dependence on mechanical
ventilation was gradually weaned.  At the time of discharge, she
is currently on CPAP 40%O2, Peep 5 and PS 10.

FEN: Ms [**Known lastname 5261**] takes lasix at home, but is not lasix dependent.
 Her baseline weight of ?45kg was severely low for her height,
and she is obviously malnourished.  She was sustained
perioperatively with TPN and eventually tolerated tube feeds via
the J port of her [**Last Name (un) **] tube.  Her presenting albumin was 1.8,
and on [**5-28**], it had risen slightly to 2.2. On the day of
discharge it has risen to 2.4.

GI: Her colostomy was functional soon after surgery, and she was
switched from TPN to tube feeds at that time.  She tolerated
these without complication.  She receives protonix for GI
prophylaxis.  Her abdominal incision was left open because of
the stool within the peritoneal cavity at the time of surgery.
This was eventually treated with a VAC dressing (last changed
[**5-29**]). This was taken off the day before discharge. Her wound is
shallow and clean with nice granulation tissue.

HEME: She required several RBC transfusions during her admission
for iron deficiency anemia but also for blood loss anemia.  She
is being prophylaxed against DVT with SQ heparin.

ID: She was kept on 1 week of abx postop because of gross stool
spillage during her case.  When she returned to the SICU with
pneumonia, she was treated with a 10 day course of levaquin with
improvement.  No positive cultures. On [**5-31**], the Foley was
changed.

ENDO: Sliding scale.

DISPO: Do not resuscitate.  Her health care proxy is her
daughter, [**Name (NI) **].
