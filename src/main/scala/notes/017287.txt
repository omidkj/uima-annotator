Service:  NEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old male with
a history of diabetes mellitus, end stage renal disease,
status post living related renal transplant in [**2130**],
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, status
post silent myocardial infarction and stent to the left
circumflex, who presents with poor appetite times two weeks,
decreased urine output over the course of three days, as well
as episodic band-like epigastric burning pain in the past
couple of days.  He describes the epigastric pain as eight
out of ten, nonexertional, band-like burning in the
epigastrium radiating around to his back.  This pain is also
associated with shortness of breath and mild nausea.  It
tends to last twenty minutes, although some episodes have
lasted up to three hours.  It also appears to be positional
in nature and somewhat relieved by antacids.

The patient reports no urine output over the past eighteen
hours.  He denies any tenderness over the site of his renal
transplant.  He also denies fever, chills and dysuria.  He
does report that he recently finished a course of Biaxin
which he was taking for mouth infection.  He says that on the
day prior to admission he put out only approximately 150 cc
of urine.  His creatinine at baseline is 3.0 to 3.5.

The patient reports that he has had recurrent episodes of
progressive shortness of breath related to his congestive
heart failure.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 190**] in [**3-12**], with hypoxia and bilateral
infiltrates.  Bronchoscopy at that time was negative for PCP
but positive for alpha Streptococcus.  There was question of
mediastinal adenopathy and ground glass opacities on CT at
that time.  He returned to the [**Hospital1 188**] in [**6-9**], with similar symptoms which responded well
to antibiotics and diuresis.

Echocardiography in [**8-9**], revealed an ejection fraction of
45 to 55%.  Currently he does report shortness of breath,
dyspnea on exertion, however, denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and orthopnea.  He also reports increased lower
extremity edema.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired.  He denies use of
tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs reveal temperature 98.0,
blood pressure 140/90, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturation 93% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat - Right eyelid droop with fixed pupil.  The left
pupil is round and reactive to light.  The oropharynx is
clear.  The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or jugular
venous pressure equals 14 centimeters.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Bibasilar crackles and no wheezes.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, no
S3 and no S4, no murmurs.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly,
no masses.  Extremities - warm, no cyanosis and no clubbing
and 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Neurologic -The patient is
alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are intact, nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood count 7.7,
hematocrit 26.7, platelets 205,000.  Sodium 134, potassium
4.6, chloride 102, bicarbonate 12, blood urea nitrogen 114,
creatinine 5.8, glucose 224.  Calcium 7.7, phosphate 8.0,
magnesium 2.2.  Urine sodium equals less than 10, urine
creatinine equals 134, urine osmolality equals 350.
Urinalysis showed 20 to 30 white blood cells, 30 to 50 red
blood cells, positive yeast, negative bacteria, negative
casts.

Chest x-ray showed interstitial pulmonary edema, small left
sided pleural effusion, right basilar atelectasis.

Electrocardiogram was unchanged from previous baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary - At the time of admission, the patient had
shortness of breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion, and
was found to have a possible right lower lobe pneumonia on
CT, for which he was started on Levaquin.  On hospital day
number four, the patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for congestive heart failure, related
decline in respiratory function and decreased pH, for which
he was started on 100% nonrebreather face mask.  After
spiking fever to 102, the patient was started on Ceftaz and
Vancomycin for presumed pneumonia.

After a short time in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his
respiratory status improved and he began saturating close to
100% in room air.  Antibiotics ere discontinued at that time
as his rapid response was thought to be more indicative of
congestive heart failure related symptoms rather than
pneumonia.  Following removal of significant amounts of fluid
at dialysis, as well as transfusion, the patient's
respiratory status improved dramatically as did his
appearance on chest x-ray.

At the time of discharge, the patient had been breathing room
air for approximately three days, oxygen saturation ranging
from 95 to 100% in room air.

2.  Cardiovascular - On admission, serial enzymes were drawn
and the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  No
new changes were noted on electrocardiogram.  Episodes of
epigastric pain were thought to be noncardiac in nature.  On
admission, the patient had shortness of breath, worsening
dyspnea on exertion and jugular venous pressure up to the jaw
on examination.  During his hospitalization, the patient's
congestive heart failure worsened and he was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure.
Following removal of fluid at dialysis, the patient's
congestive heart failure related symptoms improved as
mentioned above.

3.  Renal - On admission, the patient had oliguria and acute
renal failure of unclear etiology.  His creatinine was 5.8
which was up from his baseline of approximately 3.0 to 3.5.
Renal ultrasound did not show hydronephrosis, making
postrenal obstruction an unlikely cause of his acute renal
failure.  Renal [**Year (4 digits) **] showed no evidence of acute rejection
or AIN and only showed signs of chronic diabetes mellitus and
chronic transplant changes.

During his first few days in the hospital, the patient showed
progressively worsening renal failure, and on hospital day
three, it was decided to start him on hemodialysis.  After
being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient continued dialysis three times a week, with
subsequent relief of his congestive heart failure symptoms.

On hospital day number two, the patient was switched from
Cyclosporin to Rapamune, however, before leaving the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the Rapamune was also discontinued and
the patient was continued only on Prednisone.  Following
admission, arrangements had been made for the patient to
undergo hemodialysis at the Center in [**Location (un) **].

4.  Infectious disease - On admission, the patient was
started on Fluconazole for suspected fungal urinary tract
infection.  Cultures subsequently came back positive, and
were then followed up by negative cultures at which time the
Fluconazole was discontinued.

On hospital day number three, the patient was started on
Levaquin for suspected right lower lobe pneumonia seen on CT.
On hospital day number four, the patient developed
