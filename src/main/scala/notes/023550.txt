HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male with
a complex past medical history.  In the late [**2092**]'s, the
patient was run over by a train and has since required
multiple reparative operations since that time.  The patient
was restored to a point where he was ambulating with a cane,
but in [**2121**], underwent a reoperation of his abdomen which was
complicated by sepsis, shock, and coma.  The patient had a
tracheostomy placed, and was ventilated for a prolonged
period of time.  Subsequent to coming off the ventilator, the
patient has had the tracheostomy removed and placed multiple
times with a tracheal T tube for post-tracheostomy tracheal
stenosis.  The patient has also had multiple dilatations and
ablative therapy without sustained efficacy.

The patient most recently had his tracheal T tube removed,
and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].  Upon examination, the
patient's airway demonstrated a normal larynx with a
subglottic stenosis starting at the level of the first
tracheal ring and extending for about 1.5 cm.  The remainder
of the patient's trachea was noted to be normal.  The patient
was also noted to have a wire stent in his left main
bronchus, which was noted to be patent.

Patient's tracheal lesion was noted to have an anterior and
lateral stenosis from granulation and scarring while
posteriorly, the membranous wall was noted to be floppy,
producing some degree of obstruction.  The overall effect of
these lesions was noted to be significant narrowing of the
lumen resulting in upper respiratory stridor and shortness of
breath.  The patient was subsequently recommended for a
tracheal resection that will take place on [**2125-6-20**] under
the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is disabled and lives with his
wife in [**Name (NI) 3494**].  The patient formally worked as a
arbitrational lawyer.  The patient has five children.  The
patient has a 120 pack year smoking history, but quit four
years ago.  Patient ambulates with braces, but is mostly
wheelchair bound.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2125-6-19**] to the
Thoracic Surgery Service for preoperative workup.  Patient's
standard laboratory studies were noted to be within normal
limits; his chest x-ray and electrocardiogram were noted to
be normal.  The patient was therefore cleared for surgery,
and on [**2125-6-20**], underwent a tracheal resection and
reconstruction.  The patient tolerated this procedure well
and was noted to have an intraoperative estimated blood loss
of 150 cc.  Patient was successfully extubated in the
operating room, and subsequently transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be afebrile and
stable with an intact neck retention suture.  Patient's neck
incision was noted to be clean, dry, and intact.  Patient was
noted to have bilateral breath sounds.  Patient's
postoperative hematocrit was noted to be 34.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was advanced to a
regular diet, which he tolerated well for the duration of his
stay.  On the evening of postoperative day #2, the patient
demonstrated an acute period of hypotension during which
period he was noted to have otherwise stable vital signs
including adequate heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen
saturation.  Patient was administered Levophed and transfused
1 unit of packed red blood cells with good effect.

Followup bronchoscopy conducted on postoperative day #2
demonstrated a mild amount of respiratory secretions which
were removed effectively with suctioning.  The tracheal
surgical site was noted to be well approximated and healing
well.  The patient continued to progress well clinically, and
on postoperative day #3 was cleared for transfer to the
floor.

The patient was subsequently admitted to the Thoracic Surgery
Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].  In general,
the remainder of the patient's clinical course was
uneventful.  His JP drain and central venous line were
discontinued without complication, as was his Foley catheter;
the patient was subsequently noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of
his stay.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was noted to demonstrate
some mild respiratory stridor, and was advised to diminish
his speaking to allow for greater surgical site rest.  Due to
some mild erythema at his neck surgical site, the patient was
started on oral levofloxacin on postoperative day #5 on which
he remained for the duration of his stay.  In addition, the
patient's Coumadin was restarted and titrated for a target
INR between 1.5-2.5.

On the evening of postoperative day #5, the patient was noted
to have yet another episode of acute hypotension with
systolic pressures falling to the mid 60's.  Once again, the
patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation
were noted to be normal.  Following review of the patient's
past medical records, it was noted that the patient had
exhibited similar episodes of unexplained hypotension on
prior admissions, which were at that point ascribed to
adrenal insufficiency in the setting of steroid
discontinuation and the patient on chronic low dose steroid
therapy.

It was noted that the patient had undergone a steroid taper
prior to his current operation, and that for healing
purposes, he had not been restarted on his standard
prednisone scheduled postoperatively.  The patient was
therefore started on IV dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **], to good
initial effect.

The following day, postoperative day #6, the patient,
however, demonstrated another acute episode of hypotension
which subsequently was noted to self resolve.  Following the
resolution of this acute episode, both the cardiology and the
Endocrine consult were obtained.  Cardiology noted no
evidence for an acute cardiac event given normal
electrocardiogram tracings obtained during the course of all
three acute hypotensive episodes.

Endocrine consultation deemed the patient's episode less
likely to be attributable to adrenal insufficiency,
considering the patient had experienced an additional episode
of hypotension following reinstitution of his steroid
therapy.  Nevertheless, Endocrine recommended continuation of
the patient's steroid schedule with prednisone 10 mg po q day
and advised followup on an outpatient basis with the
autonomic dysfunction laboratory.
