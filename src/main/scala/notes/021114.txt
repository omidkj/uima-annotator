HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to
[**Hospital **] Medical Service on [**2141-8-7**] with the diagnosis of
pneumonia.  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history
of asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, and GI bleed, who was
found in respiratory distress at home. The patient was found
in respiratory distress and hypoxic at the nursing home.  EMT
was called and found the patient unresponsive with the
respiratory rate of 6 to 8.  He was intubated in the field
and brought to [**Hospital1 69**].  The
patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 21.4 and chest
x-ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate, prior to
transfer.  Upon presentation in the ED, the patient was
unresponsive and lethargic with blood pressure of 80/15,
heart rate in the 80s to 90s.  The first ABG revealed pH of
7.13, CO2 of 82, pO2 of 305.  The patient was started on
assist control ventilator and dopamine gtt.  The patient was
given Ativan 2 mg IV and Levaquin 500 grams times one.

The patient has a history of guaiac-positive stool.  The
patient underwent NG lavage, which was guaiac positive but
not grossly bloody or with coffee grounds.  The patient
desaturated to 90% with the NG tube, which improved with
suctioning.  The patient was transferred to the ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.  The last pulmonary function test showed an FEV1
of 28% of normal and FEC of 55% of normal and FEV1/FVC ratio
of 0.39.  The patient has a history of GI bleed and
iron-deficiency anemia.  The patient is status post hip
fracture with pins.  The patient is status post fall with rib
fractures at the end of [**2141-6-24**].  The patient has a
history of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline
creatinine of 1.2.  The patient has a history of gout and the
patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Nexium 20 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Baclofen 100 mcg four to six puffs b.i.d.

7.  Procrit 600 units subcutaneously every 6 days.
8.  Aspirin one a day.
9.  Oxycodone 5 mg q.6h.p.r.n. pain.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has The patient has no known drug
allergies..

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a real estate broker with a
history of alcohol abuse, but quite three years ago.  There
is a questionable history of tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
The patient was an elderly male, sedated and intubated, frail
appearing.  Vital signs:  Temperature 97, blood pressure
86/39, pulse 106, breathing 23 times, 90% oxygen saturation
on SIMV 20 with FIO2 of 60%.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck had JVD
that was unable to be measured appropriately due to ETT tape.
PULMONARY:  Pulmonary examination revealed that the patient
had bilateral rhonchi with mild expiratory wheezing, rales
worse at the left than the right base.  The patient had a
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs
appreciated.  ABDOMEN:  Firm, without ecchymosis and positive
bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  The patient had three plus
pitting edema below the knees and slight withdrawal to pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
The patient had a white count of 19.8, hematocrit 20.3,
platelet count 362,000.  Labs on admission revealed the
following:  Sodium 145, potassium 6.9, chloride 107,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 111, creatinine 2.3, glucose 185, LFTs
unremarkable.  Urinalysis unremarkable.  The patient's first
ABG, as mentioned in the history of present illness was 7.13,
82, 305 on 100% FIO2.  Chest x-ray showed marked scoliosis,
no cardiomegaly, no vascular redistribution with a marked
right lower lobe infiltrate and question of right pleural
effusion.  EKG revealed sinus rhythm at 107 with normal axis
and intervals; biphasic T waves in 1, 2, 3, AVF and V6, and
peak T waves in V1 to V5.  No baseline EKG was available.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 71-year-old male with a history
of asthma, GI bleed, and atrial fibrillation, who presented
with two acute processes.  The patient had respiratory
distress, acidosis, and right lower lobe infiltrate, as well
as hypertension, suggestive of sepsis.  Secondly, he had a
decreased hematocrit and heme-positive stool with question of
intra-abdominal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by system).

PULMONARY:  The patient was found to have a left lower lobe
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  The patient was started on
Ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  Because of the patient's
underlying lung disease, which appears to be asthma and not
necessarily COPD, the patient was started on stress dose of
Solu-Medrol and remained intubated until the 22nd.
Unfortunately, the patient did not do well and needed to be
reintubated.  The patient was successfully extubated on the
23rd at which point he was started on oral Prednisone taper
and continued on his M.D.I.  The patient remained stable on
three liter face mask with saturations, and he was
transferred to the floor on the 26th.  The patient, at that
time, had a chest x-ray showing an increase in the right-side
pleural effusion.  Incision was made to tap the effusion.
The patient underwent thoracentesis on the [**7-22**].
Unfortunately, the procedure was complicated by pneumothorax
requiring chest tubes.  The patient's pleural effusion was
sent for culture and cytology.  Initial workup showed the
effusive to be transudative rather than exudative.  Cytology
at the time of discharge is still pending.  The patient's
chest tube was discontinued on the [****] without
event.  The patient will continue his steroid taper and
metered dose inhalers as an outpatient.  The patient
completed a 14-day course of Levofloxacin for the right lower
lobe infiltrate.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's blood cultures were
negative throughout the course of his admission as were the
respiratory cultures and urine cultures.  The patient
completed a 14-day course of Levofloxacin.  The pleural
effusion, which was tapped on the 30th was found to be
transudative and one out of two blood cultures, which were
sent were growing gram-positive cocci in clusters that
appeared to be coagulase negative.  Final information on that
was pending.  The patient was restarted on Ceftriaxone until
that organism was definitively identified.  However, given
that this was out of two cultures, the organisms was felt to
be contaminate.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of atrial
fibrillation.  The patient has hypotension.  The patient was
originally started on a dopamine drip.  The patient was
weaned from the dopamine drip within the first few days of
admission and remained hemodynamically stable with fluid
boluses.  The patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
throughout the course of his hospital stay, but remained
hemodynamically stable with blood pressures in the 100 to 120
range systolic.  The patient apparently has not been
anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation for a number of
years secondary to tendency towards falls.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had probable upper GI bleed on
admission for which he was transferred four units of packed
red blood cells.  The patient underwent an EGD, which showed
a new duodenal ulcer.  The patient's biopsy was H.pylori
negative.  The patient was maintained on Protonix and
Carafate.  After transfusion, there were no further problems
with the hematocrit and no melanotic stools throughout the
course of the hospital stay.

The patient also has a history of celiac sprue.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient is
cachectic with obvious nutritional deficiencies, some of
which are probably attributed to his history of celiac sprue.
The patient was tube fed while intubated, but subsequent to
extubation, the patient was tolerating POs adequately without
event.

DISPOSITION:  The patient remained full code.

The patient was discharged on [**2141-8-24**] to [**Hospital3 7558**] Hospital in good condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.
