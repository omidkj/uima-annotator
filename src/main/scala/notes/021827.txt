Pertinent Results:
Cath [**8-2**]: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system demonstrated severe 3 vessel disease. The LMCA was short
but normal. The LAD was subtotally occluded after S1, remainder
of the LAD was small with diffuse irregularities filling
antegrade and via RCA acute marginal collaterals. The LCX had
diffuse disease and the OM2 was occluded and filled via
collaterals. The RCA was occluded at mid vessel after the acute
marginal which filled the distal LAD. There was mild pulmonary
hypertension with PAP 40/16 mmHg). Left ventriculography
revealed severe global hypokinesis with LVEF 29%. No significant
mitral regurgitation was evident.
CNIS [**8-5**]: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis. Likely left
subclavian stenosis.
Chest CT [**8-6**]: Moderate emphysema. Widespread interstitial
pulmonary abnormality including fibrosis and interstitial
pneumonitis, consistent with IPF.
Echo [**8-8**]: PreBypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF 30-40%. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include septal hypokinesis at
the base, septal akinesis from mid basal region to apex,
inferior wall hypokinesis at the base and inferior wall akinesis
at the apex. A prominent thrombus is seen in the left ventricle,
adherent to the ventricular wall near the apex. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (mobile) atheroma
in the descending aorta. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Post Bypass: No new
regional wall motion or valvular abnormalities observed. LVEF
30-40%.  No new aortic abnormalities observed.
CXR [**8-25**]: Right IJ line is unchanged with tip in the right
atrium. Compared to [**2182-8-21**], there has been no significant change
in the lower lobe volume loss, prominent interstitial markings
versus scarring in the left lateral lung, mild cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the medical service, medical management was
optimized, he received regular hemodialysis treatments, and was
taken to the OR on [**2182-8-8**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. He underwent a CABG
X 4 (LIMA > LAD, SVG>Diag>OM, SVG>PDA). Please see operative
note for details of surgical procedure. Pt. was transported to
the cardiac surgical recovery unit for invasive monitoring in
stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. His epicardial
wires and chest tubes were removed on POD # 1, and warfarin was
initiated(due to finding of LV thrombus in the OR). He remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry unit
on POD # 2. He continued on regular dialysis, was being
anticoagulated, and had remained stable until early am on [**8-15**].
At that time, he had a bloody BM, was lightheaded, and
diaphoretic. He was transferred to the ICU.  His INR which had
been in the 3's had rapidly increased to 6, then to 9 just prior
to this incident. His hematocrit dropped to the mid-teens. He
was transfused RBC's & plasma, received vitamin K. GI was
consulted, and he underwent UGI endoscopy (on [**8-15**])which showed
gastritis (not actively bleeding). EGD was repeated on [**8-16**] which
showed gastritis & duodenitis. He remained hemodynamically
stable after his anticoagulation was reversed, and he was again
transferred to the telemetry floor. He underwent a colonoscopy
on [**2182-8-21**], which revealed polyps, and normal mucosa.
Anticoagulation was again initiated (for post-op AF, as well as
the LV thrombus noted in the OR) with warfarin and IV heparin
was given while waiting for the INR to become therapeutic. On
[**2182-8-26**], he was noted to have some bleeding in his left eye,
ophthalmalogy was consulted (pt. has long-standing history of
retinopathy, prev. vitreous hemmorhage, legally blind). He was
found to have vitreous hemmorhage, and eye drops were initiated
as recommended. His eye was patched, and anticoagulation was
stopped. Throughout post-op course he received regular
hemodialysis treatments and worked with physical therapy for
strength and mobility. He appeared stable and suitable for
discharge home on post-op day 20. He was not restarted on
coumadin seoncadry to the his sensitivity and bleeding
complications. He was discharged home with VNA services and the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
