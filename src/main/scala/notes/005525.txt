Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shoulder pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Irrigation and debridement left shoulder via anterolateral
deltopectoral miniarthrotomy with cultures.
2. Aspiration left hip joint under fluoroscopy.
3. Irrigation and debridement 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint,
superficial abscess.
4. Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic CMY (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial
fibrillation, CKD, with past history of DVT and PE on Coumadin
who was recently discharged from the CCU ([**11-6**]) for CHF
exacerbation c/b C.diff infection, who is now being transferred
from [**Hospital **] hospital for ?Septic shoulder joint and hypoxia,
requiring intubation.  Patient is intubated and sedated so
history obtained from HCP (niece) and transfer records.  She
presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**11-18**] with left shoulder pain.
Orthopedics was consulted and joint aspiration was done which
showed +hemarthrosis.  Joint culture now growing staph aureus.
She was given oxacillin initially and then per discharge note,
received Vancomycin althouth transfer medication list does not
have Vancomycin listed as being given.  Today, the patient
developed hypoxia and required increasing O2 requirement and was
placed on a NRB with O2 sat in 90-92% range per HCP.  O2 sat
then declined to 70% on NRB and patient was then electively
intubated prior to transfer.

IMAGING:
[**2179-11-21**] CXR:
There is opacification in the right upper zone. This could
represent volume loss in the right upper lobe or possible
supervening consolidation.

[**2179-11-21**] Repeat CXR:
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has
been
substantial clearing of the right upper lung opacification. This
suggests
expectoration of a mucous plug with relief of volume loss.

[**2179-11-21**] Shoulder XR:
No previous films are available for comparison. There is
sclerosis, with narrowing and some irregularity involving the
glenohumeral
joint. This may merely reflect degenerative changes, though the
possibility of an indolent infection cannot be excluded. MRI
might be helpful for further evaluation.

[**2179-11-21**] Hand XR:
The third MCP joint is quite well maintained without convincing
erosions. Degenerative change is seen involving the first CMC as
well as the second DIP joint. Some narrowing is also seen
involving several other DIP and PIP joints.

[**2179-11-22**] CXR:
No significant change from prior exam, allowing for significant
leftward rotation of the patient

[**2179-11-23**] ECHO:
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal, though restricted
motion of the posterior leaflet is seen. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation or wire-associated
vegetation. Probable left atrial appendage thrombus with
spontaneous echo contrast also identified within the body of the
left atrial appendage. Mild mitral regurgitation, at least
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe biventricular systolic
dysfunction.
