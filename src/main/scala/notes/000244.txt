HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old male with known mitral valve disease and has been
experiencing increased shortness of breath for several months
and initially it was attributed to COPD; however, on repeat
echocardiogram which showed worsening MR and LV dilatation,
scheduled for cardiac catheterization and it showed LAD 80%
occluded, left circumflex 99% occluded, 3+ MR, and elevated
PA pressures.

The patient was initially admitted to the Medicine Service
for stabilization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD.
2.  Mitral valve disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Status post MI in [**2120**].
7.  GERD.
8.  Cataract.
9.  Bladder cyst.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medicine Service and stabilized on the Medicine Service.  The
patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to the Operating Room on
[**2148-2-2**] and underwent a CABG times three, mitral
valve repair, and annuloplasty.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was admitted to
the DIC CRSU on an intra-aortic balloon pump and paralyzed
and sedated on Milrinone, Levophed, epinephrine, and
Pitressin.  The patient required multiple units of packed red
blood cells and FFP to maintain his cardiac index.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was started on
CVVH given his renal impairment and also given his fluid
overload.

The patient was transferred to the unit.  Postoperatively,
the chest was left open because difficulty ventilating the
patient because of COPD intraoperatively and at the time of
operation it was decided to leave the chest open.  The
patient was transferred to the CRSU with the chest open.  The
chest tube was clotted off postoperatively on postoperative
day number one and stopped draining.

The patient was becoming increasingly difficult to ventilate.
 The decision was made to re-explore and evacuate a hematoma
at the bedside on postoperative day number one for which the
procedure was carried out and the patient stabilized.  He was
continued on CVVH by the Renal service.

The patient was continued on the .................... stable
state for the next several days without any event.  He was on
CVVH on milrinone, epinephrine, Levophed, and was being
paralyzed and sedated for the next several days.

TPN was started on postoperative day number three.  On
postoperative day number five, we began to try some trophic
feeds; however, the patient did not tolerate trophic feeds.

On [**2148-2-9**], the patient's cardiac index appeared to be
deteriorating and the decision was made to re-explore the
chest again at the bedside.  The procedure was carried out;
1/2 liters of fluid was evacuated from the right pleural
space and some clots were evacuated from the chest tube.
However, since that day on the patient's condition began to
deteriorate rapidly and overnight the patient began to
require several amps of bicarbonate still having a pH of 7.21
on ABG.

Throughout the night of [**2148-2-9**], the patient continued
to require bicarb.  He went into A fib and was cardioverted
and went back into A fib again.

Eventually, on the morning of [**2148-2-10**], at approximately
6:30 a.m., the patient went into asystole.  Cardioversion was
carried out and several amps of bicarbonate and several amps
of calcium were given.  The epinephrine drip was turned up.
Milrinone was turned up to maximum.  Pitressin was turned up
to maximum, however, to no avail.

The patient expired on the morning of [**2148-2-10**] at
approximately 6:30 a.m.

DISCHARGE PROCEDURE:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft, MVR and revision.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mitral valve disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Status post myocardial infarction.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Cataract.
9.  Bladder cyst.
