Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old male with a past medical history of
stroke with persistent R near-hemiplegia and averbal s/p PEG
placement, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6-2) who presented from his
nursing home today for evaluation of fevers and acute on chronic
renal failure. He is at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since [**Month (only) 404**], in the MACU,
stable on a trach mask, with his course punctuated by c diff
colitis and a return for fevers. This past weekend, he initially
started spiking fevers with increasing diarrhea. He was started
empirically on PO vanco (given his + c diff in the past). His
respiratory status then acutely decompensated requiring return
to mechanical ventilation.
Sputum collected returned positive for ESBL Klebsiella for which
he initially received Imipenem which was then switched to Zosyn
based on culture data. He also was noted to have anasarca with
worsening urine output and his creatinine was above his
baseline. He was given D5W with bicarb to which he did not
respond. Today he spiked through Zosyn, so he was sent to the ED
for further work up.
.
In the ED, his vital signs were stable with HR in the 80's and
BP in the 120's. He was febrile to 101.7, and was satting 93% on
A/C 500x 14 FiO2 0.4 and peep 5. He was found to be anasarcic on
exam and his CXR was notable for a persistent LLL effusion and
pulmonary edema.
He received vanco and cefepime and about 1L of IVF. He also
underwent a bedside echocardiogram which was negative for
pericardial effusion or ascites. A UA was grossly positive. Also
of note, he was in and out of afib on tele in the 80's.
.
He is admitted to the MICU for further work up and evaluation

pre-hosp:
Sputum Culture: ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia

Hosp:
Afib with LAFB @ 71bpm. Scattered P waves noted on the EKG
however. Second ekg with NSR @ 98

CXR ([**2155-5-6**]) -
1. Persistent left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
2. Mild CHF.

CT torso ([**2155-5-6**]) -
1. High position of the endotracheal tube just at the thoracic
inlet. The tube should be advanced for more optimal placement.
2. Moderate-sized bilateral low-attenuation pleural effusions
with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Moderate low attenuation pericardial effusion and coronary
artery calcifications.
4. Diffuse anasarca within the regional soft tissues with
scattered ascites consistent with volume overload.
5. Multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest
compatible with cysts and others too small to characterize.

TTE ([**2155-5-7**])-
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is probably
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
normal (LVEF 50-60%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 87 yo male with history of CVA s/p
trach/peg in LTAC unit admitted with increasing respiratory
distress, fevers, diarrhea and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
1) Respiratory Distress: patient was trached after difficult
attempts to wean post CVA. He has been treated in the last
several months for HAP, most recently finishing a course of
antibiotics on [**2155-4-11**] for pansensitive pseudomonas and proteus
from sputum on last admission. He has a persistent left sided
effusion and evidence of pulmonary edema on plain chest imaging
on presentation. His pre-hospital sputum cultures revealed and
ESBL Klebsiella species consistent with a ventilator associated
pneumonia and he was continued on appropriate antibiotics.
While being volume resusitated from his sepsis his respiratory
status was challenged by the fluid load.  Investigations for
other infectious causes such as UTI or c. diff associated
colitis were negative. As his sepsis improved, he was able to
tolerate gradual diuresis which allowed him to return to
pressure support ventilation.
.
2) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient presented in
acute on chronic renal failure which seemed to be in a low flow
state, although acute worsenining of renal function could be
medication induced, secondary to ATN or prerenal azotemia. The
most likely cause was thought to be pre-renal due to the septic
physiology then worsened by volume overload.  He was gradually
diuresed as above and discharged on his hospital dose of 120 mg
IV Lasix daily. This can be gradually tapered down as his
respiratory status and peripheral edema improves. His creatinine
and electrolytes should be monitored as his diuresis continues.
.
3) Hyponatremia/metabolic acidosis: The patient presented as
hypovolemic hyponatremic and mild metabolic acidosis associated
with renal failure.  He was volume repleted as above and his
metabolic derangements improved.
.
4) Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. His
blood pressure medications were held during his stay and resumed
prior to discharge.
.
5) Atrial fibrillation: The patient presented in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.  This was a new finding for the patient
according to our records. His rate was well controlled during
the hospital stay.  The decision to anti-coagulate the patient
with coumadin was deferred to the patient's primary care
providers and LTAC physicians.
.
6) Diabetes mellitus type 2: Elevated blood glucose on arrival
likely indicative of intravascular
