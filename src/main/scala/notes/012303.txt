History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16284**] is a 75F with history of endometrial cancer who
presented with CP and is found to have a pulmonary embolism. Pt
reports that she was feeling well until 4d PTA when she
developed suddent onset of right sided CP. This radiated to her
R shoulder and posterior thigh. She initially ascribed this to
gas, but pain persisted over the weekend. She was trying to wait
out her symptoms given PCP appointment this week. She developed
increased SOB on ambulation the day prior to admission. At [**Company 191**],
she was hypoxic to 88-89% on referred to the ER for emergent
evaluation.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals were 98 86 144/95 16
96% on RA. She was given nitroglycerin x2 and morphine 6mg for
her chest pain. EKG showed. CTA chest showed bilateral lobar PE
and she was started on a heparin drip. Had been hypertensive up
to 180's/110's in the setting of pain. On exam, mildly
tachypneic. Has two PIVs, given 1L of NS.
.
On evaluation in the ICU, she reports her pain is 6.5/10. Denies
any leg pain, swelling, history of leg trauma, estrogen use,
smoking, personal or family history of DVT. Had one miscarriage.
No hemoptysis, fevers, chills, sweats, weight loss. Traveled to
[**Location (un) 4708**] as recently as [**4-12**] but no extended trips since
that time.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with chest pain and
found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms.
.
# Submassive pulmonary embolisms:
Patient presented with progressive chest pain and dyspnea over
several days.  She underwent CTA in the Emergency Department
which revealed bilateral pulmonary embolisms.  She was
hemodynamically stable with the exception of significant
tachypnea and hypoxia.  She was started on a heparin drip and
transferred to the ICU. In the ICU was found to have evidence of
right heart strain on TTE and mild troponin and BNP elevation.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT,
eliminating the need for IVC filter.  Echo performed showed no
evidence of clot-in-transit. She was transitioned from a heparin
drip to lovenox and coumadin.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable, however, due to her supplemental oxygen requirement she
spent her first three days in the ICU.  She was transferred to
the medicine floor where she was nearly weaned off her oxygen.
Patient still requires supplemental oxygen with ambulation and
during sleep to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 90%.
She was discharged home on lovenox and coumadin and home oxygen.
 VNA services were established to draw her blood for INR
monitoring.  Patient will be followed in the [**Company 191**] [**Hospital 3052**] starting [**2136-6-6**]. Recommend follow up with Gyn/Onc
to evualate status of endometrial cancer as this may be a
contributor to the onset of pulmonary embolisms.
.
# Anemia: Patient appears to have chronic anemia with a history
of iron supplementation.  Hematocrit was closely monitored
during admission due to use of anticoagulants.  Hematocrit
remained stable and was at baseline on day of discharge.
.
# Low grade fever:  Presumed to be secondary to pulmonary
infarct in setting of submassive pulmonary embolisms.  Patient
had no evidence of infection on UA or CXR.
.
# Hypernatremia:  Hypernatremia due to hypovolemia given
increased insensible water losses with low grade temps,
tachypnea and decreased po intake prior to admission.  Patient
was treated with IV fluids and encouraged to increase po intake.
 Her hypernatremia resolved during her admission.
.
# Hypertension: Patient has known history of hypertension.
Significant pain/discomfort on presentation likely contributed
to elevated blood pressures.  Patient was continued on home
losartan and beta blocker.  Her HCTZ was increased from 12.5 to
25mg daily. Her nitrates were held during admission due to
concern for decreasing her preload. Patient's blood pressure
became better controlled with the increase in HCTZ and with
management of her pain and dyspnea. Patient was instructed to
resume all home medications upon discharge (with the increased
dose of HCTZ).
.
# OSA: Continued on home CPAP
.
# Asthma:  Patient reported intermittent exacerbations of asthma
symptoms during her admission.  She was treated with albuterol
nebs and scheduled advair.  Upon discharge patient's serevent
and azmocort inhalers were replaced with an advair inhaler.
Patient was instructed to continue to use her albuterol inhaler
as needed and to notify her primary care physician if she is
frequently requiring her rescue inhaler.
.
# Degenerative Joint Disease:  Patient's osteoarthritis pain was
managed with acetaminophen and percocet.  She reports being
recently instructed to discontinue her use of high dose
ibuprofen.  She was discharged with extra-strength acetaminophen
and percocet.  She showed clear understanding of the need to
limit her acetaminophen intake to less than 4000mg per day.  She
states this will not be an issue because her pain is well
controlled by taking 1 percocet and 1 acetaminophen together
three times a day (total of 2475mg acetaminophen per day).
Patient was evaluated by physical therapy prior to discharge.
They recommended home physical therapy or rehab. [**Hospital 1739**] rehab
was offered to the patient which she refused. She did not want
to prolong her hospital stay or be admitted to a rehab center.
She showed clear understanding of the risks of going home
without physical therapy clearance.  Patient was discharged with
home physical therapy, a rolling walker and a 3-in-1 commode.
.
# Enlarged heterogeneous-appearing thyroid:  Incidental finding
on CTA on presentation.  Exam revealed an obese neck without
clear evidence of thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.  Would
recommend further outpatient workup with thyroid function tests
and serial exams.
