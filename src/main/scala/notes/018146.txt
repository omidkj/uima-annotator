Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
intravenous and intra-arterial TPA
intubation and subsequent extubation
transfusion of 9 units packed red blood cells and 2 units FFP

History of Present Illness:
82 year-old female with h/o takosubo cardiomyopathy, s/p cath @
[**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2188-8-7**] which showed apical ballooning,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who presented to [**Location (un) **]
with chest pressure. Patient reports she was in her usual state
of health until pain started evening of [**11-29**] at 10pm. The pain
awoke her from sleep and she had a difficult time falling back
asleep secondary to chest discomfort. She also felt nauseous
throughout the evening. In the morning, she called her daughter
and came into the [**Name (NI) **]. Patient denies any recent illness or
unusual stressful events.
.
At OSH, EKG reveals ST elevation in V3 - V6. Labs were
significant for troponin I of 4.24 -> 8.17. She also complainted
of epigastric pressure and had one episode of nausea and vomited
bileous x1. Zofran given x1 with relief. Echo done today and
reviewed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**], but report is unavailable. Prior EF was
40%. Now "decreased." As OSH, patient given plavix 300, ASA 325,
and started on heparin gtt. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization given concern for STEMI.
.
Vitals on transfer were 110/51 71 sr with PVCs resp18-20 sat
97-98% on 2L nc, 0/10.
.
Patient went for cardiac catheterization, which revealed normal
LMCA, 30 - 40% stenosis in proximal and mid-LAD, 30% stenosis on
Left Cx, and 30% mid-RCA stenosis. She had a left ventriculogram
showing apical ballooning with non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
.
On the floor, patient reports chest pain is currently resolved.
She denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, dyspena, orthpnea.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TTE [**2189-12-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary
to extensive, severe, circumferential apical hypokinesis with
focal apical dyskinesis. The basal segments are hyperdynamic but
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is not present. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
TTE [**2189-12-9**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
diatl anterior wall, septal walll, and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction from focal basal hyperkinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild left ventricular outflow
tract gradient from basal left ventricular hyperkinesis.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-12-1**],
left ventricular systolic function has improved.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2189-11-30**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow - limiting
stenoses. The
LMCA was patent. The LAD had a 30-40% proximal and mid stenosis.
The LCX
had an origin 30% stenosis. The RCA had a mid 30% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated left
sided
pressures with LVEDP of 24 mmHg. There was no aortic valve
gradient seen
on careful pullback from left ventricle to aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed apical ballooning with non
infarct
zone hyperkinesis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries had no angiographically- apparent
flow-limiting
disease.
2. Mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
3. Marked apical balloning - during ventriculogram.
