Imaging:
Renal US:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 13.1 cm and the left kidney
measures 14.5 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, renal masses or
stones. There is probably a left-sided duplicated system, as
discussed on the previous reports. Limited views of the bladder
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-30**] and [**12-3**]: Bibasilar consolidation has grown progressively worse since
[**11-30**] and [**12-3**], concerning for pneumonia. Vascular
congestion and severe
cardiomegaly indicate cardiac decompensation, with probable new
edema in the mid lung zones. Right jugular line ends at the
superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
50F h/o paraplegia, recurrent UTIs with ESBL klebsiella presents
with likely urosepsis.

# Hypotension: Met SIRS criteria with likely source urine, and
has history of resistant ESBL Klebsiella and Proteus, sensitive
to Zosyn and carbapenems. Also with h/o MRSA. Pulmonary source
also possible although less likely.  There was no evidence of a
new infection to date. Her blood pressures were a little lower
than they usually are, likely due to decreased food intake.  She
was discharged with instruction to continue to stay hydrated and
increase salt in her diet in order to keep your blood pressures
in her usual range.  Discharged on prior Amoxicillin dosing.

# Altered mental status: Likely toxic-metabolic due to combo of
infection and pain medications.  Improved without change in
medications or clear infection.

# Chronic pain: Followed by pain clinic at the [**Hospital1 756**] (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Initially held sedating medication but then restarted
prior to discharge as mental status improved.

# Paraplegia s/p MVA: Complicated by atonic bladder requiring
self-catherization, DVT/PE s/p IVC filter, chronic pain
syndrome, post SCI anxiety/depression.  Continued oxybutinin for
urinary retention.

# Hepatitis C: Chronic with undetectable viral load as of [**10-9**].
No acute issues.

# Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease, normocytic; currently at
baseline Hct 30-36.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued outpatient levothyroxine.
