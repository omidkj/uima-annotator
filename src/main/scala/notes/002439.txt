Chief Complaint:
s/p fall --> [**Last Name (un) 94409**] transfer from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital, arrived
in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] around 3 pm for acute SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Craniotomy with evacuation of acute SDH
PEG tube placement [**10-17**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo woman with h/o paroxysmal AFib on coumadin
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-5**] with subdural hemorrhage after a
fall the day before.
.
History obtained from the daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 94410**]: her mother
is usually articulate, and lives with her husband. Yesterday, at
around 2:30 pm, her husband and herself got back from eating
lunch out. She bent down to pick a piece of paper, tripped and
fell, and hit the left side of her head. The apartment that she
and her husband live in face the beach, and two boys came
running to her aide, dialled 911, and she refused to go. The
following day, another one of her daughters came to pick her up
to go out for the day, but she was still in bed. According to
her daughter [**Name (NI) **], she normally does not sleep well at
night, but ended up having a good night of sleep.
.
INR was 3.5 on admission and was reversed with FFP. She
underwent craniotomy with evacuation of hematoma SDH s/p
craniotomy with evacuation of hematoma. Her hospital course was
complicated by fevers felt to be due to hospital acquired
pneumonia. She then developed respiratory distress in the
setting of her pneumonia and volume overload and was transferred
to the MICU [**10-10**] for further management.
.
In the MICU, she was diuresed with IV lasix gtt, during which
time she has developed a contraction metabolic alkalosis. TTE
demonstrated hyperdynamic LV with grade II diastolic
dysfunction. Lasix gtt was discontinued in the AM of [**10-14**] and
she has been euvolemic on 80mg IV lasix daily, currently with
sat's of 99% on a face mask (she is a mouth breather). She had
AFib with RVR in the setting of her infection, but her heart
rate has been well controlled over the past several days. Her
mental status has remained poor (apparently "very articulate" at
baseline and is primary caregiver for her husband, who has
dementia). She is minimally responsive to voice and touch and is
non-verbal. She was having witnessed apneas, so the MICU team
repeated her head CT [**10-14**], but there was no evidence of
progressive bleed. She also had a CT of her pelvis to evaluate
for fracture; the preliminary read shows no evidence of
fracture.
.
She has been called out to the medicine floor for further care.
Of note, she continues to have fevers and leukocytosis. Her
course of vanc and zosyn for HAP is supposed to be completed
[**10-15**]. She also received 5 days of bactrim for E coli UTI per UCx
from [**10-5**]. Repeat cultures are unrevealing at this time, though
UA did have trace leukocytes. C diff is pending; she has had [**2-16**]
loose BMs/day.
