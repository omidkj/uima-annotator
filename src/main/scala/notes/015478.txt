Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old female with a complicated past
medical history including asthma and OSA who presents with acute
onset shortness of breath since approximately 2 am on the
morning of admission. Per the patient, she noted some mild
shortness of breath before going to bed on the night prior to
admisssion and required an albuterol neb. Her condition did not
improve following this and she was noted to have an O2 sat of
44% and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] complexion. She was given 3 more nebs and brought
in by EMS. In the ED here, her initial O2 sat was 80% on NC,
improved to 100% on NRB. She was initially placed on BiPAP which
was eventually turned off and she was tried on NC. She
subsequently desaturated but came up to 100% on 12L NRB. 3
duonebs were also given after being off BiPAP.
.
She was subsequently transferred to the ICU, where her vitals
were: afebrile, 132/77 80 14 100% 12L NRB. She was given SL
Nitro x2 given for "a little bit of CP", which resolved after
nitro. Also received SoluMedrol 125mg IV x1, Levofloxacin 750mg
IV x1.
.
She denies h/o COPD, CHF, but is on home lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **]. No
f/c/n/v/LE swelling. BNP was negative, CXR read in the ED as
volume overload and 40mg IV furosemide was given with 800cc
output via Foley that was placed in ED. Troponin neg, d-dimer
neg. WBC noted to be 12.
.
She has a history of asthma requiring daily albuterol and prior
hospitalizations but no intubation, on 2L home O2.
.
On the floor, she reports continued mild shortness of breath,
which she notes is near her baseline. She has a chronic
nonproductive cough, but reports mild sinus congestion for the
past two days and her cough has worsened and become productive
of small amounts of yellowish sputum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old female with a complicated past
medical history including asthma and OSA who presents with acute
onset shortness of breath since approximately 2 am on the
morning of admission. She was briefly admitted to the ICU on a
BiPap then NRB. She swiftly transitioned to nasal cannula on
asthma exacerbation therapy.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Chronic Asthma with Acute Exacerbation: Given her history of
asthma, wheezing on exam, and improvement over several hours
with nebs, this was likely another asthma exacerbation. Despite
her decreased mobility, we doubted PE, as she had a low D-dimer
of 271, and she has no calf tenderness. Given her elevated white
count with slight left shift, she could have early pna, but she
was afebrile and had no other sx and CXR and her exam was not
consistent with infection. Given her risk factors of DM2, HTN,
HLD she is also at risk of ACS. She denied any CP upon
development of her SOB, her first trop was negative, and her
recent cath was unremarkable. The inspiratory nature of her
wheezing is also concerning for vocal cord dysfunction. Also,
her recent URI is likely a contributing factor to the
exacerbation. COPD, Pickwikian, bronchitis, and vocal cord
dysfunction are also possible and her acute decompensation is
likely multifactorial. She was treated with IV steroids (125 mg
solumedrol), albuterol nebs, and a 100% non-rebreather and was
brought to the ICU. By the time she reached the ICU, her sats
had improved and she was stable on 4L by nasal cannula. She was
brought up to the floor where she was continued on Q4 albuterol
nebs and 30 mg PO prednisone and her O2 was weaned. She noted
significant improvement in her breathing and felt that she was
near her baseline by the morning following her admission. She
was discharge on albuterol nebs, which she has at baseline, as
well as a 3 day prednisone taper and flovent inhaler
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
#Type 2 DM Uncontrolled with complications- We held her hold
home metformin and glipizide and kept her on ISS.
.
#Benign Hypertension- Home meds were continued: valsartan,
furosemide.
.
#Hyperlipidemia- continued home statin
.
#GERD- continued omeprazole
.
#Osteoarthritis- continued home pain treatment regimen with
vicodin and motrin
.
#Panic disorder- continued home quetiapine QHS
.
#depression- continued mirtazapine and citalopram
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. She will go back to the [**Hospital3 2558**] for continued care.
2. She has a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist to
[**Hospital3 4656**] her respiratory issues. An [**Month (only) **] appointment was being
discussed at discharge and may be arranged pending appointment
availability.
3. She has a follow-up appointment with ENT to [**Month (only
