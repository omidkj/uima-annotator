Brief Hospital Course:
This 74 y/o white female was admitted 0n [**2180-7-22**] through the
emergency room after a 2 week history of headache and declining
mental status.  She was on coumadin at home for her atrial
fibrillation. Hisotry at that time was obtained from her husband
and he reported that she had had episodes of incontinence
secondary to not being able to make it to the bathroom in time
secondary to ataxia.  CT scan was originally done at [**Hospital1 **] and then patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
SDH was noted.  The repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**] was unchanged as the
collection was acute with the majority of the collection being
chronic. There was 1 cm of MLS at that time.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2180-7-22**] shorlty
after her admission for evacuation of the SD collection as her
mental status was continuing to decline.  She was given FFPx2
units to futher correct the INR which was originally 3.9 (she
recieved 4 units FFP at [**Last Name (un) 1724**]). She was also started on Dilatin.
Postoperatively she was unable to be extubated (she has had a
history of difficulty with extubation in the past per her
husband).  She remained vented and was eventually trached on
[**2180-8-1**].  Her postoperative [**Last Name (un) 30640**] exams have been stable with
slow progression.  She has mostly been purposeful with the right
upper extremity.  Her lower extremeties are active. and the Left
upper extremity is purposeful however slightly weaker than the
right.  She localizes briskly with the RUE and today on [**2180-8-9**]
has had some eye opening to noxious however still not following
commands.  She did however shake her head NO when asked if she
could show her thumb.   Her incision for the craniotomy has
healed completely.
On hospital day#1 she was started on levaquin and flagyl for ?
aspiration pneumonia.  She was kept NPO and PPI's were started -
she was started on sub-q heparin on post op day number [**11-21**].  Her
CT scan on [**2180-7-23**] of the brain showed a right temporal
hemorrhage which was felt to be a reperfusion injury - there
were and are no infarcts.  This hemorrhage was not evacuated.
Tube feeds were started on [**2180-7-24**] -She was seen and evaluated by
Inpatient Nutritional services on [**2180-7-25**] - Their recommmendation
was that she start promote with fiber at 60 cc hr - she
ultimately met her goal at 80cc / fr. (1920kcal, 120 g protien)
- (however TF goal while on propofol which provides caloric
intake was to be at 60cc/hr)
Ventilation weaning attempted on multiple occassions.  As of
HD#6 [**2180-7-27**] she was not able to be weaned and the tracheostomy
was scheduled. At times her dilantin level had dropped and she
was given boluses. Ultimately her dilantin was stopped on
[**2180-8-8**] and Keppra was started.

On [**2180-8-1**] she had a  Tmax of 104.2 - fever w/u was intiated by
SICU team. sputum with gm + cocci in pairs and clusters - urine
culture was neg. MRSA in sputum on [**2180-8-2**] - antibiotics were
started, she received 14 days of Vancomycin

MRI was done on [**2180-8-4**] because of slow neurological progression
although CT scans have all remained stable with postoperative
changes and the reperfusion injury.  FINDINGS: Diffusion images
demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct. There is subdural
hematoma seen from the right frontal to occipital region
extending to the interhemispheric fissure. The maximum width of
the subdural is 8 mm in the right parietal region. The subdural
measures approximately 9 mm along the falx. A small left-sided
subdural hematoma is also seen in the parietal region, the
maximal width of 4 mm. There is additionally, a right temporal
intraparenchymal hematoma identified. There is mild surrounding
brain edema seen. There is effacement of the sulci along the
right cerebral hemisphere without midline shift. An area of low
signal on susceptibility-weighted images in the right occipital
region indicate chronic blood products from previous hemorrhage.
The basal cisterns are patent. There is no evidence of
transtentorial or transforamen magnum herniation seen. Following
gadolinium administration, there is some enhancement of the
meninges seen but there is no evidence of abnormal parenchymal
enhancement identified adjacent to the intraparenchymal
hematoma. No other areas of abnormal intraparenchymal
enhancement noted. Postoperative changes are seen in the right
frontal region.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral subdural hematoma with right-sided
hematoma extending to the interhemispheric fissure with
measurements as described above. Right temporal intraaxial
hematoma with surrounding edema. No midline shift or herniation.
Mild mass effect on the right cerebral hemisphere. No evidence
of acute infarct.

Pt was also seen and evaluated by PT and OT services during her
ICU stay.

She had a PEG placed on [**8-10**] under interventional radiology, her
tube feeds are Promote with fiber @80hr now at goal.

She continued to have difficulty being weaned from vent despite
numerous trials, though seems to be more successful as she is
being moved out of bed to chair and now more awake.  Her current
vent settings at this writing CPAP + PS with R 12, TV 500 and
50% FiO2, PEEP of 5

On [**8-13**] her neuroexam appeared much improved she opened her eyes
spontaneously, shook her head yes/no and followed simple
commands.  She was started on Bab
