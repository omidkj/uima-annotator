Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress, "coffee ground" emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with PMHx (detailed below) significant for traumatic
brain injury with [**Hospital 56102**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **]
on [**2125-12-13**] with nausea and vomiting, fever to 101, coffee
ground emesis, markedly increased secretions, hypoxia, and
hypotension.

The patient was living independently with his wife prior to [**9-29**]
when he sufferred a fall on coumadin which led to bilateral
SDH/SAH and a Right MCA stroke. The patient required intubation
during this first hospital stay secondary to respiratory
failure.  He subsequently had a tracheostomy and PEG placed.
The patient developed a MRSA bacteremia and was started on
Vancomycin.  He was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab facility in
good condition after a month long hospital course.  On [**2125-10-27**]
the patient returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for headaches and fevers. The
patient was found to have a reaccumulated subdural hematoma, a
temp to 103.8, and was started on vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl,
(having had completed a fourteen day course of vancomycin on
[**10-28**] for MRSA pneumonia) switched to vanco, ceftaz, flagyl on
[**11-1**] to better cover pseudomonas after subdural hematoma
evacuation.

The patient was subsequently found to have high grade Vancomycin
resistent Enterococcus facecium bacteremia and was started on
linezolid.  Urine was negative for infection, chest x-ray showed
likely failure and possible pneumonia. The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2125-11-14**] where he remained
until [**11-28**] when the patient had an episode of sudden desats,
hypotension, hypoglycemia with a FSBG of 50 and spiked a fever
to 99.2.  The patient was brought to the ED via EMS and
transferred to the ICU, where he remained until [**12-12**],
undergoing treatment for respiratory failure most likely related
to a LLL aspiration PNA.  He was treated with a full course of
Levaquin for his PNA and 5 days of Zosyn for a line infection.
On admission the patient was placed on AC vent control.  At the
time of discharge to [**Hospital3 **] hospital he had
successfully been weaned to trach [**Hospital3 **] and was requiring 3 hour
suctioning.

When the patient returned the next day, he was febrile to 103,
hypotensive with SBP<80, and had coffee ground emesis from his
tracheostomy tube.  WBC count was 19.1 and lactate was 4.6.  The
patient was transferred to the ICU from the ED for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:

1. Sepsis:
Patient was admitted with hypotension, elevated lactate(4.6),
fever to 103, after an episode of nausea, vomiting and witnessed
aspiration at [**Hospital3 **].  He was treated for presumed
sepsis with aggressive IV fluids and antibiotics and
defervesced.  His blood pressure stabilized overnight and
elevated lactate resolved. Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] had no further episodes of
hemodynamic instability throughout the remainder of the hospital
course.  It was presumed his sepsis was secondary to the
Klebsiella in his urine and sputum.

The patient was maintained on a full treatment course of
Vancomycin and Meropenem.  All antibiotics were discontinued on
[**2126-1-1**].  Blood cultures were negative since [**2125-12-28**].  He
remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure secondary to Aspiration Pneumonia
s/p tracheostomy.
On admission, it was felt the patient had a recurrent aspiration
pneumonia as he was witnessed to vomit through his tracheostomy
tube.  Chest X-Ray supported the diagnosis of LUL and RLL
aspiration PNA. On admission, his prior sputum cultures were
reviewd and a culture from [**12-8**] was noted to have grown
Klebsiella pneumonia sensitive only to Meropenem. The patient
was therefore started immediately on Meropenem on [**12-13**].  Repeat
sputum culture on [**12-14**] also grew Klebsiella pneumonia with
multiple resistances, sensitive to meropenem. He was also
treated with Gentamicin x 2 doses.  He was noted to be
hypoxic(pO2 50)in the ED on trach [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was placed on AC
ventilatory support with improvement of his oxygenation. Within
a day, the patient was weaned back to trach [**First Name3 (LF) **] with stable
oxygen saturations.  By discharge the pt was requiring only Q3-4
hour suctioning. During this admission, he was also fitted for a
PMV ot facilitate communication. The patient was transferred to
the floor on [**2125-12-22**] for transition to [**Hospital1 **] for further
rehab care.

Frequent suctioning requirement of thin clear sputum was
prominently helped by application of a scopolamine patch, which
decreased suctioning requirement to approximately q4-6h.

3. Urinary Tract Infection with Klebsiella:

Urine culture from [**12-13**] grew Klebsiella pneumonia.  The patient
was treated with Meropenem for full course of antibiotics that
began [**2125-12-13**]. He should have his urinalysis repeated to
document clearance of the infection.

4. History of VRE bacteremia:

The patient was continued on linezolid for empiric treatment of
VRE endocarditis for 6 week course of antibiotics, given family
declined TEE during his [**Month (only) 359**] admission to fully exclude
endocarditis.  His Linezolid was discontinued on [**12-23**] after
multiple negative blood cultures. This was several days shy of
the full 6 week course, but it was felt that Linezolid may be
contributing to his persistently low platelets and was not
adding any further benefit.

3. Fevers:

The patient was treated for his Klebsiella pneumonia and urinary
tract infection with Meropenem and his fevers resolved. The
patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his hospital
course after his initial febrile period.

4. Cardiovascular:

Blood Pressure:  Pt was hypotensive on admission in the
Emergency Department with BP 90/60s. He was managed with
agressive fluid resuscitation and transient pressure support
with Levophed .
