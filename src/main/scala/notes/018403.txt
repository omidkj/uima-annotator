Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea
Chest pain

2.  Pericardiocentesis [**11-16**]
3.  VATS, Chest Tube, Pericardial Window dilation, [**11-17**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 32 y.o. male with history of aortic valve replacement
for strep. viridans endocarditis that was complicated by aortic
insufficiency who presents with progressive dyspnea. Patient has
experienced exertional dypsnea since [**2112-11-7**]. Prior to this,
patient had been able to walk several walks without any
difficulty in breathing. Since [**11-7**], he becomes dypsneic after
walking 1 block on level ground. He has never had dyspnea before
and denies any cough or pleuritic chest pain. Patient reports 4
pillow orthopnea. He denies any lower exremity oedema. He
reports reproducible chest pain that is at baseline from his
sternotomy incision, which is relieved with ibuprofen. He also
reports back pain when bending down to pick something up.
.
In the ED, bedside echocardiogram was obtained and demonstrated
large pericardial effusion, without any tamponade physiology.
Chest x-ray revealed large chest x-ray. Although patient was
dyspneic, he did not have any hemodynamic instability or
significant pulsus paradoxus. He was admitted to CCU for
hemodynamic monitoring.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea and chest pain
as above. No history of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated Sinus rhythm at 66 bpm with decreased relative
voltage compared with prior dated [**6-/2112**], at which time patient
had met criteria for LVH.  Secondary TWI from LVH, but otherwise
no new ST-T wave changes.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**11-10**] demonstrated:
Borderline dilation of LV cavity, normal LV systolic function
(EF 55%), normally-functioning mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis, [**1-26**]+ MR, large circumferential pericardial effusion,
no echographic evidence of tamponade.

Cx-ray on [**11-10**]:
A large right pleural effusion associated with compressive
atelectasis, cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS
.
## Pericardiocentesis: Patient admitted to CCU w/ cocern for
impending tamponade.  Was monitored in CCU and deemed to be
stable for floor after an appropriate period of time.  Coumadin
was held and heparin gtt started for anticoagulation when
patient's INR near 2.5.  Pericardiocentesis drain placed in Cath
Lab on [**11-16**].  Post-drainage showed near complete resolution of
the effusion.  Patient was then taken to OR by thoracics for
VATS (out of concern for hemothorax), chest tube placement, and
pericardial window.  OR course notable for open pericardial
window (as noted in prior operative reports) that was further
dilated in OR.  2L of fluid removed that was sanguinous and
clotted prior to being able to check Hct - suggesting
significant blood component. Patient with small pneumothorax s/p
procedure, and w/ air leak.  Chest tube left in place until
[**2112-11-21**] when deemed safe to remove.
.
## Pleural effusion - Large right-sided pleural effusion.  Once
patient's INR subtherapeutic, patient underwent diagnostic and
therapeutic thoracentesis on [**11-14**] removing 1L of sanguinous
fluid from the R-pleural space.  Hct of fluid 13% consistent
with prior bleeding.  LDH and protein consistent with exudative
process as well.  After pericardiocentesis as above, patient had
some improvement in pleural effusions indicating communication
between the pleural and pericardial space.  Given concern for
lung entrapment with bloody effusions, definitive drainage of
pleural space was performed in OR w/ VATS and chest tube
placement as above.  Ultimately upwards of 3L of fluid was
removed from the R-lung.  F/u imaging showed near complete
resolution of the patient's effusions.  Patient remained
comfortable on room air throughout his hospitalization.
.
## Valves - 25mm mechanical aortic valve prosthesis
- On admission, patient's coumadin held.  Heparin gtt started
when INR near 2.0.  CT surgery recommended the patient to be on
ASA and coumadin on discharge due to added benefit of preventing
thrombosis in mechanical valves with minimal increase in risk of
significant GI bleeding.  Patient was restarted on coumadin
prior to discharge.  Target INR [**2-27**] with aortic mechanical
valve.  Will be followed in coumadin clinic.
.
## Remainder of the patient's hospitalization was uneventful.
