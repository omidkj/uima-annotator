History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97639**] is an 83M with a PMH s/f advanced dementia, and
recurrent aspirations s/p PEG placement in [**2-/2195**] who presents
from the [**Hospital3 **] after a suspected aspiration event. He
was in his USOH until this morning at 9AM, when he had an
episode of yellow vomitus. His exam at that time was notable for
a firm and distended abdomen, for which a trial of laxatives
were given, with little relief. As day progressed, the patient
began to develop respiratory distress, and developed a fever. He
was give Ceftriaxone 1 Gm IM x1, was suctioned and given neb
treatments. As his respiratory status continued to decline, he
was brought to the ED.

In the ED, presenting vital signs were: T=101.4 rectally,
HR=106, BP=95/73, RR=24, O2SAT=95% on 4L NRB. Physical exam was
notable for rhonchorous lung sounds, and a distended abdomen
with a reducible hernia. Laboratory data was significant for a
leukocytosis to 44,000 with 23% bands, ARF (creatinine increased
to 1.5 from baseline of 1), a positive UA, and a lactate of 5.0.
A CXR revealed new airspace disease in the left lower lobe. A CT
of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained to evaluate for an SBO,
which showed a LLL consolidation, SBO, and cystitis. Surgical
consultation was obtained, and it was felt that there was no
indication for surgery at this time. The patient recieved a
total of 3L NS, 1g vancomycin, zosyn, and BP increased to 110s
systolic.

CXR [**2196-2-26**]: In comparison with the study of [**2-25**], there are again
low lung
volumes. The opacifications in the left upper and lower lung
zones are
slightly less discrete than on the previous study. This would be
consistent with some clearing of aspiration. Another possibility
would be gravitational edema if the patient has been lying on
his left side. The nasogastric tube extends to the upper portion
of the stomach, where it is cut off by the bottom of the film.


AB CT [**2196-2-24**]
1. Small-bowel obstruction which can be traced to the ileum with
a short
segment of thickened small bowel likely accounting for the
obstruction. The cause of thickening along the short segment of
small bowel is unclear and diagnostic considerations include
infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic processes. Please note,
neoplastic considerations cannot be entirely excluded.
2. Periumbilical hernia containing non-obstructed loop of
sigmoid colon.
3. Severe urothelial enhancement and perivesical stranding
compatible with
cystitis. Please note, there is no clear evidence for
pyelonephritis on the current study though ascending infection
cannot be excluded.
4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Stable right adrenal adenoma.
6. Left lower lobe consolidation, may represent
pneumonia/aspiration versus atelectasis.
7. Normal appendix.
8. Renal hypodensities likely representing cysts, though
incompletely
assessed. One large left renal cyst has collapsed since prior
exam from
[**2193-10-18**].
9. Adequate position of GJ tube.

Lung volumes remain low. Slight increased density over left lung
could be due to layering pleural effusion. patchy opacities in
left lung and dense left retrocardiac opacity persist. New right
PICC terminates in mid-SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 97639**] is an 83M with a PMH s/f advanced dementia, and
recurrent aspirations, who presents with fevers in the setting
of a presumed aspiration event, SBO, and a UTI.

#. Sepsis: On admission the patient met SIRS criteria with
fevers, leukocytosis, bandemia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He
also had signs of hypoperfusion with elevated lactate and
transient hypotension. After 4L of NS the pt's blood pressure
was stable. The pt's suspected sources of infection were a
possible aspiration/health-care associated pneumonia, UTI, or
the thickened bowel seen on CT abdomen. The pt was initially
treated with vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of health-care
associated PNA, but the pt developed a morbilloform rash that,
on examination of prior OMR records, the pt has a history of
with vancomycin. Vancomycin was discontinued and the pt's rash
resolved. Zosyn was continued for a plan to treat for 14 days
for pseudomonal HAP and ileitis. In setting
