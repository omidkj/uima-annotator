Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred with small bowel obstruction and septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Lysis of adhesions.
3. Decompression of the colon and small intestine.
4. PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This 72-year-old woman was seen at
the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2696**] for abdominal pain and vomiting.
The
patient was evaluated at outside hospital and found to have a
several-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting with a
lactate
of 7.7 and a marked left shift.  She was transferred here for
further management.  She has had several abdominal procedures
including an appendectomy, cholecystectomy, cesarean section and
TAH-BSO, and had one prior small bowel obstruction that required
a laparotomy.  She had a recent admission for what was thought
to
be a large bowel obstruction with what was thought to be a
transition point of the hepatic flexure.  She resolved
spontaneously and then had a colonoscopy, which showed some
congested mucosa at the hepatic flexure and the proximal
transverse colon and terminal ileum.  Biopsies were negative,
and
the patient was discharged.  CEA at that time was negative.  She
was thought perhaps to have a venous ischemia.  Hypercoagulable
workup was performed with a phospholipid antibody found.  She
then developed the above-mentioned syndrome with nausea,
vomiting
and acute weakness.  She was transferred here and was agitated
and in respiratory distress and was intubated.  Her labs at the
outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 8000 with
53%
bands, lactate of 7.7, creatinine of 2.5.


Past Medical History:
 Her past medical history is notable for
diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux,
morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, arthritis.


Social History:
Lives with spouse and son. The patient is a former smoker and
drinks one
drink per day.


Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
GENERAL:  She is an overweight woman who is intubated.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 99 degrees, blood pressure is
100/60, on Levophed drip.  Pulse rate of 99.
NECK:  The neck is somewhat plethoric.
CHEST:  Breath sounds are diminished on both sides.
HEART:  The heart rate is regular without murmurs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  The abdomen is obese and there is no particular
tenderness and the examination done before intubation did not
show a great deal of tenderness but there was distention. 	
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were somewhat pale.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. High grade large bowel obstruction with transition point at
the proximal to mid transverse colon. No CT findings to suggest
ischemic bowel. Findings may be secondary to adhesive disease,
less likely cecal volvulus.
2. Segment VI hepatic lesion, likely represents a hemangioma.
3. Left lower lobe [**Last Name (LF) 26646**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent aspiration and/or
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU upon transfer from the
referring hospital.  She was intubated and maintained on
antibiotics.  Given her clinical condition she was taken
emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy.
Please see the operative report for details.  Post-operatively
she was transferred back to the SICU. The rest of her hospital
course is outlined by systems below:

Neuro: The patient was kept intubated and sedated
postoperatively.  The sedation was weaned on HD 8 and she slowly
became alert.  On discharge she was alert and oriented x3

Pulm: The patient remained intubated until POD #9.  The
ventilator was then slowly weaned and she was able to be
extubated on POD#11.  During her intubation she required
bronchoscopy which revealed a mucus plug.  She also required
diuresis to improve her oxygenation.  She was eventually weaned
off oxygen and was saturating in the high 90's on RA upon
discharge

ID: The patient arrived to the hospital in septic shock.  Her
blood cultures eventually grew ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS and
LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES and her sputum culture grew klebsiella and
mold.  She was started on antibiotics including vancomycin,
Flagyl, fluconazole.  Antibiotics were continued for a total of
14 days.  On discharge she was afebrile with a normal white
count.  She was also given Xigris during her hospitalization for
treatment of her sepsis.

Heme:  The patient was noted to have a low platelet count in the
SICU.  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia was diagnosed by labs.
All heparin products were stopped and the patient was started on
Arixtra for anticoagulation.  The anticoagulation was stopped
once the patient was out of bed.  She was maintained on
pneumoboots throughout her hospitalization. A PICC line was
placed for antibiotics.

GI:  The patient remained NPO while in the SICU. A swallow
evaluation was obtained and they recommended soft diet with no
straws initially.  On discharge she was tolerating a regular
diet.   While in the SICU she was maintained on tube feeds via
and NG tube.  The tube feeds were stopped once the patient was
tolerating a regular diet.

GU:  The patient had a Foley catheter which was removed when she
came out of the SICU.  The catheter was replaced however because
the patient was incontinent and it was thought this was
worsening her decubitus ulcers.

On discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet, her pain
was controlled on oral medications and she was voiding via a
Foley catheter.  She is being discharged to acute rehab in
stable condition for further care.  She will be sent with a
Foley catheter.
