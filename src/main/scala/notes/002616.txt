Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]

Endotracheal intubation
Central line and Swan Ganz catheter placement
Chest tube placement


History of Present Illness:
69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent x 2 (last one [**2121-12-26**]
post IMI), CHF with EF 60%, PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and s/p
left brachial pseudoaneurysmal repair, transferred from
[**Hospital3 3834**] with fever and hypotension, as well as
troponin leak. Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2121-12-26**] with sudden onset right-sided CP and SOB, and was found
to have NSTEMI (ST depressions in lateral leads, peak troponin
of 5.0), with mild CHF. A cardiac catheterization revealed 95%
RCA stenosis (in-stent re-stenosis). A RCA Cypher stent was
placed with 10% residual stenosis. She was discharged home on
[**2121-12-27**].

On [**2122-1-8**], she presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **] with
non-exertional right-sided CP, along with SOB, which is her
anginal equivalent. Symptoms lasted approximately 1/2 hour, and
were improved but not resolved with SLNTG. In the ER her vital
signs were stable with T 97.0, BP 147/64, RR 18, Sat 98%RA. JVP
was elevated at 6cm, lungs with end expiratory wheezes. An EKG
revealed NSR with RBBB, no acute changes. Her initial CK was 25,
trop 0.04, WBC 4.8, and Cr 0.9. She was treated with aspirin,
nebs for possible COPD flare, and started on heparin IV for
possible unstable angina. While in the hospital, she had a
Myoview, showing an inferior filling defect.

On the night prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], she became
hypotensive with SBP to low 80's, temperature to 104, CK of 300
and CKMB 15.7, trop I 13.5. Her BP did not improve with fluid
resuscitation, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on
neosynephrine and heparin IV for possible re-cath. Of note, she
was on 50% FM, with decreased UO.

Further history revealed a sister with recent influenza and
hospitalization. ROS otherwise negative for worsening orthopnea,
PND, DOE, diarrhea, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD. Cardiac cath in [**2117**] with 80% proximal RCA lesion,
50-60% distal RCA lesion, 50% OM and a 40% distal LM/PLAD
lesion. S/p PTCA and stent placement to the proximal RCA.
Cardiac cath [**2118**]: RCA had an ostial 30-40% stenosis and mild
30-40% diffuse in-stent restenosis. EF of 60%. Cardiac cath
[**2121-12-26**], with 30% instent restenosis in the previously placed
RCA stent, and 95% mid vessel stenosis. PTCA with Cypher stent
placement performed, with 10% residual stenosis.
2. CHF, last EF 60% in [**2118**].
3. Hypothyroidism
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2

Past Surgical History:
1. Aorto-bifem bypass [**2111**]
2. Pseudoaneurysm repair '[**17**]
3. Bilateral cataract surgery

Social History:

years ago (smoked [**12-21**] ppd X 35 yrs).

Family History:
N/A

EKG: NRS, rate 125 bpm. [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-6, ST
depressions in II (old). TW flattening in III+aVF.

Relevant studies in hospital:

[**2122-1-10**] ECHO:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior, inferoseptal, and
inferolateral akinesis with relative preservation of the lateral
and anterior walls..
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Insufficent
doppler studies performed of the aortic valve to determine the
presence of stenosis or regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen but studies limited..
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

****************
[**2122-1-13**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
is dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
25-30%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though
a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

****************
[**2122-1-19**] ECHO:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and supporting
structures are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2122-1-13**], the
findings are similar (Overall LVEF was somewhat overestimated on
the prior study).

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent on [**2121-12-27**] for
in-stent restenosis, CHF, PVD, who returned to [**Location **] on [**1-8**]
with chest pain, initially ruled out, and who then developed
fever to 104, hypotension and rise in troponin I, transiently on
Neo drip, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Her
hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) CAD: On arrival, an echo revealed an EF of 25%, and resting
regional wall motion abnormalities with inferior, inferoseptal,
and inferolateral akinesis with relative preservation of the
lateral and anterior walls. CK was 250, Troponin 1.22 (peak),
EKG without ST elevations. Her picture was felt most consistent
with sepsis with demand-related ischemia rather than stent
thrombosis, and the decision was taken not to proceed to cardiac
catheterization. Her most recent cath in [**Month (only) 404**] revealed
single-vessel CAD which was stented. A PA line was placed on
admission, with initial numbers CVP 11, PA 43/16, SVR 620, CO/CI
7.1/3.76 felt most consistent with sepsis physiology, and MUST
protocol was initiated, with fluid resuscitation. She required
pressors intermittently, intially Neosynephrine, then Levophed,
which were eventually weaned off. She was continued on Heparin
IV for 48 hours, then D/C'd.

While in hospital, she was continued on ASA, Plavix and Lipitor.
BB and ACE were temporarily held in the setting of hypotension.
BB therapy was eventually resumed when BP stable. ACE inhibitor
held pending recovery of renal function, resumed on [**2122-1-21**]
with improving renal function and titrated up.

Follow-up arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] 1 week following discharge.
