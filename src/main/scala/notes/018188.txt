Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, leg swelling, abdominal distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis who
presented with weakness, lightheadedness, lower extremity edema,
and abdominal girth.  The patient had an Echo in [**2183**]
significant for mild to moderate aortic stenosis.  He had been
doing relatively well until 3 weeks prior to admission when he
began to notice weakness, primarily in his legs, and
lightheadedness upon exertion.  He notes that he has had several
falls, approximately 20 over the past 2 months, with his most
recent occurring yesterday.  He denies loss of consciousness or
head trauma with these episodes.   He has had no chest
pain/shortness of breath/nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis.

He has noticed swelling in his lower extremities over the past
1.5 weeks.  He reports that his abdominal girth has been present
for several years and is stable.  While he has gained some
weight over the past month, he is unable to quantify and
describes it as no more than usual.

Review of systems is negative for fever, cough, abdominal pain,
dysuria, and hematuria.  He does report [**1-1**] loose bowel
movements per day for the past 7 days.   He denies blood but
notes that his stool has been lighter in color than normal.  No
change in the color of his urine.

On the morning of admission, he reported to his friend that he
was too weak to keep his podiatry appointment; the friend
arrived at his house and found him to be very unkempt.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Ascites
The patient displayed a tense abdomen.  Abdominal ultrasound
revealed a large amount of ascites and a small nodular liver
suggestive of cirrhosis.  A diagnostic and therapeutic
paracentesis was performed and 5L of ascitic fluid were removed.
 Following the procedure, the patient continued to drain a large
amount of clear ascitic fluid from the site.

Analysis of the ascitic fluid was significant for 430 wbc with
60% lymphoctyes and a serum albumin: ascites gradient greater
than 1.  These findings were considered suggestive of portal
hypertension.  The etiology of the elevated lymphocyte count is
unclear but concerning.  This could be followed up by hepatology
as an outpatient.

The patient had a second diagnostic paracentesis when he
developed a change in mental status and elevated white count.
Cell counts were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.

The patient was also diuresed with a regimen of lasix and
spironolactone.

2. Cirrhosis
The cause of the patient's cirrhosis is unknown.  His reports of
alcohol consumption have been inconsistent.  Viral hepatitis
serologies were negative.  The patient exhibited episodes of
disorientation, and an ammonia level returned elevated.  This
was treated with lactulose.

3. Ischemic colitis
An abdominal CT was suggestive of mesenteric ischemia.  The
surgery and hepatology teams were consulted, and the patient was
treated with medical management.  He was sent to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after he passed bright red blood per rectum.
 He was placed on bowel rest and a 10 day course of
metronidazole, ampicillin, and levofloxacin.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable and returned to the floor after a short
stay in the MICU.

4. Portal vein thrombosis
He continued to reaccumulate ascites despite paracentesis and
diuretic therapy, so an abdominal ultrasound was repeated.  This
was significant for partial portal vein thrombosis.  A
subsequent abdominal CT confirmed near total occlusion of the
portal vein, with patency of the superior mesenteric vein.  An
EGD was significant for portal gastropathy but revealed no
esophageal varices.  However, given the patient's high risk of
bleeding, including his history of several falls and his portal
gastropathy, anticoagulation was held.

5. Aortic Stenosis
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed only
mildly worsened aortic stenosis.  His physical exam on admission
was suggestive of left and right sided heart failure and
improved with diuresis.

6. R/O MI
An EKG was significant for NSR, LVH, and ST depressions
laterally.  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.

7. Elevated BUN, Cr, K+
The patient's comprimised renal function was likely due to a
combination of intravascular volume depletion and CHF-induced
prerenal disease.  His renal function should be followed as an
outpatient.

8. Left carotid bruit
It was unclear if this is a true bruit or a radiation or his
heart murmur.  He may benefit from a carotid ultrasound in the
future.

9. Hypertension
The patient's blood pressures were well-controlled on his home
regimen of norvasc and cozaar.  After the diangosis of ischemic
colitis, blood pressure medications were held to preserve
mesenteric flow, and the patient's systolic pressures were
stable in the 140/150s.

10. Depression
The patient was continued on fluoxetine 20 mg qd per home
regimen.  When he exhibited mental status changes, this was
held.  He was placed on zyprexa and did well.

11. Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition
The patient was admitted with a sodium restricted diabetic diet.
 After the development of ischemic colitis and portal vein
thrombosis, he was placed on a low-protein, low-sodium,
low-residue diet.
