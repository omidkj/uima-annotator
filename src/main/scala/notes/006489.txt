Chief Complaint:
cough

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old woman with a history of rheumatoid
arthritis on Humira and dementia who is presenting from her [**Hospital1 1501**]
with three weeks of cough and new O2 requirement. Her son
explains that her cough started 3 weeks ago and was junky and
productive. Her LTC facility gave her a a [**Name (NI) 31069**] (unclear date
given) but she did not improve. According to the son she has
been intermittently on O2 at her [**Hospital1 1501**] for the past month. No
fevers, chills, shortness of breath or other symptoms. On the
day of admission she started complaining of increased fatigue
and developed a low grade fever. Her O2 sats at the LTC facility
were 92% on 2L. She also mentioned some abdominal pain to her
son this morning which he thinks was consistent with her ongoing
constipation.
.
On arrival to the ED her initial vital signs were temp 98.4 and
heart rate of 79 blood pressure of 89/33 respiratory rate of 22
and O2 sats of 74% on room air (and then 92% on 4L O2). A chest
x-ray showed an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity which could
reflect aspiration or infection with a small left pleural
effusion. She did not improve on a trial of nebs. She was
started on vanc/zosyn for health care associated pneumonia and
received a total of 500cc of IVF. She denied any abdominal pain
and had a benign abdominal exam. Her vital signs at the time of
transfer were HR 66 RR 27 BP 109/43 with O2 sats of 96% on a
non-rebreather.
.
On arrival to the MICU she is in visible discomfort and
breathing through a non-rebreather. She endorsed some shortness
of breath and cough but denied any chest pain.
.
Her son also mentions that he noticed bilateral conjunctivitis
this morning, L>R, and he thinks that she got this from one of
the other residents in her LTC facility. She does not wear
contacts and has no history of glaucoma.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
86F a history of RA on Humira and dementia who presents from her
[**Hospital1 1501**] with pneumosepsis.

She was presented with a CXR showing a left
pleural/parapneumonic effusion that quickly worsened to complete
white-out of this lung, likely secondary to a post-obstructive
pneumonic process.  She was febrile and hypotensive, sent to the
MICU for management.  She was covered for HCAP with Vancomycin
and Zosyn, extended past the typical 8-day coverage due to the
severity of her pneumonia and extremely high O2 requirement of
6L NC and high-flow O2 through the mask.  She then developed RML
collapse and she was unable to wean off any of this oxygen.  Her
code status was confirmed DNR/DNI with her family.  Her severe
conjunctivitis was treated with erythromycin ointment on
admission and improved markedly over her hospital course.

She then developed progressive acute kidney injury, with urine
sediment confirming acute tubular necrosis.  She continued to
become more somnolent with hypercarbia.  BiPAP was initiated
without benefit, though orotracheal suctioning seemed to
stimulate her cough and wake her up.  Given the refractoriness
of her disease, an awake bronchoscopy was performed to look for
any acute, reversible conditions (i.e. mucus plugging).

Follow-up CXRs showed progression of her disease bilaterally and
her O2 saturations dropped into the 70s.  Given the
irreversibility of her condition, the family decided to
transition the patient to comfort measures only and morphine
boluses were given for comfort.  Ms. [**Known lastname 3549**] passed away the
following morning, on [**2125-10-9**]. An autopsy was declined by the
family.
