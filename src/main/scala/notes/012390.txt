HD-dependent ESRD, stage IV decub ulcer who presents to the ER
with hypotension. Last hospitalization was [**1-11**]/-[**2146-1-22**] for

grew MSSA and VRE. She has had multiple recent hospitalizations
over the past month for lower GI bleed requiring transfusions
refusing colonoscopy on most recent admission, CHF complicated
by bilateral pleural effusions that responded to HD.
.
Lives at [**Location **]. Had been doing relatively well although was more
somnolent recently that family thought due to overmedication
with oxycodone and lorazepam that was being dosed standing for
decub dressing changes and anxiety. Has chronically required

new productive cough. Chronic unchanged diarrhea. Today for
scheduled HD session and noted to have SBPs 80s pre-HD, but
still dialyzed and completed session. Post-HD, SBPs dropped to
60-70s although patient mentating well and otherwise without
complaints. Sent to ED for evaluation.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have a SBP of 60s and therefore given
2 liters normal saline without improvement. Other vitals 97.5,
72, 22, 99% NRB. Right femoral CVL placed. Norepinephrine gtt
started with improvement to BP 105/30. WBC 12.3k without left

Imaging:
CXR [**2-11**]: IMPRESSION: Interval left PICC with tip within right
atrium that can be withdrawn by approximately 3 cm for more
optimal positioning within the low SVC. Stable large bilateral
pleural effusions with associated bilateral atelectasis, and
mild congestive heart failure.

Renal U/S [**2-7**]:
Atrophic kidneys bilaterally with prominent cortical thinning,
consistent with chronic medical renal disease. No perinephric
fluid
collections are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
An 85 year old lady admitted for hypotension due to sepsis.  She
was found to have C.diff colitis and osteomyelitis.  During this
admission a decision was made to focus on comfort measures after
medical therapy provided no clear improvement and she passed
away peacefully on [**2146-2-12**].

1. Hypotension:  The patient was admitted with hypotension
consistent with sepsis given increasing WBC count, C. diff
positivity, and sacral ulcer probing to bone.  She was treated
with Flagyl IV and Vancomycin PO only given no evidence of
bacteremia or culture from her wounds.  She was maintained on
levophed as needed for blood pressure maintenance.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress:  The patient developed
mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status
changes.  This resolved on its own with arousal.  CVVH was
briefly initiated to clear fluid overload and correct acidosis,
but stopped by the family when made CMO.

3. Acute on Chronic renal failure: The patient was briefly on
CVVH but stopped by the family when made CMO. Renal followed
closely.

4. Stage IV Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care & Plastic Surgery were
consulted and followed.  They made care recommendations but no
operative interventions.

5. Depression: The patient was continued on remeron and celexa.
