none

History of Present Illness:
50 male with h/o HIV (CD4 514 in [**5-30**]), EtOH abuse, COPD
presents with alcohol withdrawal approximately one hour after
his last drink (vodka). He reports that his drinking has
increased recently due to stresses in his life, both with his

subside. This has been present for at least two years. He denies
orthopnea, PND, edema.
.
ED COURSE: He was appreciated to be in acute EtOH withdrawal. He
was supported with IV lorazepam, given banana bag. He was found
to have an anion gap without osm gap, with a lactate of 6.3,
which closed somewhat with IVF. He also had elevated d.dimer
with negative CTA. His ECG was without changes and he had two
sets of negative cardiac enzymes. He was also give solumedrol
and duoneb for SOB.
.
ROS: Poor PO intake, ~30lb weight loss over 3 months, and
occasional chest pain. He also c/o intermittent abdominal pain.
He has not had recent F/C/night sweats. He denies vomiting,
diarrhea, rash. He is depressed without suicidal ideation or
intent.

STUDIES~
.
* CTA chest [**2197-11-5**]: There is no evidence of pulmonary
embolism. There is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.
There are multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, notably an
8-mm node in the superior mediastinal, a 7-mm precarinal lymph
node, and an 8-mm subcarinal lymph node. Lung windows
demonstrate emphysematous changes of the lungs with a
centrilobular distribution. There are opacities in a dependent
distribution in the posterior upper lobes and lower lobes. There
is no pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. There are
mild coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion. Limited images of the upper
abdomen demonstrate diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Emphysema.
3. Dependent opacities in the lungs may simply represent
dependent
atelectasis.
.
* CXR [**2197-11-5**]: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. Severe emphysematous changes are again noted. Possible
opacities seen posteriorly appear to correspond to areas of
dependent atelectasis on the CT scan obtained on the same day.
No evidence of pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe emphysema. 2. Possible posterior opacities
in the lungs appear to correspond to areas of dependent
atelectasis seen on the CT scan obtained on the same day.
.
*ECG [**2197-11-5**]:
.
*CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2197-5-4**] :
1. Sigmoid diverticuli without evidence of acute diverticulitis.

2. Normal appendix visualized.
3. Unusual area of hyperattenuation seen within the bladder near

the right UVJ, possibly representing ureteral jet with contrast

material, however, ultrasound is recommended for further
evaluation to exclude an enhancing mass within the bladder.
These findings were conveyed to ED dashboard immediately
following completion of this exam on [**2197-5-4**].
4. Fatty liver.
.
*Exercise MIBI [**2196-6-14**]: No ischemia


Brief Hospital Course:
 1. EtOH withdrawal: He has had multiple inpatient and
outpatient detoxes, without h/o DT, seizures. He has been
drinking more than usual recently. Initially maintained on
Ativan (received 16 mg on day 1 hosp), then weaned down on
ativan. By tranfer out of ICU, ativan had been weaned down to
1mg tid to continue until follow up with his PCP in the next
week.
.
2. Seizure: likely due to EtOH withdrawl, seen by neurology felt
[**1-26**] withdrawl but also recommended continuing ativan on d/c and
adding neurontin. Pt. was tolerating 300 mg tid of neurontin on
d/c and was given a schedule to increase this up to 600 mg tid
per neurology reccomendation.

3. Lactic acidosis: His anion gap was initially elevated at 30
with a lactic acid of 6.3. There is no osm gap. Following IVF,
lactate was 2.7. The most likely explanation is alcoholic
ketoacidosis.
.
4. Shortness of breath: His CT and CXR demonstrate severe
emphysema, though FEV1 normal. His DLCO was reduced at 52%
predicted in [**2194**]. CTA negative for PE. Resolved on discharge.
.
Chest pain: Positive family history, smoker, HIV/AIDS though
little is known of other risk factors. No ECG changes, no
further chest pain after leaving ICU. Negative stress [**2197-6-14**].
.
Abdominal pain / LFT: Unclear story, as he currently is
non-tender. His LFTs are elevated, most likely consistent
alcoholic hepatitis. He was scheduled for CT abd/pelvis in ED,
but held off due to contrast load. RUQ us obtained and revealed
no evidence of biliary disease, but a hypoechogeneic 2 cm
hypodensity that will need f/u MRI as an outpt. Abdominal pain
improved on d/c.
.
Diarrhea: Found to have C. Diff, started on Flagyl for 14 day
course.
.
HIV/AIDS: Not currently on HAART. checking CD4, viral load. His
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2392**] is aware that he is in ICU for EtoH and will
f/u re further treatment for HIV.
.
Depression: Partner insists his drinking was due to loss of will
to live. He currently denies suicidal ideation, but admits to
being depressed. Psych consulted and can f/u as outpt as
necessary.
.
FEN: replete lytes prn, regular diet
