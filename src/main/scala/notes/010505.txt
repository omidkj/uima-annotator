History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with extensive past
medical history including coronary artery disease, severe
cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and severe mitral
regurgitaion. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 in
[**2152-6-24**]. Repeat cardiac cath on [**2152-9-18**] showed elevated
right heart pressures, three-vessel coronary disease, and
occluded vein graft to obtuse marginal. His other vein grafts
were patent. An echo in [**2153-1-29**] showed dilated left ventricle
with
an EF of 20%, moderate TR, severe MR and right ventricular
systolic pressure of 58mmHg. He currently complains of
persistent
dyspnea on exertion- although this has improved in the past
month
following a decrease in Carvedilol dose. Presents for surgical
evaluation for Redo-sternotomy, MVR +/- TVR.

Intra-Op TEE [**2153-8-27**]
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 -
20 %). with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter. There is grade 1 atheroma of the descending
aorta..
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on high dose epi, norepi and milrinone.
Severe RV and moderate LV systolic dysfxn.
There are ring annuloplasties of the MV and TV with no leak or
regurgitation.
Peak mitral gradient is 12, peak tricuspid gradient is 3 mmHg.
Aorta intact.

Echo [**2153-9-3**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with only the anterolateral wall having
relatively normal function. All the other segments are akinetic.
There is an anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm. Diastolic
function could not be assessed. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV with severe systolic
dysfunction. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with
evidence of pressure/volume overload. Mitral and annuloplasty
rings in position with mild regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-28**],
the right ventricle is more dilated on the current study (was
described as normal in size on prior but was probably mildly
dilated then). The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2153-8-27**] where
the patient underwent redo sternotomy, MVrepair (26mm [**Company 1543**]
Profile 3D Ring), and TV repair (32mm [**Doctor Last Name **] MC3 Ring).
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on epinephrine,
milrinone, and levophed drips, as well as nitric oxide.  He was
in critical but stable condition.  Cefazolin was used for
surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  He did require escalating
inotropic support and nitric oxide overnight as PA pressures
remained elevated.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was consulted from the heart
failure service.  Inotropic and vasopressor support was weaned
over the following days.  PICC was placed for access on [**2153-8-31**].
 Hepatology was consulted for hyperbilirubinemia, which was
believed to be a result of hepatic congestion.  Total bili
peaked at 17.2mg/dL, then would trend down.  RUQ ultrasound
revealed gall bladder sludge without cholecystitis.  The patient
was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD 4.  Coreg
was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.

[**2153-9-4**]

By the time of discharge on POD **** the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged ***** in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
