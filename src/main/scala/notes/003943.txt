Chief Complaint:
Stridor


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-12-19**] - Intubation and arterial line placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25788**] is an 85 yo with hx of copd who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED today complaining of sob x 5-6 hours and stridor.  He
reports it was unlike any previous COPD episodes.  Per his
caretaker, he had increased work of breathing all night
preceeding his visit to the ED with audible wheezing.  His wife
[**Name (NI) 25789**] that and said that he was in his previous state of
health prior to last night.  She did say that he seemed to have
problems swallowing, but he never complained.  She denied any
change in his diet the night before that may suggest
anaphylactic response.  His daughter mentioned that he felt his
cough was worse.  In the ED, his symptoms did not improved with
bronchodilators.  ENT was consulted in the ED who felt that the
upper airway was patent and suspected a subglottic problem.
Because it was felt his airway was in danger and there was
concern of tracheal deviation by imaging, he was intubated.
Despite the concern for subglottic airway obstruction, the ET
tube passed without problem.  A CT neck and chest was ordered
and he was admitted to the MICU for further workup.  Labs were
notable for negative CEs.  BNP 9800. Cr 1.2 (BL 1.2).

Pertinent Results:
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM - [**2200-12-19**]
Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Aortic sclerosis without stenosis. Dilated thoracic aorta.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2200-12-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe atelectasis and right small to moderate
pleural effusion. No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
Sclerotic focus within the left proximal humerus also noted on
prior remote study from [**2191**] which is not fully characterized
and may represent an enchondroma.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST [**2200-12-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube cuff overinflated.
2. Findings compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Moderate
right-sided pleural effusion.
3. Probably reactive precarinal and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Dilated and fluid-filled esophagus, an aspiration risk. No
evidence of
aspiration at the current time.
5. Increase in the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm,
incompletely imaged on this study, since [**2198**]. Dedicated
abdominal imaging of this is
recommended.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Diverticulosis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2200-12-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Please note, MRI is more
sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia and can be
considered if there is high
suspicion for acute stroke.
2. Mild-moderate dialtion of ventricles can be due to diffuse
parenchymal
volume loss with superimposed Alzheimer's disease; to correlate
clinically.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Study Date of [**2200-12-23**]
IMPRESSION:
Incomplete and suboptimal study secondary to patient
noncompliance while in restraints. No evidence of DVT in the
vessels
interrogated as detailed above. If suspicion persists, consider
repeat
performance when patient compliance may be achieved.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2200-12-24**]
IMPRESSION:
Evidence for aspiration with thin liquids. Remainder of the
study demonstrated mild oral and pharyngeal swallowing
dysfunction as detailed above.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2200-12-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued laryngeal penetration with nectar-thickened liquids
and thin liquids, however, previously appreciated aspiration was
not noted on today's study.
2. Otherwise, no interval change in mild oropharyngeal swallow
dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25788**] was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress
s/p intubation.  His respiratory status improved and he was
extubated on [**2200-12-18**].  He had received steroids for possible
pharyngeal swelling and was being tapered upon transfer.  His CT
of the neck showed possible epiglottitis vs. post-intubation
inflammation.  After being extubated, he did well from a
respiratory standpoint.  However, his mental status was not at
baseline.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-pysch consult was called and recommended
changing his zyprexa to haldol and evaluating his R facial
droop.  He was ordered for a head CT to evaluate for possible
stroke.  He was already being treated with aspirin and aggrenox
for previous CVAs.  He failed his speech and swallow study and
an NG tube was placed and tube feeds started.  He was
transferred to the floor on [**2200-12-23**].

FLOOR COURSE:
#. Dyspnea / Stridor:
Once arriving to the floor the patient had only mild expiratory
stridor and typically only while awake. He was continued on a
prednisone taper for presumed airway inflammation of unknown
etiology and he finished his steroid course prior to discharge.
His pulmonary exam at discharge revealed some rhonchi, dry and
barking non-productive cough, and bibasilar crackles. He was
slightly tachypneic to the low 20s, but denied dyspnea and had
an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. He was receiving
albuterol and ipratropium nebs and was started on Advair while
hospitalized.

#. Hypertension:
Patient was removed from home regimen of valsartan due to small
chance that angioedema could be cause of his stridor. He was
started on HCTZ and then switched to amlodipine with good result
and was discharged on amlodipine.

#. Diarrhea:
Patient noted to have diarrhea last two days of admission;
however, clostridium d
