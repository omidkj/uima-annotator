Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary artery catheterization with RCA stent placement


History of Present Illness:
57 y.o man w/ long smoking history, HTN presents to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital with episode of dyspepsia and nausea which did not
improve with tums. He was found to have a likely inferior STEMI
with posterior extension, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization, which revealed a totally occluded RCA, 50% LCx
and 60% LAD lesion. A cypher stent was placed in the RCA, after
which the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic. He was put
on pressors which were quickly weaned off and brought to the
ICU. In the ICU he was stable.

Pertinent Results:

EKG [**2188-9-18**]:
Inferior ST elevation - repeat if myocardial injury is suspected

EKG [**2188-9-18**]:
Sinus rhythm
Lateral T wave changes are nonspecific
Low QRS voltages in limb leads
Since pervious tracing, no significant change

Cardiac cath [**2188-8-18**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revelaed three vessel disease.  The LMCA was wihtout flow
limiting
disease.  The LAD contained mild, diffuse disease witha 60% mid
lesion.
The LCX also was diffusely disease with a 50% lesion.  The RCA
was
totally occluded proximally with fresh clot present.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed a slightly elevated PCPW of
15mmHG.
Cardiac output was 6.8 l/min by the Fick method.
3. During the case, the patient transiently developed low blood
pressure
to the 70s systolic.  He was asymptomatic during this time.
Dopamine
was transiently infused, but easily weaned off by the end of the
case.
4. Successful PCI of the RCA with two Cypher DES (3.5 x 13 mm
overlapping with a 3.0 x 33 mm more distally).  The distal stent
was
post-dilated with a 3.25 mm balloon.  Final angiography
demonstrated no
dissections, no residual stenoses, and TIMI-3 flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Three vessel coronary disease.
2.  Normal cardiac output.
3. Successful Primary PCI of the RCA.

Echo [**2188-8-18**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include probable
basal to mid
inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber may be mildly
dilated and free
wall motion could not be adequately assessed (cannot exclude
hypokinesis). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) inferior MI - The patient's RCA was totally occluded so it
was stented with a cypher stent. The patient was put on a
IIbIIIa inhibitor and loaded with plavix and given aspirin post
cath. His EF was normal per echo. The patient was started on
metoprolol which was changed to atenolol at DC, and started on
captopril which was changed to lisinopril at DC. He was started
on lipitor 80 mg po qd as his LDL was elevated at 116. He was
monitored by telemetry during the hospitalization which showed
occasional extopic beats. He expressed a recurrent interest in
going home, but was encouraged to stay for 72 hours post MI per
guidelines, and a compromise was enetually reached to let him go
home after 60 hours. He was strongly encouraged to stop smoking,
and given smoking cessation information as well as a nicotine
patch. He will have cardiology follow up and cardiac rehab at
[**Hospital1 **].

2) Resp - the patient was given atrovent nebulizers for his
COPD, which kept his os sat >93% on 2 LNC during
hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
You received a coronary artery stent for a heart attack.

It is extremely important to take all of you medications, but
especially important to take your plavix and aspirin every
single day.

One of the best things you can do for your health is to quit
smoking. We have provided you with information; if you want more

about what to do after caring for yourself after a heart attack
with catheterization.

No heavy lifting more than 10 pounds for 2 weeks. Walking as
tolerated.

If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, GI
upset, vomiting, or other concerns, please immediately return to
the ED or call your PCP.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **]
in 1 weeks or earlier to puesue smoking cessation.

Please follow up with the Cardiology service at [**Hospital1 **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 56845**] in [**12-7**] weeks. We have given you referral names.

Please arrange for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation through
your cardiologist or from the list given to you at [**Hospital1 18**].
