IMAGING:
FINDINGS: Mild cardiomegaly is again noted. Lung volumes are
low, likely
exaggerating pulmonary vasculature which is mildly prominent. No
focal
consolidation or pneumothorax is detected. There is possibly a
small left
pleural effusion. An esophageal catheter is incompletely
evaluated due to
exposure. Sternal wires are noted.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with cardiomegaly and possible
small left
pleural effusion. Incomplete evaluation of esophageal catheter,
which
possibly terminates in the mid esophagus. Per discussion with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 14740**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7867**] by telephone at 21:02 on
[**2198-11-17**], this tube may possibly be in place intentionally
within the mid esophagus. If gastric placement is desired,
advancing the tube is recommended if not contraindicated for
this patient.
.
EGD ([**2198-11-17**]): Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding localized erosions
were noted in the antrum. Cold forceps biopsies were performed
for histology.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Erosions in the antrum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
EGD ([**2198-11-19**]):
Irregular z line was noted. Biopsies of this area was obtained.
(biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the whole stomach
Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy ([**2198-11-21**]):
Esophagitis
Normal mucosa in the whole stomach
Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum
Normal mucosa in the proximal jejunum
Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum
.
Thumb Xray ([**2198-11-23**]):
FINDINGS:
Three views of the left thumb demonstrate thumb within a splint.
There are
degenerative changes at the first IP joint with osteophytes and
joint space
narrowing. There are also severe osteoarthritic changes at the
first CMC with intra-articular bodies and large osteophytes with
joint space narrowing and cystic change. It is unclear as to
whether there is a superimposed fracture at the base of the
first metacarpal or background degenerative changes. No acute
fracture identified in the distal aspect of the thumb.
