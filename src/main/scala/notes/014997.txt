History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2431**] [**Known lastname **] is a 38yo F ALL s/p double cord blood
SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction attributed to chemotherapy for ALL as well as XRT
for [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] (EF 15-20%), embolic CVA now on coumadin, asthma,
hypertension and chronic kidney disease, well-known to the [**Year (4 digits) 3242**]
service who was just discharged yesterday ([**2174-8-10**]) after a
prolonged hospital course for acute on chronic CHF thought be be
due to cardiac GVHD and acute on chronic renal failure. She was
discharged home with daily infusions of IV torsamide and
methylprednisolone. She came to clinic today fopr follow-up
where she was found to be febrile to 102 and up 0.5lbs from her
discharge weight. CXR was done and cardiac silloette was
increased, concerning for pleural effusion. Blood (PICC and
peripheral) and urine cultures were sent, and she was started on
empiric meropenem.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt has no complaints. She spent an hour
outside yesterday and was otherwise at home resting. She does
nto recal any bug bites. She did not feel subjectively febrile.
She has some cough, but no different or worse than prior to
discharge. She has some pedal [**Last Name (un) **],a put attributes this to
being up and walking around today. No calf pain. Otherwise, ROS
is negative. Per her sister, the pt got her torsemide and
methyprednisolone in clinic today. [**Name6 (MD) **] outpatient NP, pt's
weight was 137# today, up slightly from 136.5# on the day of
discharge.

Past Medical History:
ALL:
- initially presented in [**2172-8-5**] right chest and right upper
extremity pain and paresthesias and visual blurriness. WBC
149,000; received leukapheresis, started on hydroxyurea.
Diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL.
- underwent phase I induction with daunorubicin, vincristine,
dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, MTX; phase II with
cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, MTX
- Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy on [**2172-10-26**] showed no morphologic
evidence of residual leukemia
- underwent allo double cord blood SCT [**2173-1-11**], course
complicated by neutropenic fever and acute skin GVHD
- subsequent course has been complicated by pseudomonas
pneumonia
in [**5-15**], empiric treatment of CMV pericarditis in [**7-15**], chronic
nausea and vomiting which has been treated as GVHD with steroids
though colonoscopies in [**8-14**] and [**11-14**] were negative for GVHD.
.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Embolic stroke in [**3-/2174**] on coumadin
- Asthma
- Hypertension
- Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
- C-section in [**2165**]
- Cardiomyopathy due to early anthracycline-related
cardiotoxicity [**10/2172**]
- Chronic kidney disease stage III/IV, baseline creatinine ~2.0
- Chronic abdominal pain: Her workup so far has included EGD
[**2173-9-5**], [**2173-11-5**] with mild signs of gastritis, no GVHD.
Colonoscopy [**2173-8-5**], unremarkable with biospy negative for
GVHD, CMV.  UGI and SBFT [**4-/2174**] was mostly unremarkable.  She
has had multiple CT scans which have demonstrated moderate
ascites with interval increase, no drainable fluid collection,
diverticulosis, small fat-containing umbilical hernia with mild
fat stranding, no bowel obstruction.  RUQ ultrasound revealed
ascites, gallbladder wall edema presumably from third spacing,
and no biliary duct dilatation.

Social History:
She is single with a daughter and a son. Lives in [**Location 686**].
Previously employed at [**Company 59330**] though has not worked since her
diagnosis. Lifelong nonsmoker, but not currently. Denies
illicits or EtOH.

Family History:
Mother with history of gastric cancer, died at age 40.  Father
with hypertension.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**2174-8-11**]):
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA
and lateral
chest examination of [**2174-8-3**]. The heart size has increased
further in
size. There is no typical configurational abnormality. The
rather general
increase of the heart shadow is suggestive of pericardial
effusion. Previously described right-sided PICC line remains in
unchanged position.
Pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has not changed
significantly; however, the previously described patchy and
partially confluenting parenchymal densities persist and
apparently have progressed further. They are most marked in the
mid lung field on the right side and the lateral upper lobe area
on the left. Lateral pleural sinuses are partially concealed by
the described parenchymal densities. Conclusive evidence of
pleural effusion is not present, and major pleural effusion is
unlikely as it did not exist on the lateral view on the
preceding chest examination.
.
Progression of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in this patient
on stem cell
transplant therapy.
.
Echo ([**2174-8-12**]):  Moderate ?partially loculated pericardial
effusion without definite evidence for tamponade physiology.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-8-4**],
the pericardial effusion is larger. Serial evaluation is
suggested.
.
Echo ([**2174-8-18**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Echo ([**2174-8-23**]):
The left atrium appears extrinsically compressed (mildly)
posteriorly, possibly by a consolidated posterior pericardial
effusion. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. with depressed
free wall contractility. The epicardial surface of the right
ventricle as well as atria appears to be encased in a layer of
echodense material (epicardial fat vs consolidated effusive
material). No evidence of cardiac tamponade seen.
.
RUQ ([**2174-8-23**]):
1. No evidence of acute cholecystitis, as clinically queried.
