Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cor Valve placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo male with hx CAD s/p CABG x1([**2173**]), PCI
([**2185**]), afib, dual chamber PPM, CVA, renal insufficiency s/p rt
renal artery stent, carotid disease, with known aortic stenosis
s/p valvuloplasy ([**8-/2197**]) who presents with symptoms of
shortness
of breath after slowly walking 1 block, inability to climb
stairs
without stopping due to shortness of breath. He denies chest
pain, lightheadedness. Past medical history includes B-cell
lymphoma for which he was treated with chemotherapy, no
radiation, now in remission ([**2192**]). He was seen 4 months prior
for evaluation for aortic treatment options and was found to be
of prohibitively high risk for surgical AVR. He was considered
for [**Year (4 digits) 10723**]/TAVR but did not meet criteria for available high
risk arm of study. He has been stable on medical management,
however, his family notes a decline in function and worsening
fatigue over the last 3 weeks. He admits to frequent naps, and
shortness of breath after walking 20 feet. He was again seen and
evaluated for conventional surgical AVR. He was deemed of
prohibitive surgical risk due to advance age and comorbidities.
After informed consent and extensive discussions with patient
and his son and daughter, he was screened for the [**Name (NI) 10723**]/TAVR
continued access extreme risk arm of the study. He met all
inclusion criteria, and did not meet any of the exclusion
criteria. He was screened and accepted and now returns for
elective [**Name (NI) 10723**]/TAVR.

Imaging:

Chest x-ray pre op
There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, currently
moderate.
Small amount of left pleural effusion is new as well.  Patient
is in mild
interstitial edema.  Heart size and mediastinum are
unremarkable.  Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected
location of right atrium and right ventricle.

TTE [**2199-4-30**]
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
An aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic
valve leak is probably present. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen (with holodiastolic flow reversal
demonstrated in the descending thoracic aorta in suprasternal
notch views). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion

TTE [**2199-5-1**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
An aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. The prosthesis is
well seated with thin/mobile leaflets and normal gradients. An
eccentric anterior perivalvular jet of at least mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-30**],
the severity of aortic regurgitation is now reduced. The other
findings are similar.

TTE [**2199-5-2**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
An aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. A paravalvular aortic
valve leak is present at the aorticopulmonic crux/septum. The
[**Month/Day/Year **] stent may not be fully expanded at the aorticopulmonic
crux/septum. A component of intravalvular regurgitation cannot
be excluded. The aortic regurgitation appears moderate (2+) by
color flow Doppler.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2199-5-1**], the appearance of aortic regurgitation by color
flow Doppler is increased.

TTE [**2199-5-3**]
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). An aortic
[**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-2**], no
change.
