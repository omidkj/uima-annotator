History of Present Illness:
82-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic robot assisted
TAHBSO, LOA for endometrial cancer and reduction of hernia on
[**2172-11-17**].  She was seen by the Acute Care service afterwards
for a small bowel obstruction which resolved with conservative
management.  She has had a RLQ ventral hernia for the past nine
years since her right hip replacement. This was reduced during
her surgery but became reincarcerated post-operatively and was
thought to be the likely source of her obstruction.  She was
ultimately discharged to home on [**2172-11-27**]. She returned to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED after presenting to an OSH with an acute abdomen.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:  asthma, HTN, chronic sinusitis, LE
edema/cellulitis, laparoscopic robot assisted TAHBSO, LOA for
endometrial cancer ([**2172-11-17**])

Past Surgical History:  right hip replacement ([**2163**]), bladder
neck suspension, open appy, ovarian cystectomy,
cytoscele/rectocele repair, thyroid surgery

Social History:
Denies smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse.  She is a 20-pack-year
smoker who quit over 20 years ago.


Family History:
Two sisters had breast cancer. Uterine cancer in her youngest
daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] history of ovarian or colon cancer.


Physical Exam:
In the ED:
98.7  99  122/50  18  97RA
GEN: A&O, NAD, NGT in place
HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist
CV: RRR, No M/G/R
PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R
ABD: large R sided ventral hernia, minimally tender to
palpation,
feels firm and indurated, rest of abdomen is soft, minimally
distended, no rebound or guarding
Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused

Pertinent Results:
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2172-12-5**] :
1. New/increased fluid in the right lower quadrant hernia sac
with ill-defined small bowel loops and mesenteric edema within
the sac, as well as increased intermesenteric fluid in the
peritoneal cavity, raises concern for bowel ischemia.
Extraluminal gas in the hernia sac, while seen previously, it is
now more remote from patient's surgery, and perforation can not
be excluded.
2. Relative caliber change of small bowel at the hernia neck,
but only mildy dilated proximal bowel loops, may be due to
early/partial obstruction.
3. Increased/new pelvic fluid which appears to be organizing and
with peritoneal enhancement; while findings may be reactive with
peritonitis, underlying infection is not excluded.
4. Unchanged postsurgical soft tissue densities between the
urethra and the rectum and between the right ischial tuberosity
and the anus.
5. Small right renal hypodensity, too small to further
characterize on this study, but which could be further evaluated
on non-urgent ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 101374**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room as well as the GYN service given her recent
surgery. She had a WBC of 20K and her CT scan demonstrated an
incarcerated hernia with evidence of ischemia on exam.  She was
admitted to the ICU for vigorous fluid resuscitation and broad
spectrum antibiotics.

On [**2172-12-6**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with repair of a strangulated, perforated
ventral hernia.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the ICU in stable condition. She maintained stable
hemodynamics and her pain was well controlled with IV Dilaudid.
She remained intubated overnight and was successfully weaned and
extubated on post op day #1. Due to her extensive surgery her
nasogastric tube remained in for decompression until her bowel
function returned.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor on [**2172-12-9**] she remained
stable but her nasogastric tube was removed. She was taking only
a small amount of liquids over the next few days and she became
more distended and tympanic on exam.  She stopped passing flatus
and her KUB showed a dilated large bowel.  She was treated with
Methylnaltrexone which was immediately effective.  She was
passing flatus and had a normal bowel movement.  Her narcotics
were discontinued and her pain was effectively managed with
Tylenol.  Her diet was advanced to regular but her appetite was
only fair.  Eventually she improved with Carnation Instant
Breakfast supplements along with the addition of Megace.

The Physical Therapy service evaluated her on numerous occasions
and due to her prolonged hospitalization and decreased mobility
a short term rehab was recommended prior to her return home. She
was dischargaed on [**2172-12-18**].
