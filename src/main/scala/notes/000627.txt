Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hand pain
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis line removal


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 y.o. man with pmh significant for CAD, HTN,
ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, presenting with fevers and
hypotension. The patient reports being in his usual state of
health until yesterday, when he developed acute onset of chills
and rigors. Two hours later he noticed intense pain at his right
thumb cmc joint. This joint became ertythemetous and then pain
and erythema progressed to his right index finger. That evening
his Peritoneal dialysis nurse visited and reported his
peritoneal diasylate appeared normal to her and not infected.
The patient went to bed and then awoke because his pain
continued to worsen. He went to [**Hospital3 635**] hospital where his
temperature was 101.8, SBP was in the 90's, which is his
baseline, HR in 110's. He was given vancomycin and ceftriaxone
for cellutlitis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to be seen by hand
specialists.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.6 P 112 BP 85/47 R21 O2 sat 96%
RA. he was given 500cc of NS when his blood pressure dropped to
57/44 and he became hypoxic to 80% on 2L NC. He was asymptomatic
during this hypotensive episode. He had a Left IJ placed and
started on levophed. His BP increased to 104/67. Hand films were
done and showed degenerative changes of the second and fifth DIP
joints, no fractures, and no bone destruction. Probable soft
tissue swelling around the wrist. Plastics evaluated the patient
and felt he had a hand cellulitis. They recommend splinting and
elevation and antibiotics. They will continue to follow. .
.
Of Note, the patient has been on dialysis for 4 years. he was on
HD for 3months, then switched to peritoneal dialysis for 3
years. He switched back to HD after having a peritoneal
infection. he transitioned back to HD for 1 year and then
switched back to PD 1 week ago. he switched to PD because it is
better for his lifestyle.
.
Review of sytems:
The patient denies dyspnea, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diahrrea.
He reported one episode of emesis prior to coming to the capecod
ED.
he also reports the occurrence of "water blisters" on his lower
legs which began 1 month ago. He became anuric 1 month ago, and
since then has been retaining fluid. he reports these Bullae
have drained only clear fluid and have not appeared infected.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

[**2171-4-20**] 6:18 am BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):

EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. Axis appears
rightward but is difficult to assess. Early precordial QRS
transition. Right precordial lead ST-T wave changes may be
primary. Findings are non-specific. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

  Intervals Axes

.
Three views of the right hand and wrist. No fracture identified.
There are
degenerative changes particularly in the second and fifth DIP
joints with the latter having an apparent flexion deformity. No
bone destruction or
chondrocalcinosis. Probable soft tissue swelling about the
wrist. Assessment
is limited by lack of localizing and limited clinical history.
.
CXR:
SINGLE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF CHEST: A right approach duo-lumen
central
venous catheter has the tips terminating respectively in the
distal SVC and right atrium. An endovascular stent projects over
the mid abdomen.

Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by low lung
volumes. There is relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
of unknown chronicity.
Atherosclerotic calcification is noted in the aortic arch. There
are
retrocardiac opacities which could represent atelectasis
although underlying infec
