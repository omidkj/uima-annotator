CXR [**11-3**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, suspicious for
pneumonia. Interval improvement on the left. Evidence for small
left effusion unchanged

CXR [**11-5**]
REASON FOR EXAM: 80-year-old man with hypoxia and respiratory
distress and
elevated white blood count, please evaluate for pneumonia.
Since [**2171-11-3**], sternotomy wires are still intact. A
tracheostomy is in unchanged position. Right PICC tip is not
seen.

Bibasilar opacity increased could be atelectasis, pneumonia or
aspiration.
Standard PA and lateral views or better inspiration AP could
further
characterize this. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
angle is
unchanged, altough it was partly excluded on this study.
.
CT HEAD [**10-31**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged right frontal lobe
heterogeneous mass with resolution of post-biopsy hemorrhage and
pneumocephalus. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT Torso [**10-31**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study for assessment of pulmonary embolism secondary
to technical factors. No central PE.
2. Enlarged pulmonary artery reflective of pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Moderate cardiomegaly.
4. Peritracheostomy secretions and debris.
5. Cholelithiasis. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
6. Innumerable cysts of the kidneys bilaterally, stable compared
to [**2168**].

Brief Hospital Course:
For details regarding previous prolonged hospital course at
[**Hospital 792**]Hospital and [**Hospital1 18**], please see prior discharge
summary [**2171-10-25**].

MICU Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU for a hypoxic episode
at rehab.  Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on arrival and
showed focal tracheomalacia with airway occlusion. Tracheostomy
tube change performed. He was not hypoxic upon arrival and was
quickly weaned to trach mask which he tolerated for 48 hours
prior to transfer to the floor.  He was treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Vancomycin and
Flagyl for possible HCAP/VAP and C. Diff.  Antibiotics were
weaned quickly as pt was not hypoxic, not febrile, and had a
negative chest x-ray.  The flagyl was stopped after 3 C. Diff
stool studies came back negative.  The patient was briefly on
pressors overnight the night of admission but these were
discontinued in the morning and he remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was kept in the MICU for thick secretions requiring
frequent suctioning but was transferred to the floor as he was
off the vent for over 48 hours and secretions thinning.  For his
brain tumor, Keppra was continued for seizure prophylaxis and
his neuro-oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **].  The family was also
requesting a new rehab placement and this process was started
with case management.

Floor Course
On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Vancomycin was restarted [**11-5**] since pt was having increased
sputum production, sputum cultures grew MRSA, he had an elevated
WBC of 20, and ? bibasilar infiltrates on CXR [**2171-11-5**]. He
should continue for total 10 day course of vancomycin. He was
not continued on Zosyn since MRSA was felt to cause of pneumonia
given sputum culture results. If he develops fever, increase in
WBC, or increased sputum production, would consider broadening
coverage but it was not felt t
