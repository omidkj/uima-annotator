Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left subclavian central line placement.
Left pigtail tube thoracostomy.
Right upper extremity peripherally inserted central catheter
(PICC).
Replacement of gastrostomy tube to a 20F tube.
Intubation [**1-17**]


History of Present Illness:
52 yo female history of Hep C, EtOH abuse complicated with
pancreatitis, and potential cirrhosis who was brought in by
ambulance from a nursing home with fever, tachycardia to 150s.
Pt reports abdominal discomfort.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 101.0 150 110/65 28 100%. She was
given tylenol for fever. She was confused in the ED but her
baseline mental status is alert but confused, she frequently
calls out for family members ([**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 93401**]). She was
given 0.5mg PO ativan at 6am. CXR showed LLL pna and positive
UA. She was given levofloxacin and vancomycin. A subclavian
central line was placed for access, complicated with left PTX.
Thoracics was consulted and placed pigtail catheter in left
chest. Repeat CXR showed resolving PTX. Pt found to have
pancreatitis and BISAP score [**2-8**], although hard to assess mental
status given poor baseline.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt appears confused but knows her name.
She is diapharetic, anxious. She reports abominal pain. Short
shallow breaths.

Imaging:
CXR [**2143-1-11**]:  Patient is rotated which limits interpretation of
this film. Slight increase in opacity in the left lower lung
field is present. Heart size is normal. No pleural effusions are
seen. No pneumothorax
is seen. IMPRESSION: Opacity in the left lower lung field,
atelectasis vs early pneumonia. PA and lateral films may be
helpful for further evaluation.

CT abd/pelvis/chest [**2143-1-11**]:
 IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pneumothorax.
2. Peripancreatic fluid, consistent with pancreatitis, along
with slight
decrease in attenuation of the body of the pancreas. Early
necrosis of the
pancreas cannot be excluded. There is also an early organizing
fluid
collection in between the stomach and pancreas. This could
represent an early pseudocyst. Calcifications at the tail of the
pancreas are consistent with the history of chronic
pancreatitis.
3. Thickened left adrenal, stable.
4. Interdeterminte density lesion within the left kidney which
attenuates
more than would be expected from a simple renal cyst. Renal
ultrasound
recommended if this lesion has not previously been worked up.
5. Dilated common bile duct. Consider an MRCP for further
evaluation if
distal obstruction is of concern.

[**1-14**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Prominent sulci and asymmetric
enlargement of supratentorial ventricular system consistent with
cortical volume loss of uncertain chronicity. Otherwise, no
evidence of acute intracranial process.

[**1-14**] RUQ gallbladder:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, little changed compared
to [**2143-1-11**] and slightly increased compared to [**2-1**], [**2142**]. No stones are identified in the imaged portion of the
common bile duct, although the most distal duct is not fully
visualized. MRCP could obtain further information if clinically
indicated.
2. Peripancreatic and perihepatic free fluid, consistent with
the given
history of pancreatitis.
3. Left pleural effusion.
4. Gallbladder sludge without evidence of gallstones.

[**1-17**] CT abd:
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of bilateral pleural
effusions left
larger than right. Left subclavian line with its tip in the
BC-SVC and needs to be repositioned. Interval decrease in
peripancreatic fluid collections. Persistent fluid collection in
the lesser sac. Prominent peripancreatic lymph nodes which are
stable since previous study, likely reactive.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pancreatitis: Patient with a known history of pancreatitis and
pancreatic pseudocysts presented with a pancreatitis with a
BISAP score [**2-8**], lipase in the 200s with a CT showing evidence
of acute pancreatitis.  Patient was given IVF, pain medications,
and was made NPO.  She was intially admitted to the MICU,
briefly requiring vasopressors, but then was called out to the
floor in a day.  On the floor she continued to do well with
improving hemodynamics and decreased epigastric tenderness.  She
had a RUQ ultrasound with sludge without stones and CBD
dilitation.  However given the lack of clear obstructive
symptoms, we were also considering medication-induced
pancreatitis, particularly the divalproex.
.
# Sepsis w/ SIRS: On [**2143-1-17**] the patient was transfered back to
the MICU due to abdominal pain, tachycardia, and respiratory
distress with hypotension. She was subsequently intubated.
Although no evidence of interval change was visible on her CT,
blood cultures subsequently grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas, for
which she received cefepime. She was given aggressive fluid
rehydration and pressor support with norepinephrine.  Her
pressures improved over the course of several days, with gradual
weaning of norepinephrine and less aggressive fluid support, and
she had brisk auto-diuresis as her pressures improved. She was
extubated witho
