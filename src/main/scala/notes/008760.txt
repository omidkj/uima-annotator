cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a poor historian.  81 yo F with hx of CAD, CHF, CVA,
dementia, breast CA reports that she awoke 2 nights ago feeling
short of breath and overall feeling unwell and wanting to stay
in bed all day.  She saw her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] found an O2 sat of 89-92%,
no edema, gave Lasix 40 mg PO.  The patient continued to feel
short of breath this morning, and presented again to her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] EKG was donem which  reportedly showed ST depressions; her O2
sat was 90%.  SHe was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
ED: Pt was found to have frequent APC's, ST elevations in V2V3
with reciprocal depressions in V3-V5. Received [**Hospital1 **], lopressor,
heparin.
.
Cath lab: LAD 30% proximal stenosis with diffuse severe disease,
large DI with 70% occlusion. RCA 70% mid occlusion.  Occlusions
were not amenable to intervention.   By report had wedge of 30,
anterolateral hypokinesis and LVEDP of 40%.
.
Pt transferred to floor: Given Lasix 40 mg IV, started on nitro
gtt, given morphine 4 mg IV; continued to be short of breath ->
transferred to CCU.
.
ROS: +SOB, +DOE, +Nausea, Denies F/C/cough. Denies vomiting,
constipation, dysuria.  Per PCP patient has [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recent drop in Hct
from 36->30 over 1 month.


Past Medical History:
CAD- LAD 30% proximal stenosis with diffuse severe disease,
large DI with 70% occlusion. RCA 70% mid occlusion.
CHF- dx 3 yrs ago, but now refuses to see cardiologist
CVA- age 30's, ?sensory loss in 1 hand
dementia- progressing in past 3 years per daughter
breast CA
?History of afib- Previously on coumadin for many years,
recently self d/c'd.

Social History:
Nonsmoker.  Occasional EtOH (2x/month).  Lives in [**Hospital 4382**], recently moved to area. Widow x 1 year. Daughter lives
nearby.


Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
GEN: Cachectic woman in mild respiratory distress.
HEENT: PEERL. EOMI. MMM.
Neck: Supple, no nodes. JVD=18
CV: [**4-13**] HSM over mitral area-> axilla. Irregular. Nl S1S2.
Pulm: Coarse breath sounds thoughout.  Decreased BS B/L bases.
ABD: +BS, softly distended, Nontender.
Ext: No edema.  Warm/well perfused.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2161-10-8**]: The heart is enlarged.  Pulmonary vascularity is
slightly engorged and indistinct, and there is subtle bilateral
interstitial opacity, likely reflecting interstitial pulmonary
edema.  There is also more confluent opacity in left
retrocardiac region adjacent to a small left pleural effusion.
Ring like area of calcification in the retrocardiac area
probably reflects mitral
annular calcification, but is difficult to fully assess on this
single portable view.  IMPRESSION:  Congestive heart failure
with interstitial edema and small left pleural effusion.
Adjacent left retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or
infectious pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P) 81 yo F with likely CHF with enzyme leak admitted to CCU
with SOB s/p cath, found to have 2 vessel disease and elevated
EDP = 30.
.
# CV:
a) Ischemia: unlikely STEMI given no CK elevation and STE only
in 1 lead. Likely troponin leak [**3-12**] CHF exacerbation. Now s/p
cath, 2 vessel disease not amenable to intervention.  Medical
management: Aspirin, BBlocker, ACE-I, statin.  Ms [**Known lastname 43569**] was
initially was given plavix before cath, however it was d/c'd
given no documented symptomatic CAD (and with low Hct with Fe
def anemia).  Continue home dose of Lisinopril 5mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
Toprol XL 50 qd. Lipids: LDL 161, therefore increased statin
dose. Will have to follow LFTs as outpatient.
.
b) Pump: Admitted with CHF exacerbation. Pt reported to have
diastolic failure with evidence of volume overload on CXR. Echo
with EF 70%, mod AS, AR, mild MR, mod diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix.  Her Lasix was increased
to 40mg PO BID (from 40 [**First Name3 (LF) 24018**]).
.
c) Rhythm: Pt currently in NSR with frequent PAC's.  Patient was
previously on coumadin for unclear reasons, ?history of Afib.
Contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]/old cardiologist office.  Will send
records.  No anticoagulation for now given unclear indication;
patient will follow up with PCP regarding need for
anticoagulation.
Risk factors: Age. PMH unclear.
.
d) Valves: See ECHO report as above.
-ACEI for afterload reduction.
.
# SOB: Likely due to CHF exacerbation as above, resolved quickly
with diuresis.  WBC high initially with bandemia, however,
patient remains asymptomatic and afebrile, without cough.  Blood
and uring cultures were negative at discharge. WBC trended down,
no antibiotics were given.  Pt admitted on 5L shovel mask
satting 100%, by discharge was satting well on room air.  Will
continue Lasix 40mg PO BID at discharge.
.
# Anemia: Per PCP patient has recent drop in Hct from 36->30 in
1 month, down to 27.5 on admission.  Pt has previously refused
outpatient colonoscopy.  Stool was guiac negative per PCP 1 day
PTA, and was again guaic negative in ED. Given 1 unit PRBCs,
increased appropriately, then remained stable. No signs of
bleeding.  Anemia labs revealed iron deficiency and B12
deficiency; she was started on supplementation.  The need for
colonoscopy was discussed with patient; she has again refused.
Will urge PCP to discuss scope with patient/family.
.
# Dementia: No active issues.
.
# H/O Breast CA: no active issues.
