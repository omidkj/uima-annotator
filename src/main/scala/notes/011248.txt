Admission Date:  [**2198-12-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-12-31**]


Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old female
with a history of rheumatic heart disease with known mitral
regurgitation, mitral stenosis and aortic insufficiency.  The
patient has a three year history of frequent congestive heart
failure exacerbations requiring intubation.  The patient was
admitted three days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 346**] to [**Hospital6 33**] with
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The patient had known
mitral regurgitation and coronary artery disease.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery
bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
2.  History of multiple gastrointestinal bleeds secondary to
arteriovenous malformation.
3.  Questionable history of transient ischemic attacks.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Pulmonary hypertension.
6.  Coronary artery disease.
7.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty in [**2195**].
8.  Gout.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.  Questionable allergy to Vancomycin
thought to be due to redman syndrome.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Allopurinol.
3.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Carafate.
5.  Iron.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 6.0,
hematocrit 27.5, platelet count 262,000.  Sodium 143,
potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 33, blood urea
nitrogen 37, creatinine 0.9, glucose 112.  Digoxin level was
0.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was taken to the operating
room on [**2198-12-13**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for mitral valve replacement
with a #25 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve and coronary artery
bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft to OM.
Please see operative note for further details.  In the
operating room by Transesophageal Echocardiogram, the
patient's ejection fraction was found to be greater than 55%
with mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild aortic
insufficiency.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit on Dobutamine infusion and Neo-Synephrine infusion.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was continued on the
Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine.  Cardiac output was monitored
by thick equation due to the patient's history of tricuspid
regurgitation.  On postoperative day number one, the patient
was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation.  The
patient had developed oliguria with rising blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine, treated with Bumex, Diuril and
Lasix.  The patient was placed on a Dopamine infusion with
subsequent increase in urine output.

On [**2198-12-16**], postoperative day number three, the patient
required reintubation due to elevated carbon dioxide and
respiratory acidosis.  The patient had been attempted on
BiPAP ventilation which subsequently failed and required
intubation.  After intubation, the patient was noted to have
a moderate amount of secretions.  Sputum culture was sent
which subsequently was positive for Hemophilus influenzae.
The patient's course was changed over a wire to a triple
lumen catheter.  Dobutamine was weaned to off with an
adequate cardiac index.

On [**2198-12-16**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed
thick copious secretions.  The patient underwent
bronchoscopies on consecutive days, [**2198-12-17**], [**2198-12-18**], which
gradually showed improving amounts of secretions and after
antibiotics were then started.

On [**2198-12-17**], the patient was started on enteral feeds.  The
patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine peaked at 76 and
1.5.  The patient had required multiple red blood cell
transfusions for decreasing hematocrit with no obvious source
of bleeding.  The patient continued on Dopamine infusion for
oliguria and the patient's mechanical ventilation was weaned
to CPAP.

On [**2198-12-18**], the patient was transferred from the CSRU to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit service.  The patient had been
started on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation which
subsequently resulted in bradycardia.  On [**2198-12-21**], the
patient was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions for
which bilateral chest tubes were placed with resolution of
effusions.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation after the patient required aggressive
pulmonary toilet requiring multiple respiratory treatments
with Albuterol.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2198-12-23**].  Later
that evening, the patient was emergently intubated for
hypoxia and increased work of breathing.  The patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The
patient required restarting of Dopamine infusion due to
bradycardia.  Sputum culture from [**2198-12-23**], and [**2198-12-24**],
showed gram positive cocci which subsequently grew in culture
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin.  Infectious disease consultation was
obtained.

Chest tubes were removed on [**2198-12-25**].  Dopamine infusion was
discontinued on [**2198-12-25**], and needed to be restarted due to
bradycardia.  Electrophysiology consultation was obtained and
it was decided to discontinue the Amiodarone with thought
that perhaps the patient's atrial fibrillation with decreased
ventricular response was due to Amiodarone and perhaps the
patient would need a permanent pacemaker placed.

On [**2198-12-27**], the patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy
placement and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a #8 tracheostomy tube.  Bronchoscopy at
that time showed minimal secretions.  On [**2198-12-28**], a PICC
line was attempted for intravenous antibiotics.  Chest x-ray
showed that the tip of the catheter is in the midsubclavian
vein.   It seemed that this intravenous was adequate for
intravenous antibiotics but inadequate for anything requiring
central infusion such as TPN.

The patient over the next several days underwent slow
ventilatory wean awaiting placement in rehabilitation
facility.  On [**2198-12-30**], the patient developed an episode of
faster heart rates than previously, heart rates in the 70s to
one hundred teens.  CKs were sent to rule out myocardial
infarction.  The first CK was 8 and the second CK was 10.

On [**2198-12-31**], electrophysiology was again consulted regarding
the potential need for permanent pacemaker.  It was decided
that the patient should complete a full two week course of
Vancomycin for her Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia and the patient should be discharged to
rehabilitation and follow-up with electrophysiology clinic
regarding the need for permanent pacemaker.
Electrophysiology also requested echocardiogram to rule out
endocarditis as a result of bradycardia.  It is scheduled the
afternoon of [**2198-12-31**].  After that, the patient will be
cleared for discharge to rehabilitation facility.
