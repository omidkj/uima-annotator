CT Head:
1.  Increase in size of now 2.8 cm left inferior frontotemporal
hemorrhagic contusion with surrounding edema, with resultant
mass effect leading to partial effacement of the suprasellar
cistern and concern for developing downward transtentorial
herniation.
2.  Unchanged to minimally increased left greater than right
multifocal
subarachnoid hemorrhage with extension in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right
lateral ventricle without evidence of hydrocephalus or shift of
midline
structures.
3.  Left occipital subgaleal hematoma.

CTA Neck:
1.  Acute fracture of the left transverse foramen of C4 without
evidence of vascular injury.
2.  Right first rib fracture.
3.  Probable Paget's disease of the bone involving the left
humerus,
incompletely imaged.

CTA Head:
1.  Enlarging subarachnoid hemorrhage centered at the left
operculum, with minimal mass effect, and new extension into the
intraventricular space.
2.  No evidence of vascular malformation, aneurysm, or mass.
3.  Paranasal sinus disease featuring mucosal thickening and
air-fluid levels.

MRI Cervical and Thoracic Spine:
1.  The cervical spine demonstrates irregularity and abnormal
signal of C4, C5, and C6 vertebral bodies which may be
degenerative in nature.  The fracture described at the left
transverse foramen of C4 cannot be appreciated in this MRI.
There is a fluid collection in the prevertebral soft tissues
measuring 2.4 x 0.25 cm anterior to C3 and C4.  This may
represent edema or fluid collection related to the recent
history of trauma.  The cerebellar tonsils are displaced 1 cm
inferiorly through the foramen magnum which may be due to Chiari
1 malformation or due to increased intracranial pressure related
to the intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  The thoracic spine demonstrates a compression fracture of
T11 vertebral body with 7.5-mm retropulsion, causing deformity
of the anterior aspect of the spinal cord and mild abnormal
signal in the spinal cord.  Additionally, there are nondisplaced
fractures of T4 and T5 vertebral bodies.  There is no evidence
of epidural hematoma.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis.

[**2194-4-2**]: CT head:
Overall, the parenchymal and subarachnoid blood is unchanged
compared to the most recent examination, with minimal
intraventricular blood, also unchanged, and no evidence of
hydrocephalus or central herniation.

[**2194-4-3**]: EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of severe diffuse encephalopathy manifest by reversal of the
anterior-
posterior gradient and the presence of diffuse slowing with a
frontal
central predominance. There are also features suggesting
slightly
greater left hemisphere pathology. While there are numerous
potential
epileptic discharges in the form of sharp slow waves, no clear
spike and
wave discharges were seen and no seizures were identified.

[**2194-4-10**]: Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive studies:
Grayscale, color Doppler images were obtained of bilateral
common femoral, femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.  Normal
flow, compression and augmentation is seen in all of the
vessels.

[**2194-4-13**]: CT head:
1.  No acute hemorrhage. Resolving left frontal intraparenchymal
and left
frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2.  New non-hemorrhagic fluid in the left maxillary sinus,
ethmoidal sinus, sphenoidal sinus and both mastoid air cells.
3. Low lying cerebellar tonsils- ? Chiari 1 malformation

[**2194-4-18**]: Right wrist/forearm:
Severe chronic-appearing degenerative changes superimposed on a
prior inflammatory process involving the wrist, but with no
definite
superimposed injury.  Bony demineralization

[**2194-4-18**]: Portable chest:
Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out
of view,
below the diaphragm.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is
no
pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.
Mild
cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lower lobe opacities have
increased, worrisome for aspiration.  There is mild vascular
congestion.  Spinal hardware is again noted.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the trauma ICU on [**2194-3-31**] with the
following injuries:
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage
R. posterior 1st rib fx
C4 transverse process fx
T11 burst fx
T10 end-plate fx

Her course is described below by system:

Neuro: Patient was followed by neurosurgery through out her
stay. Due to the extent of hemorrhage, a CTA was obtained to
determine if an aneurysm was present, but none were visualized.
Her neurologic status gradually improved and she w
