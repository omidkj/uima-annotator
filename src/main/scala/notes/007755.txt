Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for tenuous respiratory
status.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
73 yo male with PMH sig for HTN, prostate cancer s/p
prostactectomy in [**2101**], and recently diagnosed lung
adenocarcinoma metastatic the brain, s/p L frontal craniotomy
with metastatectomy [**6-21**], who presented to the ED today c/o
increased cough over the last couple of days, with associated
bilateral back/side pain.
.
He had originally presented in [**2107-6-17**] after an MVA secondary
to LOC, followed by R arm weakness and L frontal HA, which led
to the diagnosis of a left occipital heterogenous enhancement
and right cerebellar lesion by MRI. CXR showed a mass in the
RML. The brain mass was thought to be metastatic. He was given a
Decadron 10mg IV load dose and started on Keppra
prophylactically to a goal dose of 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was brought to
the OR on [**6-26**] and underwent a left sided frontal craniotomy for
tumor removal. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma, and
immunophenotyping was most consistent with a lung primary. He
had post-operative MRI which showed no complications.
Clinically, he was ataxic and had a partial right sided neglect.
His steroids were weaned over the next few weeks and stopped
[**2107-8-7**]. He is s/p whole brain cranial irradiation (3 weeks of
whole brain radiation post-operatively).
.
On the day of admission he presented with minimally productive
cough and back pain, going on for a few wks, however acutely
worsening on the day of admission.  He denies shortness of
breath.  Denies CP/ N/V/dizziness. He did have a low grade temp
x 2 days. Denies night sweats.
.
In the ED, CTA chest showed saddle PE with bilateral peripheral
PEs, bilateral lower lobe aspiration or pneumonia, and interval
enlargement of lung masses.
.
His vitals in the ED were 99.4, 107, 139/94, RR 18, 82% on RA.
He was placed on NRB and sat increased to 96%.  He received
Alb/Atrovent nebs, prednisone, ceftriaxone/Zithromax.  He was
started on IV heparin.
.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
H/o prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy in [**2101**]
Lung Ca metastatic to the brain, as above.  Initially presented
with R arm weakness and L headache.  CT [**2107-6-23**] with 1. Left
parietal mass with extensive edema also involving left posterior
frontal and occipital lobes, and moderate-to-severe midline
shift. This most likely represents a metastasis.  2. Thickening
of the cortex overlying the edematous regions, which may be seen
in post-ictal state.


Social History:
-lives with son and wife
-originally from [**Country 3587**]
[**Location 17509**] 20 pack-year smoking history but quit.
-denies any recent alcohol use

Family History:
-denies any family history of seizures or strokes


Physical Exam:
Vitals: 97.4, 112/74, 108, 26, 100% on NRB
General: [**Location 7979**] speaking male appearing comfortable, with
mild accessory muscle use.
Lungs: Rhonchi at bases b/l, with bronchial breath sounds at L
base.
CV: tachy, no MRG
Abdomen: non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Extr: No c/c/e.  DP palpable b/l.

[**8-12**] CTA chest
1.Saddle pulmonary embolus with numerous segmental and
subsegmental emboli
throughout both lungs.
2.  Interval enlargement of the right middle lobe lung mass and
of the left lower lobe nodular opacity.
3.  Interval enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes.
4.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities suggestive of aspiration
.
[**8-12**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**8-13**] CXR: 1. Consolidation at the bases bilaterally, right
greater than left. The wedge-shaped consolidation at the right
base suggests evolution of a pulmonary infarction. The opacity
at the left base may be secondary to pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. There is a catheter in the left hemithorax which presumably
is a left IJ catheter, its tip is in the region of the left
brachiocephalic vein.

.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**8-15**]: 1. New 7-mm focus of FLAIR signal abnormality in
the right posterior frontal lobe with possible corresponding
faint enhancement, suspicious for new metastatic focus.
2. Marked decrease in vasogenic edema within the left
frontoparietal lobe, and improvement to post-surgical change at
the resection site in the left parietooccipital region.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo male with adenocarcinoma of the lung metastatic the brain,
s/p metastatectomy [**6-21**], p/w PE.
.
1) Pulmonary embolism:  Likely related to hypercoagulability of
cancer.  Patient continues to be hemodynamically stable.  No
signs of RV strain on EKG or echocardiogram.  Respiratory status
was intially tenuous, however, for > 72 hours prior to discharge
he was comfortable satting about 93-94% on 5 L NC. He was seen
by neuro oncology during this admission and it was thought to be
safe to start him on heparin drip with a goal PTT of 60-90.  He
was not started on coumadin as his study chemotherapy regimen
precludes using coumadin. He was transitioned to lovenox 1 day
prior to discharge and remained stable. His respiratory status
was stable at discharge on 5 L NC and he will go home with
oxygen and VNA to help with lovenox.
.
2) NSCLC with brain mets: Neurologic exam remained stable
throughout admission with no focal deficits. Repeat MRI revealed
new metastatic focus but neuro oncology felt that no action
should be taken at the present time considering his PE and
anticoagulation. Will continue Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Once stable from the standpoint of PE will restart chemotherapy.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
3) H/o seizures: Unclear history.  Patient did not have any
seizures during this admission. Continue Keppra for prophylaxis.
