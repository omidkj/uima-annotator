Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with h/o HTN, HLD, DM, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with worsening shortness of breath. History was mainly obtained
from daughter. [**Name (NI) **] was in usual state of health until [**12-24**]
days ago when daughter noticed that patient began coughing
(non-productive) and appeared more tired. She stated that she
noticed he was wheezing but denied any fevers/chills, sick
contacts, or recent travel history. This evening, the daughter
noticed that the patient had increased respiratory noices after
the patient went to sleep. The daughter was concerned and called
911.
.
When EMS arrived, the patient was noted to have an O2sat of 74%.
With supplemental oxygen, O2sat's normalized. Patient was then
taken to the ED. In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.5 BP 127/68 HR
64 RR 10 SpO2 95% NRB. Patient was given nebulizer treatments.
Laryngoscopy was completed for inspiratory wheezing and
visualized normal vocal cords. CXR was concerning for pulmonary
edema v. consolidation and the patient was started given
ceftriaxone and levaquin for CAP coverage.
.
Of note, CBC in ED indicated Hct of 25 (down from baseline in
mid 30s). Stools were maroon appearing and were Guaiac positive.
Patient was started a protonix gtt and was crossed for 2 units
of blood prior to transferring to the ICU. Additionally, lactate
on admission was 4.0.
.
On encounter, the patient was feeling better. He endorsed some
SOB and nausea but denied any CP, dizziness, LH, vomiting, or
diarrhea. Patient was immediately given 20mg IV lasix and was
started on the pRBC infusion.

[**2105-9-7**] echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

[**2105-9-11**] Chest xray:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The patient was
extubated. There
is significant interval improvement in widespread parenchymal
opacities
consistent with interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Still
significant
abnormalities within the parenchyma are seen, widespread. The
right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17437**] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o M with prostate CA, borderline DM, CKD,
who presented with dyspnea likely [**12-23**] pulmonary edema v. PNA,
also found to be anemic likely [**12-23**] GI bleed.

#) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially admitted with
shortness of breath. He was intubated on hospital day 2 for
increased work of breathing. Pt improved with diuresis on Lasix
gtt. He was also treated for possible PNA with
Levquin/Ceftriaxone. Pt likely had cardiac event at home prior
to admission, resulting in worsening diastolic dysfunction and
mitral regurgitation, leading to pulmonary edema. Pt was
extubated on [**2105-9-10**] without complication and was satting well
on NC at the time of transfer out of the MICU. LOS negative 5L
at the time of transfer on [**9-11**].
On the floor pt continued to be clinically euvolemic though
required 2.5L NC. Home dose of metoprolol was restarted. In
anticipation for discharge pt attempted ambulation trial on
[**9-14**] though had desaturation down to 83% with recovery to mid
90's at rest (off of oxygen). Pt continued to have mild
leukocytosis and a CXR on [**9-15**] showed residual pulmonary edema
though improved as well as some concern of bony lesions possibly
related to his rostate CA.
On [**9-16**] pt continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.
Pt was discharged with services (PT and VNA), on home oxygen.
