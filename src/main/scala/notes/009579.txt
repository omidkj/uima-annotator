Good LV systolic fxn. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The [**Month/Day (1) 8813**] valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There

decreased
since earlier in the day. Pneumomediastinum is now evident but
not clinically
significant. Tip of the ET tube above the upper margin of the
clavicles, 6 cm
above the carina and 2 cm above optimal placement. Tip of the
Swan-Ganz
catheter projects over the region of the pulmonic valve.
Nasogastric tube
passes into the stomach and out of view. Midline drains still in

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-25**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred
to the CVICu in stable condition on amiodarone, insulin and
propofol drips. Extubated on POD #1. [**Last Name (un) **] consult done due to
protamine reaction. Recommended lantus and humalog SS. Renal
also consulted due to CKD and rising creatinine.Chest tubes
removed on POD #2. Renal diet also started. Amiodarone restarted
for AFib, and converted to SR. Low dose beta blcoakde titrated.
Transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin increasing his
activity level. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially unremarkable.His kidney function improved with good
diuresis and creatnine back to baseline. Glucose levels well
controlled on the new Lantus and Humalog regiment. On POD#8
Mr.[**Known lastname 11679**] was discharged to home with VNA follow up. He was
instructed on all neccessary follow up visits.
