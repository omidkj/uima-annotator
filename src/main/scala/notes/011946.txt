History of Present Illness:
Briefly, pt is a 68 yo M with ESRD [**1-22**] IgA nephropathy on HD,
HTN, COPD, EtOH cirrhosis initially p/w abdominal pain for
several days. On [**2-19**] pt came to ED c/o abd pain. Pt had
paracentesis with drainage of 2.5 L, but no SBP on diagnostics.

polys. Pt admitted for tx of SBP. Also found to have C diff on
stool studies. Initial tx ctx/vanc/flagyl. On [**2-23**] at HD, pt's
sbp dropped to 70s and HD stopped after 2 hours. Pt with
continued low BPs on floor post-HD. Also had episode of approx
30 cc bloody hematemesis shortly after return from HD AM of [**2-23**].
Pt taken to GI suite for EGD. Around that time pt tapped again

to 39 on [**2-23**] from 14 on admission. [**2-23**] EGD showed grade III
esophageal varices, old blood but no active bleed, 4 bands
placed. Pt transferred to MICU for further management of UGIB
post banding.

KUB ([**2-19**]):

liver is not well evaluated for focal lesions.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# UGIB: Pt underwent EGD and variceal banding on [**2117-2-23**].  He was
maintained on Protonix and octreotide drips.  He was also
started on sucralfate.  He received 2U FFP to reverse his INR in
the setting of bleeding.  His hematocrit was subsequently
stable.
.
# C. difficile colitis:  He had a rising white blood cell count
on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Stool sample from [**2-21**] was
positive for C. diff toxin.  CT abdomen on [**2-24**] showed pancolitis
but did not show megacolon or abscess.  He was maintained on IV
Flagyl.  An NG tube was not placed given the recent banding, so
he could not be given oral antibiotics.  Due to his continually
rising WBC count, he was started on vancomycin PR.  Surgery was
consulted for fulminant C. diff.  They felt he would likely need
total colectomy, but that his morbidity and mortality would be
extremely high.
.
# Bacterial peritonitis:  Spontaneous vs. secondary to
translocation or microperforation from C. difficile colitis.  He
was maintained on vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl.
.
# Altered mental status:  He became increasingly somnolent in
the MICU.  His altered mental status was felt to be
multifactorial, secondary to benzodiazepine effect, hepatic
encephalopathy, uremia, and ICU psychosis.  He was given
flumazenil with some clearing.
.
# Hypotension:  He developed hypotension in the MICU and
required pressors.  His hypotension was felt most likely
secondary to sepsis given his fulminant C. diff and his
bacterial peritonitis.
.
# ESRD on HD: On HD as outpatient.  Followed by the Renal team.
With dropping BP, was being evaluated for CVVHD.
.
# ETOH: He had some signs and symptoms suggestive of withdrawal.
 He was placed on a CIWA scale, folate, thiamine, mvi.  He
received benzodiazepines initially, but was subsequently given
flumazenil for concern for altered mental status.
.
## In the MICU, he continued to decompensate with worsening C.
diff, worsening encephalopathy, and development of hypotension.
Several family meetings were held with the patient's wife,
daughters, and son.  On the night of [**2-24**], the team and the
family decided to pursue comfort measures only for the patient.
He was started on a morphine drip.  He expired at 7:35am on [**2-25**].
