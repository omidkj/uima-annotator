Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and tachycardia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73-year-old man with a history of glioblastoma
multiforme, prostate cancer, who was recently hospitalized for
right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and started on
Lovenox 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] per discharge summary.  He was seen in the
radiation oncology facility at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital3 **] on the day prior to admission and found to have altered
mental status, tachycardia and hypoxia.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for evaluation.  There he had a head CT non-contrast
without evidence of acute ischemia or bleed and transferred
here.  Given his recent history of deep vein thrombosis, a chest
CT was considered, but was not pursued there given elevated
creatinine.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his creatinine was noted to
be normal and a chest CT revealed a filling defect in the right
lower lobe that could be artifact versus thrombus.  Of note, he
had no chest CT on his previous admission.

He was also noted to have a right lower lobe pneumonia and
received a dose of levofloxacin 750 mg daily.  Of note, he was
also diagnosed with C. difficile at the nursing home and started
on Flagyl.

He was admitted to the OMED service however needed to be
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after he was noted to be hypotensive to
the 70's and hypoxic to 85% on 2L.  He was briefly places on a
non-rebreather but was able to weaned down to 3L.  In the ICU he
was noted to have a drop in his Hct from 30 to 22.  He underwent
a CT abdomen and pelvis which showed small clustered pockets of
free air in the right mesenteric region concerning for
microperforation.  Given his poor prognosis and response to
therapy for glioblastoma and new bowel perforation a family
meeting was held.  Patient and his family decided transition to
comfort measures only. He was transferred back to the OMED
regular floor for this goal and transition to hospice/palliative
care.

Past Medical History:
1. Right frontal glioblastoma multiforme involving the genu of
the corpus calosum. He had:
(1) stereotaxic brain biopsy by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., Ph.D. on
[**2175-3-17**] with the pathology showing glioblastoma multiforme,
(2) started temozolomide chemo-irradiation on [**2175-4-6**] at
[**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital6 **], and
(3) started bevacizumab on [**2175-4-27**]. He is currently on day #17
of his radiation therapy ([**Date range (1) 86584**]), which he receives daily.
He is also on Decadron and temolzolomide for treatment.  His
neuro-oncologist is Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**].

2. History of prostate cancer s/p prostate biopsy in [**2173-8-6**]

and [**2175-2-6**] that showed [**Doctor Last Name **] 10 pathology at the
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  He has not received any treatment because
this cancer was diagnosed "back to back" and family is focusing
on the glioblastoma.

3. Coronary artery disease:  No MI, has complained of angina
before and is seeing a cardiologist (name unknown).
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. Benign protatic hypertrophy

Past Surgical History:
History of cataract surgery done in [**2155**] (in [**Country 532**]) and in [**2168**]

(in the United States).

Social History:
He is retired and used to live with his wife before he was
discharged to rehabilitation after his recent hospitalizations.
He never smoked cigarettes, he drinks < 2 glasses of wine a
month, and does not use illicit drugs.  His daughter [**Name (NI) 6870**] lives
nearby in [**Location (un) 1110**], MA.

Family History:
His mother is alive at age [**Age over 90 **]; she has colon cancer and
dementia.  Mother diagnosed with colon cancer at age of 90.
Brother with leukemia diagnosed at age 54. His father died in
World War II.  He is the only child.  He has 2 daughters; the
younger one has breast cancer (diagnosed at 39) while the older
one has pre-cancerous lesion in a breast.

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.1 F, pulse 82, respiration 12,
blood pressure 114/72, and oxygen saturation 99% with 2 liters.
GENERAL:  He is lying in bed, with no respiratory distress
HEENT:  EOMI, throat is clear, no exudate
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythms,
no murmur, click, or gallop appreciated
LUNGS:  Rhonchi heard at right base
ABDOMEN:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, and decreased bowel
sounds
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
50.  He is awake, alert, and able to follow some commands.  He
does not say much (there is no interpreter).  Cranial Nerve
Examination:  His pupils are equal and reactive to light, 4 mm
to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are full; there is
mild
saccadic intrusions.  Visual fields are full to threat.  His
face is symmetric.  Facial sensation is intact bilaterally.  His
hearing is intact bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate
goes up in the midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper
trapezius are strong.  Motor Examination:  He does not have a
drift.  His
muscle strengths are [**5-10**] at handgrips and tibialis anterior and
[**Last Name (un) 938**] bilaterally.  But his deltoids, triceps, and ileopsoas have
4-/5 strength.  His muscle tone is normal.  His reflexes are 0
throughout bilaterally.  He has sustained clonus (5+) in the
right ankle while having transient clonus (4+) in the left
ankle. His left toe is up while the right is equivocal.  Sensory
examination is intact to pinch.  Coordination examination does
not reveal gross appendicular dysmetria.  He cannot walk.

Pertinent Results:
CBC: 5.4 > 10.5/30.5 < 237
Chem: 141 | 104 | 34 < 117
      3.8 | 24 | 1.1

EKG: sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, LAD, RBBB, LAFB, no significant
change from prior EGD on [**2175-5-12**]

Head CT: Abnormal R frontal lobe, wiht likely combination of
underlying neoplasm and edema.  Eval for ischemia in this
setting is limited and MRI would be better to evaluate.  No
hemorrhage

Chest CT:
1. Right middle and lower lobe patchy opacities, likely
pneumonia; however,
document resolution on followup.
2. Apparent filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental
vessel could
represent old/adherent mural thrombus, with majority of the
vessel being
patent.
3. 3 mm LLL nodule. Given history of malignancy continued
follow-up is
recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 86581**] is a 73-year-old [**Known lastname 595**] speaking male with a
history of glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, recent
diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis admitted with altered mental
status, hypoxia and tachycardia during radiation.
who presented with dyspnea likely due to a small pulmonary
emboli from known DVT - also found to have microperforation of
the bowel and is being transitioned to hospice/palliative care.

(1) Comfort Measures only:  Patient was transitioned to comfort
measures only after discussion between [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and patient and
his family.  Discussed with the family multiple times regardings
goals of care would be on improving the quality of life as
opposed to extending life.  They were concerned about him being
uncomfortable with coughing and did not want him to suffer from
a pneumonia.  It was discussed with them in depth that his bowel
perforation would be the likely cause of his passing away. Given
repeat reiterations from the family that they understood this
but still wished his pneumonia symptoms to be managed, patient
was given a three day course of Levofloxacin.  There was no
imaging, procedures, laboratory, or vital signs were done.
Patient was kept comfortable and took in reasonable PO.
