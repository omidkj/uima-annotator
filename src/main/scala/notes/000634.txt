Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADDENDUM:  On [**2191-11-25**] the patient had no additional
complaints and was anxious to leave but continued to have
some serosanguinous drainage from his sternal incision.  His
heart was regular rate and rhythm.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally.  The drainage did not seem to have any evidence
of infection.  His leg incision was clean, dry and intact.
Discharge was postponed because the volume of drainage from
his sternum was still concerning and he continued on his
Keflex antibiotics.  Case management was notified and was
involved in the delay of the patient's discharge.

On [**11-26**], which was postoperative day 15, again the
patient had no complaints but continued to have some
drainage.  He was in sinus rhythm with a T maximum of 98.1, a
blood pressure of 108/62, saturating well on two liters.  His
incision was unchanged.  His lungs continued to be clear.  He
continued on his antibiotics.  That afternoon he had a CT of
the chest to continue to monitor his sternal wound.  The CT
report showed a small amount of fluid associated with the
sternotomy that might represent a postoperative lymphocele or
seroma.  Please refer to the CT report from [**2191-11-26**].

On [**2191-11-27**] the patient was discharged.  The discharge
medications were previously dictated.  Discharge diagnoses
were also previously dictated.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in the
office approximately four weeks following discharge and was
