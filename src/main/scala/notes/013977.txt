CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. Moderate-sized pneumothorax, mild rightward displacement of
the
mediastinum. Left thoracostomy tube within the upper pleural
space with
contusion in the left upper lobe and moderate left pleural
effusion.
2. Multiple left rib fractures and sternal fracture.
4. Moderate-to-severe emphysema. An 8-mm left upper lobe nodule
warrants
evaluation in six months with a chest CT following resolution of
acute
symptoms or evaluation with PET-CT should be considered with
attention in
follow-up to mildly prominent central mediastinal nodes.
5. Extensive right basilar opacity with volume loss including
mucus plugging, suggesting extensive atelectasis versus
aspiration or pneumonia.
6. Severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary vessels
and aorta. 2.4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic ectasia. 3-cm left
iliac arterial aneurysm. No evidence of rupture. Follow-up CT
imaging is recommended within six months for surveillance.
7. Endotracheal tube terminating at the distal trachea.
Orogastric tube
terminating within the stomach.
8. 19 x 14-mm non-obstructing right renal pelvis stone. Likely
tiny left
hemorrhagic renal cyst.

CT Cspine:
1. Nondisplaced fractures of the left T2 and T3 transverse
processes. There is a small hematoma within the left
supraclavicular fossa and along the base of the posterolateral
left neck.
2. Acute left clavicle fracture.
3. Trace left pneumothorax.
4. Emphysema.

XR R knee: No definite fracture. If there is continued concern,
given the history of trauma, recommend CT.

L Foot: There is generalized osteopenia of the visualized bony
elements. However, no evidence of gas in soft tissues or bone
destruction. There is a moderate inferior calcaneal spur.

L Hand: 1. Intra-articular fracture of the long finger proximal
phalanx. 2. Degenerative changes.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]:
1. Study limited due to motion-related artifacts. Within this
limitation,
there is no obvious focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute
infarct. No mass effect.
2. Moderate dilation of the lateral and the third ventricles, as
described
above, which may relate to volume loss or communicating
hydrocephalus such as NPH. Correlate clinically.
3. Diffuse mucosal thickening and fluid in the mastoid air
cells, moderate
amount of fluid in the sphenoid sinus and mild-to-moderate
mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
4. Diffuse hypointense signal of the marrow is noted related to
anaemia,
myeloproliferative or infiltrative disorders. Correlate with
hematology labs.

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Renal US:
1. No hydronephrosis bilaterally. Subcentimeter non-obstructive
right renal calculus. Limited Doppler images show normal
arterial and venous flow at the renal hilae bilaterally.
2. Heterogenous area within the right lobe of liver concerning
for a mass but incidentally noted and only partially imaged.
Dedicated ultrasound imaging of the liver is recommended.
3. Increase in amount of intraabdominal ascites.
4. Apparent fluid distended bladder may represent a pocket of
ascitic fluid given reported presence of Foley catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92039**] work up in the ED revealed the following injuries:
- L clavicle fracture
- L ribs [**1-10**] fracture with associated pneumothorax s/p chest
tube and pigtail placement
- Sternal fracture
- T2-T4 L transverse process fractures

She was transferred to the TSICU for further management. Her
course is below by system:

Neuro: Patient's CT evaluations revealed no head or spinous
trauma. Her c-collar was kept on until cleared by neurosurgery.
She was taken off log roll. She was neurologically intact while
intubated, though sedated on propofol and fentanyl. Given her
prior possible history of ethanol abuse, she was monitored with
a CIWA scale. Her sedation was weaned as her pain improved,
however she was lethargic and minimally responsive. Neurology
was consulted and an MRI was performed which ruled out stroke.
Neurology felt her mental status was a result of her global
trauma state. She gradually improved and was intermittently
aware and interative, though resigned mostly.

CV: On admission, patient was found to have a supratherapeutic
digoxin level. She received digibind on HD1 and was seen by the
cardiology team. Echo was performed with preserved EF and
hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall inferomedially. She
required pressor support despite fluid resuscitation and blood
transfusion, prompting adrenal cortical evaluation. Cortisol was
relatively low for her stressed state and she was started on
hydrocortisone, allowing a small wean in her pressor
requirement. With antibiotic therapy for sepsis from MSSA
pneumonia, patient's pressors were weaned off. Her bradycardia
improved and she was taken off dopamine. Cardiology was
consulted for possible pacer, however, given her fragile state
and high risk for infection and skin breakdown, it was not
recommended. Repeat echo on [**2188-12-24**] showed normal cardiac
function with no valvular disease. Patient had almost daily
episodes of bradycardia with hypotension and lethargy requiring
atropine to recover. After a long discussion with the family,
the decision was made not to escalate care and to only provide a
maximum of 2 mg of atropine for symptomatic bradycardia and the
patient was made DNR.

Resp: Patient was intubated prior to arrival in our ED. A large
air leak was noted in her chest tube, presumably from
parenchymal injury to the lung. Chest tube was kept on suction
until air leak dim
