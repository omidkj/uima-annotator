Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M admitted for hypotension and anemia with history of
recent discharge for GIB related to [**Location (un) 3825**] ulcer, found to have
2 [**Location (un) 3825**] ulcers on repeat EGD.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. Anemia
GI bleed from 2 [**Location (un) 3825**] ulcers noted on EGD is likely cause,
given his history of melena; however, patient had episode of BRB
in the toilet bowl on the day of discharge so question of
possible other cause exists.  The patient has a history of
radiation proctitis which may be responsible for this.  He
required multiple transfusions -- first in ED/MICU (1unit) and
though he did not have an appropriate initial response, after
receiving 2 more units on the general medicine floor he
responded well.  Hcts came up to high 20s (28-29) and eventually
increased to 32 upon discharge. Serial Hct were between 21-23.
He was seen by [**Location (un) **] who performed an EGD showing 2
[**Location (un) 3825**] ulcers within hiatal hernia sac; these were not actively
bleeding.  He has been started on omeprazole and sucralfate and
will follow up with GI, as well as surgery as an outpatient for
possible repair of hiatal hernia.

2. [**Location (un) 3825**] Ulcers: Seen on repeat EGD as above; not actively
bleeding.  Treated with omeprazole and sucralfate.  The patient
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] in GI in 3 weeks.

3. Hypotension at admission:
Most likely etiology was hypovolemia due constipation, poor PO
and continue use of diuretics, with possible contribution from
GI bleed although he was having melena and no hematochezia.
Blood pressure resolved in MICU with fluids and holding of
diuretics.  On the general medicine floor he was normotensive;
home bumetanide was held for most of the admission and restarted
the day before discharge, when blood pressures were normal to
borderline high.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

1. Hypothyroidism: stable during this admission.

2. Hypertension: home antihypertensives -- lisinopril,
bumetanide and nadolol -- were held during this admission due to
hypotension when he came in.  These were restarted upon
discharge as blood pressures were stable at normal to elevated
(130s-160s systolic range).

3. Pedal edema: Bumetanide held for most of admission but
restarted prior to discharge with significant diuresis and
decreased edema.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. The patient will have his H/H checked in 1 week via his PCP
and these results should be communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**].

Medications on Admission:
1. Bisacodyl 10 mg PO DAILY:PRN constipation
per pt, taken with pain medications
2. Bumetanide 2 mg PO QAM
3. Levothyroxine Sodium 50 mcg PO DAILY
4. OxycoDONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN back pain
5. Pregabalin 25 mg PO BID
6. TraMADOL
