Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholangitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 28825**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, and remote history of
partial gastrectomy and cholecystectomy who presented on the day
of admission to [**Hospital6 1597**] with right upper quadrant
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fevers. At the OSH he was
found to have a temperature of 97 with blood pressures in the
mid 80s. His liver enzymes were elevated with a predominantly
obstructive pattern; he underwent RUQ ultrasound that showed
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The patient was volume
rescucitated with 4L of intravenous saline, and he was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ERCP evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic with initial
vitals T 100.8, HR 80, BP 90/45, RR 16, and satting 94% on 6L.
Labs were notable for ALT of 228, AST of 338, AP of 225, and
Tbili of 2.9. White count was 17 with 8% bands. Hematocrit was
29, and platelets were 145. INR was 5.8. Lactate was 4. Blood
cultures were drawn. The patient had already received
ciprofloxacin and Flagyl at [**Hospital3 2568**], and he was given
additional Zosyn at [**Hospital1 **] ED. He got 10 mg IV vitamin K, but FFP
was held due to concern of volume overload. In addition, due to
persistent hypotension and concern of pulmonary edema with more
fluids, a groin line was placed and norepinephrine was started.
ERCP had been contact[**Name (NI) **] and will see the patient either in the
ED or when he reaches [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

His vital signs at time of transfer were BP 101/58, satting 100%
on BiPAP, HR 110-120 (atrial fibrillation), T 101 rectally.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: currently, patient denies abdominal pain or
nausea. He says he does not have any discomfort.

.
Admission CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly but no evidence of focal
airspace
consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

ERCP [**2135-11-27**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Lumen: Evidence of a previous sub-total gastrectomy was seen in
the stomach body with Billroth II anastomosis.
Duodenum/jejunum: Limited exam of the duodenum / jejunum was
normal
Major Papilla: A single diverticulum with large opening was
found with the major papilla located inside the diverticulum.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was unsuccessful
using a free-hand technique despite multiple attempts with
multiple catheters. Contrast medium injection was not attempted.


Impression: Previous sub-total gastrectomy of the stomach body
with Billroth II anastomosis
Papilla located inside a large diverticulum.
Despite multiple attempts, biliary cannulation was unsucessful.

Recommendations: Return to ICU.
Consider PTC for biliary decompression.
Additional notes: The procedure was done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the
GI Fellow. Estimate blood loss = 0 cc. No specimens were
obtained. See impression for final diagnosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with remote history of partial
gastrectromy and cholecystectomy who presents with abdominal
pain and hypotension, and labs suggestive of acute cholangitis.

# Cholangitis: Given his septic presentation, he was initially
started on empric Zosyn.  He was fluid resusictated with 4 L IVF
and required placement on pressors for his hypotesnion.  After
much discussuion between the ICU, team, the ERCP team, and Mr.
[**Known lastname 28826**] family, it was decided that he should undergo ERCP.
He was temporarily intubated for the procedure. However, given
his history of Biliroth II gastrectomy, the CBD could not be
canulated. He was successfully extubated shortly after returning
to the ICU. Percutaneous biliary drain placement was discussed,
but patient improved clinically on abx, and family was not in
favor of further invasive procedures. Pt was continued to
empiric Zosyn with improvement in WBC count. Pressors were able
to be weaned off sucessfully. [**Hospital6 1597**] cultures came
back as pansensitive E. coli and Klebsiella (resistant to
ampicillin), and abx were narrowed to ceftriaxone. In  order to
better evaluate cause of obstruction, MRCP was done which showed
choledocholithiasis.  Discussion was had with Interventional
Radiology and ERCP teams, and future consideration will be given
to PTC with rendesvouz.  Both teams agree for now that he should
recover from current episode, however, GI wishes to discuss with
he and HCP on [**2135-12-6**] whether to move forward soon with stone
retrieval intervention.  Daughter (HCP) is a
