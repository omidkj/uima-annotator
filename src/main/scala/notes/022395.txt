Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
leukocytosis and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39 year-old male with hx of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma s/p allsoSCT s/p DLI, complicated by PTLD treated with
rituxan, GVHD of the gut, liver, and lung with BOOP/pulmonary
fibrosis with chronic trach and vent brought from [**Hospital1 **] with
tachycardia to the 130's-140's, from baseline increaseing sputum
production and leukocytosis.
.
Mr [**Known firstname **] is well known the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with multiple stays here for BOOP
exacerbations and pseudomonal pneumonia.  He is well known to
our infectious disease service for his greatly resistant
psuedomonas.  After his last hospitalization he was followed in
OPAT for IV administration of colistin, doripenem, micafungin
and inhaled colistin.  Per the patient the doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
sent out special sensitivities and his psuedomonas may be
susceptible to an "older drug" though he doesnt know the name,
though it appears doxycyline is a new drug on his med list.  He
had been doing well until yesterday when he noted tachycardia,
increased sputum production, and leukocytosis.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the
setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- CT scan: 15x14x10cm mass in the LUQ.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response,
but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with
MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**3-/2155**]: Underwent stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan followed

by autologous stem cell transplant in
- [**7-/2155**]: Noted for disease recurrence. He was initially treated

with a course of Rituxan without response followed by Zevalin
with
- [**3-/2156**]: Noted progression of his disease. He was treated with

one cycle of [**Hospital1 **] followed by one cycle of ESHAP.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant
with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning

- Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by

acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a
prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple
transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this
was treated with a course of Rituxan. No evidence for recurrence

of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.

- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of
bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but
then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not
to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding
drop in his ferritin. He has continued with transient rises in
his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying
doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered
over the time.
- [**2160-1-10**] CellCept discontinued.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain. MRI
revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle
bilaterally. After extensive workup, this was felt related to an

infection and required several admissions with completion of
antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphoma and he has

remained in remission.
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his
GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal
[**Year (4 digits) 950**]. MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not

as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI
imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-- GI varices and attempts at banding have been unsuccessful due

to difficulty with passing the necessary instruments. He has
been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which
was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his

varices.
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small
new pneumothorax in the left apical area. This has essentially
resolved over time
- Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]);
multiple tests done with no etiology found; question
malabsorption related to GVHD
- Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated
with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant
pseudomonas. Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD

in setting of his URIs.
- Currently receives IVIG every month.
.

Imaging:
[**9-21**] CXR: Slight interval worsening of left upper lobe and
retrocardiac
opacity concerning for persistent infectious process. Given
history of immuno suppression, chest CT could be performed for
further evaluation.

[**9-23**] CXR:  Interval improvement in left upper lobe and
retrocardiac
opacities. Attention on follow up radiographs of subtle right
upper lobe
opacity. Small left pleural effusion.
