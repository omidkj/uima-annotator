History of Present Illness:
84 Y F w/ hx afib on coumadin/amio, diastolic heart failure,
admitted [**2133-3-15**] with flash pulmonary edema in setting of

Pt felt very itchy, with headache, rapid heart rate and SOB;
thought related to not taking hydroxyurea, as that has helped
with her itchines in the past but became progressively more
short of breath and decided to call EMS. Also states over the

edema.

.
Echo ([**2133-3-16**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4cm2)
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**2133-3-16**]): As compared to the previous examination, there is
clear regression of the marked interstitial pneumonia. However,
there are still signs of interstitial fluid overload and a clear
cardiomegaly. No evidence of pleural effusions.

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2133-3-31**] 10:04 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? effusion eval lead placement ppm

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion eval lead placement ppm
INDICATION: 84-year-old female status post CABG. Evaluate for
effusion and lead placement.

COMPARISON: [**2133-3-28**].

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: A dual-lead cardiac pacer
overlies the left hemithorax in a similar orientation with leads
intact terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Median sternotomy wires are noted, unchanged in configuration.
The patient is status post mitral valve annuloplasty. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is slight increase
in size of the bilateral moderate pleural effusions left greater
than right. There is linear atelectasis in the left base.
