Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
VT arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 55 yo M with PMHx of CABG [**2175**], PCI [**2180**] who
presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-13**] with increasing back pain and
chest pressure. Back pain was described as sharp x 30 min,
improved with nitroglycerin. Patient was otherwise asymptomatic.
He was admitted with chest pain for ROMI and possible stress
test [**10-14**] (CTA was negative). However at approx 10 PM he was
found face down in his room after his roommate called out. He
was initially breathing with shallow breaths, but then became
apneic and pulseless. Code blue was called and CPR initiated.
Patient was found to have Ventricular tachycardia and patient
was shocked per ACLS protocol. As well, patient was loaded with
amiodarone 300 mg and intubated for airway protection (though no
report of respiratory distress). Patient was briefly transferred
to the ICU at [**Location (un) 620**], but quickly transported to [**Hospital1 18**]. Per
report after intubating food particles were suctioned from the
ET tube.
Patient was then directly sent to the cath lab. There he was
found to have a total occlusion of his SVG-OM2 graft, this was
dilated and stented x2. Right heart catherization was done that
showed elevated pulmonary pressures and an elevated PCWP to
approx 40. IV lasix was administered. A 40 cm balloon pump was
placed and patient was transported to the CCU.
.
Review of systems not possible as patient is intubated and
sedated. As OSH, review of systems was positive only for chest
pain, back pain and lower extremity edema

Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
CAD

Social History:
Social history is significant for current tobacco use. There is
no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is significant family history of premature coronary artery
disease with several male relatives having [**Name2 (NI) **] in their 40s, 50s
with the youngest occurring at age 25-26.

HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with JVD
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. No S4, no S3. Difficult to assess secondary
to balloon pump
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. No crackles, wheeze,
rhonchi.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND,
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits (difficult to assess with
balloon pump).
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, purpuric chest/neck
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 0 DP,
PT 1+
Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

cardiac Cath [**2183-10-14**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a 50% ostial
stenosis.
The LAD had a 50% proximal stenosis.  The LCx system had a 100%
occluded
OM2.  The RCA was diffusely diseased with an 80% ostial stenosis
and a
60% proximal stenosis.
2.  Arterial conduit bypass angiography revealed a widely patent

LIMA-->LAD with retrograde filling.  The radial graft to the
R-PDA had a
40% proximal stenosis.  The SVG-->OM2 was totally occluded.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and
left heart
filling pressures, with RVEDP of 31 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 40 mm
Hg.
Pulmonary arterial pressures were elevated with PASP of 58 mmHg.
 There
was systemic arterial hypotension with aortic SBP of 78 mm Hg.
Cardiac
index was depressed at 1.34 L/min/m2.
4. Successful stenting of proximal and distal SVG-OM graft with
3.5x28mm
Vision BMS and 2.5x28mm Minivision BMS respectively in setting
of ACS.
5. Insertion of IABP for cardiogenic shock

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2  Occluded SVG-->OM2.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
4. Succesful Stenting of SVG-OM2
5. Intraaortic ballon pump placement.
.
ECHO [**2183-10-14**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis, inferior hypokinesis,
apical hypokinesis/akinesis. No apical thrombus identified.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, PCI who presents after VFib/tach
arrest with total occlusion of his SVG s/p PCI.
.
V fib/tach arrest: Likely caused by ischemia and thus possibly
reversible. Was revascularized in cath lab and now without
further episodes. Was loaded on amiodarone IV on gtt overnight,
and then turned off.
.
Cardiogenic shock: Secondary to STEMI and CAD as patient had
totally occluded SVG. Cardiac index low at 1.34. IABP placed to
support blood pressure and coronary artery filling. Briefly on
phenylephrine for hypotension. Patient on heparin, plavix,
aspirin,  add beta blocker. Patient was eventually weaned off
IABP as his blood pressure tolerated. BBlocker was added. He was
transitioned to coumadin from heparin, and will be maintained on
this for apical akinesis.
.
Fluid overload: patient with increased PCWP and right sided
pressures. Possible that patient received excessive fluids prior
to transfer. As well patient with poor forward flow. diuresed as
blood pressure tolerated. Euvolemic on dc.
.
Aspiration event: Patient with suctioned food particles. Patient
with mild fever and leukocytosis. possible stress response, but
given hypotension, treated empirically with antibiotics for
aspiration pneumonia. CXR without signs of infiltrate. treated
intially with Vanc/zosyn, no signs of infection, so this was
discontinued.
.
Respiratory status: patient intubated on OSH before transferred.
STable from respiratory status, and was weaned off vent on HD 2.

.
Anemia: likely in the setting of blood loss due to
catherizations and acute stress, stable on discharge.
.
Acidosis: improved after improvement in vent settings. [**Month (only) 116**] have
metabolic acidosis after hypoxic insult.
