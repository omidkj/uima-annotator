Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Psychosis (auditory and visual hallucinations)/tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
59 yo woman with h/o depression, anxiety, asthma who presents
sectioned from therapist. She was noted to be very disorganized,
psychotic, and hallucinating at therapy and sent in for
evaluation. She reportedly had a fall yesterday and no LOC.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.6 108 183/85 20 97. She was
tachycardic 108 which improved after fluids to 80 (1 Liter).
Labs notable for WBC 13.4, nl chemistry, D-dimer 488, AST 42,
LDH 293, Valproate 85 negative cardiac enzymes. U/A negative.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia, NA/NI and no ST/T changes. CXR
negative, CT Head with no bleed, sinus retention cyst. Pt
subsequently pulled out IV. She was agitated and got 1mg ativan
POx2.
.
She remained intermittently tachycardic and felt to need
evaluation of this prior to admission to psych.
.
Of note, psychiatry spoke to pts friend who felt that she has
not been doing well and has been depressed: not going out of the
house, not getting up, crying, not answering the phone but had
never known her to hallucinate.
.
Per patient's primary care doctor's office, patient has baseline
leukocytosis and was previously seen by a hematologist in the
[**Hospital1 **] system who did not find
underlying pathology. She has also been documented with
tachycardia on medical visits, HR110 in [**2152-2-14**]; she also
frequently misses appointments due to severe anxiety and
depression (predominantly of hoarding, isolating nature - no
previous history of hallucinations/psychosis).
.
Currently unable to obtain good history from patient, as she is
intermittnetly falling asleep. When aroused, patient is
disorganized in her speech, asking about the difference between
apple cinnamon and apple cider, tangential but alert and
oriented X3.

Past Medical History:
Anxiety
Depression

Allergic rhinitis
Esophageal reflux
Tension headaches

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:98.8 BP:126/60-140/78 P:120-125 R:16 O2: 94-95%RA
General: Alert, oriented x3 but mumbling and difficult to focus.
Would awaken to verbal stimuli and attempt to answer question in
somewhat pressured/garbled speech and falls asleep quickly
thereafter. Also with apneic episodes and loud snoring. Some
tangential thoughts this morning (ex: what is the difference
between apple cinnamon and apple cider?)
HEENT: NCAT, EOMI without nystagmus, dry mucus membranes, mucus
crusting around eyes (L>R), nasal congestion (audible)
Neck: Soft, supple, no JVD, no nuchal rigidity
Lungs: CTAB, no wheezing/rhonchi/rales
CV: Regular rhythm, tachycardia, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, normal
S1/S2
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, obese, bowel sounds present, no
rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, +DP/PT pulses, no
clubbing/cyanosis/edema
Neuro: Strength and sensation grossly intact, moving all
extremities, gait unable to assess

Brief Hospital Course:

Still tachycardic, CTA negative for PE.  Mental status cleared
significantly.
.
59 year old female with h/o depression, anxiety, HTN, asthma
presents for section 12 from therapist for psychotic symptoms
and tachycardia
.
# Altered mental status: Initially unclear and thought likely
due to progressing psychiatric illness and ativan received in
ED. Psychiatry initially felt her presentation was consistent
with psychotic depression or previously subclinical bipolar or
psychotic disorder. Patient has been on depakote, suggesting the
need for some mood stabilization as target of pharmacotherapy.
In further discussions with family, however, her recent
hallucinations were felt to be inconsistent with what would be
expected with psychotic depression, and inconsistent with her
past mental health manifestations. Head trauma was also felt
less likely given negative CT head. Infectious etiology less
likely, despite leukocytosis which is apparently close to
baseline. CXR, urinalysis, LFTs all negative and patient does
not have localizing symptoms/fevers; no nuchal rigidity or
significant concern for CSF infection and ultimate lumbar
puncture analysis was negative for bacterial, fungal, viral
etiologies. Other toxic metabolic etiologies include
B12/thiamine deficiency, hypo/hyperthyroidism psychosis,
syphillis, illicit drug use work up for which were all negative.
Given neurological exam grossly intact, lower suspicion for
these etiologies as well. Patient became progressively
somnolent, altered on the floor, responding only to noxious
stimuli and unsafe to take PO medications. She was started on
thiamine and underwent lumbar puncture as aforementioned.
Patient was noted to be audible obstructing while sleeping. On
continuous pulse oximetry, patient was noted to desaturate
frequently while sleeping to <88% O2.Serial ABGs were performed
which showed progressive hypoxia, hypercarbia. Sleep was
ultimately consulted and recommended BiPap settings. Patient
then had a 20 second apneic episode and was transferred to the
MICU. There, she was transitioned to CPAP with face mask. As she
could not tolerate the face mask, she was switched to nasal CPAP
with good effect. Her mental status improved dramatically
thereafter and upon return to the general Medical Floor, patient
was conversant, interactive and asking intelligent, informed
questions about her medical conditions. Throughout this, patient
was continued on her home psych and other medications.
Psychiatry followed patient throughout this hospitalization and
eventually felt her presenting symptoms not due to psychiatric
illness, but likely severe sleep depression secondary to
obstructive sleep apnea. Patient was discharged straight to her
follow-up Pulmonary appointment and will also have close
followup with her psychiatrist (psychiatry NP) and primary care
doctor. Social work also saw patient in-house.
.
# Tachycardia - Most likely dehydration in the setting of recent
poor PO intake (given mental status/psychiatric issues) and per
physical exam (dry mucus membranes). Pulmonary Emboli was lower
on the differential in the setting of no hypoxia and D Dimer
488. Eventual CTA for pulmonary emboli was also negative.
Cardiac etiology also felt to be unlikely given normal EKG and
negative cardiac enzymes X2. TSH was within normal limits and no
events were noted on telemetry. Patient was on intravenous
fluids when altered and transitioned to PO intake with some
improvement in her tachycardia to 90-100s.
.
# HTN- Continued home Lisinopril/HCTZ & Nifedipine per home
regimen. Although blo
