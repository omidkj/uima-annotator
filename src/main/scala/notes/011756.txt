History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year-old woman with a history of type 1
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and breast cancer s/p
lumpectomy who is admitted to the MICU this morning for diabetic
ketoacidosis.  She reports that she was in her usual state of
health until approximately two days ago, when she noted the
onset of nausea and inability to tolerate POs.  She also noted
that her FSBGs were markedly elevated (300-500; "normal" FSBG
for her ~280) in spite of her poor PO intake.  She also reports
having polyuria for the past two days with clear, light-colored
urine; she denies any dysuria.  Yesterday, she also had a couple
episodes of loose stools.  She is unsure if she has had any sick
contacts since she lives in a shelter.  She went to her PCP's
office today who noted an inability to tolerate sips of water, a
BP of 92/50, HR of 105, so she was sent to the ED for evaluation
for possible DKA.  Of note, the patient denies any recent
fevers.

Upon arrival to the ED, she was afebrile, BP 107/59, HR 103, RR
16, Sat 100% on room air, FSBG 496.  She was started on a NS
infusion and an insulin drip at 6 units/hr.  Her initial labs
were notable for an anoin gap of 24 and ketonuria on her
urinalysis.  A right IJ triple lumen central venous catheter was
placed.  She was given a total of 3L NS and 1L NS with 40 mEq
KCl.  She put out a total of 700cc of urine.  Throughout her
course, her anion gap decreased to 20, and her FSBG was down to
234 at the time of transfer.

Review of Systems:
Notable for dry cough for several days.  Denies fevers, dysuria,
abdominal pain.  Poor PO intake, N/V/D as above.  Denies chest
pain, dyspnea.  Reports occasional pedal edema.

Past Medical History:

ECG ([**2126-1-9**]):
Sinus tachycardia at 105 bpm. Normal axis, normal intervals. No
ST segment or T wave changes.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The lungs are
clear.  There is no pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year-old woman with poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes
mellitus presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis.

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis:
No clear source of her DKA was found.  It was thought
potentially secondary to chronic poorly controlled DM.  She had
no evidence of infection, including UTI or pneumonia.  She was
continued on her insulin drip until HD#2.  She was initially
fluid resuscitated but this was changed to D51/2NS once gap
closed and K normalized.  She was transitioned to glargine and
insulin sliding scale on HD#2 with 2 hour overlap of insulin
drip.  Her electrolytes were followed Q4 hours and her gap
remained closed.

[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and she was sent home on a regimen of
lantus [**Hospital1 **] and humalog sliding scale per their recommendations.
She was advised to continue with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

Of note, the patient has been living in a shelter and has found
it difficult to access care.  She states that she will have
housing soon.  In the meantime, she was encouraged to work with
the social workers at the shelter so she could learn how to use
public transportation to get to her appointments.

## Nausea/Vomitting:
[**Month (only) 116**] have been indicative of early DKA; alternatively, may have
had a viral gastroenteritis which pushed her into DKA.  She had
no further symptoms following treatment of her DKA.

## Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine

## Hyperlipidemia: continued statin

## Thyroid Nodule: per patient, noted on CT scan done at [**Hospital1 2177**]
last month; none appreciated on exam currently.  She was advised
to follow up with her primary care provider for appropriate
[**Name9 (PRE) 8019**].

## History of Breast Cancer: continued tamoxifen.  She was
encouraged to continue follow-up with her outpatient providers.

## Migraine headaches: asymptomatic; continued topiramate

## ?Asthma:  Continued albuterol and montelukast

## Of note, patient refused subQ heparin during her stay.
