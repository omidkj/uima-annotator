PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Aortic valve disease s/p AVR. Small ericardial
effusion, r/o tamponade.
Height: (in) 61
Weight (lb): 306
BSA (m2): 2.27 m2
BP (mm Hg): 174/75
HR (bpm): 74
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2154-6-13**] at 15:26
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007W000-0:00
Test Location: West Other
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 65% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move
normally.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. Local
anesthesia was
provided by benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated
for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The
posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous lidocaine. No
TEE related
complications. 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an
antisialogogue
prior to TEE probe insertion.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the
aortic arch and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis
leaflets appear to
move normally. There is no paravalvular leak. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2154-6-2**] from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab, to
which she was discharged after undergoing a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
AVR on [**2154-5-17**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Hospital1 827**].  [**Hospital 38**] rehab reported increased dyspnea,
tachypnea, diarrhea, and failure to thrive over the past 36-48
hours.

Upon admission she was seen in consultation by the renal
service.  She was dialyzed during her stay and her renal
function improved markedly.  It was determined that she likely
wound not need long term dialysis.  She was also seen in
consultation by the infectious disease service during her
admission and she was placed on Vancomycin per their
recommendations.  Once it was determined that she would not
require long term dialysis access, she was re-coumadinized for
her mechanical aortic valve.  By hospital day ###### she was
ready for discharge to a rehabiliation facility.
