Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Episodes of recurrent Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiologic study and Ventricular tachycardia ablation.


History of Present Illness:
75 y.o. male transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with V-Tach,
BiV ICD firing several times per day. Loaded with amiodarone in
the ED. Recently admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] for Left lead revision.
.
He reports a history of recurrent ICD firing since it was placed
approximately 3 years ago but has not had an incident since
[**Month (only) 956**] when his leads were revised. ~4am on [**4-12**] his ICD fired
while he was sleeping. He was scheduled to have a colonoscopy
today so went through a bowel prep throughout the day but did
take his medications. His ICD fired again early this morning. He
was instructed not to take his medications and remain NPO for
his colonoscopy, but when his gastroenterologist found out that
his ICD had fired again, he cancelled the procedure. The patient
then took his usual morning medications at ~1pm. His ICD fired 2
more times, and as he was close to his cardiologist's office, he
stopped in. His ICD was interrogated, verified that it did fire,
and he was sent by ambulance to [**Hospital6 33**] ED. There,
he was loaded with IV amio (15 mg/min for 150mg, then 1mg/min)
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. The patient reports a
fluttering-type of sensation and "funny feeling" before his ICD
fired each time, similar to the past, but he never syncopized,
had chest pain, or had shortness of breath. Currently he feels
at his baseline with no complaints.
.
ROS: No orthopnea, PND, chest discomfort, lower-extremity
swelling, N/V/D/C/abdominal pain, fevers, chills.

Chest X-ray on [**2123-4-19**]:
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST:
The mildly enlarged heart is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  The ICD and
pacemaker leads are in proper positions projecting over the
right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. Patient is
status post CABG.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process is noted.
2.  Mildly enlarged heart is unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
#) CV - Rhythm: Patient on Mexiletine 200mg [**Hospital1 **] and amiodarone
200mg qday as outpatient but was started on amiodarone
continuous infusion at OSH. Pacer interrogation demonstrated
firing x4 as above. Given previous history of ischemic disease,
this may be V-tach with permanent re-entrant substrate secondary
to ischemia/infarction. Recent increasing frequency of events
may be secondary to recent bowel preparations from colonoscopy,
and decreased absorption of anti-arrhythmic agents secondary to
this. Had recurrent episodes of V-tach with ICD firing on [**4-14**].
Now status-post VT ablation on [**2123-4-16**].  Per Electrophysiology
service recommendations, restarted mexiletine and continued oral
amiodarone 200mg qdaily. Started on anticoagulation with
warfarin and heparin gtt after VT ablation procedure, which will
need to continue for 2 months.
.
#) Ischemia - History of CABG in [**2102**]. Experienced few episodes
of angina associated with V-tach during this admission, that
resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin without and significant
ECG changes.  Continued with aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol,
statin, but held lisinopril.
.
#) Pump - Per records, patient has EF ranging 15-25%. Although
JVP is elevated, appears to be euvolemic otherwise, given
absence of crackles on pulmonary exam and absence of peripheral
oedema. Continued with furosemide 120mg qAM, 80mg qPM ,
Isosorbide mononitrate, and hydralazine, metoprolol. Held
lisinopril, can consider discontinuing if already on
Imdur/hydralazine.  Discontinued digoxin due to
arrhythmogenicity
.
#) Valves - no known issues. [**Month (only) 116**] have mitral regurgitation
secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy. No symptoms.
.
#) Hypertension - Continued metoprolol, imdur/hydralazine,
furosemide.
.
#) Chronic renal failure - Creatinine was slightly elevated from
baseline of 2.0. Likely secondary to recent bowel
preparation/dehydration. Electrolytes and volume status stable.
Held Lisinopril.
.
#) COPD - Continued advair.
.
#) Iron deficiency anemia - Patient was undergoing colonoscopy
for work-up of this.
Continued with iron supplements.  Guaiaced stools and monitor
hematocrit.
