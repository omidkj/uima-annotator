Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular central vein line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1024**] is a 46 year old gentleman with a PMH EtOH cirrhosis
c/b multiple prior UGIBs and past possible HRS, continued
alcohol abuse c/b seizures, CKD (had been on HD until [**Month (only) **]
[**2169**]), now being transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for management of
hypovolemic shock secondary to GI bleed, and possible TIPS
procedure.

History obtained from OMR and OSH records, as well as
conversation with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ICU nurse, as patient is
intubated and sedated.

[**Name (NI) **] girlfriend reported to OSH that patient had filled
four "buckets" of bloody emesis at home, and was then convinced
to go to the ED at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2171-8-27**]. On arrival, patient
was only able to speak in short sentences, but was making little
sense. VS on arrival were BP 91/37 HR 160 RR 20 (temperature and
SaO2 not recorded). He became obtunded, and was intubated
shortly thereafter, with Fentanyl boluses, followed by propofol
drip. Labs were notable for: H/H 2.8/8.2, Plts 64, Cr 3.9, INR
2.6, urine tox positive for oxycodone, EtOH level 238, and UCx
with 100,000 Coag negative staph. OG tube was placed, and this
prouced another container full of bloody emesis. Massive
transfusion protocol was initiated in the ED, and patient was
given 4 units FFP, 2 units of PRBC and 4 Liters of NS. EGD that
evening showed erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, coffee
grounds in stomach, and a suggestion of duodenal varices.
Gastroenterologists at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hypothesized that the
patient may have been chronically bleeding from his
esophagitis/varices, as they could find little evidence of
active bleeding.  During his admission at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], he
received a total of 10 units PRBCs, 7 units FFP, and two 6-packs
of platelets. He was kept on octreotide drip (began [**8-27**]) and
pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID ([**8-27**]). He was also treated with Zosyn
for possible aspiration pneumonia (starting on [**2171-8-27**]). For
sedation, he was kept on propofol for sedation with lorazepam IV
boluses as needed. Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] labs H/H [**7-11**], and
plt 25 @ 1200 today. For access, he had a right triple lumen CVL
and a left a-line. He also had an OG tube, and fully matured RUE
AV fistula (not used since [**69**]/[**2169**]). He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management, including possible capsule endoscopy,
balloon enteroscopy and/or TIPS.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated, but
appeared comfortable.

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple admissions to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 83800**] for upper and lower GI
bleeds. Most recently at [**Hospital1 18**] UGIB, admitted [**Date range (3) 83801**]:
transfused 9U PRBC, 8U FFP and 10U plts. No noted varices on EGD
[**2171-4-2**]. Thought to be secondary to erosive esophagitis.
2. EtOH cirrhosis: acute EtOH hepatitis in [**8-27**] (was not
started on corticosteroids due to GI bleed, UTI and [**Last Name (un) **]); was
started on pentoxyphyline to prevent HRS with a planned 4 week
course from [**2168-9-26**] (last day [**2168-10-24**]); negative hepatitis A, B
and C serologies. Complicated by GI bleeds as above in the past
(but no varices), and possible history of HRS.
3. CKD: Cr baseline around 3.0. Was HD-dependent via RUE fistula
until [**2170-9-18**]. Diagnosis was multifactorial from ATN +/-
NSAIDs +/- HRS
4. MRSA bacteremia [**2171-10-23**] treated with vancomycin
5. EtOH abuse with h/o seizures in the setting of heavy alcohol
consumption
6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
7. MVA [**3-/2153**]: Right femur fracture with [**Male First Name (un) **] placement, pelvic
fracture
8. Asthma

Social History:
Has never smoked. Drank [**11-22**] Vodka daily until recently, but
denies drinking in the past 4 months (last drink first week of
[**Month (only) 359**]). Never has used IV drugs. Lives with girlfriend, [**Name (NI) 5627**]
[**Name (NI) 83758**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83759**]. Has 2 children, daughter 17, son, 16
who live with their mother who the patient is still very close
to. Pt formerly worked at Mass Electric.


Family History:
Mother - Deceased [**12-20**] alcoholic liver disease
Father - Deceased [**12-20**] [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, diagnosed in his 40s. No
other family history of [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

IMAGES AND PROCEDURES:
CXR [**8-29**]
FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.
Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina and
should be withdrawn 2-3 cm.  Orogastric tube courses into the
stomach and out of view.  Right IJ catheter likely terminates in
the right atrium and can be withdrawn 4 cm for more optimal
positioning. Consider repeat radiograph after repositioning.
Bilateral pleural effusions and dense retrocardiac opacity are
noted, with low lung volumes and possible mild pulmonary edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly noted.

CXR [**9-10**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**8-31**], the degree of
pulmonary vascular congestion has somewhat decreased, though
part of this may be due to the upright position.  Substantial
