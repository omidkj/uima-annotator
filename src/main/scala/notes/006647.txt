58 yo male with hx of CAD s/p IMI, ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF 25-30% and hx of VT controlled on quinidine presents with ICD
lead fracture. Pt had IMI in [**2159**]. In [**2170**] he had an ICD placed
for episode of Vtach. He then ad another episode of V-tach for
which his ICD fired 16 times and he underwent ablation. He was
started on sotalol, however failed this tx. He had another
episode of V-tach in [**7-13**] and was changed to quinidine in
[**2173-8-6**]. He has had no further episodes of VT since [**Month (only) 205**].
.
Most recently he was noted to have fluctuating RV lead impedance
and was scheduled for RV lead extraction tomorrow. His device
started beeping today and transmission showed greater impedance
([**2165**] ohms) therefore he was admitted for monitoring overnight.
He has not had inappropriate shocks and is not pacer dependent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary of hospital course:
The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of CAD s/p IMI,
ischemic CM (EF 25-30%) with an ICD placement [**8-/2170**] (for NSVT,
EF <35% and inducible VT on EPS) VT s/p failed ablation on
quinidine, admitted to the floor for an ICD lead extraction. On
[**12-8**], telemetry showed sudden onset of a wide complex
tachycardia at 150. The patient was intially asymptomatic to the
episode, but began to feel nauseated. He denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness. He was
intially bolused with IV lidocaine 50mg x 2 without effect. He
was then bolused with 300mg IV amiodarone, and started on a
amiodarone gtt at 1mg/min, but remained in stable VT. The
patient was transferred to the CCU, had ATP pacing and started
on mixiline. He was taken to the OR [**2173-12-9**], the lead was
removed and a new ICD system was implanted in the left pectoral
region. He was a difficult intubation and had right upper lobe
collapse post procedure which later resolved spontaneously. He
was kept intubated overnight and extubated without trouble the
next day. A cardiac CT was peformed prior to discharge in
preparation for VT ablation procedure as an outpatient. He was
discharged on mexilitine and keflex to complete a 7 day course.
