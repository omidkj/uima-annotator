Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 55 year old male well known to [**Hospital1 18**] who was
recently d/c on [**2169-10-25**] after 1 month stay in hospital for
gallstone pancreatitis complicated by respiratory and renal
failure which ultimately improved with supportive care. He was
discharged to rehab and was recently sent home 3 days ago.
Today, he awoke with a headache and complained of increasing
abdominal pain. He was
seen by a visiting nurse who noted that the patient appeared
sweaty and diaphoretic. A blood pressure taken demonstrated a
SBP in the 60's. He was sent to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, where BP was
70s/40s. The patient received 5L IVF resuscitation and was
started on Levophed and given Zosyn 4.5g x1. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

IMAGING:
[**2169-11-10**] AP Chest:
No acute findings. Persistent bibasilar opacities, likely
atelectasis vs. small effusions.
.
[**2169-11-10**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST:
1. Findings progressed from prior study, compatible with
pancreatic necrosis with phlegmonous collection in the
pancreatic bed containing trapped gas. The possibility of
superinfection cannot be excluded.
2. Small volume ascites, unchanged.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. CBD stent in appropriate position.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions, stable.
.
[**2169-11-11**] AP Chest:
Right internal jugular line is now in central position.
Subsegmental atelectasis. Evidence for accumulation of small
bilateral pleural effusions and possible development of mild
vascular congestion as well.
.
[**2169-11-12**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS:
1. Focal occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein around
the peripheral IV catheter. No proximal extension.
2. No DVT in the deep veins.
.
[**2169-11-14**] CT ABD W&W/O CONTRAST; PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis with large collection of air and
necrosed tissue in the pancreatic bed involving whole pancreas
measuring 8.7 x 17 x 13 cm, which is stable as compared to the
previous examination.
2. Stent in the CBD in appropriate placement.
3. Gallbladder stones and small amount of air.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Moderate amount of peritoneal fluid which has increased in
size as compared to the previous examination.
6. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions which have also
increased in size compared to the previous examination.
.
[**2169-11-17**] CXR:
Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Bibasilar
atelectases have increased on the left side. Cardiomediastinal
contours unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by
the pleural parenchymal abnormalities.  The upper lungs are
grossly clear.
.
[**2169-11-25**] CXR:
One portable view. Comparison with the previous study of
[**2169-11-21**]. There is streaky density of the lung bases consistent
with subsegmental atelectasis.  The costophrenic sulci are
blunted. The left hemidiaphragm is indistinct.  Mediastinal
structures are unchanged. A nasogastric tube and left subclavian
catheter have been removed. A PICC line has been inserted on the
left and terminates in the superior vena cava. There is no other
significant change.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
