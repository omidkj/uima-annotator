Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary intubation
CVVH


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old woman with severe LV diastolic
dysfunction, severe TR, and RV failure often refractory to
diuretics and has previously required CVVH/UF, CRI (baseline Cr
2.5), HTN, DM, and Afib, and ulcerative colitis who is
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] with acute appendicitis
and congestive heart failure. Please see the CCU fellows note
for details. In brief, the patient presented with right-sided
abdominal pain x 3-4 days when she presented to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2111-3-2**]. She denied any nausea of vomiting or change in bowel
movements at initial presentation. She underwent an abdominal CT
which demonstrated a 10m enlarged appendix with phlegmon and fat
stranding. She was not taken to the OR because of her
comorbiditis and there was no obvious pocket to drain.
She was medically managed with Cipro/Flagyl. It is not clear how
much IVF she received- but per OSH records, she was given
'discretionary use' of IVF. She was also started on diuretic
(unclear the dose)and and her response to diuretics is not
clear. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
surgerical evaluation of her phlegmon. She was transferred on
neosynephrine.
.
Initial labs revealed a severe metabolic acidosis with a ABG of
7.19/42/101, a HCO3 of 15, an anion gap of 23, and a Lactate of
1.2. She was 15kg over her dry weight (81.4kg on arrival with a
dry weight off 66). The patient is drowsy with providing limited
additional details or history. She denies CP but feels somewhat
short of breath and unable to lie flat. She denies abdominal
pain.
.
Limit review of systems, given patient mental status.

ECHO [**2111-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Small left ventricular
cavity size with low normal systolic function. Dilated right
ventricle with global systolic dysfunction and signs of pressure
and volume overload. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary hypertension
(likely underestimated due to high right atrial pressures in
setting of 3+ tricuspid regurgitation).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2110-12-16**], left ventricular function is mildly reduced,
predominantly due to abnormal septal motion. There may be less
mitral regurgitation
.
CXR [**2111-3-9**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
nasogastric tube is now visible. It is coiled in the stomach but
the tip is located in the middle parts of the stomach. No
evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise
unchanged chest radiograph. Unchanged cardiac silhouette.
.
CT ABdominal: [**2111-3-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended and fluid filled appendix, compatible with known
acute
appendicitis. No abscess or perforation.
2. Volume overloaded state with cardiomegaly, diffuse soft
tissue edema,
small pleural effusions, and small ascites.
3. Pleural effusions are associated with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
4. T10, L3, and L4 wedge compression deformities.



Brief Hospital Course:
#. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: She is presented 15 kg over
her dry weight. Required intubation and lasix IV gtt and
metolazone boluses. Now at dry weight of 66 kg with minimal
peripheral edema, clear lungs and no O2 requirement. Back on
home dose of torsemide. No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] at home and no indication as
pt has diastolic dysfunction. Was on spironolactone at home but
this has not been restarted because of rising creatinine.
Consider restarting once creatinine is decreasing. Pt will need
daily weights and chem-7 checked on Wednesday [**3-18**]. She will f/u
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
#. Acute appendicitis: Noted at [**Hospital 1774**] Hospital with right sided
abdominal pain and evidence on CT, medically managed and
symptoms have resolved. The surgical service followed her here
and will see her after discharge. Initially on cipro/flagyl,
then changed to vanco/Zosyn, now back to cipro flagyl and will
need 3 more days of these antibiotics to complete a 14 day
course. Will need another 3 days for total of 2 week course. She
is eating and drinking normally despite mild nausea this am. No
fevers or leukocytosis.
.
#.Combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis: Now resolved
after intubation and CVVH. Thought to be related to acute kidney
failure and decompensated CHF. Required pressors while in CCU to
maintain BP.
.
#. Acute on chronic kidney injury: Thought to be related to CHF
exacerbation requiring CVVH. Creatinine is now rising in the
setting of aggressive diuresis, 3.0 at discharge with baseline
about 2.0. Expect creatinine to decrease with lower torsemide
dose. Please recheck creatinine on [**3-18**] and avoid nephrotoxic
meds.
.
# Atrial fibrillation- CHADS of 3. not on coumadin [**1-22**] GI
bleeding. Remains on aspirin 81 g daily
.
# Diabetes mellitus- not on home meds, does not seem to have
been on them in the past. Last A1C 4.9
- carbohydrate consistant diet
.
# Nutrition: Pt required dietary modification after intubation,
now has been
