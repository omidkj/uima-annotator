Admission Date:  [**2195-11-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-12-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2118-1-8**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS;  The patient is a 77 year old
female, who presented with six to seven weeks of severe right
knee pain and warmth.  She notes chills, no fevers or rigors.
In recent days prior to admission, she had noted increased
chills.  She has noted decreased ambulation secondary to
pain.  Te patient was seen by the orthopedic service [**2195-9-25**], and a knee x-ray was taken, which was within normal
limits.  A repeat x-ray was taken [**2195-11-23**], with a small
effusion noted.  Laboratories were drawn at that time with
blood cultures, the blood cultures grew gram positive cocci
in pairs and chains, in two separate bottles.  The patient's
white blood cell count was 16.8 and her ESR was 96.  She was
told to come to the Emergency Department.

IN the Emergency Department, the orthopedic service saw the
patient and tapped her knee.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient received Oxacillin, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.
Of note, the patient had developed a heart rate to the 140s,
noted to be atrial flutter.  She received Cardizem 5 mg
intravenously with a decrease in her heart rate to the 70s
and a decrease in her systolic blood pressure to 62.  The
patient received normal saline boluses and a Dopamine drip
was initiated.  Upon initiation of Dopamine drip, she
returned into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response to the 170s.  The Dopamine drip was discontinued and
her blood pressure correspondingly fell to 69 systolic.  At
that point, Neo-Synephrine drip was started, which she
tolerated well.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit at that time.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  In the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient was maintained on Oxacillin and
Levofloxacin which was eventually changed to Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin.  She continued to receive normal saline boluses
and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure which was subsequently
weaned in several days after admission.  The patient
continued to have episodes of atrial flutter requiring
Diltiazem boluses intravenously as needed, however, she had a
tendency to drop her blood pressure with this medication.
After successfully weaning the Neo-Synephrine, the patient
had another episode of hypotension requiring reinitiation of
Neo-Synephrine.

On [**2195-11-26**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102 degrees
Fahrenheit and was pancultured.  At that time, the patient
also experienced oxygen desaturation.  A chest x-ray was
performed which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her maintenance fluids were discontinued.  While in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, a transthoracic echocardiogram
demonstrated no vegetation of the valves, and left
ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral
regurgitation.  The patient's Theophylline was discontinued
secondary to her continued episodes of atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter and this medication's likely
erythrogenic potential.

On [**2195-11-27**], the patient had two more episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia of which she was asymptomatic
with no decrease in her blood pressure.  A transesophageal
echocardiogram was eventually performed to rule out valvular
endocarditis which was significant for a vegetation
demonstrated of her native aortic valve.

On [**2195-11-27**], the patient was transferred to the medical floor
and upon arrival was found to be in atrial fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular response to the 140s.  She denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
abdominal pain, radiating pains or light-headedness upon
arrival.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Vital signs revealed
temperature 100.8, blood pressure 148/70, heart rate 130,
oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.  In general, an elderly
female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Sclera
anicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.  The oropharynx is
clear.  Neck - no jugular venous distention appreciated.
Chest is clear anteriorly.  Cardiovascular - irregular,
tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur
appreciated at the right upper sternal border.  No rubs
appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities - no edema, 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  The right knee
was without erythema but was noted to be warmer than the left
knee.

LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 12.5,
hematocrit 28.0, platelet count 232,000.  Sodium 141,
potassium 3.6, chloride 107, bicarbonate 26, blood urea
nitrogen 8, creatinine 0.7, glucose 104.  Calcium 7.7,
magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 2.1.  TSH is 3.2.  Vancomycin 15.7.

Right knee, three views, plain films obtained [**2195-11-23**], which
demonstrated small joint effusion, no fracture was
identified.

A portable chest x-ray on [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated no
radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary or cardiac disease
processes.  A chest x-ray on [**2195-11-29**], demonstrated small
pleural effusions bilaterally, unchanged from the prior
radiograph.  There were two calcified granulomas noted within
the left lung.

CT angiogram on [**2195-12-2**], was preliminarily negative for
pulmonary embolus.  There were noted to be atelectatic
changes in the bases of the lungs bilaterally.  The pleural
effusions noted on chest x-ray were also evident.

Microbiology - Joint fluid from [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated 2+
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no microorganisms seen on gram
stain.  The fluid culture resulted in no growth.  The joint
fluid analysis demonstrated 5,480 white blood cells, 945 red
blood cells, 94 polys, 4 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes and no
joint crystals.  Two separate blood cultures from [**2195-11-24**],
demonstrated nutritionally variant Streptococcus sensitive to
Clindamycin, Gentamicin, Penicillin and Vancomycin.  Urine
culture on [**2195-11-24**], and [**2195-11-25**], were negative for growth.
Two blood cultures drawn on [**2195-11-25**], were negative for
growth.  Two blood cultures on [**2195-11-27**], were negative for
growth.

Electrocardiogram on [**2195-11-25**], demonstrated recurrent
supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid rate of 171.
Slight ST segment depression leads V3 through V4, raising the
possibility of rate related ischemia.  Electrocardiogram
performed on [**2195-11-27**], demonstrated atrial fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular response with occasional ventricular
premature beats.  Delayed R wave transition was noted.
Compared to the previous electrocardiogram on [**2195-11-26**], this
atrial fibrillation was new.

Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2195-11-26**], demonstrated left
ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, mild aortic
regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, trivial
tricuspid regurgitation, and physiologic pulmonic
regurgitation.  There were no valvular vegetations
demonstrated.

A transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2195-11-27**], demonstrated a
left ventricular systolic function which was normal, left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  Aortic valve
demonstrated a moderate size vegetation.  No valve abscess
was seen.  Moderate aortic regurgitation was demonstrated.
The aortic valve vegetation was 0.6 by 1.0 centimeters in
size. This was on the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve.

Electrocardiogram performed on [**2195-11-30**], demonstrated normal
sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular
contractions.  Occasional ventricular premature beats were
noted.  There was low limb lead voltage.  Delayed R wave
transition.  The premature ventricular contractions were new
compared to the prior tracing.
