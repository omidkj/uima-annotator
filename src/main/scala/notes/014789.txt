HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status
post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and coronary
stent placement in [**2166-5-27**], CHF with an ejection fraction
of 33% in [**2166-6-27**], type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
chronic renal insufficiency, who presented on [**2168-9-9**] after
a syncopal episode.  She is status post recent admission
[**2168-5-27**] to [**2168-6-20**] for presyncope.

Patient reports that she was at a restaurant eating dinner,
got up from the table, and had a syncopal episode.  She was
caught by a male companion.  She denied any head trauma or
injury.  She did report having had low blood sugars in the
50s-60s over the last few days.  She denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, headache.  She denied
any lightheadedness, dizziness, vertigo.

She reports having had [**2-29**] syncopal episodes in the last
three months.  In the Emergency Department, heart rate was
48, blood pressure stable at 116/50, respiratory rate of 20.
Upon arrival, she still complained of residual
lightheadedness.  Upon further questioning, she reports an
episode of substernal chest pain earlier that morning,
relieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS, AND OTHER TESTS:  Complete
blood count showed WBC 9.9, hemoglobin 9.1, hematocrit 26.6,
MCV 85, platelet count 197.  Serum chemistry with a sodium of
130, potassium 5.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, BUN 53,
creatinine 1.9, glucose 272.  Liver function tests showed an
ALT of 22, AST 17, LDH 143, amylase 97, total bilirubin 0.3,
lipase 26, albumin 3.5.

Calcium 8.4, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 4.2, serum osmolality
302.  Cardiac enzymes showed CK 27, troponin T 0.04.
Urinalysis showed rare bacteria, otherwise negative.

EKG showed junctional bradycardia with ventricular rate at 48
beats per minute.  Left axis deviation.  T-wave inversions in
lead III, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression in leads I, V4 through V6.

Echocardiogram [**2166-6-27**] showed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 30-35%, E:A ratio 0.83.  Left atrium mildly
dilated.  Left ventricular cavity size normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with
anterior, septal, apical akinesis.  Aortic valve mildly
thickened.  1+ mitral regurgitation.  Left ventricular inflow
pattern suggestive of delayed relaxation.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Bradycardia:  On EKG, the patient had junctional
bradycardia, consistent with conduction disease.  It was felt
that the syncope was likely secondary to bradycardia due to
sinus node dysfunction.  She was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for further evaluation.

She underwent evaluation by the Electrophysiology fellow and
attending.  Was felt to be exhibiting signs of sinus node
dysfunction with A-V nodal conduction delay.  She is felt to
be a candidate for pacemaker placement.  Prior to pacemaker
placement, the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm
spontaneously with rates in the low to high 60s.

On [**2168-9-12**], she underwent permanent pacemaker placement in
the Electrophysiology Laboratory.  She underwent placement of
a [**Company 1543**] DDD dual chamber rate response pacemaker.  She
tolerated this procedure well without any complications.

She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit to the regular
medicine floor on [**2168-9-12**].  The following day the pacemaker
was interrogated by the Electrophysiology fellow, and was
felt to be functional.  She had no further cardiac events.

2. Chest pain.  Rule out MI:  Patient had an episode of
substernal chest pressure on the morning of admission.  She
also had evidence of new ST segment depressions, T-wave
inversions on admission EKG.  Therefore, she was continued on
aspirin.  It was felt that she was unable to tolerate beta
blocker therapy secondary to her conduction abnormalities and
junctional bradycardia.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled with
negative creatinine kinase and troponin-T values x3 cycles.
Followup EKG failed to show any further changes.

3. Chronic renal insufficiency:  On admission, the patient's
creatinine level was increased above her baseline.  This was
felt to be likely secondary to poor forwarded flow from her
junctional bradycardia.  Decision was made to hold off on ACE
inhibitor therapy secondary to her elevated potassium level,
poor renal function.  BUN and creatinine values were followed
closely to monitor for resolution of her azotemia.

She did have one episode of potassium value elevated to 6.9.
EKG was obtained, which demonstrated no evidence of widen QRS
complex or peaked T waves.  She was treated with Lasix 20 mg
IV, calcium gluconate 2 grams, Kayexalate 30 cc, 1 amp of
dextrose, insulin 10 units IV.  This brought her potassium
level down to 3.8.  As her heart rate reverted to normal
sinus rhythm with values in the high 60s, the patient's renal
function improved.

On the day of discharge, her creatinine valve was below her
previous baseline at 1.1.  ACE inhibitor therapy was
reinstituted, with discharge planning to closely follow her
future potassium levels.

4. Diabetes type 2:  Initially, the patient's oral diabetic
agents were held and she was covered with q.i.d. fingerstick
blood glucose testing and regular insulin-sliding scale.  On
[**2168-9-13**], her previous outpatient oral diabetic regimen was
reinstated.  She tolerated this well.

5. Hypothyroidism:  The patient's TSH level was increased at
5.6, but a free T4 level was 1.1.  Therefore, decision was
made to continue her outpatient dose of Levoxyl at 50 mcg
q.d.

6. Anemia:  Patient has a history of chronic anemia,
transfusion dependent q3 months.  Upon admission, her
hematocrit was decreased to 26.6.  She was therefore
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  She tolerated
this well.
