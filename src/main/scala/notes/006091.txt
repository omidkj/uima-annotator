Mr [**Known lastname 11257**] is a 70 year old male with a history of prostate

evidence of free intraperitoneal blood throughout the abdomen.

transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from the
[**Hospital 620**] Campus.

DIAGNOSIS:

1.     Liver tumor (A,B):
       a.  Extensive necrosis and hemorrhage.
        b.  Rare foci of atypical hepatic cells, suspicious for
hepatoma.
2.     Liver tumor (C-F):
        a.  Foci of hepatocellular carcinoma, mainly
well-differentiated.
        b.  Marked necrosis.
3.     Liver tumor (G-K):
        a.  Foci of hepatocellular carcinoma, mainly
well-differentiated.
        b.  Marked necrosis.
4.     Liver tumor (L):
        a.  Necrotic tissue.
        b.  No tumor identified.
5.     Wedge biopsy of anterior liver (M):
        a.  Minimal portal mononuclear cell inflammation (grade
0-1).
        b.  Trichrome stain:  Cirrhosis (stage 4).
        c.  Iron stain:  No stainable iron.
        d.  No tumor.
        e.  The features are consistent with chronic viral
hepatitis B.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, a chest tube was placed in Mr [**Known lastname 11257**] for a
possible left pneumothorax that occurred after placement of
subclavian cordis line. On HD2, He underwent angiography which
revealed evidence of active extravasation from a small
branch off the left hepatic artery. This was coil embolized by
interventional radiology successfully. After the interventional
procedure, it was noted that his abdomen was extremely tense,
consistent with an abdominal compartment syndrome. Because of
this, decompression was indicated. He was taken to the OR on
[**8-1**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6633**] for Exploratory laparotomy,
Evacuation of abdominal compartment syndrome and hematoma, and
Irrigation and abdominal silo placement. On [**8-2**], he was
intubated. He was transferred to the SICU. On [**8-3**], continued on
the vent; fentanyl was increased and propofol decreased, Fio2
decreased. He returned to the OR on [**8-4**] for abdominal washout
and wall closure performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**]. On [**8-5**] fentanyl drip
was dc'ed. He was on CPAP. Propofol was increased d/t increased
agitation. His  Hct, Plt, Cr, INR remained stable, but his
ALT/AST/BUN was slightly increased.
He was extubated on [**8-6**] with O2 sats of 93-95%. He was agitated
and was given Haldol for short effect and Fentanyl q1hour. After
suffering poor oxygenation, he was intubated; propofol was
resumed. On [**8-7**], he remained on AC and he failed propofol
weaning. Chest CT was done and ruled out metastasis. On [**8-8**],
ICU team continued to diurese with Lasix and continued to
attempt weaning off vent. After noting reddening of abdominal
wound with serosanguinous discharge, staples were removed from
wound. On [**8-9**], a vac dressing was placed on his abdominal
wound.
On [**8-10**], diuresis with lasix continued. He was also started on
tube feeds.
On [**8-11**], the chest tube was removed. He tolerated clear liquids
and began diuresing on his own. He was provided a 1:1 sitter at
bedside.
He was extubated on [**8-12**], and he was transferred to FA9.
On [**8-13**], he was started on regular diet, and TPN was tapered;
foley was removed. Overnight, he became agitated and was given
Haldol and Ativan.
On [**8-14**], the CVC was dc'ed, and peripheral IV access was
obtained. His IV was hep-locked, and he was placed on 1.5L fluid
restriction. His vac dressing was removed and fascia was
assessed and intact. He was placed back on the vac on [**8-15**] after
draining ascitic fluid continued to soak the dressing. On [**8-16**],
he was seen by Hepatology for evaluation for possible liver
transplant. He was deemed not suitable for liver transplantation
due to prior hx/o prostate ca and Hep B cirrhosis and size of
liver lesions. He was subsequently placed on Aldactone 50mg and
Lasix 20mg.
