Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
A 68-year-old woman with a history of recurrent B-cell lymphoma,
who is currently being treated on Protocol #08-164, A Phase 1/2a
Open-label study of Praltrexate and Gemcitabine and Vitamin B12
and Folic acid Supplementation in Patients with Relapsed or
Refractory Lymphoproliferative Malignancies who received her
C2D15 treatment on [**2119-1-23**]. She now presents to the ED with
fever to 101 at home, without specific associated symptoms other
than a mild bifrontal headache that has since resolved and some
shoulder blader pain which she always has with her chemotherapy.
No neck stiffness, photophobia, naucea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
cough, dysuria or rash. In ED vitals were stable but she had a
temp of 100.1. Physical exam revealed no focal source of
infection. Labs revealed a borderline low wcc of 3.6. She's
cultured and started on vanc and ceftriaxone and admitted for
further care.
.
Onc history:
68-year-old woman with a history of recurrent non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, who was diagnosed in [**12/2116**] and received six cycles of
R-[**Hospital1 **] with her last cycle on [**2117-4-19**]. She had a motor vehicle
accident in [**7-/2117**] with extensive injuries including C2
fracture. Following recovery, she received one cycle of
maintenance rituximab in [**10/2117**] with a followup PET scan in
[**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy with biopsy consistent with
her known lymphoma. She then received two cycles of ICE
chemotherapy on [**2118-2-22**] and [**2118-3-23**] with resolution of her
FDG-avid adenopathy. She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem
cell mobilization and collections on [**2118-4-22**] followed by an
autologous stem cell transplant with induction chemotherapy with

a BEAM regimen starting on [**2118-5-19**].
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a restaging PET scan on [**2118-11-11**] which

unfortunately showed interval development of a single 21.7 mm
focus of prevascular adenopathy. Given that Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] has a
history of agressive lymphoma and clonal T cell process along
with connective tissue disease that can cause benign adenopathy,
we arranged for a CT guided biopsy on [**2118-11-22**]. The biopsy
results showed high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and
polymorphic T cell dominant lymphoid population that raised the
possibility of concurrent T cell lymphoma. She was started on a
research protocol treatment with Pralatrexate and Genticitabine
and received her first cycle on [**2118-12-12**].

TTE [**2119-1-25**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-5-16**] the
amount of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have increased
slightly.
.
CXR [**2119-1-25**]:
A right subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.
Mildly increased interstitial markings at the right lung base
are nonspecific. There is no consolidation or pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax. The heart is now slightly enlarged
compared to prior
exams. There is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement. The known
prevascular
mediastinal mass is only appreciated with the benefit of prior
CT. Mildly
tortuous aorta is again seen. The pulmonary vascularity is
normal.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific interstitial markings at the right lung
base.
Recommend oblique radiographs to assess the right middle lobe.
.
[**2119-1-27**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Persistent right lower lobe pneumonia with new atelectasis in
the left lower lobe.
.
[**2119-1-27**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower
extremity.
.
[**2119-1-28**] CTA Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.

2. Bilateral, right greater than left, small-to-moderate pleural
effusions
with associated relaxation atelectasis are new. No new focal
pulmonary
consolidation is identified.
3. Increase in mediastinal adenopathy, with a new enlargement of
pretracheal and right hilar lymph nodes compared to [**2118-11-1**].




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 103705**] is a 68 year old female with NHL, s/p Pralatrexate
and Gemcitabine, A fib on multiple nodal agents who was admitted
for fever and right shoulder blade pain then transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with pleuritic chest pain/hypoxia and bradycardia, then
bacl on the floor, treated for pneumonia.
.
# Bradycardia: Pt became bardycardic into 30s the morning after
admission.  This was likely secondary to over-medication with
home Metoprolol, Diltiazem and Digoxin. Digoxin level was
elevated at 3.2. Patient remained normotensive and asymptomatic.
All nodal agents were held initially and then Metoprolol (h
