History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57yo woman with RCC metastatic to lungs with recent
progression of disease in the area of the right mainstem
bronchus, s/p mechanical debridement of endobronchial exophytic
lesion, now being transferred from [**Hospital6 15083**] with
SOB. She has a h/o recurrent pleural effusions and has baseline
DOE. She was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 17949**] with dyspnea at rest,
cough, and chest pressure, and was found to have a pericardial
effusion with tamponade physiology. She required
pericardiocentesis and [**Date range (1) 19843**] placement with improvement, and
chemotherapy was restarted prior to discharge.

Yesterday, she was experiencing worsening of her respiratory
distress, so she was taken to [**Hospital6 15083**] ED and was
admitted. Labs were unremarkable including a negative troponin,
although BNP was elevatd at 361. Her dyspnea was thought to be
multifactorial, related to pleural effusion, atelectasis,
pericardial effusion, and pulmonary masses. TTE showed a
moderate pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance.
V/Q scan was low to intermediate probability for pulmonary
embolus, and CXR and CT revealed progression of large soft
tissue mass with atelectasis and increased loculated right
pleural effusion. She is transferred here for further care.

Currently, her breathing is somewhat improved. She endorses
chest congestion and cough that is sometimes productive of a
yellow sputum. She also endorses occasional wheezing. Denies
chest pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting, but endorses nausea.
She feels very tired, but generally feels improved since
restarting her Sutent a few days ago.

ROS: Appetite is poor, and she has a headache that is less
severe than a migraine. Reports weight loss over the last six
months. No fevers, chills, palpitations, dysuria, rashes,
arthralgias, myalgias. Otherwise negative in complete detail.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**9-/2151**] CT scan showed  Large left renal mass. MRI/MRV
demonstrated a large 7.5 cm left lower pole mass, with no
filling
defect of the left renal vein. Bone scan negative for osseous
metastases.
- [**2151-10-13**]: Left nephrectomy/adrenalectomy. Pathology: 5.5 cm
mass, extending locally beyond the capsule, [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade II to
III, not extending beyond Gerota's fascia. Venous invasion was
present; the renal vein margin was negative. There were negative
margins and negative adrenal glands. (pT3a Nx Mx)
- [**2154-2-8**]:  A CT scan demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary
nodules, the largest 7 mm in diameter.
- [**2154-3-4**] PET scan: Multiple pulmonary nodules and posterior
cervical lymphadenopathy.
- [**2154-4-5**]: Video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobe and
right middle lobe wedge resections and mediastinal lymph node
dissection. Pathology confirmed the presence of metastatic
carcinoma of renal origin in the two wedge resections and in the
level 8R paraesophageal lymph node.
- [**2154-8-26**]:  Cycle 1, Weeks [**12-18**] of high-dose IL-2 ([**11-29**] and
[**4-29**] doses received).
- [**2154-10-14**] CT scan: Increase in the size of a right
infra-hilar
lymph node. Decrease in size of numerous small pulmonary
nodules.
- [**2154-11-11**] CT scan:  Right hilar lymph node slightly increased
in
size. Stable tiny pulmonary nodules as well as nodular scarring
in the right lower lobe.
- [**2154-12-18**] CT torso showed slight increase in dominant right
infrahilar mass when measured in the axial plane compared to the
prior two exams.
- [**2155-1-2**]: Flexible bronchoscopy revealed extrinsic
compression, with near complete occlusion of the
anterior segment of the right lower lobe bronchus and mucoid
secretions emanating from the superior segment of the right
lower
lobe.  Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed x3 with
pathology revealing atypical clusters of epithelioid cells
suspicious for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  In addition,
bronchial washings and brushings were obtained, revealing
atypical cells in scattered clusters.
- [**2155-1-29**]:  Flexible bronchoscopy and video-assisted thoracic
surgery with right lower lobe wedge resection and intralobar
pulmonary artery lymph node excision.  Pathology revealed lymph
node fragments with metastatic carcinoma consistent with renal
cell carcinoma.  The excised fragment of the right lower lobe
demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
- [**3-/2155**]: Cycle 2, Weeks [**12-18**] high-dose IL-2 ([**8-30**] and [**4-29**] doses
received)
- [**2155-9-8**] - [**2156-5-24**]: Multiple CT Torso showing gradual
growth of right hilar lymphadenopathy.
- [**2156-7-19**]: Began therapy with MDX 1411 on Phase I protocol 08-209
- [**2156-10-18**]: Began palliative sunitinib after scans showed disease
progression with MDX 1411; needed to terminate first cycle one
week early due to severe thrombocytopenia (platelets 27k). Began
cycle 2 on [**2156-11-29**] at reduced dose of 37.5 mg daily. Began
cycle
3 on [**2157-1-10**] at 25 mg daily.
- [**2157-3-19**]: Switched to pazopanib because of progressive
difficulties tolerating sunitinib (and progressing disease on
lower doses of sunitinib); dose reduced to 600 mg daily due to
side effect. On [**6-8**] pazopanib dose was increased to 800 mg
daily
considering worsening clinical symptoms.
- [**2157-7-25**] CT TORSO shows overall improvement of pulmonary
nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy
- [**2157-9-8**] CT TORSO shows disease progression
- [**2157-9-12**] bronchoscopy showed tumor infiltration of the
endobronchial mucosa throughout the right main stem and bronchus
intermedius.  Endobronchial exophytic lesion partially
obstructing the opening of the right main stem, which was
mechanically debrided.
- [**0-0-**] external beam radiation to the lesion in
the R hilum.  [**0-0-**] additional palliative XRT
- [**2158-9-16**] everolimus
- [**2157-12-7**] - [**2158-3-27**] Avastin, d/c due to worsening symptoms
- [**2158-3-30**] CT torso shows disease progression
- [**4-18**] start Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 D1 and D8 q21d, [**4-20**] start
Sutent 25 mg 2 weeks ON 1 week OFF
- [**7-3**] - Progression of pulmonary disease on gemcitabine/sutent,
but patient experiencing symptomatic improvement.
- [**7-10**] - C4D1 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-7-24**] - C4D15 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-8-9**] - Rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement
- [**2158-8-14**] - C5D15 gemzar/sutent
- [**2158-8-28**] - C6D1
