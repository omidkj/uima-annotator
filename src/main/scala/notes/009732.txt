History of Present Illness:
74 y.o. Female w/ COPD on baseline 3L O2, HL, DM II, HTN,
Schizoaffective d.o., TD, depression p/w hyperglycemia, acute
exacerbation of chronic cough. Admitted to ICU for subjective
dyspnea relieved with BiPAP.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 10794**] states over the past few days she has been very
concerned about her blood sugars being in the 500s. She denies
any recent change in her diet or diabetes medications but does
endorse a worsening of her chronic cough. She has had a dry
cough for several months however she feels her is now more
frequent. She also endorses chronic rhinorrhea which appears to
unchanged. She denies any sick contacts, sore throats, fevers,
chills. She does endorse some DOE which is worse than her
baseline, she lives on the [**Location (un) **] and can climb 10 steps with
only 3 stops to rest. Currently she feels she would need to stop
a lot more frequently. She is not able to increase her home O2
so she has been on 3L this whole time. She usually does not
leave her apartment, a caregiver comes into her house and
cooks/cleans for her.
.
On [**5-18**] the pt and pt's daughter called [**Name (NI) 191**] regarding her high
bld sugars and increase in dry cough. She recently d/c'd Spiriva
as she was experiencing a rash with it. She was also noted to
have elevated CBGs and was asked to increase her Lantus to
13unit, Metformin to 1gm daily and asked to make an episodic
appointment.
.
In the ED her initial VS were noted to be T99.6, BP 143/76, RR
24, Sat 100% on 15L initially. Per ED signout though she was
noted to be using accessory muscles, tachypneic to the mid 20s.
She was given several rounds of nebs with no improvement
objectively and subjectively. ABG on 2L of nc showed pCO2 40,
pO2 119, pH 7.40. As she felt dyspneic and appeared to have
increased work of breathing on examination she was placed on
BiPAP 5/5, FiO2 30%. Her last set of VS prior to transfer was T
98, HR 101, BP 144/64, 26, 98% on 2L.
.
upon transfer to the unit she was on 2L nasal cannula and felt
she was doing a lot better.
.
Of note Ms. [**Known lastname 10794**] has been hospitalized twice over the past
month. She was discharged on [**5-10**] for hyperglycemia, she was
seen by [**Last Name (un) **] and d/c'd on Metformin and Glargine. She was also
hospitalized [**Date range (1) 97408**] for RUE swelling of unclear etiology.
She was noted to be wheezing during that admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y.o. Female w/ COPD on baseline 3L O2, HL, DM II, HTN,
Schizoaffective d.o., TD, depression p/w hyperglycemia, acute
exacerbation of chronic cough, hyponatremia. Admitted to ICU for
subjective dyspnea relieved with BiPAP.

##. COPD Exacerbation: Pt presented to the ED with sensation of
air hunger and dyspnea, in the [**Name (NI) **] pt appeared to be using
accessory muscles despite Methylprednisolone 125mg, several
rounds of nebulizers. Her ABG on 2L did show excellent pO2, and
the patient felt more comfortable, remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint and did not require Bipap.  On review of
CXR 2 view there was no evidence of PNA. It is possible given
the increase in chronic cough, hyperglycemia that perhaps a
viral syndrome could have preceeded her symptoms vs d/c of
spiriva. She underwent an echo which showed moderate pulmonary
edema. She was given prednisone 60 mg po x 3 days then 40 mg po
x2 days and was discharged home with a presciption for
prednisone 20 mg po daily x 5 more days. She will have PFTs done
as an outpatient and will follow-up with the [**Hospital 2182**] clinic. She
should consider outpatient pulmonary rehabilation for her COPD.

##. Hyperglycemia: Pt noted to have elevated CBGs to 500 at
home. This may have been due to infection given pt's report of
diet and medication adherence. She also has a caregiver who does
all the preparation of meals. Per [**Company 191**] callback she was told to
increase her Lantus Glargine to 13u, Metformin to 1gm. Blood
glucose in the ICU/ED have been in the 200s.  She was continued
on her home Glargine in the ICU and Metformin was held in the
ICU for potential contrast. On transfer to the floor, patient's
blood sugars remained high, likely related to prednison.
Patient was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult service. She was
discharged home on glargine 35 units at bedtime and humalog 15
units with meals as well as additional sliding scale.  Patient
was not taking aspirin and this medication should be considered.
She was discharged with close follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **].

##. Hyponatremia: Pt noted to be hyponatremic in the ED to 125
mentating well. Un
