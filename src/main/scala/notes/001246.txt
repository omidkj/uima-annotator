Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71 yo Cantonese and Spanish speaking male with metastatic
pancreatic cancer was admitted from the ED with dyspnea, altered
mental status, and hyponatremia. History was obtained from
patient's son and [**Name (NI) **] as patient could not give complete
history.
.
Patient was recently admitted to the OMED service 4/22-24/09
with tachycardia and hypotension thought related to dehydration.
He was given IVF and 2 units pRBCs with improvement in his blood
pressure and heart rate. He was also treated with a 7-day course
of levofloxacin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. [**Name (NI) 1094**]
son reports that his cough improved, but he gradually developed
increasing lower extremity edema and abdominal swelling.
Associated symptoms include worsening mental status and fatigue.
On review of systems, he denies fevers, shaking chills, night
sweats, abdominal pain, back pain, chest pain, and sick
contacts.
.
Of note, during his last admission, palliative care was
consulted for assistance with goals of care. Although the
patient has refused palliative chemotherapy and XRT, he has not
further discussed or re-addressed code status. He remains full
code.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 98.4, HR 100, BP 122/70, and pulse
ox 97% on 2L. His exam was notable for increased edema and
ascites. His labs were notable for hyponatremia with a sodium of
103, elevated lactate to 6.6, and hyperkalemia to 5.5. He
received 1L IVF, vancomycin 1 g IV x 1, and zosyn 4.5g IV x 1.

[**2189-3-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes are nonspecific,
Since previous tracing of [**2189-3-18**], T wave flattening noted.

[**2189-3-29**] CXR: Increasing left effusion/consolidation. Please refer
to CT
abd/pelvis performed subsequently for further details.
.
[**2189-3-29**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
- Marked interval progression of metastatic disease as detailed
above with increased disease burden in the pancreas, liver and
diffuse implants in the abdomen. Please see above for details.
- Stable multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys.
- Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate, left greater than
right.
- Minimal ascites. Moderate anasarca.
- Small nonobstructing bilateral renal calculi.

[**2189-3-29**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process. MR is more
sensitive in the
detection of small masses.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo man with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was
admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
.
# Hyponatremia: Profound hyponatremia likely etiology of altered
mental status with improvement in lethargy with cautious
correction. Pt initially on hypertonic saline as thought to have
component from dehydration. However, per renal assessment,
appears to have baseline mild SIADH exacerbated by excessive po
fluid intake at home due to diagnosis of dehydration given at
last admission. Pt placed on 800cc to 1L fluid restriction with
improvement to likely baseline of 126-128.
.
# Hypotension: Per Renal, likely new baseline in setting of
progressive chronic disease. Ddx hypovolemia given tachycardia
but little response to fluid boluses. Initial concern of
hypoperfusion given elevated lactate but persistence of lactate
likely [**12-29**] to malignancy.
.
# Dyspnea: Infiltrate on CXR initially treated as HAP with vanco
and zosyn. Switched to cefpodoxime prior to discharge as MRSA
screen negative and pseudomonas unlikely given clinical picture.
Legionella negative. Rapid respiratory viral Ag test negative.
Prior to discharge, switched to cefpodoxime as MRSA screen
negative and low clinical suspicion for pseudomonas pneumonia.
Plan to complete 8-day today course of antibiotics, last dose on
[**2189-4-6**]. Small bilateral effusions on imaging (ddx parapneumonic
v. malignancy) may also have contributed to dyspnea.
.
# Bandemia: Likely [**12-29**] pneumonia, stable to mildly improved. No
other localizing sx. Urine cultures negative with no growth on
blood cultures to date. C. diff toxin test ordered but no sample
sent; unlikely etiology.
.
# Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac
positive stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and
it is unclear if he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer.
In light of guiac positive stools, held off on any
anticoagulation at this time.
.
# Splenic Vein Thrombosis
Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if
this represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor
invasion. Family made aware of diagnosis, but anticoagulation
held as pt is poor candidate given his poor PO intake, multiple
comorbidities, and reported allergy to coumadin.
.
# Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low
albumin. [**Month (only) 116**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on
prior echo. [**Month (only) 116**] also have third-spacing [**12-29**] hyponatremia.
Nephrotic syndrome unlikely given U/A. ? of new ascites which is
likely related to his increased metastatic disease. Started on
high protein diet.
.
# Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT
abdomen/pelvis. Of note, OB positive stool seen in the setting
of known GI malignancy but with relatively stable Hct. He has
been offered palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment,
which he has declined. Family meeting was held with palliative
care and oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] present. Decision made to discharge
pt home with hospice but to remain full code given hope of
seeing son who will be arriving fr
