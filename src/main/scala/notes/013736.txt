Imaging:
[**2116-8-8**] CXR:  Dense consolidation within the left lower lobe
consistent with aspiration versus pneumonia.
.
[**2116-7-3**] Chest CT:
1. Slight interval increase in size of 1.9 x 1.6 cm right mid
lung nodular opacity, containing both solid and ground-glass
components as described, which is highly concerning for
recurrent bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
2. New anterior right mid lung tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning
for
aspiration or infection. Given mild hiatal hernia, and distal
esophageal thickening, with right basilar bronchiectatic change,
this could represent chronic aspiration.
.
[**2116-7-13**] Spirometry: FEV1/FVC 58, There is an obstructive
ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC suggests a coexisting
restrictive ventilatory defect which is confirmed by the reduced
TLC measured on [**2103-3-7**]. Compared to the prior study of
[**2116-2-10**] there has been no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with an aspiration pneumonia, with a left
lower lobe infiltrate seen on CXR. He was initially admitted to
the ICU where he was given levofloxacin and cefepime. He also
received one dose of steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation
while in the emergency room, and this was discontinued. His
fever curve improved, and he was switched to levofloxacin alone
to complete a total 10 day course as an outpatient. On day of
discharge, he had a leukocytosis, which was improving, and
thought from the high dose steroids received in the emergency
room, which needs to be followed up with a repeat CBC as an
outpatient. His ambulatory oxygen saturation was 88%, and he was
95% on RA at rest. He was continued on his home inhalers.

He was also noted to have acute renal failure, thought to be
from both prerenal azotemia and recent indomethacin use. He was
advised to hold indomethacin and colchicine. His creatinine
returned to baseline at day of discharge.

He was also noted to have an anemia with a hematocrit of 33,
which was stable. He did not have any signs of bleeding. He will
need to have this repeated as an outpatient as well. It is
likely anemia of chronic disease.

For his history of alcohol abuse, he was placed on a CIWA scale,
and was given a multivitamin, thiamine, and folate. He was
counseled on alcohol cessation.

An appointment with his PCP was made. He will need to have a CBC
checked at this time.
