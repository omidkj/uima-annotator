The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented to the Cath
Lab for an elective cardiac catheterization.  He has a
history of recurrent chest pain and was referred to the [**Hospital3 **] Cardiac Cath Lab by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  Other than
recurrent chest pain over the last several weeks he had no
further symptoms.  He states that his last cath was in [**2115**],
and at that time, he has had only occasional chest pain
usually occurring at night after being out drinking and would
easily respond to nitroglycerin.  He has not noticed any
exertional or rest angina, although when he was on a cruise
several weeks prior to admission, there were several days
where he awoke with mild chest discomfort.  It did not
resolve with nitroglycerin.  He was seen by the ship doctor
who told him that his EKG was within normal.  Upon returning
back home from his cruise, he had daily mild anginal symptoms
and was therefore referred for catheterization by his local
cardiologist.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease status post cardiac bypass surgery x2.  He also has a
history of hyperlipidemia and status post appendectomy as
well as a history of high cholesterol.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2. Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
3. Prilosec 20 mg q.d.
4. Lipitor 40 mg q.h.s.
5. Norvasc 5 mg q.h.s.
6. Nitro paste 0.2 mg per hour during the day, off at night.
7. Valium p.r.n.


ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial examination revealed normal
vital signs as well as an unremarkable physical exam.  Lungs
were clear.  Cardiac, S1 and S2 were normal.  No obvious
murmurs.  No peripheral edema.  Neurologically intact.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He denies any
history of IV drug use, former tobacco, rare alcohol.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 58-year-old man referred for cardiac
catheterization on [**2119-4-13**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac.  The patient presented to the Cath
Lab on the morning of [**2119-4-13**].  He was taken for cardiac
cath.  Diagnostic catheterization revealed native vessel
coronary disease similar to his previous.  He also was found
to have a thrombus in his SVG to RCA that was initially
treated successfully with angioplasty and stenting.  However,
several minutes after achieving an open SVG to RCA graft, he
had an acute closure, which resulted in a cardiac arrest with
a ventricular fibrillation arrest.  Despite 45 minutes of
CPR, he was unable to restore a native rhythm.  Cardiac
Surgery was consulted and initiation of ECMO occurred, which
was initiated in the Cath Lab with eventual re-flow in the
SVG graft.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the
CSRU.  Unfortunately, the patient became progressively
edematous and poor flow through the ECMO despite
repositioning as well as bilateral chest tubes.  The patient
also developed increasing abdominal distension suggestive of
an catastrophic intra-abdominal event.  Poor prognosis was
related to the family members and decision was made to
withdraw measures and the patient passed away.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Cardiac arrest secondary to acute closure of
the SVG to RCA graft.

TIME OF DEATH:  [**2119-4-13**] at 4:50 p.m.

Postmortem was declined by the family.  Medical examiner was
notified and the case was declined as well.
