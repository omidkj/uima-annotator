Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
COPD exacerbation, s/p Y-stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Y stent ploaced
endotracheal intubation
central line placed

History of Present Illness:
54M with h/o severe COPD, recurrent tracheobronchomalacia s/p
tracheoplasty and revision ([**11-21**] and [**3-21**]) and multiple stent
placements, who was admitted from the PACU s/p Y-stent placement
with suspected COPD exacerbation. Patient is sedated, so this
history was obtained from the IP staff and the patient's wife.
[**Name (NI) **] has had increasing exertional dyspnea over the last few
months. He has had some associated cough, non-productive. He has
had no fever or chills. He underwent bronchoscopy on [**1-14**], which
showed severe malacia of the cervical as well as intrathoracic
trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi. He was admitted
electively today for Y-stent placement by IP. His Y-stent was
placed without complication. He was extubated in the PACU, with
subsequent development of bronchospasm resistant to nebulized
bronchodilators. His ABG showed significant CO2 retention and
acidemia, and he was reintubated and sedated with propofol. IP
then performed flexible bronchoscopy through the ETT and the
stent was found to be well-seated and without obstruction. He
was given Solumedrol 125mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV, and
aggressive Combivent MDIs. He was transferred to the MICU for
continued management of COPD exacerbation.
.
Currently, he is sedated and unable to answer further questions

studies on admission:
[**2178-1-23**] EKG- poor baseline, sinus tachycardia at 129bpm, normal
axis, borderline long QT, poor R wave progression, no obvious
ST/T changes to suggest ischemia
.
[**2178-1-23**] CXR- The endotracheal tube is identified with tip
approximately 5 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal in appearance. The left costophrenic angle
is not included in this study. Blunting of the right
costophrenic angle suggests small right pleural effusion. No
signs of congestion or opacities to suggest pneumonia. Paucity
of peripheral vasculature is suggestive of COPD. There is a
displaced posterior right fourth rib fracture which appears old.

.
[**1-31**] CT chest: 1.  Interval development of right middle lobe and
right lower lobe and minimally left lower lobe tree- in- [**Male First Name (un) 239**]
and reticular interstitial opacities consistent with small
airways disease, as may be seen in viral, atypical, or
mycobacterial infections.
2.  Severe emphysema and right upper lobe postsurgical changes.
.
[**2-7**] RUQ US: 1: Coarsened texture and increased echogenicity of
liver likely represents fatty infiltration, however other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease, including
significant fibrosis/chrosis, cannot be excluded on this study.
2: Biliary sludge.
.
[**2-5**] CT head: Small hypodensities of the left internal capsule
and external capsule which likely represent chronic lacunar
infarcts.  Minimal amount of small vessel chronic infarction
elsewhere, as noted above.  Further evaluation with MRI could be
obtained to assess for acute infarcts, which may be difficult to
detect with CT.
.
[**2178-2-11**] CXR: Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm and is out
of view.
Interval development of small left pleural effusion and left
basal
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60153**] is a 54yo man with severe COPD (FEV1 0.64) and
tracheobronchomalacia, who was initially admitted to the MICU on
[**2178-1-23**] with respiratory failure after tracheal Y-stent
placement.
.
# Respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation: After the
Y stent was placed the patient had significant bronchospasm on
exam in the PACU, believed to be due to severe COPD
exacerbation. Repeat bronchoscopy at that time showed the Y
stent was in good position. CXR was not remarkable for any new
changes.  The patient was intubated and sent to the ICU.  Repeat
bronchoscopy revealed purulent sputum consistent with
tracheobronchitis. The patient was started on vancomycin and
zosyn treatment.  The patient was extubated, but quickly failed
this largely due to anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension and
tachypnea, and was quickly re-intubated.  The paln was to
optimize his other hemodynamic parameters prior to re-attempting
extubation.  He was aggressively diuresed with lasix and
responded well. His blood pressure and heart rate were
controlled with beta blockade, verapamil and ace inhibitors.  He
continued antibiotic therapy but worsening of secretions
prevented extubation for some time.  His anxiety was eventually
controlled with standing clonazepam as well as prn haldol.  The
patient was difficult to awaken from sedation and took several
days to become responsive. This was in the setting of elevated
liver function tests and elevated ammonia. He was started on
lactulose TID and zosyn was stopped on [**2-8**] as it can cause
transaminitis and his course was nearly completed. CT head was
unremarkable and after 2-3 days the patient awakened off
sedation and became responsive to questions.
     He was extubated to biPAP on [**2178-2-9**] and was quickly weaned
to oxygen by nasal cannula without problem.  His goal O2
saturation is approximately 90-92% given the severity of his
COPD and he was able to maintain this on nasal cannula. He was
treated with nebulizers as well as guafenesin liquid standing.
Ideally he should be on mucinex tabs 1200mg po bid, however this
cannot be crushed so we substituted with Mucinex.  He was given
aggressive chest PT and used a mechanical in-exsufflator three
times daily, which should be continued at rehab.
     He was initially on high dose IV steroids, but is currently
in the course of a prednisone taper. His current dose is 30mg po
daily and
