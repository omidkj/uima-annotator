History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 72 year old woman with history of CVA x 2 (no
residual defecits), COPD on 2L O2 at home, who presents from her
[**Hospital3 **] with altered mental status, respiratory
failure/pneumonia/copd exacerbation, dehydration/acute renal
failure.
On day of presentation, she was reportedly found in bed in her
apartment, EMS reported her to be awake, but confused. Her cat
was found deceased in the apartment. Pt reported not eating for
days and was unsure how long she had been in bed. An empty
bottle of [**Hospital3 20746**] was found by the bed, pt reported only taking
the prescribed amount. She was noted to be tachycardic and
tachypneic.
On arrival to ED, initial VS: [**Age over 90 **]F 151/64 119 48 100% 4L. There
was note that she reported shortness of breath with a congested
cough. Nursing notes record purulent nasal secretions. She
desatted to 80s on 4L, no improvement on NRB and was
subsequently intubated. Her labs were notable for a polycythemia
with Hct of 60.9, lactate 3.4, BUN 37, Cr 1.1, LDH 756, Ca [**86**].3.
Troponin negative. UA and serum tox negative. ECG with no
ischemic changes. CXR showed LLL infiltrate, bullous disease.
CTA showed small LLL PNA, 2.1cm left lung nodule, no PE,
extensive bullous disease. She was given 2L NS, ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin, solumedrol and nebs and transfered to the ICU for
further management of her respiratory failure.
In ICU, patient initially remained intubated, was treated with
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, standing nebulizers, solumedrol
transitioned to prednisone to treat pneumonia/COPD flare. She
was continued on IV fluids with resolution of her polycythemia,
hypercalcemia, acute renal failure. Her ICU course was also
notable for mild hypernatremia attributed to her dehydration
status.
With above measures, patient was successfully extubated and
weaned to her home O2 requirement of 2L via nasal cannula. She
is now called out to the regular medical floor.
Currently pt complains of continued cough, some shortness of
breath, and diarrhea. Denies chest pain/pressure, palpitations,
abdominal pain, fevers/chills, night sweats. ROS also positive
for weight loss.

Imaging Studies:

CT Head ([**6-9**]):
No acute intracranial process. Sequelae of remote left frontal
infarction are noted. Fluid in the sinuses, nasopharynx and
oropharynx may be related to the intubation.

CXR ([**6-9**]):
Bullous emphysema with left lower lobe pneumonia. A repeat PA
and lateral view of the chest is recommended to further evaluate
the right basilar lucency which most likely represents a large
bulla. Leftward superior tracheal deviation which may in part be
positional. This may be further assessed on a repeat AP view of
the chest.

CTA Chest ([**6-9**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
2. Nodule at the lingula as detailed above. Recommend comparison
with prior imaging of the chest if available, and in its
absence, this finding needs clinical correlation for possible
malignancy and close 3 month followup.
3. Small collection of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and ground-glass opacity on
the left may represent an infectious process in the appropriate
clinical context.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 72 yo woman with history of emphysema/COPD and prior CVAs
found down, hypoxic, tachycardic and confused.

# Respiratory failure
Felt to be due to pneumonia versus COPD flare. She was intubated
in the ED, treated with high dose steroids, standing nebs, and
started on antibiotics for treatment of HAP (intially
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, then switched to ceftriaxone and
azithromycin). CTA showed LLL infiltrate but no PE. On the first
hospital day, she was extubated to BiPAP, then weaned to nasal
cannula on the second hospital day without complication. Serial
ABGs showed adequate oxygenation with slight hypercarbia, likely
due to underlying COPD. Sputum, urine and blood cultures were
negative. She completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and
completed [**7-10**] day course of ceftriaxone.  She was treated with a
72-hr course if IV methylprednisolone, followed by [**5-8**] day
course of prednisone 60mg, to be followed by an extended steroid
taper for COPD exacerabation.  Sputum cu
