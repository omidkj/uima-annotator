No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness, speech difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-8-10**] Cerebral angiography with mechanical thrombectomy and
intra-arterial tPA administration
[**2118-8-19**] PEG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 87 year-old M without known medical history who
presented with acute onset L-sided hemiparesis, disorientation,
garbled speech. the patient was apparently playing golf when at
10:30am he was seen driving his cart into a utility box after
which he slumped over the steering wheel. The accident was
apparently minor and he was not ejected from the vehicle. He was
found to be generally unintelligeable, disoriented with garbled
speech and transfered to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital. CT head/neck at
that time was negative for fracture or acute hemorrhage.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he exhibited aphasia without spontaneous
movement on the R side of his body. His NIHSS was 19. He
underwent CT-A and CTP which showed dense L MCA occlusion with
large L-sided perfusion defect on CTP.

Given the time course, >4.5 hrs since last known well, tPA was
not given however, interventional neuroradiology was contact[**Name (NI) **]
for possible [**Name (NI) **] clot removal after cerebral angio.

Pertinent Results:
[**8-10**] CTP - IMPRESSION:
1. Complete occlusion of the distal M1 segment of the left MCA
with
significant prolongation of the mean transit time throughout
virtually the
entire left MCA territory. A near-complete geographic match in
blood volume reduction suggests large "infarct core" with only
marginal "ischemic penumbra."
2. No definite correlate of the infarct on the non-enhanced CT,
suggesting a relatively hyperacute time course.
3. No evidence of hemorrhage.
4. Extensive atherosclerosis with stensoses involving both the
anterior and posterior intracranial circulation and the cervical
vessels, as detailed above.

[**8-10**] CT Abd/Pelv
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with septal thickening and
increased
interstitial markings. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules
measuring up to 5 mm. Correlation with prior malignant history
is recommended. A repeat chest CT may be obtained after diuresis
for further evaluation.
2. No evidence of acute visceral injury in the abdomen or
pelvis.
3. Large hiatal hernia with a focal nodularity which may
represent a fold but underlying lesion not excluded. Correlation
with direct visualization in a non-emergent setting or with any
recent endoscopy is suggested.
4. 1.6 x 0.9 cm filling defect in the left posterior portion of
the bladder, which may represent a mass versus clot. Urology
consultation advised.
5. 1.7 x 1.3 cm focus in the left thyroid lobe. Further
evaluation with
ultrasound is recommended in a non-emergent setting.

[**8-10**] CT Chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with septal thickening and
increased
interstitial markings. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules
measuring up to 5
mm. Correlation with prior malignant history is recommended. A
repeat chest
CT may be obtained after diuresis for further evaluation.
2. No evidence of acute visceral injury in the abdomen or
pelvis.
3. Large hiatal hernia with a focal nodularity which may
represent a fold but
underlying lesion not excluded. Correlation with direct
visualization in a
non-emergent setting or with any recent endoscopy is suggested.
4. 1.6 x 0.9 cm filling defect in the left posterior portion of
the bladder,
which may represent a mass versus clot. Urology consultation
advised.
5. 1.7 x 1.3 cm focus in the left thyroid lobe. Further
evaluation with
ultrasound is recommended in a non-emergent setting.

[**8-11**] TTE
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate
([**12-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No structural cardiac
source of embolism seen. The patient appears to be in atrial
fibrillation. Left ventricular systolic function is probably
normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Mild
to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation with moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

[**8-11**] NCHCT
IMPRESSION:
1. New foci of hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia and
scattered
subarachnoid hemorrhage- left frontal and parietal and a small
focus in the right parietal lobe.Consider close follow up to
assess interval change and exclude the possibility of contrast
enhancement related to prior contrast studies.
2. New or increasing hypodensities seen in the left caudate,
