Physical Exam:
VS - 95.7(ax) 108  131/85  17  100@ 3LNC
Gen - confused, agitated, patient extremely uncooperative with
exam.  Flailing and contracting.
HEENT -  dry MM
Neck - supple, + cervical LAD
Cor - tachy, no murmurs
Chest - clear but poor airmovement and moaning
Abd - tender to palpation, + BS, no rebound, no guarding
Ext - no edema, R heel with decub ulcer, decub on coccyx and
breakdown of skin around labia.
Neuro - L hemiparesis, unable to eval pupils because patient is
clamping eyes down.  seems to be neglecting L side.
.


Pertinent Results:
Reports:
EKG: sinus tach 120 NA/NI, peaked T's V2-4 with <1mm ST elev
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
1.  Bilateral pneumonia, in a pattern suggesting aspiration.
(tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**])
2.  Multiple small abscesses in musculature of pelvis.
3.  Hypoenhancing pancreatic tail, without focal fluid
collection.  Evidence of background chronic pancreatitis, with
diffuse pancreatic calcifications and dilation of pancreatic
duct to 4 mm.
.
CT Head:
1.  Left mastoid air cell opacification, indicating probable
mastoiditis.
2.  Limited study, but no gross intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR: Unresolving left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity.  Given
stability of findings dating back to [**2120-11-25**], A CT
examination is recommended to rule out a postobstructive
process.

FINDINGS: The examination is limited due to patient motion.
There is bibasilar airspace disease which may be atelectasis or
infection. Again seen is trace pericholecystic fluid which was
seen on CT scan. There is no evidence of gallstones. There is no
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No focal
intrahepatic lesions are demonstrated. There is no evidence of
choledocholithiasis. There is a slight strandy increased T2
signal intensity surrounding the tail of the pancreas, most
consistent with pancreatitis as seen on CT scan. No focal mass
is demonstrated, although the images are limited due to patient
motion. There is no evidence of pancreatic duct dilatation. The
adrenal glands and left kidney are unremarkable. There is a 5-mm
cyst at the interpolar region of the right kidney. There is no
lymphadenopathy. A transpyloric tube is seen which is coiled in
the duodenum as seen on CT scan.

Edema is seen within the musculature of the lower extremities
bilaterally, only partially imaged. There is normal bone marrow
signal intensity.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. No evidence of choledocholithiasis.
2. Trace pericholecystic fluid without evidence of gallstones or
gallbladder wall thickening or distention.
3. Findings consistent with edema in the region of the
pancreatic tail, most likely secondary to pancreatitis. The
examination is limited due to patient motion; however, no
definite pancreatic mass is demonstrated.
4. Bibasilar airspace disease, atelectasis or infection.
5. Bilateral edema within the lower extremity musculature.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for further
workup, had multiples studies done including MRCP, CT head, LP.
Workup disclosed ?AIDS cholangiopathy and pancreatitis.
Eventually called out to floor.  Family meeting held between PCP
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1299**] and Family.  Decision was made to make
