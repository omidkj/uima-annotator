History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36180**] is a 67-year-old gentleman, with
coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction, who has
also had a history of reflux disease and biopsy proven
[**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus. Serial biopsies have been obtained and
reviewed at 3 different institutions. All institutions agree
that biopsies show focal areas of high grade dysplasia and 2
out of the 3 reviewing pathologists said there was
intramucosal carcinoma. A variety of treatment
options were discussed, including transhiatal esophagectomy
versus ablative
therapy versus minimally invasive esophagectomy. The patient
would prefer to proceed with transhiatal esophagectomy.

pathology: DIAGNOSIS:
1.) Gastric lymph node (A):
One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
II) Esophagus and proximal stomach, partial esophagogastrectomy
(B-Y, CA-GA):
a. Barrett's esophagus with focal intramucosal carcinoma and
multiple foci of high-grade dysplasia; no definitive invasion of
the lamina propria is identified (multiple levels are examined).
Margins of resection are free of dysplasia.
b. Gastric fundus with incidental leiomyoma of the muscularis
propria (1.0 cm, see note) and no mucosal diagnostic
abnormalities recognized.
c. Six lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/6)
 d. Esophageal squamous epithelium with no diagnostic
abnormalities recognized.
III) Esophageal lymph nodes (Z-BA):
Five lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/5).
Note:  Immunostains of the gastric leiomyoma are positive for
actin and desmin, and negative for c-kit with satisfactory
controls. Slides corresponding to blocks Q-R were reviewed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] who concurs with the diagnosis.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and taken to the OR [**2135-10-12**] for transhiatal
esophagectomy and feeding jejunostomy tube. An epidural was
placed pre-op for pain control and a swan ganz catheter for
hemodynamic monitoring given low but stable EF 35%. Operative
course was uneventful. Pt remained intubated and was admitted to
the ICU for ongoing pulmonary and hemodynamic support. Peri-op
antibiotics of flagyl and kefzol.
POD#1 weaned and extubated. NPO, anastomotic JP to bulb sxn, NGT
to sxn and j-tube to gravity.
POD#2 Remained in ICU for ongoing pulmonary tiolet.  he received
some Lasix for rales and respiratory distress.  Tube feeds were
started.
POD#3 His epidural catheter was discontinued.  His NG tube was
removed as well.
POD#4 A chest X-ray demonstrated left lower lobe atelectasis and
a right lower lobe opacity.
POD#5 He went into rapid atrial fibrillation.  An Amiodarone
drip was started.  A cardiology consult was obtained.  A heparin
drip was started for anticoagulation because of A-fib.
POD#6 He converted to sinus rhythum after a 5 second pause.
POD#7 He tolerated grape juice without any leak into his JP
drain in his neck.  His JP drain was removed.  He was started on
a clear liquid diet.
POD#8 He began to leak food contents from his neck wound.  His
neck incision was opened up (one layer of the two layer closure)
and pakced with gauze. He was kept NPO.  A PICC line was placed
for access for his heparin and amiodarone drips.
POD #10 He failed a voiding trial and had to be straight
catheterized (UOP 300cc).  His staples were removed.  His Foley
was removed.  He had a negative LUE ultrasound to rule out a
DVT.
POD #11- He had a Foley placed after he failed to void.  He went
into V-tach for 24 beats and his amiodarone drip was reduced by
half after counseling cardiology.
POD#12- Cardiology discontinued his amiodarone, enalapril
started and lopressor continued.  Disposition planning ongoing
w/ [**Hospital 5065**] Healthcare and Visiting Nurse Services of [**State 40074**]for skilled nursing care at home. Pt looks and feels improved.

cath to remain in place, primary urologist informed and pt to
f/u outpatient, appt scheduled.
[**10-26**] no arrhythmia. Cervical wound improving, decreasing in
size.  Pt cont to look and feel improved. Ambulation ad lib
