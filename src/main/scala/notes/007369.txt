HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for pulmonary embolism in
the past, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, meniere's disease, and increasing "memory loss" who
presents from an outside hospital after having a left arm
shaking at home, and then having dysarthria and rapidly
declining mental status requiring intubation.

On head CT, he had a right frontal parietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
where he was soon extubated, but then had another episode of
mental status change and was found to have pneumonia.  His
blood pressure was monitored closely while in the Intensive
Care Unit and eventually he was extubated and sent to the
floor in good condition.

On exam, he has a left hemiplegia and left neglect, but is
responsive and following commands.  He was later found to be
in acute respiratory distress after being called out to the
floor initially and he subsequently returned to the Intensive
Care Unit for reintubation and then was again transferred to
the floor on [**2101-11-28**] after being stabilized.  He
continued to have a rather high oxygen requirement on initial
call out, however, this was eventually resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Heart block, status post pacemaker.
3.  Pulmonary embolism 12 years ago in the setting of total
hip replacement, status post IVC filter and "mild memory
loss" according to the family.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
2.  Famotidine.
3.  Zosyn for the pneumonia which he received a 14 day course
of and stopped.
4.  Brimonidine 0.15% eye drops.
5.  Timolol eye drops.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Very independent at home.  He was driving
with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood
pressures 138/70.  Heart rate 76.  Oxygen saturation
initially 99% on face mask, but now is doing well on room
air.  General medical exam is unremarkable.  Neurological
exam:  The patient is alert and awake.  He answers
appropriately to questions.  He follows commands well.  He
has left-sided neglect and a positive grasp reflex in the
right hand.  The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with
a left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5
strength.  The right side is full strength.  The patient also
has reflexes that are slightly brisker on the right
throughout.  He has a left upgoing toe and withdraws to pain
bilaterally in his extremities.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES:  On the day of discharge, his white
blood cell count is 9.1, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count
511,000, PT 13.6, PTT 28.8, INR 1.2.  Urinalysis is pending.
Glucose 104.  BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, sodium 138, potassium
3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, calcium 9.9, phosphate
2.9, magnesium 1.8.  Blood cultures:  No growth to date.
Urine culture from [**11-28**] showed no growth.  Chest x-ray
showed no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure
and no pneumothorax.

CT showed as mentioned, a large right frontal parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with some leftward shift to the
septum lucidum, no uncle herniation and also small amounts of
hemorrhage in the dependent portions of the occipital horns
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurology
Service with an acute large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage
and severe left-sided hemiplegia with left-sided neglect.  It
was felt that his hemorrhage was likely due to amyloid,
although, the patient was on Coumadin also at the time.  The
patient's Coumadin was stopped. Given his diagnosis of probable
amyloid angiopathy, he is not an optimal long-term Coumadin
candidate.  The patient did well throughout admission after
resolution of his pneumonia.  He was given a course of Zosyn for
14 days after which time his oxygenation became much improved and
he was able to remain stable on the floor.  He had no further
temperature spikes. He failed two swallow evaluations and thus
was given a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube per the
Gastrointestinal Service for his nutritional needs.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation in good
condition on [**2101-12-7**].  He will receive follow-up in
the [**Hospital 4038**] Clinic.  The date to be scheduled before
discharge. Follow-up with his PCP and Cardiology to be scheduled
as well to optimize management of his atrial fibrillation.
