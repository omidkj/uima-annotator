CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2123-1-4**] 10:22 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluation of effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old woman with s/p MVR LAA resection maze
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation of effusion
TWO-VIEW CHEST, [**2123-1-4**]

COMPARISON: [**2123-1-1**].

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve surgery.

There has been prior median sternotomy and mitral valve surgery.
Improving bibasilar atelectasis is present. Persistent small
pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as multiple
calcified pleural plaques. Small air-fluid level in the
retrosternal region is likely related to recent sternotomy.

IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent small
pleural effusions.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Aortic Valve - Valve Area:  *2.2 cm2  >= 3.0 cm2
Mitral Valve - MVA (P [**1-20**] T):  2.0 cm2

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass: Perservered Biventricular function LVEF >55%. There
is a bioprosthetic mitral valve insitu. Peak gradient 10, mean 8
mmHg with cardiac output 5.2. There was initally a tiny
perivavluar leak which resolved completely with protamine
administration. Aortic Contours are intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All finidings dicussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted preoperatively for IV heparin. She was taken to
the operating room on [**12-31**] where she underwent a MVR, MAZE and
LAA ligation. She was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition. She was given 48 hours of vancomycin as she was in
the hospital preoperatively. She was extubated later that same
day. She was restarted on IV heparin and coumadin. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #1. She did well
postoperatively. She awaited therapeutic INR and 24 hours of
overlap with IV heparin before discharge however her INR became
supratherapeutic and she remained in the hospital. She developed
a rash on her back that seemed to improve once her lasix was
discontinued. Her INR continued to rise and she was given FFP.
She went in to atrial fibrillation and was seen by EP who
planned for cardioversion but she returned to sinus rhythm. Her
INR began to improve and she was ready for discharge on POD #7.
Spoke to [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Location (un) 620**] anticoagulation, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will
follow her coumadin as prior to surgery, anticoag will assume
management once VNA services are stopped.

Medications on Admission:
ASA 325, toprol 100, flecanide 100 ", zetia 10, crestor 20,
ativan, coumadin 10 Mon, 7.5 on other days, MVI, colace 100",
