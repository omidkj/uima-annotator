CXR:
FINDINGS:  There is no definite focal consolidation.  No
superimposed edema is evident.  There is prominence in the
aorticopulmonary window, which may relate to the patient's known
lung cancer diagnosis.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits accounting for the depth of inspiration and AP portable
technique.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
which may be due to a small effusion.  There is no definite
right effusion.  No pneumothorax is
seen.  A Port-A-Cath is evident with the tip projected over the
superior vena cava.
.
IMPRESSION:  No clear consolidation or superimposed edema.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Head CT:
FINDINGS:  The extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable.
The calvarium and skull base are intact.  The paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear.  The globes are intact with
lenses in place.  Intracranially, the ventricles are midline and
normal in size and configuration.  The cortical sulci and
subarachnoid cisterns are likewise unremarkable.  [**Doctor Last Name **]
matter-white matter interface is well defined.  There is no mass
effect or CT evidence suggestive of underlying vasogenic edema.
Additionally, no intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute
cortical stroke is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable head CT examination.  No secondary
evidence to suggest underlying metastatic disease.
.
Renal U/S [**2129-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with PMH newly diagnosed metastatic small cell cancer
presents with severe neutropenia and ARF with electrolyte
abnormalities.
.
1. ARF: Most likely of multifactorial etiology including
pre-renal, and intrinsic renal dysfunction (FeNa 8.5%).
Intrinsic renal may be [**1-7**] cisplatin toxicity, tumor lysis
syndrome, on top of CKD from HTN (baseline unknown). Post-renal
etiology seems less likely, as pt is urinating and renal U/S
with no evidence of hydronephrosis. The urinary output increased
steadily and is 150 cc/hour today ([**2129-3-28**]). Creatinine slowly
trending down, down to 8 today , as well as phosphate, down to 6
from >8. A renal consult was obtained early on which advised 3%
saline for 20 cc/hour for 1 Liter, with which Na corrected to
127. The renal team did not feel that the patient had tumor
lysis syndrome. The patient has been on a 1.5 L per day free
water restriction. The patient does not wish to have
hemodialysis, and the renal consult did not feel this was
appropriate. He was given phos-binder, his medicines were
renally dosed, and diovan and celebrex were held. In discussion
with his oncologist his chemotherapy regimen is modified to no
longer have platinums.
.
2. Hypocalcemia: DDx includes precipitation into CaPo4 in
setting of hyperphos, tumor lysis syndrome. Calcium was repleted
in a conservative manner in view of his hyperphosphatemia. His
cardiac status was closely monitored and he did not develop any
cardiac symptoms.
.
3. Hyponatremia: Likely [**1-7**] hypovolemia. Not sodium avid by
lytes, but may be [**1-7**] concomitant intrinsic renal dz.
.
4. Fever and Neutropenia: The patient was placed on neutropenic
precautions. He had new infiltrates on CXR. He received vanc and
cefepime, renally dosed. Vanc level was very high so he has not
been given new dose yet. Sputum grew pan sensitive E Coli, and
MSSA.  He was switched to levaquin only.  Respiratory symptoms
improved.  He was started on neupogen with good response and his
neutropenia resolved. However his neupogen was stopped late, and
he has a high level of leukocytosis.
.
6.Thrombocytopenia: Most likely [**1-7**] chemo. Unlikely DIC (nl INR,
fibrinogen 734). HIT negative.  REsolved over first few days of
admission.
.
7. Lung cancer with bone metastasis:
Resulting in diffuse bony pain. A pain consult was obtained. He
is on oxycontin, dilaudid for breakthrough pain, and neurontin
low dose qhs. This worked well and at rest he had no pain.  But
with walking he c/o left hip pain. He will resume chemotherapy
with his primary oncologist.
.
8. COPD: continued inhaler per home regimen; alb/atrov nebs
standing every six hours. Discontinued propanolol, which the
patient was probably taking for his social phobia, and started
low dose metoprolol tid to avoid rebound tachycardia.  Due to
persistent wheezing, he was started on systemic steroids. now to
taper
.
9. Depression: Effexor was renally dosed and duloxetine was
d/c'ed. QTc was monitored on EKGs. Social work worked with the
patient.
.
10. HTN: Diovan was held. BP remained stable.
.
11. Hypothyroid: continue levothyroxine.
.
.
DNR DNI: The patient decided on a meeting with medical team and
his brother on 4/ 20 to be made DNR DNI. His brother is his
health care proxy.
