ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to an initial Discharge
Summary which was dictated on [**2127-2-6**].

While awaiting rehabilitation bed placement, Psychiatry saw
the patient for management of anxiety attacks and sleep
depravation.  Their impression was that the nightly episodes
of sleep depravation were most likely related to an anxiety
disorder secondary to her respiratory problems and a delirium
which might be caused by the presence of infection, hypoxia,
or metabolic.  Their recommendations were to start Seroquel
12.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.  which should help for the depression,
and anxiety, and sleep.  Continue to treating her medical
problems.

The patient did not want to initiate medications at this
time.
