[**5-14**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval evolution of left MCA territorial infarct
demonstrated by loss of left frontal lobe [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation, local edema with minimal mass effect.
2. Stable chronic ischemic changes as described above.
.
[**5-12**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to motion artifact. If there is clinical
suspicion for acute ischemia, an MRI is recommended.
2. Stable chronic ischemic changes as described.

Carotid doppler:
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis in the bilateral extracranial
internal carotid arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
AA/P:
93 Russian-Speaking female s/p large L MCA territory stroke
intubated due to respiratory distress and increased work of
breathing likely caused by aspiration pneumonia.
.
1. Stroke:
The patient was noted to have a grossly abnormal neurologic exam
in the ED and was admitted to the neurology service for stroke.
Head CT ultimately revealed a large L MCA stroke. This was a
suspected cardioembolic source given the A-fib, although she was
therapeutic on coumadin. Carotid dopplers were negative. Her
mental status and neuro exam remained stable over the admission,
although she did remain confused, unable to communicate with
providers. She was awake, alert moving her extremities. She
failed speech/swallow [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NG tube was placed.
neurologically, she remained stable for the duration of the
admission. She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory
distress on [**5-15**]. Shw will follow up with neurology as an
outpatient, per the discharge paperwork.
.
2. Respiratory Distress;
On [**5-15**] the patient was noted to be tachypneic and in respiratory
distress on the neuro floor. She was transferred to the MICU and
intubated. She had a presumed aspiration pneumonia, given the
stroke and failed swallow study. No organism obtained on sputum.
She was treated with a course of vanc/levoflox/flagyl for 7
days.
She was extubated successfully at 1200 on [**5-19**]. Although she
continued having a lot of secretions, needing frequent deep
suctioning, noted to have poor gag.
.
3. Afib:
She has permanent AF, with episodes of RVR. The dig was stopped.
Rate control was continued with metoprolol. Anticoagulation was
continued with coumadin, although she required a dose of vitamin
K to reverse a supratherapeutic INR, after which coumadin was
resumed.
.
4. HTN:
BP meds were titrated daily to acheive target bp 120-130/80s.
Metoprolol, captopril, isosorbide were used. Lasix as well for
diuresis for CHF.
.
5. CHF, EF 45-50%:
There was a component of overload to the respiratory distress.
She was diuresed with lasix.
.
FEN:
Tube feeds were used given the aspiration risk. For long term,
will need dobhoff tube or pediatric NGT. The family was opposed
to PEG.
.
PPX: IV PPI, pneumoboots, on coumadin
.
Dispo: MICU for now, ? d/c to rehab where frequent suctioning
could be performed.
.
Code: DNR, no escalation of care, no CPR, no pressors. DO NOT
re-intubate.  No trach, no PEG.  continue current level of care.
