Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left heart catheterization: Performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2170-9-11**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88yoF with h/o dementia who intially presented to
BIDN with chest pain after a mechanical fall and c/f STEMI, now
transferred for acute hypoxia requiring intubation.  accepted in
transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].  Patient is currently unable to
provide a history, but per BIDN records on the DOA she had an
unwitnessed mechanical fall at home (her 2nd in 2 days), and
while being transported to BIDN by granddaughter c/o chest pain.
 In the ED she was noted to have a positive troponins (.36)
with an EKG showing concerning changes (c/w inferior STEMI)
compared to 3 days prior to her admission.   In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED
she received a plavix load, full dose ASA, heparin and beta
blockers and she was noted to be slightly bradycardic
thereafter.  She continues on heparin.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted,
and initally offered the family cardiac catheterization which
they refused. Her troponins peaked at her admission value as did
her CKs at 310.

On the morning of [**9-9**] the patient beame agitated and
hypertensive (SBP 180's), shortly thereafter she became
hypoxemic (O2 sats as low as 68%) she failed 100% non-rebreather
and BiPAP, and was intubated [**2-21**] work of breathing and failure
to protect her airway.  She was given IV nitro, IV Lasix,
Etomidate, Versed and fentanyl and her blood pressure dropped to
70.  She was given 300cc IVF and her SBP increased to 90's.  Per
family's request, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.
.
On transfer, she was intubated and sedated, with stable VS (T
98.2 HR 88 BP 131/57 O2 99% on 70% FIO2).

EKG [**2170-9-10**]: Normal sinus rhythm is present. The QTc interval is
prolonged. There are also widely splayed symmetric T wave
changes consistent with a cerebral event or consistent with drug
effect or ischemia. These changes are global. NKo previous
tracing for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested for
ischemia and/or cerebral event is required.

CXR [**2170-9-10**]:
AP chest compared to [**9-8**] through [**9-10**] at 11:39 a.m.
at
[**Hospital 4068**] Hospital. Previous left PIC line is no longer visible,
and presumably has been withdrawn either completely at least
outside the field of view at the left shoulder. ET tube is in
standard placement and nasogastric tube passes below the
diaphragm and out of view. Large scale pulmonary consolidation
which developed between [**9-8**] and [**9-10**] and worsened
appreciably over the course of the day continues to improve, but
the focal nature of the consolidation suggests that what remains
could be pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe. The
rest was edema. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion is small
if any. No
pneumothorax.

CXR [**2170-9-12**]: In the interim from the previous examination, an
endotracheal tube and esophageal catheter have been removed.
Multifocal opacities, greatest at the right base, continue to
improve. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. The heart
size is normal.

TTE [**2170-9-11**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is probably mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid
inferoseptal/apical septal hypokinesis and distal inferior
hypokinesis although views are technically suboptimal. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiac cath [**2170-9-11**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe 2 vessel CAD. The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The LAD was
totally
occluded after a high diagonal. There were significant left-left
and
right-left collaterals supplying the LAD territory. The LCX was
a
moderate caliber vessel with a 50% stenosis in OM1. The dominant
RCA had
a 90% calcified ostial lesion.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed severe left-sided filling
pressures with
an LVEDP of 50 mmHg.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.
4) Successful primary angioplasty of the ostial RCA lesion with
a 3.0
15mm Vision BMS. Final angiography revealed TIMI 3 flow with no
residual
stenosis or angiographically-apparent dissection.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe two vessel CAD with probable chronic LAD disease.
2. Successful angioplasty of the ostial RCA lesion with a 3.0 x
15mm
Vision BMS.
3. Severely elevated left-sided filling pressures.
4. ASA 81mg daily indefinitely and plavix 75mg daily x 30 days.

Video swallow [**2170-9-13**]: Barium passes freely through the
oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There
was penetration and aspiration with thin liquids. No aspiration
or penetration with any other consistency of barium.  Small
posterior wall diverticulum above the upper esophageal sphincter
is observed. For details please refer to speech and swallow
division note in OMR.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Penetration and aspiration of thin liquids.
2. Small diverticulum of the posterior wall of the upper
esophagus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
88yoF with no cardiac history presents to BIDN with chest pain
after recent mechanical fall and e/o STEMI on EKG, transferred
for hypoxia requiring intubation.
.
Active issues:
.
# STEMI: On transfer, pt's family expressed that they wanted to
proceed with cardiac cath.  She went to cath lab on [**9-11**] which
showed severe two-vessel disease, chronic LAD disease, and 90%
occlusion of RCX.  BMS x1 was placed in RCX. She was started on
ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily,
metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], and lisinopril 10mg daily. She
will need to continue plavix for 6 months and ASA indefinitely.
She was initially started on heparin gtt
