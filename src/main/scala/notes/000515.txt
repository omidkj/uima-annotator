Bacteremia

Central Venous Catheter

History of Present Illness:
73 yo female transferred from [**Hospital 8629**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for
intermittent fevers. Pt initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2155-3-17**]
after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after prolonged
hospitalization. Initially, the pt underwent CABG, prosthetic
MVR, and closure of foramen ovale on [**2155-2-21**]. Post-op course
complicated by mediastinal hemorrhage, prolonged shock, renal
failure. The pt failed to recover neurologically, and the family
decided to pursue trach and PEG. HD was initiated, and the pt
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab. Since admission, she has
had intermittent fevers and leukocytosis, and recurrent
infections. She initially was treated with a course of Vanc,
Zosyn, and Flagyl. She was then started on Fluconazole for
fungus in the urine, and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] bacteremia. This was changed to
Caspofungin when the patient failed to respond to treatment. The
pt also grew [**Female First Name (un) **] out of her blood and was started on Linezolid.
She also had new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, and was
started on Imipenem for broad coverage. She developed fever and
hypotension requiring pressors off and on from the 20th to the
24th. She underwent a TTE that showed no vegetations, EF 40%.
Surveillance cultures have been NGTD. She was started on
steroids empirically, and a random cortisol level returned at 3.
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation including
TEE, CT, ID consult, and infected lined change.

blood cx [**4-18**], [**4-19**] from picc pending
.
cxr:
Right lower lobe/right infrahilar opacity. Differential includes

asymmetrically distributed alveolar edema or consolidation,
possibly
aspiration related. Mild vascular conjestion.
.
TEE - Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. A small left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen
at rest consistent with a small secundum atrial septal defect.
There is
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
inferior akinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm,
non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and scending thoracic
aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. A well seated mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is
present. The leaflets are mildly thickened with normal gradient.
No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Very mild mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral annuloplasty ring with
very mild mitral
regurgitation. No vegetations identified. Complex (non-mobile)
aortic
atherosclerosis. Small secundum type atrial septal defect.
Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 YOF with anoxic brain injury, renal failure and line
infection.
.
Line infection - [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and [**Female First Name (un) **] grown at Rehab. Treated with
caspofungin, linezolid, and meropenem. Hemodialysis and PICC
lines removed, tip cultures negative. Left subclavian line
placed. Repeat cultures neagative. TEE done which showed no
vegetation or abcess. New PICC line placed [**2155-4-24**], left
subclavian d/c'd. To complete a 14 day course of Meropenem,
Linezolid, Caspofungin to end on [**2155-5-2**].
.
Renal failure - Patient was on dialysis after prolonged
hypotension leading to ATN. HD catheter removed at time of
admission. Cr and electrolytes remained stable. Patient making
~1L of urine a day. Hemodialysis discontinued indefinetly.
.
Hypotension - Patient transiently hypotensive. Hypovolemia vs
sepsis. Responded to fluids.
.
Anoxic Encephalopathy- secondary to prolonged shock, evaluated
by neurologist at [**Hospital1 **], poor prognosis for recovery based on
prolonged state of neurological decline. No change in neuro exam
during hospitalization.
.
Respiratory Failure- trached. Per outside hospital physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] to wean from vent. Attempted to wean while here, but
failed PS.
- continue vent at current settings AC 500 x 12/PEEP 5/ FiO2 40%

- MDIs standing
- Growing pseudomonas in sputum, being treated with Meropenem x
2 weeks
- VBG showed near normal pH with low pCO2 and low bicarb.
