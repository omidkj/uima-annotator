her second postoperative visit now approximately three and a
half
weeks after surgery.  She is seen urgently at the request of her
visiting nurse who noted she was having some active drainage
from
her incision so much so that they had saturated her Steri-Strips
and they had all begun to fall off.  She had also noticed a
malodorous smell coming from the incision with surrounding
erythema.  Ms. [**Known lastname 14781**] tells me that she has not had any

draining.

Brief Hospital Course:
Problems:
1. [**Name2 (NI) 650**] sepsis / Septic shock / Septic arthritis of the left
knee
2. Acute renal failure
3. Hyponatremia
4. Diabetes type II, controlled without complications
5. Hypertension
6. Morbid obesity
7. Edema/anasarca secondary to volume repletion
8. Anemia of chronic disease
9. Arthralgias/Myalgias possibly related to allergic reaction
10. Constipation

Initially admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and was
started on IV antibiotics (Ancef). After monitoring, she undergo
a washout on [**2103-9-24**]. Subsequently developed hypotension and
subsequent acute renal failure on POD#2 requiring an ICU
transfer and it was felt she would benefit from a repeat
I&D/liner exchange of her left knee; this was done on
[**2103-9-27**]. She remained intubated post-operatively for airway
protection and was extubated without problem on [**2103-9-28**].

Regarding antibiotics, once cultures returned with PROTEUS
MIRABILIS, MORGANELLA MORGANII, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE, she
was switched to meropenem. Daptomycin was continued empirically
until final culture from [**2103-9-27**] returned without GPCs.

She was also noted to have hives/pruritis post operatively.
Allergy was consulted and felt that the likely etiology of her
pruritic rash was a drug allergy - in particular, ciprofloxacin
or vancomycin. Per allergy, we avoided ciprofloxacin,
vancomycin, aspirin, and cefazolin and treated her
symptomatically with benadryl and famotidine. As ciprofloxacin
may be a good option for long-term suppressive therapy, an
allergy follow-up appointment may be valuable for possible
re-challenge.

Regarding anemai, required transfusion of 3U PRBCs.
