[**5-14**] RPR: non-reactive

RADS
[**5-13**] RLE U/S: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right lower extremity
DVT.

[**5-13**] Left foot: 1.  Hallux valgus, with osteoarthritis and
possible neuropathic component, involving the first MTP joint,
an unusual site; the Lisfranc joint appears spared.
2.  No specific evidence of osteomyelitis at this site, or
elsewhere in the foot.

[**5-13**] Right ankle: Extensive soft tissue ulcers, with no definite
evidence of osteomyelitis.

[**5-13**] Chest: Left ventricular configuration of the heart, with
tortuous aorta.  On the lateral view, very mild blunting of both
costophrenic angles.  No pneumothorax.  Epigastric staples
noted.  Lung fields appear clear.  The osseous structures are
within normal limits.  Mild kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:  No active lung disease seen

[**5-14**] Arterial Noninvasive Study: Doppler evaluation was
performed of both lower extremity arterial systems at rest.  The
distal right leg cannot be examined due to open wounds.  In the
right, Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral level only.
 They are monophasic at the popliteal.  No ankle brachial index
could be calculated. The ankle metatarsals PVRs are flat.  On
the left, Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral,
popliteal, and dorsalis pedis levels.  Ankle brachial index is
1.1.  Pulse volume recordings are relatively normal to the calf
level and show significant drop off at the ankle and
metatarsals.
IMPRESSION:  On the right, there is significant superficial
femoral and tibial artery occlusive disease.  On the left, there
is moderate tibial artery occlusive disease.

CARDS
[**5-14**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is  5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal  cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall  motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis  is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular
systolic function. Aortic valve sclerosis

Angiography:
[**5-16**]
1.  Patent infrarenal abdominal aorta with patent bilateral
    single renal arteries. We see a patent distal infrarenal
    aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac bypass.
2.  Both internal and external iliacs are patent.
3.  The right lower extremity runoff revealed patent common
    profunda and superficial femoral arteries. There is mild
    to moderate diffuse disease throughout the distal SFA and
    above-the-knee popliteal. There is a high-grade stenosis
    at the distal below-the-knee popliteal just before the
    anterior tibialis  takeoff, there is also high-grade
    stenosis within the tibioperoneal trunk. We see a 3-
    vessel runoff with the main runoff given via a patent
    posterior tibial. At the foot the anterior tibialis is
    bluntly occluded at the ankle. We did not see a dorsalis
    pedis. The posterior tibialis continues down into a
    patent plantar arch.






Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU service on [**5-13**] due to a BP
of 229/104.  A labetolol drip was started with appropriate
response.  Vascular surgery and podiatric surgery were consulted
for the b/l venous stasis ulcers.  Vanco/Levo/Flagyl were
started, cultures were obtained from the leg wound, and the
lower extremities were wrappe
