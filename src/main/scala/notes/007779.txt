The patient recently returned from the [**Country 13622**] Republic - St.
[**Doctor Last Name **] - where she was for the past 2.5 months. She describes
progressive SOB for many months, worse in the past several days
affecting her at rest. She noted associated epigastric pressure
which by her report was also present for months. She describes
generalized fatigue and leg weakness. The patient describes
medical and dietary compliance. She was evaluated in the heart
failure clinics for a regularly scheduled appoitnment. When she
was found on echo to have precipitous decline in her EF to 10%
(from 20% in [**6-/2130**]) she was referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, vitals were 99.2 113 137/94 18 100% RA. The patient
had negative EKG for ischemia and negative cardiac enzymes. She
underwent PE protocol CT to evaluate for possible PE in the
setting of recent plane travel and complaints of asymmetric
lower extremity edema. The CT was negative for PE. She received
325mg aspirin, GI cocktail, mucomyst (prior to CTA) and
furosemide IV 80mg.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence syncope. She
endorses DOE at 10 yards, 4 pillow orthopnea, bilateral lower
extremity edema, PND and lightheadedness. Remainder of review of
systems is remarkable for persistent cough productive of whitish
sputum.

EKG ([**2131-1-1**]): Sinus tachycardia at 110. Normal axis and
intervals. Downsloping ST depressions in V5-6. Tachycardia is
new and axis is shifting toward negative in aVF and II compared
to prior dated [**2129-1-18**].
.
CTA PE Protocol ([**2131-1-1**]): 1. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. 2. Patchy ground-glass opacity with increased
interstitial prominence is
consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 3. Stable
marked cardiomegaly. 4. Perfusion abnormality in the liver may
reflect the underlying heart failure. It is on this study
incompletely evaluated.
.
CXR ([**2131-1-1**]): Preliminary read, interval increase in size of
cardiac silhouette, which could be partially secondary to
techinical differences, however, possible pericardial effusion
versus worsening cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded. No evidence
of pulmonary edema.
.
TTE ([**2131-1-1**]): Estimated EF 10%. Severe TR. Full report
pending.
