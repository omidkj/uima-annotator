History of Present Illness:
74 year-old man with glottic squamous cell carcinomal s/p chemo
and XRT as well as T3N0Mx poorly differentiated carcinoma of the
lung in remission presenting after a recent hospitalization for
dysphagia with continued dysphagia and poor PO intake leading to
weakness.  He was discharged approximately a week before this
presentation and at that time was admitted for dysphagia.  He
had dilation of a relativley quite minor esophageal stricture
during that hospitalization and afterwards improved and was
discharged.  He reports that his swallowing is slightly better
but he is not able to take much food at all.  He reports his
appetite is very poor.  In the context of this poor intake he
reports he has gotten very week and though he reports a month or
so ago he could walk several blocks over the last weeks he does
not think he could do this. Aside from his weakness and poor
intake he reports chronic back pain on his left side, where he
had a previous surgery.  He has subjective fevers and chills and
reports chronic cough but this is nonproductive.  He does have
chronic production of sputum in his mouth that he does not feel
he can handle and swallow and spits in a basin throughout our
interview.  He denies odynophagia.  He also endorses chronic
anorexia and more recently having had some subjective fevers or
chills though he reports dysuria or localizing singns except for
his chronic, nonproductive cough and approximately two episodes
of loose stool a day, which he reports are immediately after he
eats.  He has mild headache. He denies abdominal pain, dysuria,
or flank pain.  He very rarely has nausea and will vomit with
dyspnea after vomiting.  He denies dyspnea at any other time.
Because of inability to manage these symptoms at home he
presented to the ED.

In the ED all vital signs were stable.  T 98, P 108, BP 92/65,
RR 18, O2 Sat 100% RA.  He had labs and cultures, which revealed
a leukocytosis but UA and chest radiograph were both without
signs of acute infection and he was afebrile.  He was admitted
for further management.

Currently, he discusses his litany of complaints and is very
irritated by how poorly he is feeling.  He is particularly
concerned about how little he is eating and mentioned to a nurse
he would die without IVF.  He does ask for supplements, however,
and is very concerned with his PO intake.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
Chest radiograph PA and lateral [**2136-9-24**] (my read): General
greater density over the left lung field, likely due to volume
loss (chronic).  No infiltrate or pulmonary edema appreciated.
No effusions.  There is a circular lucency of the left clavicle
that appears new from previous chest radiographs though
radiograph from [**Month (only) 216**] shows a circular lucency likely linked to
the lung.  No acute intrapulmonary process, ? lytic lesion in
left clavicle.

Bed Side Swallow Study
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] is well known to me from previous swallowing
evaluations. He had been tolerating thin liquids and ground
solids before his recent left thoracotomy, Left upper lobectomy
and pericardial resection for biopsy proven non-small cell lung
cancer.  We repeated his video swallow after that procedure
before d/c but swallow function was c/w previous exams and he
remained safe for thin liquids and soft foods with extra sauce
and gravy. He was given a 10 days course of antibiotics for H
pylori but was only able to take 3 1/2 days of the medication
and
did not finish the prescription.

It is unlikely his oral and pharyngeal have changed since [**Month (only) 205**]
when we did his last video swallow and he has been recently
dilated which rules out the possibility he restrictured. My
guess
is that the biggest change is likely continued H pylori, as he
vomited up most of the medication and stoped taking it after 3
days. Suggest considering restarting meds for H pylori (not sure
if it needs to be rediagnosed before starting meds) to try to
improve comfort.

He remains safe to drink his liquid supplements, and takes 5
cans
of Nutren 2.0, 500 calories each which he should be ordered for
here. He can also take water safely, which can keep him
hydrated.
We will plan to f/u with him after treatment for H pylori to
