Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

None


History of Present Illness:
52 year old man with morbid obesity, homelessness who presents
with shortness of breath that began 1-2 months prior to
admission that progressively worsened over the past couple of
days.  He reports a productive cough of thick phleghm with blood
tinged sputum that started yesterday (only minimal amount of
blood). He has a fever to 102 and anorexia.  Denies TB exposure.
 He has chronic knee pain secondary to arthritis per his report.
 He has a distant history of smoking. He was originally seen at
OSH ([**Hospital1 **]) due to a positive d-dimer.  He could not
fit into the CT scanner to evaluate for PE.  CXR at OSH was
notable for pneumonia and thus he was started on azithromycin
and ceftriaxone.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.7 98 136/78 24 96%.  He weighs
536lb.  Labs notable for WBC 28 with 5% bands, lactate 2.9, chem
7 within normal limits.  No imaging was completed.  Received
oxycodone-acetaminopehn 10mg/650mg.  RR ranged 20-40s on 100% on
10L face mask.  Received 1L NS.  1 PIV 18G. Blood cultures sent.
 Most recent vitals 99F 99 28 145/76 100% 10L facemask.  CXR
showed RLL airspace opacity, atelectasis, aspiration. He was
admitted with respiratory and TB precautions.

On arrival to the MICU, patient complains of some cough and
dyspnea. Otherwise no complaints.

STUDIES:
[**2106-6-22**]   	Radiology 	CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
There are low lung volumes, and there is airspace opacity in the
right lower lobe which does not silhouette the heart border.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
contours are normal.
IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe airspace opacity, could represent
infection, atelectasis, or aspiration.

[**2106-6-23**]   	Cardiovascular 	ECHO
Suboptimal image quality - even with addition of myocardial
contrast. Moderately dilated left ventricle with normal global
ventricular function. Normal size and function of right
ventricle. Borderline

[**2106-6-22**]   	Radiology 	BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
The exam is limited due to patient's large body habitus.  There
is
normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation of the common
femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins bilaterally.  Normal
color flow is
demonstrated in the bilateral peroneal and posterior tibial
veins.

[**2106-6-24**]   	Radiology 	CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON
1.  No pulmonary embolism to the proximal lobar levels.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia.

MICROBIOLOGY:

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
52 year old man with morbid obesity and recent homelessness who
presents with shortness of breath found to have pneumonia with
bandemia and positive d-dimer. Patient was admitted to ICU given
oxygen requirement, patient was initially on NRB.  Patient was
treated for community acquiremed pneumonia and was started on
heparin gtt for possible PE. Subsequent CTA ruled out PE and
heparin was discontinued. He was discharged to complete 5days of
azithromycin and 10 days of cefpodoxime.

# Pneumonia:  Patient initially required NRB given hypoxia.
Pneumonia was felt to be most likely given productive cough and
bandemia as well as RLL infiltrate seen on CXR.  Community
acquired pathogens most likely, with possible TB given bloody
sputum, persistent cough and homelessness.  Patient was started
on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP.  Patient had elevated
d-dimer (530) and initially could not fit into CT scanner for
eval for PE. VQ scan was also felt to be difficult for patient.
Patient was borderline tachycardiac in the 90s - 100s when at
rest, but had bursts up to 150s when standing.  He was
empirically started on heparin gtt to treat PE. Patient was also
kept in respiratory isolation until AFB x3 ruled out Tb.
Patient had ECHO done which was difficult to interpret secondary
to body habitus. Upon call out to the medicine floor, he was
saturating well on room air. CTA was obtained which did not show
PE and confirmed multifocal pneumonia. Heparin gtt was stopped
and patient's symptoms were significantly improved. He was
discharged to complete 5 days of azithromycin and 10 days of
cefpodoxime.

#HTN: Patient on lisinopril 20mg and HCTZ 12.5 at home. Meds
were initially held on admission to ICU. As he improved, he
became hypertensive and lisinopril and HCTZ were added back on
and uptitrated to 25mg HCTZ and 40mg lisinopril. He received
captopril as needed for SBP's>180.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
# Type 2 DM: On metformin home. Patient kept on HISS while
in-house.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin 20 mg daily

# OSA: On CPAP, uses on regular basis. Continued CPAP while in
house.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Recheck Chem7 1 week following discharge given increased
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide dose


Medications on Admission:
Lisinopril 20
HCTZ 12.5
Metformin 1000 mg [**Hosp
