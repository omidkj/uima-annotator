History of Present Illness:
39F h/o DM1, polysubstance abuse, sCHF, NSTEMI p/w nausea and
intractable emesis since [**2113-8-5**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2113-8-6**].  On admission she was found to be in DKA and have a
urosepsis.   She was initially treated with an insulin drip and
this was switched over to sc insulin.  She was found to have a
UTI and started on cipro and meropenem as she was septic and she
has had a history of resistent organisms.  She eventually grew
klebsiella sensitive to meropenem and resistent to cipro so
meropenem was continued alone, Blood cultures from [**2113-8-6**] grew
GNR, not yet speciated.  Hospital course also significant for a
L IJ placed for sepsis and access.  She had a troponin elevation
to a peak of 0.2 which was considered a result of demand
ischemia (negative CK, Cr of 2.0).  In addition the patient had
acut renal failure with a Cr of 2.2 which has improved to 1.5
with IVF during her stay.  She was not intubated or on any
pressors during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.  She had a LOS fluid balance of
+5.6 L in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Currently feels well with the exception of mild nausea.  She has
eaten and has not vomited, no other symptoms.  No SOB, no
orthopnea, is sleeping w/ 1 pillow and at 15 degrees, no PND, no
edema of stumps.  No chest pain, no LH, no HA, no F/C, rest of
ROS is negative.

Past Medical History:
- DM Type 1 - poorly controlled with last A1C=12% in [**12-11**],
complicated by neuropathy, episodes of DKA, bilateral BKAs
- H/o ARDS secondary to sepsis
- PVD
- Depression

- Dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia
- Systolic CHF with EF=40% in [**8-10**], regional WMA (inferoseptal,
inferior, inferolateral and mid to distal anterolateral
hypokinesis)
- NSTEMI in [**12-11**]  (in the setting of DKA, peak TnT of 1.02)
- Winter [**2112**]-[**2113**] admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] for PEA and MRSA empyema in
left lower lobe
- h/o retinal detachment in OS
- Urine has been positive for cocaine on 4 separate occasions in
[**11-8**], and twice in [**4-11**]

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-8-6**]
SINGLE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH: Patient is slightly rotated to the
left. A left internal jugular central venous catheter has its
tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Trace retrocardiac linear
atelectasis is present. Mild right upper lobe volume loss
appears similar as compared to [**2113-6-13**]. The lungs are
otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
The heart is normal in size. An IVC filter is in stable
position.
IMPRESSION: Left internal jugular central venous catheter with
tip at
cavoatrial junction without pneumothorax.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2113-8-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly limited exam given lack of oral and IV contrast.
Enlarged
kidneys with no hydronephrosis. Cannot exclude pyelonephritis.
2. Short segment of bowel wall thickening along the ascending
colon, possibly related to colitis.
3. Trace ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female with a PMHx sig. for DMI presented w/ nausea
and vomiting found to have DKA, urosepsis, bacteremia, demand
ischemia, and acute pre-renal azotemia, admitted on [**8-6**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
called out to medical floor on [**8-8**].
.
# DKA:  This was likely precipitated by UTI/bacteremia.  [**Last Name (un) **]
followed while in house and she will follow up as an outpatient.
.
# SEPSIS:  Due to UTI/bacteremia with K. pneumoniae.  She is to
complete a 14 day course of Ertapenam.  She was discharged with
a PICC line.  She was counseled on the life-threatening
conditions related to misuse of the PICC line, including but not
