History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old woman with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, now
sober > 6 months, currently undergoing evaluation for liver
transplant, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for further
management.  The patient was most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
between [**1-8**] and [**2132-1-11**] for a colonoscopy and EGD with
polypectomy and biopsy.
   The pt has known ascites and is on a stable regimen of lasix
and aldactone but still requires weekly paracentesis to control
her ascites (Normally >5L removed at a time by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10733**]).  She presented to [**Hospital3 **] endoscopy suite for
her usual paracentesis and reported feeling weak with muscle
twitches on [**2132-2-6**].  Blood pressure at the time was found to
be 70/50 leading to an ED evaluation where the blood pressure
was confirmed and in addition she was found to have a K of 7.5
and Na of 117.  In addition, she had a BUN/Cr of 79/2.6, T.Bili
of 1, Alb of 2.4, INR of 1.07 and Ammonia of 9.  She was given
bicarb, insulin/d50 and oral kayexalate.  ECG demonstrated no
peaked T waves (however this was done after treatment).  K
decreased to 6.7.  She was subsequently admitted to the ICU for
further management.  The pt was hydrated overnight with increase
in systolic BP to 80s.  In addition, she was given albumin and
Ceftriaxone IV.  On [**2132-2-7**], paracentesis was performed with
removal of 2L of fluid.  The ascites fluid (after antibiotics)
demonstrated RBC of 19,000 and WBC of 165 with 48% polys.
BUN/Cr improved to 62/1.6 but urine output remained poor.  The
pt was also given a dose of lactulose as she had not had a BM
since Tues. Patient was subsequently transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis, presented
as transfer from [**Hospital3 3583**] after found to be weak with
muscle twitching on [**2132-2-6**].  K at that time was 7.5 with Na
117, treated with bicarb, insulin/d50 and oral kayexalate with
resultant K 3.9.  Her Na improved to 123.  Also noted at OSH to
be in ARF with Cr 2.6, improved to 1.6 after IVF hydration, felt
most likely to be prerenal given recent increase in both
spironolactone and lasix, and not hepatorenal given improvement
with diuretics being held and IVF hydration.  Platelets noted to
be 149, INR 1.17.  The pt usually undergoes large volume
paracentesis with weekly draining of 5-6L.  She has not had
abdominal tenderness, fever, WBC at OSH 14, however, she
underwent paracentesis [**2132-2-7**] at [**Hospital3 3583**] with 2L
removed, showing 165 WBC AFTER Ceftriaxone given.  She also
received albumin at OSH.  Of note, she has been undergoing liver
transplant eval with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
.
While at [**Hospital1 18**] she was changed from ceftriaxone to cipro for SBP
pprx. She had a paracentesis on [**2-7**] (3 liters), [**2-12**] (2
liters), and [**2-14**] (2 liters) all of which were negative for SBP.
Unfortunately her renal function continued to worsen (1.0 ->
2.2). Sodium also stayed in the 120's despite fluid restriction.
Furthermore she remained hypotensive 60's to 70's. Difficult to
assess patient's volume status so renal and liver felt patient
could be better managed with closer hemodynamic monitoring.  In
the MICU, CVL was placed.  Per renal, it was felt pt had HRS and
ATN.  Initially her UO was low, so after albumin was ineffective
in treating her BP, she was started on levophed. She underwent
paracentesis x2 with 2 L taken off on [**2-17**] and 6 L taken off on
[**2-19**].  On [**2-18**] the pt was started on ceftriaxone for tx of ?SBP
on gram stain from [**2-17**] paracentesis (elevated WBC in setting of
being on abx).  She received frequent PRBC and albumin while in
the unit. The pt was found to have C diff and was started on
flagyl on [**2-19**].  She was also found to have yeast in her urine
so her fol
