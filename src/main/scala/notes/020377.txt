Chief Complaint:
Oligometastatic Left Lower Lobe Lung Cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Thoracotomy, Left Lower Lobe Lobectomy, Mediastinal Lymph
Node Dissection

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 67yo F with a PMHx significant for HTN
and diverticulitis who was discovered to have a LLL lung cancer
incidentally after an episode of acute, uncomplicated sigmoid
diverticulitis in [**7-22**].  Pre-operative work-up, including whole
body PET-CT and brain MRI showed 2 lesions, a left adrenal and
left lower lobe mass.  Pre-operative assesment confirmed
non-small cell cancer with lung primary and given recent
literature supporting surgical intervention in oligometastatic
patients, the decision to proceed with a left lower lobe
resection was elected.  Pre-operative PFTs and cardiac risk
stratification revealed the patient to be an adequate candidate
for the procedure and on [**2106-12-20**], the patient had an
uncomplicated L-thoracotomy, left lower lobe lobectomy with a
mediastinal lymph node dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Post-operatively, the patient was extubated without event and
went to the floor.  For details of the procedure, see operative
dictation.  On POD#1, the patient went into rapid atrial
fibrillation (Afib) with a rapid ventricular response (RVR).
She was symptomatic with dizziness and lightheadedness as well
as palpatations.  Her systolic BP was measured between 70-90
systolic and possible cardioversion was entertained.  However,
after transfer to the [**Month/Day/Year 58879**], neosynephrine + amiodarone gtt was
utilized and she converted to sinus rhythm the following day.
She had no leak from her chest tube(s) and her other systems
were within normal.  While in the [**Last Name (LF) 58879**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MI protocol with
cardiac markers was unrevealing and she was aggressively
diuresed secondary to possible volume overload.

By the following day, she felt well; however, she lapsed back
into A-fib with a RVR.  Re-bolus of IV amiodarone and
continuation of her beta-blockade was successful in keeping her
rate controlled initially, but, she remained in atrial
fibrillation.  Ultimately, her chest tubes and epidural/foley
were serially removed over post-operative days #[**4-22**].  Follow-up
CXR after tube thoracostomy removal revealed no PTX and adequate
re-expansion of her left lung.  Cardiology consult obtained on
[**2106-12-25**] recommended judicious use of amiodarone in conjunction
with beta blockade.  This transiently worked, however, on POD5,
she returned to a rapid rate and cardiology recommended a
diltiazem drip with transition to an oral regimen of calcium
channel blocker with an amiodarone taper (e.g. 400BID x2weeks,
400 QDaily x2weeks, 200BID x2 weeks, until 100QDaily x 2 weeks),
cessation of her beta-blocker and intiation of anticoagulation
accomplished with lovenox injections as a bridge to therapy with
coumadin.

By discharge, she was stable on oral pain medication, tolerating
a regular [**Doctor First Name **] diet although her blood sugars were slightly
elevated.  She had received 2 days of coumadin and upon
discharge, her INR was 1.9 after receiving 5 mg doses nightly.
She will take 2.5mg of coumadin the night of her discharge.
Lastly, she is to be discharged with home oxygen, keflex for
superficial phlebitis of her IV site x7 days, lovenox injections
to be administered by VNA with daily blood draws for INR also
drawn by VNA.  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-19**] weeks
in his clinic by calling for an appointment and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2903**]
on [**2106-12-29**] at 12:30PM.
