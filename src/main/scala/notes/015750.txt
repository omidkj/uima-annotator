Chief Complaint:
fever, respiratory failure, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o M w/ striatonigral degeneration, nonverbal and minimally
communicative, recurrent aspiration w/ tracheostomy with
multiple infectious complications including MRSA, VRE, C. Diff,
pseudomonas, GERD, diastolic dysfunction, ischemic bowel s/p j
tube, recent admit to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in [**6-28**] with hypoxia, UTI, who is now
being transferred from an outside hospital after being admitted
there for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**8-14**]. The
patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**8-14**]
(ABG 6.97/200/105), and this was felt secondary to obstruction
of his tracheostomy tube and possibly from his neurological
disease. He was also in acute renal failure with hyperkalemia.
Patient was admitted to OSH and had bronchoscopy which showed
occlusion of the tracheostomy orifice by the posterior
membranous trachea. He had 2 trach changes while there but
patient still intermittently seemed to occlude the trach and
develop high PIPs. This was mostly positional. Patient was at
least in part transferred for

Other events during this brief OSH hospitalization were a PAC
with PCWP 18, PAP 45/26 RAP 18. His initial hematocrit was only
19 but improved and stabilized with 3 units of PRBC (no source
found for this blood loss). Patient's stool was also + for C.
Diff. His renal failure improved. Patient had low grade fevers
with a bld cx that grew 1/2 bottles GPR thought to possibly be a
contaminant. He was treated with PO Vanco for C. diff, Cefepime,
and flagyl.

On transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], patient was found to be hypotensive with
MAPs in the low 50s, systolics in the 70s. He improved slightly
with 1.9 L of IVF but then declined again and required
initiation of Levophed.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP): [**2109-9-13**]
Reason: evaluate for infiltrate
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man with tracheostomy, s/p resolved ptx with
ncreased secretions
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for infiltrate
INDICATION: Status post resolving pneumothorax, evaluate for
infiltration.
COMPARISON: Study from [**2109-9-8**].
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is limited evaluation
secondary to poor positioning of the patient. There appears to
be a tracheostomy positioned with the tip positioned within the
trachea. A right-sided PICC line is seen, with the tip
positioned in the upper SVC. There is an opacity overlying the
mediastinum, which is curved, and likely represent structures
outside the body. There is obscuration of the left
hemidiaphragm, suggesting likely atelectasis. There is slightly
increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent
with some pulmonary vasculature congestion.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vasculature congestion. Minimal
probable atelectasis at the left lung base.

Date of Birth:  [**2040-4-7**]        Sex:  M

Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 17274**]

PROCEDURE:  Rigid bronchoscopy.

LOCATION:  Operating theater.

ASSISTANT:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 17275**], M.D.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained from under Mr. [**Known lastname 17276**] Health Care Proxy, he was
brought to the operating theater where general anesthesia was
employed.  Due to Mr. [**Known lastname 17276**] profound contractures and
difficult anatomy, the tracheoscope was unable to be inserted
through the mouth and had to be inserted through his
tracheostomy stoma site. With great difficulty, the rigid
tracheoscope was inserted through the trachea stoma site to
the level above the carina. At this angle and due to the very
small nature of the tracheoscope, we were unable to deploy a
wide stent. At this point in the procedure, given the fact
that we could not safely deploy a stent, and there were no
therapeutic options which could performed in the safe
fashion, given the tortuous nature of his trachea and the
extreme difficulty in positioning this patient, given his
current contractures and given his profound underlying
medical problems, the procedure was aborted at this point. A
#8 [**Last Name (un) 295**] TTS tracheostomy tube was replaced through his
tracheal stoma.

FINDINGS:  Tortuous trachea, extremely difficult positioning,
great difficulty passing tracheoscope.

Procedure aborted secondary to not being able to safely
deploy stent into the airway.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED:  None.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.
