Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amitriptyline / Benzodiazepines / Morphine / Valium

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, cough, pedal edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- bronchoscopy
- central venous catheter/pulmonary artery catheter placement
- arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 47 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 8, VL [**Numeric Identifier 8638**] on
[**2122-10-19**]; compliant with HAART; history of high-grade resistance
patterns; no history of OIs; diagnosed [**2111**]; presumed contracted
from MSM contact) who presented to the Emergency Dept today with
six days of worsening bipedal edema, exertional dyspnea, and
fevers.  He reports a gradual worsening of his symptoms over the
past six days.  His exertional dyspnea has worsened to the
extent that he is dyspneic at rest.  He has had frequent
coughing which is mostly dry, but occasionally was producing
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum.  He has been having daily fevers as high as 102,
along with chills and sweats.  His PO intake has been decreased,
but he has been forcing himself to drink fluids.  He has
developed worsening orthopnea (now using 7 pillows at night;
usually uses 3 pillows).  He has been compliant with all of his
medications, including his HAART and his Bactrim prophylaxis.
When his symptoms began, he decided to increase his Bactrim use
to 3 DS tabs daily.  He has not had sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] did
receive this year's influenza vaccine and OMR indicates that he
received the Pneumovax in [**2117**].
.
He saw one of his PCP's colleagues earlier today and was
afebrile with a BP of 94/64, HR 100, and O2 sat of 94% on room
air.  A CXR was interpreted (on a wet read) as showing bilateral
opacities consistent with an opportunistic infection such as
Pneumocystis.  He was referred to the Emergency Department for
further evaluation.
.
On presentation to the ED, he was afebrile with a BP of 115/83,
HR 115, and O2 sat (by report) in the low-90s on room air. An
ABG at this time was 7.53/29/63.  He was noted by the triage RN
to be in some respiratory distress and was placed on CPAP, with
improvement in his O2sat up to 100%.  Out of concern for
Pneumocystis pneumonia, he was given 400mg of IV Bactrim and
60mg of prednisone.  His ECG was noted to have new T-wave
depressions in V2-V5, and a troponin-T was 1.67, BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**].  He
was given a 325mg aspirin.  Since this was thought to likely be
demand ischemia in the setting of an acute pulmonary process, no
anticoagulation was started after discussion by the ED team with
the cardiology consultant on call.  He was also noted to have a
worsening of his baseline anemia and was consented for a blood
transfusion (but was transferred to the MICU before the blood
had arrived to the ED).  Prior to transfer to the MICU, an ABG
on CPAP 7/5 with FiO2 50% was 7.48/33/247.
.
Review of Systems:
Notable for some mild chest discomfort while coughing (much
different from the patient's history of anginal pain).  He
denies any weight loss, hemoptysis, visual changes, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, or hematochezia.

Past Medical History:
- HIV/AIDS, diagnosed [**2111**]; genotyping in [**10/2116**] showed
high-grade NNRTI resistance, suspected to have PI-resistance as
well; no history of OIs
- Two-vessel CAD; inferior STEMI in [**2114**] (totally-occluded RCA,
two mid-LAD lesions; all of them stented); BMS to RPLB in [**3-/2118**]
(in the setting of positive stress and angina); DES to mid-LAD
(in-stent restenosis; in the setting of worsening fatigue and
exertional dyspnea)
- Diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure (LVEF 37-50%,
depending on study; no echo on the OMR)
- Dyslipidemia
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Hypertension
- Severe peripheral neuropathy, thought secondary to stavudine;
on very large narcotic regimen
- C5-C6 diskectomy and fusion in [**2110**]
- Emphysema
- Depression

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location (un) 3844**] with his long-term partner.
[**Name (NI) **] has smoked [**3-22**] ppd for the past 30 years.  He does not drink
alcohol and has no history of drug use including IV drug use.

Family History:
He denies any family history of cancer or lung disease.  His
mother has diabetes and coronary artery disease.  He reports
that multiple family members have had MIs at early ages.

CXR ([**2122-12-15**]):
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal with cardiac size top
normal. Hazy opacity is in the hilar regions bilaterally.  There
are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
pneumothorax.  There is no overt CHF.
.
ECG ([**2122-12-15**]):
Sinus tachycardia with ventricular rate 115 bpm, normal axis,
normal intervals. ST segment depressions in leads V2-V5, new
from prior ECGs.
.
TTE ([**2122-12-16**]):
Left ventricular cavity is enlarged. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
distal [**1-20**] of the anterior wall, septum and apex, and
hypokinesis of the lateral wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF 30-35%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated,
with hypokinesis of the basal half of the free wall. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An eccentric jet of
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
TTE ([**2122-12-18**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is
