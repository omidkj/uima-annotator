HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old female
with a history of MDS diagnosed in [**2157-2-18**] requiring
serial platelet and RBC transfusions every two weeks
presenting with a history of bronchitis, who was treated as
an outpatient with Augmentin, who was then admitted to the
Medicine service on the [**3-4**].  Patient was
initially treated with the following antibiotics:  Zithromax,
cefepime, and Vancomycin.  Her chest x-ray was consistent
with pneumonia on the right side and mild volume overload.
The patient was persistently febrile with a cough and had new
onset atrial fibrillation with hypoxic episodes.  There was
concern regarding her relative immunosuppression and
therefore, the patient was started on Bactrim treatment and
was transferred to the MICU for management of hypoxia,
possible intubation, and concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].

In the MICU, the patient's oxygen saturations fluctuated.
She was 93% on 100% nonrebreather.  She continued to complain
of sensation of shortness of breath, but denied any chest
pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  She was delirious
and somewhat confused at her initial presentation in the
MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As noted above.
1. MDS.
2. CHF.
3. AFib.
4. CVA diagnosed in [**2156**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol abuse.  No tobacco.  She has two
grown children and lives at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical exam was notable for a T
max of 102.6.  She was tachycardic, atrial fibrillation at
126-136 was her ventricular rate, blood pressure ranged from
95-111/48-55.  Her respiratory rate ranged from 33-40.  She
was 93-94% on 100% nonrebreather.  Her exam was notable for
elderly appearing frail female, who was oriented x1.  She had
regular tachycardia, S1, S2.  Pulmonary examination:
Bronchial breath sounds with bibasilar crackles.  Abdominal
examination was soft, obese.  Extremity examination was
unremarkable.

Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with normal axis and
intervals.  She had old T-wave inversions in V1 through V4,
otherwise no evidence of acute ischemia.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Remarkable for platelets of 13,000 and
hematocrit of 28.3.  Upon admission to the MICU, her ABG was
7.52, 23, 66.  Lactate 2, TSH 1.4, fibrinogen 818.

Echocardiogram from the [**2-23**]:  Ejection fraction
60%, left atrial dilatation, [**12-22**]+ TR, no vegetations.

RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:  Showed pulmonary congestion with possible
infiltrates.

CT of her abdomen from the [**3-4**] notable for
ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, otherwise it was
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Respiratory failure, pneumonia, and CHF:  The patient had
persistent temperature spikes.  She was maintained on triple
antibiotic regimen, however, persistently spiked and without
any change in her chest x-ray or symptoms.  In the setting of
her immunosuppression, there is a higher suspicion for PCP
and fungal etiologies, therefore, the patient was maintained
on Vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime, and Bactrim.

The patient had a history of oral herpetic lesions in the
past and was started on acyclovir as well.  Given the
patient's poor respiratory status as well as overall poor
prognosis.  The patient's family agreed to pursue comfort
measures only.

2. MDS:  The patient's platelets remained below 15,000
despite multiple transfusions.  There is no evidence of
active bleeding.

3. Change in mental status and fever:  CT of the head was
performed to evaluate any evidence of an acute intracranial
hemorrhage.  There was no evidence of that.  CTA was also
performed to evaluate for any evidence of a pulmonary embolus
given the patient's ongoing hypoxia.

In summary, given the patient's overall poor prognosis and
ongoing hypoxia despite very broad coverage with
antimicrobials, a family meeting confirmed the patient's code
status DNR/DNI as well as pursuing comfort measures only.
The patient proceeded to become more tachypneic and
tachycardic throughout her hospital course.  All of her
antibiotics were withdrawn and the patient was put on a
Morphine drip titration to comfort measures.

On [**2158-11-11**], patient was sedated and reportedly
unresponsive to verbal stimuli, and was persistently
tachycardic.  On the [**11-12**], the patient died.
Family members were present at the time of death which was
4:20 a.m.  Family declined an autopsy.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia
and myelodysplastic syndrome.  Immediate cause of death was
respiratory failure.
