Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Left humerus fracture


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open reduction and internal fixation of L humerus fracture.


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] is a 67yo woman with a history notable for renal
cell carcinoma diagnosed [**2107**] s/p left nephrectomy. She has
known mets to brain, bone, lungs, adrenal gland and abdominal
cavity. She is currently s/p 2 cycles of chemotherapy. On [**1-28**],
she felt her arm give way while pushing open a door, and was
taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a left
humerus fracture. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-1**] to the
orthopedic service. A skeletal survey showed a right distal
humeral metastatic lesion as well. The patient underwent an
uncomplicated ORIF on [**2111-2-3**] preceded by a "preembolization" of
the lesion by IR. Radiation oncology saw her and planned on
doing outpatient xrt. However approximately 3 days post-op, she
developed abdominal distension, decreased bs, and then began
vomiting bilious liquid. A CT head to look for increased ICP was
done and was negative and additionally the known cerebellar
lesion seen on MRI was not seen. She was diagnosed with an ileus
and NGT was placed to suction. General surgery began following
the patient. She developed decreased UOP and was transferred on
[**2-9**] to the SICU for closer fluid management. The patient
received > 8 L of fluid (difficult to track exact amount) while
in the ICU and CVPs were consistently 15.  Patient had CT torso
while in the unit which showed adynamic ileus, no large/small
bowel obstruction, new pulmonary, mesenteric, right adrenal
metastases. Patient was transferred to the floor on [**2-10**] with
NGT which is now clamped with low residuals of about 100 cc
every four hours. She was started on TPN during this time and
has continued on this. She has begun to have liquid stools and
flatus. She has had continued decreased urine output that has
not responded to .5-1 L boluses but has responded to IV lasix.
She has been markedly hypokalemic and has required aggressive
repletion.

The patient currently reports no chest pain, no sob, slight
abdominal tenderness in mid epigastrium. NO fevers or chills or
sweats.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a new pleural-based
mass at the right base measuring 2.0 x 3.9 cm. Adjacent
atelectatic changes and a tiny right-sided pleural effusion are
also present. Otherwise, the appearance of multiple pulmonary
nodules noted at the left base is similar. The large cystic
lesion in the liver has an unchanged appearance. Surgical clips
are seen in the gallbladder fossa consistent with prior
cholecystectomy. The pancreas and spleen are unremarkable. The
right kidney is unremarkable. There is a new right adrenal mass
measuring 10 x 25 mm. The size of the previously described
lesion in the left nephrectomy bed, however, is somewhat smaller
and measures 3.5 x 4.4 cm in axial dimensions.

There are new mesenteric masses in the upper abdomen. One
measures 17 x 36 mm and the second one 12 mm in diameter. There
is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or free air. A small
amount of perihepatic ascites is noted, however. Edema seen
extensively in the subcutaneous soft tissues.

A nasogastric tube lies in suitable position with its tip in the
distal stomach. Contrast passes into the proximal jejunum only.
More distally, the small bowel is mostly filled with fluid.
There is fecal material and gas in the colon. There are areas of
mild small bowel dilatation, and segments of mild colonic
dilatation as well, most notably in the transverse colon.
However, no transition point is seen, and the overall pattern is
consistent with adynamic ileus.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in
the urinary bladder. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free
fluid. Subcutaneous edema is noted. Fluid and fecal material are
seen in the rectum and sigmoid.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1) Likely adynamic ileus with no evidence of small or large
bowel obstruction.

2) More extensive metastatic disease as described.

FINDINGS: There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or change in the size of the
ventricles. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation remains
intact. There is no new evidence of a major vascular territorial
infarct. There is a stable area of low attenuation in the left
basal ganglia, which could represent a lacunar infarct. The
known left cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellar vermis masses
are not appreciated on this study. There is no new mass effect.
The paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or new mass effect. The
known cerebellar masses are not appreciated on this study. Note
should be made that MRI is the preferred method of modality to
evaluate the posterior fossa.


Brief Hospital Course:
##Ortho: pt underwent ORIF without complications as described in
the HPI. She remained stable and B arms were made non-weight
bearing. She also has tumor in right humerus and should be moved
carefully given high risk of pathologic fracture of right
humerus. She will receive radiation to her arms by rad onc as
described below. She will follow up with ortho in 2 weeks with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 55088**].
.
## GI: As described above, she had a KUB that showed adynamic
ileus. After bowel rest with NGT to suction for several days she
began passing liquid stools. She continued to have some nausea
and preferred not to take solid po's for this reason. She had no
vomiting. Her abdominal exam remained with some slight
tenderness in the LUQ and periumbilical region, but there was no
rebound or guarding. She complained mostly of gas and bloating
with diarrhea which continues to improve slowly day by day. She
was treated with anzimet and simethicone with some relief. Her
diet should be advanced as tolerated and TPN weaned as more po's
are tolerated. Diarrhea should be monitored and anti-motility
agents held.
.
## Respiratory: The pt continued to complain of SOB and DOE. She
appeared clinically volume overloaded, although CXR was
difficult to interpret [**12-31**] her size. She was diuresed with lasix
20mg IV tid and showed significant improvement. She also had
audible wheezes on exam although she states she has no h/o
asthma or COPD. She was treated with RTC albuterol and atrovent
nebs and improved clinically. Volume status should be evaluated
and maintenance dose of lasix 40mg po qd should be adjusted as
needed.
.
## Rad Onc: attempt was made to get
