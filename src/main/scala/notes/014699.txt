Brief Hospital Course:
On [**10-19**] he was admitted and underwent mitral repair as
noted.  See operative note for details.  Attempts at minimally
invasive repair were abandoned due to rapid atrial fibrillation.
He weaned from bypass on nitroglycerin, propofol and amiodarone.
He required multiple defibrillations for VT in the operating
room, but stabilized on amiodarone.  He was extubated without
difficulty the evening of surgery.

Following transfer to the floor on the day after surgery he
remained stable.  CTs were discontinued as were pacing wires.
He was diuresed to his preoperative weight. Amiodarone was
continued and beta blockers added, with maintenance of sinus
rhythm.

Diuretics were continued after discharge for a week as he still
was 5 kg above his preoperative weight.

All medications and directions were discussed with him prior to
discharge.
