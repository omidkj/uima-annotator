Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9063**] is an 87 year old male with a history significant for
atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, dementia, CAD s/p CABG
[**2174**], CVA [**2185**], chronic systolic CHF, chronic urinary retention
with indwelling catheter, recently hospitalized in mid-[**Month (only) 205**] s/p
fall/UTI, now with lethargy and hypotension.

#SIRS/Urinary tract infection: patient came in hypotensive,
tachycardic, with an elevated white count.  Most likely source
was a UTI secondary to his chronic foley. He was started on
ceftriaxone and fluid bolused.  His pressures came up to
110s-120s systolic after fluid resuscitation.  His white count
trended down and he remained afebrile.  On D3 of
hospitalization, his urine cx returned E. coli and enterococcus
with multiple antibiotic resistances.  It was determined that,
given his multiple co-morbidities and need for a chronic foley,
that he would need a longterm course of IV antibiotics (10
days).  As per the sensitivities, ceftriaxone was changed to
cefepime.  Enterococcus was sensitive to ampicillin so he was
started on ampicillin. A PICC line was placed on [**2196-9-7**] and he
was sent to the medical floor.

# Leukocytosis:  WBC fell from 28 on arrival to 14-15.  It is 15
on day of discharge.  Patient is afebrile, with no other signs
of infection.  No diarrhea to suggest Cdiff.  CXR does not
reveal pneumonia.

# Pleural effusions:  Seen on CXR, but patient not hypoxic, so
he was not diuresced aggressively in light of his poor oral
intake.  Patient not tachypneic or in any respiratory distress.


#Acute renal failure: patient's creatinine was 1.5 on admission,
responded well to fluid boluses, and on transfer to the floor
was 1.0.

#Mental status: patient has baseline dementia and was still
pleasantly demented throughout his stay on the ICU.  He remained
oriented only to self.

# Anorexia:  Patient very disinterested in eating.  Denied any
pain on eating or any pain whatsoever.  He would eat a few bites
of food and simply stop.

# Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient not anticoagulated.  Continued
ASA 325 mg daily.  On long acting metoprolol XL 12.5 mg po bid.
HR remained in the 100-110 during his hospital stay.

GOALS OF CARE:  Despite treatment with appropriate antibiotics,
Mr [**Known lastname 9063**] had persistant anorexia throughout his hospital stay
which was accompanied by poor urine output.  He was put on low
dose IV fluids to help him maintain adequate urine output.
I spoke with his PCP Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5263**] and his son and health
care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 9063**].  We discussed that his recurrent UTIs
and anorexia are events that occur at the end of life,
