Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 4 [**10-25**], [**10-27**], [**11-4**], [**11-8**]


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 41 yo M with PMH of pulmonary hypertension, ESLD from
alcohol and hepatitis C on [**Month/Year (2) **] list, hypothyroidism who
presents with altered mental status. He is currently intubated
so history taken from his mother over the phone and from [**Name (NI) **] and
chart. The day prior to presentation, the patient was
complaining of feeling sick and nauseated. He vomited several
times but did take all of his medications per his mother as she
gives them to him. She went to check on him the morning of
presentation and he was unresponsive and gagging on emesis. She
called EMS. She reports that the patient has been having 2 bowel
movements per day over the last two days. Denies known fevers,
chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Of note, he has gained
significant weight and his spironolactone was increased from 100
to 200mg daily and then up to 300mg on [**2147-10-24**].
.
At the OSH, he was intubated for airway protection. CXR was
negative for infiltrate, u/a was clean and CT of the head was
negative for an acute process. He was given lasix 100mg x1 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In our ED, his initial vitals were T 96.4, HR 104, BP 132/87,
100% o2sat on vent. He had a repeat CXR to confirm his ETT
placement. A RUQ u/s showed small stones and marked ascites, and
he had a diagnostic paracentesis. He was given levo/flagyl
empirically and was given lactulose.
.
Currently, he is on the vent, but following some commands and
denies pain.

Imaging:
[**2147-10-25**] RUQ U/S: Limited study due to marked ascites.
1. Cirrhotic, shrunken liver. 2. Thickened, collapsed
gallbladder with multiple shadowing echogenic foci consistent
with calcified gallstones. Possible stone within the neck.
.
[**2147-10-25**] CXR: The lungs are of low volume, most likely due to
poor inspiratory effort. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. There are no focal pulmonary consolidations.
.
[**2147-11-15**] Abd US:
1. Findings consistent with liver cirrhosis, no focal lesion.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Large abdominal ascites.
.
[**2147-11-15**] CXR: The heart is not enlarged. There is no CHF, focal
infiltrate, or effusion. Compared with [**2147-11-10**], the ET tube and
NG tube have been removed. Note is made of a subtle narrowing of
the upper trachea, at a level approximately 6.1 cm above the
carina -- ? subtle tracheomalacia.
.
ECHO [**2147-11-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size. A secundum
type atrial septal defect is probably present. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild
to moderate pulmonary hypertension (estimated PASP 42-52 mm Hg).
Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Probable secundum type
atrial septal defect (known positive bubble study on [**2147-8-15**]).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-10-20**],
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher
(IVC not well visualized on prior study).

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
OSH course [**10-25**]
41 yo male with pmh of pulmonary htn, ESLD from etoh/hepC on the
[**Month/Day (1) **] list, admitted on [**10-25**] after being found down with
altered mental status and vomitting by his mother on [**10-24**].
[**Name2 (NI) 3003**] to admission he had nonbloody n/v x 2 days and it was
thought that he may have not taken his lactulose.  When his
mother found him down, EMS took him to an OSH where he was
intubated for airway protection.  Imaging including CXR and CT
head were unremarkable.  He was given 100 mg IV lasix x1 and
tansferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
ED and Initial MICU course [**Date range (1) 77407**]
In our ED he was given levo/flagyl and a diagnostic para was
done which didn't showed evidence of SBP.  He was given
lactulose in the MICU and was extubated on [**10-25**] as his mental
status cleared.  Levo/flagyl was stopped and he was continued on
his prophylactic cipro.  His Tbili began to increase to 8.5 (was
baseline [**3-25**]) and an abd US showed stones with a posssible stone
at the neck of the gallbladder.
.
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] course [**Date range (1) 77408**]
He was called out to the floor on [**10-26**] and had a therapeutic
para which removed 4 L of fluid and showed no evidence of SBP.
The morning after transfer on [**10-27**] he was found unresponsive and
hypoxic to the 80's.  A code was called and he was intubated for
airway protection and transfered to the MICU.
.
MICU course [**Date range (1) 45409**]
While in the ICU the patient was given lactulose.  A CT of his
chest showed no evidence of pneumonia or aspiration. There was
initally concern for decreased withdrawal in his lower
extremities and neuro was consulted for concern for possible
seizure activity or other neurologic involvement.  He had a head
CT on [**10-27**] which showed no acute change, but did
