HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with chest pain on
[**2154-7-14**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for management of an acute
myocardial infarction.

He has a history of atrial fibrillation since [**2143**], deep
venous thrombosis, and colon cancer.  His cardiac risk
factors include a remote smoking history,
hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of myocardial
infarctions.

He was in his usual state of health until the morning of
[**7-14**] when he developed acute chest pain when getting up at
4 a.m.   The pain appeared localized mostly to his back
without any radiation.  He did not have symptoms of dyspnea.
No nausea, and no diaphoresis.  He was able to go back to
sleep and woke up again at 5 a.m. with severe squeezing chest
pain localized to the anterior chest.  He rated the pain
[**10-31**]; again no radiation, no dyspnea, no nausea, and no
diaphoresis were noted.  He had never had this type of chest
pain before.  He also had not experienced any recent changes
in exercise tolerance of being able to walk about one flight
of stairs (limited by dyspnea and not limited by pain).  He
did not give any history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He does have chronic leg edema which has not
changed recently.

He was brought to [**Hospital6 33**] where he received four
doses of sublingual nitroglycerin which relieved the chest
pain temporarily.  An electrocardiogram at [**Hospital6 3426**] showed ST elevations in V2 to V6.  His cardiologist
is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11378**] at [**Hospital6 1708**], but due to an
unavailability of beds he was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.

The initial electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 190**] showed marked ST elevations in leads I, aVL,
and V2 to V6, with reciprocal depressions over the inferior
leads, as well as a right bundle-branch block pattern, and
left axis deviation.

Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] showed total occlusion of the left anterior descending
artery after first heart sound, diffuse irregularities in the
right coronary artery, but no significant disease in the left
main coronary artery and left circumflex.  The left anterior
descending artery occlusion was successfully stented;
however, no reflow resulted.

He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of
his acute myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation since [**2143**].
2.  Congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial
fibrillation.
3.  Deep venous thrombosis in [**2134**] and [**2150**] (the latter in
the setting of colectomy).
4.  Colon cancer, status post colectomy with colostomy in
[**2150**].
5.  Arthritis.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  One past episode of hematuria of unclear etiology.
8.  Depression.
9.  Benign prostatic hyperplasia with transurethral resection
of prostate a little more than five years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., Zestril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
furosemide 40 mg p.o. q.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
verapamil 240 mg p.o. q.d., naproxen 500 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired police officer.  He lives
with his wife in [**Name (NI) 11379**].  He smoked four packs per day
for over 10 years, but he quit 40 years ago.  He occasionally
drinks alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His brother died from a myocardial
infarction at the age of 56.  His father died from "heart
disease" at the age of 40.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed vital signs
with a temperature of 97, blood pressure of 110/60, heart
rate of 77, respiratory rate of 16, pulse oximetry 90% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  General appearance revealed the
patient was tired-appearing but in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  His sclerae were anicteric.  He had moist mucous
membranes, and no appreciable oral lesions.  Neck revealed
jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess due to the
supine position.  No carotid bruits were appreciated.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregularly irregular
rhythm with a [**3-27**] holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating
to the axilla.  The lungs had mild diffuse wheezes
throughout.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with active bowel sounds.  A well-healed
midline scar, and a colostomy bag in place on the left side.
Extremities revealed 1 to 2+ pitting edema on both legs and
chronic venous stasis changes.  Good distal pulses.  The
catheterization site in the right groin were remarkable for
dressing soaked with blood.  No hematoma or bruits were
evident.  Neurologic examination revealed the patient was
alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  No drift.  Full grip strength.  Plantar flexion
strength was [**5-26**].  His reflexes were symmetric.  His toes
were equivocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
at the time of admission to the Coronary Care Unit, his
hematocrit was 43.4, white blood cell count was 7.9, platelet
count was 161.  His PT was 16.9, INR of 2, PTT of 23.2.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 4.9, chloride of 106, bicarbonate
of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 29, creatinine of 0.9, blood
glucose of 203.  The initial creatine kinase was 114, and the
CK/MB was 7, troponin I was less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram performed status post
catheterization showed atrial fibrillation with an average
ventricular response of 69, marked ST elevations were noted
in leads I, aVL, and V2 through V6; suggesting an acute
myocardial infarction.  There was also a right bundle-branch
block pattern and left axis deviation.

A chest x-ray from [**Hospital6 33**] showed evidence of
congestive heart failure as well as small right-sided pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Following catheterization, he was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] Coronary
Care Unit with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

He was started on aspirin, Plavix, and an 18-hour course
Integrilin following catheterization, and metoprolol and
nitroglycerin drip for management of chest pain and blood
pressure.  His Coumadin had been held for catheterization,
and he was started on heparin for anticoagulation in the
setting of atrial fibrillation.  His digoxin, verapamil,
Lasix, and Zestril were initially held.

He was initially not given an intravenous fluids as his
physical examination and outside chest x-ray suggested
possible mild fluid overload.

An echocardiogram was planned for the next day.  Over the
course of the first night he had three short episodes of
chest pain and nausea which were relieved by nitroglycerin.
One of them required 1 mg of morphine.  Electrocardiograms at
that time with chest pain showed developing Q waves, but no
new ST elevations.  Serial creatine kinases were drawn which
peaked at the second creatine kinase at 5856, the CK/MB
was 482, and the MB index was 8.3.  The third creatine kinase
was 3586, CK/MB of 258, MB index of 7.2.

In the morning of [**7-15**], he became hypotensive to a blood
pressure of 80/40.  He had not yet given consent for a
central line.  He was given two fluid boluses of 250 cc of
normal saline which stabilized his blood pressure.  However,
over the next few hours he developed considerable respiratory
distress requiring increasing concentrations of oxygen and a
brief course of BiPAP.  A chest x-ray showed evidence of
congestive heart failure.  He now gave consent for central
line, and a right internal jugular line was put in place. He
was given a total of 160 mg of intravenous Lasix with great
improveme
