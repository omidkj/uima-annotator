Allergies:

Chief Complaint:
fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, stomach pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 46-year-old with a history of intracranial
hemorrhage secondary to AVM s/p evacuation in [**2179-8-27**],
complicated by hydrocephalus requiring VP shunt, brought in from
[**Hospital3 2558**] nursing home. She has a tracheostomy and PEG. She
has undergone rehabilitation at [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital1 8**] and
[**Location (un) 1036**] [**Location (un) 620**]. During her time at [**Location (un) 1036**], she was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and found to have a mucous plug
with sputum culture positive for MRSA, as well as E. faecalis
urinary tract infection (sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin, and
furantoin) treated with nitrofurantoin x 6 days. She was
transferred from [**Location (un) 1036**] to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2180-5-30**]. Per a
[**Hospital3 2558**] employee who spoke with the patient's respiratory
therapist, the patient was noted to have increasingly voluminous
secretions requiring increasingly frequent sunctioning (every
four hours -> every two hours -> every hour -> every 30
minutes). She was febrile to 101.2 with a heart rate in the
120s.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were HR 126, BP 90/68, RR 26, O2 99% on ?
O2. She was thought to have suprapubic tenderness on exam. Chest
X-ray revealed no acute intrathoracic process. Urinalysis was
leukocyte- and nitrite-positive with many bacteria. Sputum
Gram-stain and culture, blood culture, and urine culture went
sent. She received cefepime 2g IV x 1 and linezolid 600mg IV x 1
for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia and urinary tract
infection, plus acetaminophen and fluids.
.
On the floor she is noted to be hypotensive to 82/palp and is
triggered in the setting of losing her IV access. She is
admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring. In the MICU she
denies complaints.
.
 In the MICU pt received fluid boluses (6.5L total) to treat
hypotension, but did not receive pressors. Linezolid and
cefepime were continued [**12-29**] vanc allergy. CXR revealed
questionable pneumonia with retrocardiac opacity vs atelectasis,
and current abx should treat for any HAP as well. On hospital
day 3, pt's hypotension stabilized, with SBPs in the 100s. At
time of txfr, sputum culture taken is growing GNR, which will
need to be followed. Urine Cx revealed E. coli sensitive to
cefepime. Pt's lactate trended down with condition improvement.
Pt was transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, pt remained stable, with SBPs in the 100s.
Midodrine was added to pt's regimen, with resumption of normal
blood pressures in the 110s to 120s. Pt remained afebrile on the
floor, with no adverse events. Cefepime and Linezolid were
continued. Pt was restarted on her normal cycled tube feeding
regimen from continuous feeds, which she tolerated well.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; she has had ongoing hyperthermia thought to a
"central fever"/reset thermostat, though she was afebrile on
discharge from [**Location (un) 1036**] (T 98.0); husband also notes that she
has complained of intermittent headache recently; she is
constipated at baseline
(-) Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias

Past Medical History:
Intracranial hemorrhage in [**2179-8-27**]
s/p VP shunt
Enterococcus faecalis UTI ([**2-4**])
Mucous plug ([**2-4**])
MRSA colonized
Situational depression

Social History:
Cared for by husband, who is her guardian. Currently [**Name2 (NI) 546**] at
[**Hospital3 2558**] ([**Location (un) **]), a nursing facility, but has spent
the last ~9 months at [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital1 8**] and [**Location (un) 1036**]
[**Location (un) 620**]. [**University/College **] grad [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] note.

DISCHARGE LABS:

STUDIES:
cxr [**2180-6-3**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
Mild amount of subcutaneous air in the anterior abdominal wall
inferiorly is likely related to injections.
Trace pelvic free fluid, could be physiologic (if patient
pre-menopausal), or could relate to VP shunt.
