Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
right leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient seen and examined, in brief, 64 yo female with h/o PUD,
CAD, Crohn's disease who presented to the ER with right leg
heaviness and subsequently became hypotensive to 70's and
admitted to MICU. Pt was seen in clinic for f/u of recent GIB
and noted sudden onset of R leg "heaviness" and difficulty
ambulating prior to her visit. She does have a long history of
back/left leg pain on oxycontin and ambulates with a cane. She
does note increased diarrhea in the past few weeks but was not
specifically feeling dehydrated prior to admission. She also
noted intermittent headaches for a week relieved by ASA. Prior
to her office visit today she noted difficulty w/ambulating d/t
heaviness in her leg. No bowel or bladder incontinence. She had
no weakness or numbness in any other part of her body, but
thought she may have had slurred speech. In clinic her BP was
90/56. She was noted to have [**4-14**] R deltoid strenthg and
tremulousness of the right LE. She was referred to the ER.
.
In the ER her VS were: T:97.2 HR 80 BP 70/60 and O2 sat 100% 4L

She was seen by neurology for a code stroke. A head CTA showed
unchanged small bilateral basal ganglia chronic lacunar infarcts
and no stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. Neuro did not
feel presentation was c/w stroke. She was given 3L of IVF and 10
mg decadron, with improvement in her pressures to the systolics
of 130s. CXR and UA neg. She had a non-contrast abd CT that
preliminary showed no source for infection. Creatinine on admit
was 3.4 but this improved to 1.7 with iv fluids.

Pertinent Results:
Diagnostics:
EKG: NSR, rate 71, No STE or depressions, q in III
.
CXR: Limited study with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CTA Head and Neck: 1. No evidence of perfusion abnormality.
2. Small infarct in the left internal capsule, new since prior
CT of [**2101-3-9**], and of uncertain chronicity. If there remains
concern for ischemia, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute
infarct.
3. Mild atherosclerotic disease within the proximal left ICA,
with 25% stenosis at this level.
CT perfusion: normal
.
CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. No evidence of perfusion abnormality.
2. Small infarct in the left internal capsule, new since prior
CT of [**2101-3-9**], and of uncertain chronicity. If there remains
concern for ischemia, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute
infarct.
3. Mild atherosclerotic disease within the proximal left ICA,
with 25% stenosis at this level.
.
.
MRI L-spine [**5-16**]: No evidence of epidural abscess or canal
compromise. Multilevel degenerative changes. Midline soft tissue
edema at L1 through L4, unchanged from [**2101-6-4**], and may
relate to soft tissue edema from patient immobility.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female with h/o CAD, Crohn's, DM2 and lumbar radiculopathy
who presents with RLE weakness, ARF and hypotension resolved
with hydration. Pt was initially admitted to MICU but responded
to fluids rapidly and had no further hypotension; was called out
to the floor the following am.
.
#Weakness: Pt has had R sided backpain over the past week with
sudden onset of weakness. History c/w radiculopathy possibly d/t
disc bulge or nerve irritation. No saddle anesthesia,
bowel/bladder incontinence to suggest cauda equina or cord
compression. She received a CT/CTA which showed a likely old
internal capsule lesion but no areas of acute stroke. The day
after admission, her new symptoms had resolved, but she
continued to complain of left leg pain and right knee numbness
(all old symptoms). She was followed by neurology who
recommended against further work up.
.
#Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension on
admission, likely dehydration from chronic diarrhea and
diuretics as outpt.  Antihypertensives were held. I
