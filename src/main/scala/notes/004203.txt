History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41330**] is a 60yo F w/hx of CAD s/p IMI PCI to LCx [**2164**], CHF

recurrent C. Diff who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital1 5109**] for hip fracture. She was previously admitted [**2167-10-1**]
for C. Diff pancolitis, discharged on [**2167-10-6**] on PO vancomycin.
During that stay she had a CT scan showing pancolitis. While
walking into the house on [**2167-10-6**], she tripped and fell off of 2
stairs. No LOC. She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] were she
was found to have a R intertrochanteric hip fracture which was
displaced. She was evaluated by orthopedics and cardiology who
recommended transfer to [**Hospital 86**] hospital for more sophisticated
intraoperative cardiac monitoring and higher level postoperative
surgical ICU.
.
On arrival, she is somnolent and complaining of pain in the R
hip. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever. She has
mild abdominal pain. Per her husband and daughter, she has been
having several ([**7-8**]) BMs per day with some blood in the stool.
Otherwise, no complaints.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied

RADIOLOGY:
AXR [**10-15**]:
ABDOMEN, SINGLE VIEW: Bowel gas pattern is non-obstructive.
There is
interval improvement of small bowel dilatation as compared to
[**2167-10-13**].
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Air is visualized in
the rectum.  An NG tube is coiled in the stomach. Scattered
phleboliths are seen in the right hemipelvis. A gamma nail in
the right femoral head is partially visualized.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
.
CXR [**10-15**]:
FINDINGS: The support lines and tubes are unchanged. The
evaluation is
limited by motion. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The lung
volumes
remain low, with right infrahilar and left retrocardiac
atelectasis. Small
left effusion may be present. There is no pulmonary edema.
.
CT head [**10-11**]:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci
are large bilaterally, consistent with global parenchymal volume
loss. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are also
bilateral, the sequela of chronic microvascular ischemia.
Extracranial soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The
included mastoid air cells are notable for partial opacification
of the mastoid air cells on the right/underpneumatization. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells
.
ECHO [**10-9**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small
and underfilled. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 50-55%), although in the context of a small cavity size, this
may be slightly underestimated. The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypertrophied and markedly hypokinetic
right ventricle. Small left ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary
hypertension.
.
[**10-8**] Femur X-ray
Six fluoroscopic images of the right femur demonstrate interval
placement of an intramedullary rod with proximal gamma nail.
This is fixating an
intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur. There is good
anatomic
alignment and no hardware-related complications. The
