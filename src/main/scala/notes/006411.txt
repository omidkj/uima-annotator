Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / Nsaids

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1631**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with multiple
medical problems including atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter,
diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for respiratory distress.
Per EMS, patient oxygen saturation was 89% on 4 liters nasal
cannula which increased to 100% on 15 liters, heart rate in 70s,
blood pressure 150/90, respiratory rate 32 and with crackles in
all lung fields bilaterally. EMS gave patient lasix 40mg IV and
1 sublingual nitroglycerin.
.
In ED, oxygen saturation in the 80s on non-rebreather and
patient was transiently placed on positive pressure noninvasive
mask ventilation for ~2 hours. Pt was also given another 40 IV
lasix in emergency department.
.
Upon arrival to ICU, patient's oxygen saturation was 99-100% on
4 liters nasal cannula, having produced ~400cc urine since
arrival from the nursing home. When asked about the events
leading to her hospitalization, she remembers developing right
upper quadrant abdominal pain followed by acute worsening of her
shortness of breath. Patient and her daughter state that this is
exactly how her previous episodes of acute pulmonary edema have
presented. Per daughter, patient had a "high salt" meal
yesterday night, including "salmon lox."
.
Patient's daughter reports ~six episodes of acute pulmonary
edema requiring hospitalization over the past 5-6 months,
primarily at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital and [**Hospital1 18**].
.
ROS: Denies chest pain, palpitations, bright red blood per
rectum, melena, or other complaints.

Past Medical History:
1. diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 70%)
complicated by frequent admissions with acute pulmonary edema
2. atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2183-3-1**]: Mild CHF.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT  [**2183-3-1**]: Borderline distended loops
of small bowel in the central abdomen may represent early or
partial small bowel obstruction. Given the limited nature of the
study if clinical concern persists, repeat radiograph with
supine and upright views would be helpful to further
characterize these findings.
.
Cath ([**8-30**]): no CAD (30% LCx).
.
ECHO ([**11-30**]): symmetric LVH w/EF>55%, dilated LA, [**1-27**]+ MR.
.
ECG: Afib@100, nl axis, nl QRS int, QTc slightly prolonged. LVH.
ST/TW changes discordant from large QRS diffusely. Unchanged
from old ECG except for rate.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident with MMP
including atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, diastolic
congestive heart failure, and hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy who presented with acute pulmonary edema that
stabilized with IV nitro, lasix, and transient CPAP, now stable
on room air. No clear precipitant except possibly dietary
indiscretion.
.
# Respiratory distress/CHF exacerbation: Stabilized after nitro
drip, IV lasix, CPAP and now on NC. Chest x-ray and BNP also
supported congestive heart failure as likely etiology.
Precipitant may have been dietary indiscretion but patient also
had some epigastric/right upper quadrant pain. Cardiac enzymes
were cycled and were negative x3. ECG showed early repol but no
ischemic-appearing acute ST changes. HR was only in 70-80s
throughout episode so it was not thought that rapid afib was
contributing. No clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia.
No signs or symptoms to suggest pulmonary embolism at this time.
Patient was monitored on for her atrial fibrillation and rate
controlled with metoprolol XL. Patient also continued on
amiodarone. Patient was aggressively diuresed with good effect.
Lisinopril was resumed on [**2183-3-2**]. Patient's oxygen was weaned
from 4L and at time of discharge was sat'ing 95% on room air.
.
Incidentally, a 5mm calcified granuloma was seen on chest x-ray.
No interstitial process or opacities were seen otherwise and
patient's wheezing, oxygen requirement and breathing improved
dramatically with diuresis only. As a result, there was a low
suspicion for amiodarone lung toxicity. Patient will need a
follow-up chest CT to follow-up the new calcified granuloma.
.
# Renal: Creat 1.7 at admission (baseline ~1.0-1.4), possibly
related to poor perfusion during acute CHF exacerbation, now
improved. UA negative. Good UOP. Patient was resumed on ACE-I
[**2183-3-2**].
.
# Afib/Flutter: Currently in Afib @ 80-100s. As stated above,
don't believe contributed to worsening CHF. Continued on Toprol
XL and amiodarone. Continued on coumadin, goal INR 2-2.5
.
# CAD: clean coronaries on cath in [**8-30**]. Continued statin.
.
# Anemia: low-normal MCV. Iron studies in [**11-30**] consistent with
anemia of chronic disease but with adequate iron stores
(ferritin 150). Hematocrit has been stable. No signs or symptoms
of active bleeding.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued Synthroid at outpatient dose
.
# FEN: low-Na+ diet; repleted lytes as patient diuresed
.
# Prophyl: SC heparin, protonix, regular insulin sliding scale
was discontinued since fingersticks were not elevated.
.
# Code: upon clarification with pt's daughter, FULL CODE.
.
# Dispo: discharge to rehab.
