Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, post-operative blood loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extraction and replacement of pacemaker.


History of Present Illness:
80F with h/o complete heart block s/p DDD pacer with atrial and
ventricular lead malfunction who presented for lead extraction
and re-implantation of new system.  Procedure complicated by
significant blood loss from subclavian vein access site.
Patient's pressures dropped into 50's post-procedure, requiring
fluid resuscitation with 2L IVF, a bolus of neosynephrine, and 1
unit of PRBC. Hematocrit dropped from 30.6 prior to procedure to
21.3.  Patient received a total of 2UPRBC. Patient is on
coumadin, which was held for procedure.  INR was 1.1 prior to
procedure.
.
Patient had DDD pacer in [**2163**] for complete heart block.  She has
had 4 generator changes since that time, the most recent in
[**2182**].  In [**Month (only) 958**] of this year, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] evaluated the pacer
and noted declining battery voltage and low impedance in both
atrial and ventricular leads.  As patient's underlying rhythm
was complete heart block, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31925**] recommended that the
pacer be replaced, and the patient elected to have that done at
this time.

Relevant studies:
Transesophageal echocardiogram, intraoperative ([**2184-8-11**]):
Pre-lead extraction: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
procedure.

Post-lead extraction: Trivial pericardial effusion remains
unchaged. Tricuspid regurgitation is now mild (1+).
Biventricular function is unchanged. There is no evidence of
pericardial tamponade.

CXR ([**2184-8-12**]):  Upright PA and lateral views of the chest show a
left-sided pacemaker with wires terminating in the right atrium
and right ventricle.  There is a small left-sided pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax. No focal consolidations.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with h/o complete heart block s/p pacemaker
placement in [**2163**] presenting s/p extraction and replacement of
pacemaker complicated by acute blood loss of approximately 1L
intraoperatively with hypotension.

#Anemia- Patient had a hematocrit drop from baseline 33 to 21.
Patient was transfused a total of 3U PRBC postoperatively.   Her
hematocrit responded appropriately to 28.5.  She was
hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.  Patient was discharged
on iron supplementation for 1 month.  Patient was informed that
iron may turn stools black and may cause constipation.

#Hypotension- Patient was hypotensive due to volume loss
intraoperatively.  She was monitored overnight with an arterial
line in place.  She required one bolus of neosynephrine
immediately post-operatively, but maintained pressures without
support thereafter.  On HD1, she was restarted on her home
atenolol

#s/p pacemaker replacement- Pacer was interrogated on HD1 and
pacing appropriately.  Patient was given a prescription for
Keflex q8h for 8 days.  She was also given percocet for pain
control at incision site.

#Hypokalemia- Patient's potassium was low post-operatively.
Patient had no EKG changes.  Potassium was repleted and was
normal at the time of discharge.

#Hypomagnesium- Patient's magnesium was low post-operatively.
She was asymptomatic and had no EKG changes.  Magnesium was
repleted.

#h/o pulmonary embolism- Patient has been on coumadin for 12
years since she had a pulmonary embolism.  Patient held warfarin
prior to procedure and INR prior to procedure was 1.1.  Warfarin
was restarted on hospital day 1.

#COPD- Patient had no signs of an active flare during admission.
 She was continued on home advair and combivent.

#HLD-  Patient was continued on home simvastatin.

#Transitional issues:
- Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
- Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

Patient was full code throughout admission.
