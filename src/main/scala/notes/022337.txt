Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, night sweats, and fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation.
2. Lumbar puncture.
3. Blood transfusions.


History of Present Illness:
37 yo alcoholic, homeless female, with negative HIV test 2 years
ago, no known TB, presented with 3 days of night sweats,
productive/nonbloody cough x 1 week, dyspnea, diarrhea, weight
loss of 60 lb x 1 month, and decreased PO intake due to
abdominal pain. Per history obtained by NF resident, the patient
had been seen 1 week prior to admission at [**Hospital1 2177**] for abdominal
pain with a negative workup, returned 5 days prior to admission
and was given "antibiotics"; it is unclear if she ever filled
this prescription. Over the next few days, she noted progressive
weakness, fatigue, cough productive of "black" sputum, fevers,
chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea of 12 loose
stools/day. ROS is also positive for left shoulder pain with
bilateral numbness in her arms/legs, but negative for focal
neurologic deficits.
The pt reports a negative HIV test 2 [**Hospital1 1686**] ago and a negative PPD
8 months ago. She lives under a bridge and denies living in
shelters; she has been monogamous with her boyfriend for 14 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**]
and sometimes uses condoms, but notes he is unfaithful, denies
IVDU, prostitution, and jail.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, but
tachycardic and pancytopenic. She was noted to be in acute renal
failure with an elevated lactate. CXR showed likely multifocal
process with clear LLL infiltrate, for which she was given
ceftriaxone and azithro. Levofloxacin was added for a U/A
positive for UTI. An MRI L spine was done to rule out cauda
equina syndrome which showed only degenerative joint disease. An
LP ruled out CNS toxo/crytpto/ HSV. After a brief episode of
hypotension with SBP in the 70s that responded to IVF bolus, the
patient was noted to have a PO2 of 60 on ABG and was admitted to
the hospital.

Past Medical History:
1. Negative HIV 2 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**] ago as per report
2. No TB, states had negative PPD 8 monthe ago
3. Pancreatitis 1 month ago at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2-20**] EtOH, lost 40 lb
4. ?PNA at [**Hospital1 2177**] 1 week ago, may have taken 4-5 days antibiotics

Social History:
Homeless. Drinks [**1-23**] vodka daily (most recently 2 days ago),
+THC, denies IVDU. 1 PPD tobacco. Monogamous x 15 [**Month/Day (1) 1686**] (states

Renal u/s ([**2199-8-13**]): 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal
mass.

advanced forms of liver disease such as advanced
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
.

regurgitation with mild, global biventricular systolic
dysfunction (toxic, metabolic). No valvular vegetations are
seen.

CTA ([**2199-8-25**]): 1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Gradually improving left lower lobe consolidation.
3. Slowly improving pulmonary edema related to ARDS vs diffuse
infection. 4. Multifocal nodular opacities likely related to the
patient's infection.
5. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, likely
related to the patient's infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 37 yo homeless female, presenting with cough, night
sweats, weight loss, diarrhea, leukopenia, found to have
multifocal pneumonia by CXR and streptococcal bacteremia.
.
Hospital course is discussed below by problem:
.
1. Sepsis: On admission to the ICU, she was febrile, tachycardic
(120s), hypoxic, pancytopenic (WBC 1.2, Hct 29, plt 47) and had
an elevated lactate of 4.2, which was concerning for sepsis. She
was intubated to attempt to correct acidemia (pH 7.13) and
developed persistent hypotension post intubation requiring
maximum doses of levophed to maintain SBPs in the 90s. Her
sputum cx grew strep pneumo and [**4-22**] of her blood cx grew gram
strep pneumonia which was pan-sensitive.  She was treated with a
14day course of Penicillin G. All subsequent cultures remained
negative. Echo was negative for vegetations. Upon discharge, she
was afebrile, normotensive, with normal oxygen saturation on
room air.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: This was due to the strep pneumo
pneumonia.  She also required significant diuresis prior to
extubation, which occurred on [**2199-8-21**].  As above, she was treated
with 14d of penicillin. On admission, concern was als
