Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheoesophageal fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
69F with hx of NSCLC s/p Right pneumonectomy, chemo&radiation
two years ago, admitted to OSH for LLL pneumonia on [**11-5**], found
to have tracheoesophageal fistula on barium swallow and
bronchoscopy, transerred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and sedated for
interventional pulmonology evaluation of tracheoesophageal
fistula.
.
Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital 87965**] Hospital [**11-5**], where
she was treated for CAP with 10 days of levofloxacin, requiring
intubation from [**Date range (1) 87966**].  Her antibiotics were broadened
slowly first with aztreonam ([**11-9**]) then vancomycin ([**11-15**]).
She underwent bronchoscopy [**11-8**], which showed significant
inflammation in the left mainstem bronchus; culture showed rare
yeast. Post-extubation, she required continuous Bipap; she
required reintubation on [**11-15**] due to progressive hypercarbia.
She had been started on vasopressin prior to intubation and was
later started on dopamine as well.  At Midcoast, patient also
had a modified barium swallow which showed barium in the
trachea, but no obvious fistula.  Bronchoscopy confirmed
tracheoesophageal fistula 1cm TEF 5cm from the carina.  While at
Midcoast, she was also noted to have afib and aflutter, but no
known prior history.  An Echo on [**11-8**] showed pulmonary
hypertension and septal hypokinesis, but normal EF. She was
transfered to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center intubated on pressors
dopamine and vasopressin.
.
At [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center, patient had a bronchoscopy with BAL
showing GPCs.  She underwent CT chest on [**11-16**] to rule out PE in
setting of mildly elevated CKMB and trop.  It appears that she
was afebrile throughout her stay at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical.  She was
started on IV doses of digoxin for her afib which helped keep
her rate-controlled and noted to be maintained in sinus rhythm.
Patient was on insulin drip at outside hospital for
hyperglycemia in the setting of TPN and high dose stress IV
steroids.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient is on Vancomycin
(Day#4), Clindamycin (Day#3),  Aztreonam (Day#10), Fluconazole
(Day#2).
.
On arrival to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**], patient is intermittently in
stable VT with SBPs in 180s, completely asymptomatic,
intermittently in rapid Afib with rates to 160s.  She was given
one dose of IV metoprolol 5mg while in Afib with RVR which
decreased her HRs and let her self-convert to NSR with rate 80s.

OSH: [**2131-11-9**] - TTE showed normal EF, septal hypokinesis,
pulmonary hypertension

CXR [**2131-11-19**] - Right lung [**Last Name (un) 57454**] out with tracheal deviation to
the right; right-sided PICC line tip in distal subclavian; LLL
infiltrate mixed with barium
.
EKG:
- [**2131-11-19**] - 19:06 - wide complex tachycardia, rate 143,
evidence of p-waves though diff morphologies and not necessarily
conducting; a capture beat
- [**2131-11-19**] - 19:28 - Afib w RVR, rate 130s; narrow complex;
T-wave inversions in inferior leads II, III, avF and precordial
leads V1-V6
- [**2131-11-19**] - 19:33 - NSR rate 80s, inverted T waves in inferior
leads II, III, avF and in V1-V4; flattened T waves in lateral
leads
.
[**11-18**] CXR:
Rightward mediastinal shift and opacification of the right
hemithorax is
consistent with prior pneumonectomy. There is no gas in the
right
pneumonectomy space. Heterogeneous opacification at the base of
the left lung
could be dependent edema or pneumonia, including aspiration. A
2-cm wide
elliptical opacity projecting over the left mid lung could be a
nodule or
fissural pleural fluid since there is pleural fluid, more
inferiorly.
Mediastinum shifted into the opacified right hemithorax cannot
be assessed.
ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube should be
advanced at least 4
cm to move all the side ports well beyond the gastroesophageal
junction
.
CT Torso:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right pneumonectomy, with no evidence of cancer recurrence.

2. Left lower lobe consolidation, with high-attenuation material
suspicious
for prior aspiration of enteric contrast material.

3. No CT evidence of tracheoesophageal fistula. Please note that
this
examination was not a dedicated trachea study but no
spontaneously patent wall
defect is appreciated.

4. Volume overload as evidenced by pleural effusions, mesenteric
edema,
ascites, and anasarca.
.
MRI Brain:
IMPRESSIONS:

1. No intracranial metastases.

2. Small amount of fluid in right mastoid air cells.

3. Mild chronic small vessel ischemic change.


Brief Hospital Course:
69F with hx NSCLC s/p right pneumonectomy/chemo/radiation who
presented to OSH with LLL pneumonia on [**11-5**], found to have
tracheoesophageal fistula by bronchoscopy, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management of TEF.
.
# Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt was
transferred from OSH s/p intubation and antibiotic course for
pneumonia. She was transferred after discovery of TE fistula. Pt
remained intubated in the MICU for malignancy w/u and IP
evaluation of the TE fistual. She was taken to the OR on [**11-20**]
for rigid bronch, and while they were there the ET tube was
changed due to cuffleak with resulting ABG showing improvement
in oxygenation and a decrease in her previously elevated CO2.
.
# LLL Pneumonia: CXR showed LLL process; pt had completed 10
days of antibiotics for pneumonia. Vancomycin was continued for
a recent OSH sputum culture that had grown GPCs.  On HD#3,
bilious contents were aspirated from the patient's ET tube. She
was taken to the OR by interventional pulmonology for the
fistula on [**11-20**] (see below for results).  As she was
hemodynamically unstable after the procedure, antibiotics were
broadened on [**11-20**] to vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin.
.
# TE Fistula: The patient had an initial bronchoscopy in the ICU
on HD#2 that
