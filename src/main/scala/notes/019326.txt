Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall with femur fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Right femur ORIF

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 60 y/o male with PMH significant for CHF (EF 15%
per outside report), hepatitis C, dementia [**2-26**] ETOH abuse, and
known CAD who presents from his rehab facility today following
an unwitnessed fall. The patient is not a reliable historian.
Basically, it appears as though he fell sometime yesterday.
There is no clear neurologic or cardiac etiology of this fall.
This morning, he could not bear weight, and the NP[**MD Number(3) 31663**]
facility sent him to the ED. In the ED, he was found to have a
mildly displaced intertrochanteric proximal right femur fracture
as well as questionable fractures of the left superior and
inferior pubic rami. He was seen by orthopedics in the ED whose
recommendations are in the chart. He is being admitted to
medicine for pre-op cardiac evaluation as well as monitoring for
alcohol withdrawal.
.
At the present time, the patient is not complaining of pain. He
does not know what happened yesterday and cannot give coherent
answers to most questions. In the ED, he admitted to recent
cocaine use, but per his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**], the patient is totally
unreliable due to his underlying dementia due to alcohol. He has
been at rehab for greater than one month so it is unlikely that
he has been using alcohol or drugs at this facility.
.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2184-9-28**] 2:02 PM

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)

Reason: eval for cardiopulmonary process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cardiopulmonary process
CHEST, AP SINGLE VIEW

INDICATION: Status post fall, evaluate for cardiopulmonary
abnormalities.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
semi-upright position demonstrates normal heart size without
typical configurational abnormality. Thoracic aorta mildly
widened and slightly elongated, but not excessive for age. No
suspicious local aortic contour abnormalities identified. Upper
mediastinum unremarkable. No pneumothorax seen. The pulmonary
vasculature is normal. No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
infiltrates are present, and the lateral pleural sinuses are
free. Skeletal structures grossly within normal limits, but mild
asymmetric appearance of vertebral body Th12 being slightly
lower on the left than on the right.

Our records do not include a previous chest examination
available for comparison.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF, pneumothorax, or acute
infiltrates. Chest examination is limited to AP single view.

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  [**2184-9-28**] 2:02 PM

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT

Reason: eval for fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old man s/p fall, right hip pain, shortening on exam
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for fx
PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS:

INDICATION: 60-year-old man status post fall with right hip
pain. Evaluate for fracture.

FINDINGS: No comparisons. There is a displaced intertrochanteric
fracture of the proximal right femur. Mild displacement of the
distal fracture fragment with respect to the proximal fracture
fragment is seen. There is moderate degenerative change of the
right hip. There is also a suggestion of fractures of the left
superior and inferior pubic rami; this could be better evaluated
with CT. The left hip is intact. Degenerative changes of the
left hip are also noted. Evaluation of the sacrum is obscured by
overlying bowel gas. The soft tissues are otherwise
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1) Mildly displaced intertrochanteric proximal right femur
fracture.

2) Possible additional fractures of the left superior and
inferior pubic rami. These would be better evaluated with CT if
clinically necessary.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68257**] at the time of this
dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60 y/o M with history of CAD, CHF, and dementia secondary
to EtOH presents to the floor from the MICU s/p extubation from
aspiration event.
.
1. Right Femur Fracture
Patient was admitted s/p an unwitnessed fall at his nursing
home. He was found to have a right femur fracture and was
admitted for right femur fracture repair by orthopedic surgery.
While awaiting surgery, patient was found to have vital signs of
HO was called to evaluate and found the pt as described with
fever to 104, BP 180/90, HR 120s, rr 50s-60s and had aspirated
on chicken. He was intubated and transferred to the MICU. After
extubation in the MICU, patient underwent right femur ORIF
without complication. His wound was healing without any signs of
inflammation and patient is to have follow-up with orthopedic
surgery. Patient was maintained on lovenox after ORIF. Pt should
receive 4 weeks total of lovenox after surgery.  Therefore, the
patient should have an additional 1-2 weeks.  Therewas some
concern that the patient may have had bleeding after PEG tube
placement, but based on ortho recommendations, the patient
should remain on the lovenox as the risk of PE is high after
ORIF.
.
2. Altered Mental Status
While awaiting right femur ORIF by orthopedic surgery, the
patient was found to have a fever to 104, BP 180/90, HR 120s, rr
50s-60s and had aspirated on chicken.
Unclear what precipitated this event. Differential diagnosis
included a seizure given patient's history of a seizure
disorder, infection, or stroke. To help treat possible seizure,
patient was given 2mg ativan with no improvement in mental
status
