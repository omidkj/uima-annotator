CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p ct d/c

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman s/p sternotomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p ct d/c
CHEST SINGLE AP FILM:

HISTORY: Sternotomy and AVR.

Status post median sternotomy. A Cordis catheter is present in
the right brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax. No change in
heart size or prominent thoracic aorta since prior film of [**6-25**], [**2126**]. Linear atelectasis is present at the left lung base.
There has been partial resolution of the atelectasis in the left
lower lobe since prior film and left hemidiaphragm is now
partially visualized. There has also been resolution of the
previously noted linear atelectasis in the right lateral zone.

function.

calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
aortic arch. Markedly dilated descending aorta Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Moderate-severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**2-5**]+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are normal. There appears to be extensive calcification
of the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild
to moderate
([**2-5**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Vena
contracta is 5-6 mm. There is blunting or reversal of pulmonary
venous s wave
flow pattern. The mitral annulus averages 2.9 cm in diameter.
There is
bileaflet restriction of the mitral valve with central mitral
regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. All
findings discussed
with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**6-25**] and was taken to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].
Intra-op echo also revealed moderate to severe MR, worsened from
TTE 5 weeks ago. In addition, after sternotomy was done, it was
noted that the ascending aorta was heavily calcified into the
aortic arch. Given that the nature of the operation had changed
to the need for AVR/MVR, and replacement of aortic arch with
circulatory arrest, the family was consulted by telephone from
the OR. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] , the risks had dramatically
increased. The family elected to abandon the operation, wake the
pt., and allow her to participate in the discussion and
reevaluate her decision if necessary. She was extubated the next
morning. CT scanning with MMS reconstruction done for further
evaluation of her aorta. Transferred to the floor on POD #2.
Cleared for discharge to rehab on POD #4. Pt. is to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in the office next Thursday.
