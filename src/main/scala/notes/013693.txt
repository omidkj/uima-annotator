PSH: s/p appy

Onc Hx: 65 yrs. man with heavy smoking history, CAD s/p stents,
HTN and hyperlipidemia presented with cough with blood tinged
sputum, leukocytosis and weight loss at the beginning of [**Month (only) **]
[**2161**]. CXR on [**2161-1-23**] showed RLL infiltrates and he was treated
with Levaquin for pneumonia. He also developed right flank pain,

aggravated by cough. CT c/a/p on [**2160-2-14**] at [**Location (un) 2274**] showed a 3.5 cm
right infrahilar abnormal soft tissue density appearing necrotic

and with central cavity which extends along the pleural surface
medially into the right middle lobe. CT also showed a 4.9cm
enlarged left adrenal gland compatible with metastatic lesion,
possibly necrotic given its low density. Infiltration of the
surrounding fat and small nodules suggest metastatic spread from

the adrenal gland. He presented to [**Hospital1 92021**] hospital for pain
control over the weekend. His pain increased to [**10-21**] on [**2-16**] and

he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pain control and to expedite the
work up. CTA and CT a/p at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show PE but emphysema.
CT also showed a cavitating pulmonary mass adjacent to the
pericardium within the right medial lower lobe; Mediastinal and
bihilar lymphadenopathy; an enlarged left adrenal gland.  MRI
brain did not show brain lesions.  PET CT demonstrated FDG-avid
lesions in the right lung, bilateral mediastinal LN's, left
adrenal, right 11th rib and T-spine (T8, T11), all c/w with a
primary lung cancer with metastatic disease. Patient underwent 3

attempted diagnostic procedures, with the the first 2 procedures

being non-diagnostic. He underwent a EUS by the Advanced
Endoscopy/ERCP service with EUS-biopsy of the left adrenal mass
and subcarinal LN on [**2-18**], with samples returning non-diagnostic.

He then underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS with biopsy of 3
mediastinal LN's, with all 3 samples being non-diagnostic. Of
note, during this procedure, he had an episode of SVT and brief
hypotension requiring IV pressor therapy. This all resolved
spontaneously post-procedure. Thoracic Surgery was consulted to
evaluate for possible VATS or mediastinoscopy, however, Thoracic

Surgery recommended to continue with less invasive measures
first, and recommended a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal
mass. He underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**2-27**] and tolerated the
procedure well. The path shows squamous cell carcinoma,
consistent with lung primary.  Pt was noted to have an O2
requirement. He has CTA that is negative for PE and was kept on
DVT prophylaxis. He does have long smoking history and imaging
suggests a component of COPD, but he had no active wheeze. No
clear infiltrate on chest x-ray other than right-sided lung
mass. Felt to be likely due to a combination of his right lung
mass and also splinting from his metastatic bone pain that
prevents him from taking deep breaths. He remained on a stable
O2 requirement (2.5L).
He was initially discharged, but then readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**3-5**] with dehydration and right chest/flank pain. He has a
metastatic lesion at T10, and pain was felt to be radicular. CTA

in ED showed no pulmonary embolus. He received radiation, 800
cGy in 1 fraction, to T8-T10 and adjacent right sided ribs, on
[**2161-3-6**]. He received chemotherapy with carboplatin, AUC 5, on
[**3-7**], (day 1) and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, day 1 and d8, ([**3-14**]),
without difficulty. He received consultation from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **],
Palliative Care. At the end he was quite comfortable on fentanyl

patch 75 mcg/hr, dilaudid 4 mg q 4h PRN breakthrough pain, and
provigil. Metoprolol was started after an episode of AF with
rapid ventricular response. He subsequently converted to sinus
rhythm.  He was discharged in stable condition to [**Hospital1 **] in [**Location 1268**] on [**3-15**]. Admitted from [**8-3**] - [**8-7**] for
bilateral hip pain.
