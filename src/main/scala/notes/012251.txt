Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85 year-old woman with severe COPD (on home
oxygen 4L), CAD, obstructive cardiomyopathy who presented with
closed loop small bowel obstruction s/p exploratory laparoscopy,
lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.  She was
transferred to the ICU for post-operative monitoring after
becoming hypotensive, briefly requiring pressors, when started
on propofol.
.
Brief ICU Course:
.
# S/p exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions and small
bowel resection:
Patient tolerated surgery well.  She was given a morphine PCA
for pain control and treated with cefazolin perioperatively. She
was extubated successfully the next morning and weaned quickly
down to 2-4L oxygen by nasal canula after diuresis. She was
started on a perioperative beta-blocker, which was given
intravenously while the patient was kept NPO.
.
# Hypotension:
Patient was bolused 2L IVFs overnight for low blood pressures,
but she did not require pressors to be restarted. Her blood
pressures remained stable in the low 100s systolic.
- DNR/DNI had been reversed for surgery --> readdress code
status? (discuss w daughter)
General Surgery:
Operative course uncomplicated, noted to have strangulated
segment of bowel which was resected. Routinely observed in PACU,
and transferred to Stone 5 for post-op care. Remained NPO with
NGT to suction. POD3-minimal NGT output. Tolerated clamp trial.
NGT removed. Remained NPO until bowel function returned. Pain
controlled with PCA. Abdominal incision intact with staples,
CDI. Diet advanced gradually from sips to regular food as bowel
function and abdominal distention improved. Reported flatus. IV
fluid discontinued. Foley removed. Voided without issue.
Medications switched to oral. Pain well controlled with oral
Tylenol. Physical Therapy consulted. Patient ambulates with
walker at baseline. Activity not at baseline. Required
assistance and further REHAB. Screened for REHAB, discharhed
once surgically/medically ready. Ambulated in halls with walker.

.
Patient was on telemetry to monitor her cardiac status.  She had
three observed episodes of SVT which was self-limited to <1
minute.  EKG after each event revealed no changes from baseline.
 Cardiology consultation requested an echo to re-assess cardiac
status.  It revealed stable severe pulm artery hypertension,
left ventricular hypertrophy, EF>55%, and resting LV outflow
obstruction.  Cardiology also recommended increasing her statin,
starting & continuing beta-blockade, holding her home verapamil,
and initiating low-dose ACE inhibitor.  These recommendations
were completed prior to discharge. The patient remained stable
on this regimen with no visible signs of tachycardia via
Telemetry.
.
At discharge, abdominal incision intact with staples. REHAB
facility to remove stables on Monday [**11-12**] (post-op day 10) if
sugical wound intact and healed. Steri strips will be applied.
.
Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (un) 14682**] in a few weeks after
discharge.
.
Anticoagulation: Patient has history of DVT in 6/[**2157**]. She was
treated with Coumadin for about 2 years, and has been off
therapy for about a year. THis information was confirmed with
both patient and patient's daughter.
