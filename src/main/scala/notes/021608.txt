Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65 yo m with hx restrictive lung dz, CAD, distolic HF, OSA, HTN,
BPH, type II DM p/w progressively worsening shortness of breath
and LE edema. Pt reports that for the last 1 week has been
having worsening dyspnea both at rest and on exertion. Also with
~15 lb weight gain in 1 week. Usually weighs 265 lbs, today
280lbs. Home VNA contact[**Name (NI) **] cardiology and lasix titrated from 60
mg [**Hospital1 **] to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday. However without improvement of
sxs.
.
Also reports worsening LE edema, left greater than right.
Apparent trauma to L toe and knee after fall. Also with dry
productive cough and nasal congestion. Denies orthopnea, PND. At
baseline with very limited ET to ~several steps, limited mostly
by chronic back and leg pain. Per wife, during recent travel to
[**Location (un) **], did not adhere to low sodium diet for several days.
Chronic L sided CP radiating to the neck, approximately 2
episodes per week. Last episode was yesterday. These episodes
are usually non-exertional, non-radiating, and self resolves
over 2-3 minutes.
.
His inital vitals were: 97.4 98/59 HR 71 75% on RA, 97% 2L NC.
In the ED he was given 80mg IV lasix and was then admitted to
the floor for treatment of CHF exacerbation.
.
Of note Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 34888**] has had his pain medications titrated up
recently with his methadone being doubled to 10mg tid.  He had
taken 2 doses at this increased dose and upon admission to the
floor was found to be somnolent, developing shallow respirations
with worsening obtundation.  He then desatted to 70's on N/C and
was placed on a 100% NRB.  ABG at that time was 7.03/103/241.
He was given 0.4mg IV narcan with improved consciousness and
subsequently became cold/uncomfortable with hypertension to SBP
160.  He was transferred to the CCU for narcan drip and closer
monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
LABS:
BNP 7352 on admission.
WBC 9.3 on admission down to 6.0 on discharge.
HCT 33 on admission and 34 on discharge.
BUN 68 on admission down to 49 at discharge.
Cr 2.5 on admission down to 1.7 on discharge.
Blood gas on admission pH 7.03 CO2 102 O2 241.
Blood gas before discharge pH 7.38 CO3 53 O2 97.
.
CXR on admission:
The appearance of the chest is similar to [**2143-5-4**]. Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature appears similar
and remains prominent, consistent with a mild degree of edema.
Left lateral pleural thickening has not changed. There is no
evident pleural effusion or new airspace consolidation. Again
seen is prior right rib resection. Clips in the right upper
quadrant compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2143-7-13**]  12:15:04 PM
Sinus rhythm. Frequent atrial ectopy. Probable old
inferoposterior wall
myocardial infarction. Non-specific T wave changes. Compared to
tracing
of [**2143-5-4**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
.
RENAL U/S:
The right kidney measures 10.9 cm. The left kidney measures 10.7
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis or
renal mass. The corticomedullary differentiation in the kidneys
is preserved.
.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 male w/ questionable diastolic dsyfunction CKD, CAD, DM2, HTN
admitted with dyspnea and volume overload and hypercarbic
respiratory failure from prescribed narotics.
.
# Volume Overload: Patient diuresed nicely and was 2.4L negative
in first 24 hrs of admission, with minimal rales on exam. Volume
overload improving although still with b/l pitting edema.
Presumed CHF (with scant evidence), with preserved EF >55% in
[**5-8**]. Diastolic dysfunction was not evident on echo (only echo
abnormality is altered e:a ration). Precipitant for current
decompensation not entirely clear. Possibilities include dietary
indiscretion per wife and possible URI/infectious precipitant.
Treated with lasix drip and restarted on PO lasix at more
frequent dosing of 60mg TID (up from his home dose of 60 mg [**Hospital1 **])
with good effect. O2 sat was 97% on discharge.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely due prescribed
narcotic use.  Presented with dangerous hypercarbia and
respiratory acidosis. His home narcotics were initially held and
then decreased on discharge. He remained on bipap over length of
stay and had good Oxygen saturation (97% on room air).
.
# CAD: With apparently chronic non-exertional self-resolving CP.
Cath in [**2138**] showed minimal dz. ROMI at admission. His
metoprolol was continued at 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]. His ASA was decreased from
325 to 81 for secondary prophylaxis because he has not had
stents. Consider stress test when symptomatically improved as an
outpatient.
.
# CKD: CKD Stage 3, secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Acute on
chronic renal failure likely due to poor forward flow which
improved greatly with diuresis. Renal ultrasound was normal.
Etiology includes pre-renal vs renal dysfunction (diabetic
complication possibly). Initially high creatinine (2.4) and was
stable at 1.7 on discharge. Nephrology followed patient during
hospitalization.
.
# HTN: Stopped his home regimen of Imdur 30 because no clear
indication given good blood pressure control and normal echo.
Metoprolol 12.
