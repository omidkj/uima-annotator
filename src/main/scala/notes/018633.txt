MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:
[**2117-1-27**] Blood culture (x 2) - pending
[**2117-1-27**] Urine culture - pending
[**2117-1-27**] Legionella urine antigen - negative
[**2117-1-27**] MRSA screen - positive

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2117-1-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) -  Single AP erect portable view of
the chest was obtained. There is perihilar and bibasilar
opacities which could relate to fluid overload, although
underlying infectious process could also be present in the
appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable and unremarkable.

PA/LATERAL:
Mildly improved, but persistent pulmonary edema or, in the
correct clinical context, bibasilar pneumonia (including
atypical, viral or PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 105601**]).


Brief Hospital Course:
64M h/o COPD and empyema, tobacco abuse with 40+ pack year
smoking history, HLD, HTN, prostate ca s/p cyberknife and
radiation p/w gradual onset dyspnea and productive cough and
conjunctivitis, thought to be secondary to a COPD exacerbation
and pneumonia.

# COPD exacerbation, Pneumonia: Patient was weaned from BiPAP to
supplemental oxygen for nasal cannula. Blood, urine and sputum
cultures were obtained and are no growth at the time of
discharge. Fluticasone and tiotropium treatments were continued.
Oral steroids as well as Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin coverage
for COPD exacerbation were continued and the patient was
transitioned to Levofloxacin at discharge to complete a total of
eight days of antibiotics as well as a steroid taper. Overall
his clinical exam improved, he was weaned from oxygen, and he
had good oxygen saturations on room air with ambulation prior to
discharge.

# Tobacco abuse: counseled on quitting smoking, currently trying
to quit.
# Depression: continued buproprion
# HTN: continued home dosing of losartan, nifedipine.
# Gout: continued allopurinol.

# Transitional Issues:
-follow up CXR in [**5-7**] weeks
