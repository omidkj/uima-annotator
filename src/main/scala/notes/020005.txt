Blood cx x 2 [**2113-1-31**] - NGTD

Studies:

CXR ([**2113-1-31**])
FINDINGS: Cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence is
unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not enlarged. Chronic
interstitial changes are stable, most prominent at the right
base. There is new superimposed air space opacity at the right
base obscuring the right hemidiaphragm, likely representing
pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. New airspace opacity at right base likely represents
pneumonia.
2. Stable chronic interstitial opacities.
3. Stable cardiomegaly, without overt CHF.

ECG ([**2113-1-31**])
sinus rhythm at 93 with atrial premature complexes although
baseline
artifact makes assessment difficult;
Right bundle branch block; Probable left anterior fascicular
block
Since previous tracing of [**2112-10-18**], atrial ectopy present


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of COPD on home
O2, HTN, hypothyroid, hx of chest pain with clean cath [**2107**], hx
of chronic DVT on coumadin who presents from the ED with a COPD
exacerbation [**2-17**] PNA.  Her hospital course during this admission
is as follows including 2 breif MICU stay ([**Date range (3) 104587**] for
COPD and [**Date range (3) 104588**] for hyponatremia):

1 Pulmonary:  Similar presentation in [**Month (only) 359**] and she was
treated successfully with  slow steroid taper.  At the Ed, she
was noted to have  PNA on CXR.  Received Abx and steroids in ED
today, but given her O2 status at the ED (80% on RA), she was
nitially admitted to MICU overnight, and received CPAP briefly.
She remained afebrile and sating 96% -100% on 2L before called
out to medicine.  We continue levo/flagyl for a total of 10 days
(she will need to continue for 3 more days after discharge) for
her pneumonia.  We also continue her albuterol/atrovent neb
treatment (both standing and prn); continued guaifenesin 5-10mg
PO q6h which helped her cough.  In addition, we started her on a
slow steroid taper, intially on solumedrol at the MICU, then
prednisone 60mg PO x 3 days, then 40mg PO x 2 days, she will
need to continue 40mg PO x 1 day, then 20mg PO x 3 days, then
10mg PO x 3 days, then stop steroids.  She remained afebrile and
her pulmonary status improved.

2) hyponatremia - On [**2113-2-4**], she was noted to have decreasing
sodium levels, from 134, down to 127, 123, and then 120
throughout the day of transfer.  Pt's urine osms were elevated
at 601; SIADH was considered and pt was fluid restricted.
However, her sodium continued to drop as above and she was more
lethargic; she was therefore transferred to the MICU.  With
fluid restrictions overnight, her Na level trended up without
any hypertonic saline.  We continue to monitor her Na level and
her MS which improved as well.  She was called out to the floor
again on [**2113-2-5**], and her Na and MS continue to improve back to
baseline.

3) chronic venous stasis changes/right leg ulcer - Chronic issue
for the patient.  We intially continued [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
that patient has been getting in the nursing home.  Wound care
was consulted, and recommended apply aloe vesta moisture barrier
cream to B/L LE's daily prior to replacing dressing. For her
right leg ulcer, the recommended cleanse ulcer with NS, pat dry,
apply Adaptic dressing, cover with dry gauze, wrap with Kerlix
daily.  They also recommended place dry gauze and wrap with
Kerlix to left leg as well daily.  Instructions were provided to
the nursing home for her wound care at the time of discharge.
.
4) h/o DVT:  INR subtherap on admission, and she was continued
on her coumadin
at 3mg initially.  However, her INR became supratherapeutic
while on levoquin, and her coumadine was held for 4 days, and
her INR trended down slowly.
