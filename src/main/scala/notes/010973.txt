IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of free fluid or free air. No acute
intra-abdominal
pathology.
2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3. Hyperenhancing lesion in the left kidney is concerning for
renal cell
carcinoma. Other high attenuating cystic structures within the
kidneys are
most likely hemorrhagic cysts. Recommend MRI for further
evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old female with history of ischemic colitis
and lower GIB, ESRD on HD, who presents with light handedness,
HCT drop, and melena. She was recently admitted with HCT
drop/melena and underwent EGD/colonoscopy with only finding of
diverticulosis with old blood. They thought that the source was
small bowel. However, She presented with HCT drop 26 to 19, and
recurrent melena. She was admitted to the ICU and received more
than 7 units of RBC transfusion. She had small bowel enteroscopy
on [**10-31**] which was negative. GI was consulted and she underwent
capsule endoscopy. Tagged RBC scan was never done as it was
thought that the patient was not bleeding enough for this to be
positive. The results of the capsule endoscopy is still pending
at the time of discharge. It will take more several days before
the results are reported. She has been stable for 3 days in the
unit and 3 days on the floor with no further requirement for
more blood transfusion and a stable Hgb/HCT. She was able to
ambulate unassisted without light handedness or presyncope. Her
GI symptoms resolved despite regular diet.
During hospitalization, a CT of the abdomen showed hyper
enhancing lesion in the left kidney which is concerning for
renal cell carcinoma. Other high attenuating cystic structures
within the kidneys are most likely hemorrhagic cysts.
Radiologist recommend MRI for further evaluation.
I have extensively discussed this with the patient. She will
need MRI of the kidneys and Urology follow up. I was unable to
schedule this because of [**Holiday 1451**]. The [**Hospital 159**] clinic will
open on Monday. She was provided with the phone number she
needed to call for appointment.
She will be discharged with Hematocrit check on Monday with
results faxed to PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was told about the signs and symptoms of recurrent GI bleed.
