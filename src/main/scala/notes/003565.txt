was he was feeling short of breath and his wife checked his
oxygen level, which was in the 90's on 2.5L

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:[**2125-8-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. An aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal transvalvular
gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
puomonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is an anterior fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Norrmally functioning
aortic valve bioprosthesis. Grossly normal left ventricular
cavity size and global systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33668**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital where he
was diagnosed with an NSTEMI. He underwent a plavix load for a
cardiac cath showing single vessel disease and aortic stenosis
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of surgical
revascularization. He underwent a thorough pre-op work up. He
was found to have several teeth requiring extraction prior to
surgery and on HD#3 he was taken to the operating room for
dental extractions of teeth #22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.  He was
also found to have significant left ICA stenosis and a vascular
surgery consul was obtained from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. Mr. [**Known lastname 33668**] will
require a carotid endarterectomy one month after cardiac
surgery.  On HD# 5 he was taken to the operating room again
where he underwent  Coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with the
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, Aortic
valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**] tissue valve,
serial #[**Serial Number 112395**], reference number [**Serial Number 112396**].

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He was
hemodynamically labile in the immediate post-operative period
requiring pressor and inotropic support. Over the ensuing
post-operative days he was weaned from intropes and pressors and
was extubated. Post extubation he had lot to secretions and
tenious respiratory status. He received aggressive pulmoanry
toileting and avoided reintubation. He was also aggressively
diuresed. His BUN/creat remained stable. His CT's were removed
wihtout difficulty. He was very confused and at times combative,
he was started on seroquel but became too sedate and was
eventually restarted on all his preopertaive psych meds.  He
remains pleasantly confused but nonfocal. He was
thrombocytopenic and was HIT negative x2. He was started on
coumadin low dose for pre-op and post-op afib.
Beta blocker was init
