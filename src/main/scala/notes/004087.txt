Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
CC: SOB, cough
.
HPI:  71 yo M with recent diagnosis of metastatic nonsmall cell
lung cancer (unresectable stage IV) s/p first treatment of
taxol, carboplatin, and zometa on [**2168-11-15**] presents with
worsening SOB, cough, and fever.  Pt underwent his first round
of chemotherapy yesterday.  Per report he had intermittent
desaturations to 89-92% during chemo.  This am he awoke with
fever to 100.6 and worsening productive cough.  He took tessalon
pearls and Robitussin with codeine without relief.
.
In the ED his temp was 102, HR 100-120's, BP 160-180's, RR
26-34, satting 95% on NRB.  He was given
Levo/Flagyl/Vanco/Azithro.  A Chest CT revealed a large left
pleural effusion and LLL/lingular/portions of LUL collapse
(worsened significantly compared to [**2168-10-22**]).  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was noted to have a RR of 40 with a
gas of 7.47/32/68.  He was intubated.  His BP's dropped to the
80's with sedation/intubation and he was started on levophed.
An A-line and central line were placed.

Studies:
- CT chest [**2168-11-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. large left pleural effusion and collapse of left lower lobe,
lingula and portions of the left upper lobe have worsened
significantly compared to [**2168-10-22**]. Occlusion of the left
lower lobe and lingular bronchi
3. Bulky mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy.
4. New pathological fracture of the left seventh rib. Lytic foci
within the T1 vertebral body and right fifth rib are unchanged.

6. Patchy opacity within the right lower lobe, likely reflecting
an
infectious or inflammatory process.
.
- CXR [**2168-11-16**]: Interval increased left pleural effusion, and
increasing parenchymal opacities in left lower lobe and lingula.
Given the known lesions in the left hila, this is concerning for
postobstructive pneumonia/atelectasis. Mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy. Left rib met.
.
- MRI head [**2168-11-5**]: Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy. No
enhancing lesions are seen. No evidence of mass effect or
hydrocephalus.
.
- PET CT scan:
1. Intense FDG avidity in the partially collapsed left lower
lobe extending to the hilum. The intensity of this uptake is
greater than expected for postobstructive inflammatory change
alone and is consistent with the given history of non-small cell
lung cancer.
2. FDG-avid bilateral hilar adenopathy and widespread bilateral
mediastinal adenopathy.
3. Multiple foci of FDG-avid lytic metastases involving the left
scapula, the left lamina of T1, the right 5th rib (with
pathologic fracture), the left 7th rib, the right sacrum and
right acetabulum. Asymmetric activity associated with the right
L5 pars defect may
be degenerative.
.
- Chest CT [**2168-10-22**]: bulky, bilateral mediastinal
lymphadenopathy as well as bilateral hilar adenopathy, the
largest lymph nodes include a subcarinal node or mass measuring
approximately 2.5 cm x 3.5 cm in diameter. There are also
bilateral calcified pleural plaques present. The lower lobe is
partially collapsed, and within the area of enhancing
atelectatic lung, there is a low-density rounded area measuring
2.0 cm x 1.8 cm in diameter. The lungs also demonstrate
emphysematous changes, also was found to have a
small-to-moderate pleural effusion and a small pericardial
effusion. Additional central peri-bronchovascular thickening in
the left lower lobe was found which could be related to
lymphatic obstruction or localized lymphangitic spread of tumor.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo M with recently diagnosed metastatic non small cell
lung cancer (unresectable stage IV) s/p first treatment of
Taxol, Carboplatin, and Zometa on [**2168-11-15**] presents with
worsening cough and fever.
.
Patient's shortness of breath, cough and fever were likely
secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonia in setting of a known
malignancy. Patient was started on empiric broad spectrum
coverage with vancomycin/levofloxacin/metronidazole. CT chest
revealed a large left pleural effusion and collapse of left
lower lobe, lingula and portions of the left upper lobe. Shortly
after transfer to the ICU patient became hypoxic and required
intubation. Tap of left pleural effusion on [**11-16**] was positive
for non-small cell carcinoma. A left sided chest tube was
placed. Bronchial washings, subcarinal mass, and paratracheal
lymph node obtained on [**11-19**] were again consistent with
malignancy. Repeated blood, sputum, and urine cultures did not
identify etiology of infection; viral screen also negative.
Course was further complicated by developing neutropenia (s/p
chemotherapy). Aztreonam and AmBisome were both added for
broader coverage. The oncology service was following along
throughout his ICU course. Patient received Neupogen 300 mcg SC
daily for neutropenia. Despite the placement of a second chest
tube, patient continued to have hypoxic respiratory failure,
secondary to large malignant pleural effusion and left lung
collapse.  Patient became hypotensive, likely secondary to
sepsis, and required pressors and fluid boluses to maintain his
CVP and urine output. The patient's primary oncologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] had a discussion with the patient's family regarding
goals of care and the patient's prognosis and a decision was
made to make him CMO. The patient passed away at 1:55 am on
[**2169-11-23**].
