History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42678**] is a 23-year-old woman with a history of type 1
diabetes, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 20%, and a recent hospitalization for MRSA
bacteremia and acute renal failure. The patient initially
presented to [**Hospital6 1708**] for exacerbation of
her CHF and was hospitalized from [**2156-3-27**] to [**2156-4-6**].
During the hospitalization, she was found to have MRSA
bacteremia felt secondary to line infection. Transthoracic
echocardiogram was limited but without vegetations. The patient
was treated with vancomycin, gentamicin. She was discharged on
[**2156-4-6**] and re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2156-4-12**] in acute renal failure, which was felt to be
secondary to gentamicin-induced acute tubular necrosis. Her ACE
inhibitor and diuretics have been held since that admission. Her
renal function has continued to improve since that admisssion
(Cr peak 5.4, then 4.2 on d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-16**]).

She was brought to the ED with worsening dyspnea and decreased
exercise tolerance. States SOB started suddenly at about 10 pm
last night. She had no chest pain, diaphoresis, or
lightheaded-ness. She was unable to recall changes in her
weight, but reported increased LE edema. Her diet is unchanged.
Note is made of a conversation w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4048**] 5 d ago complaining
of increasing LE edema.

In the Emergency Department, pt p/w O2sat 81% on RA, HR 126,
RR60, BP 135/101 & the patient received 40 mg furosemide
intravenously with diuresis of 1.5 liters. She briefly required
non-invasive positive airway pressure ventilation as well.  An
ABG was done on bipap (7.50//40/497/32/7) however a repeat ABG
briefly off O2 (was on NRB w/ 8L O2 not 15L) was 7.51/37/75/31/5
and she desated down to the 80%. Also, serum glucose 872 for
which she has been receiving Insulin (10 U x 3). UA negative for
ketones.

ROS: walks about 3 blocks before getting SOB, sleeps on [**11-21**]
pillows at night (has been stable), positive PND, denies calf
pain or swelling, abd pain, N/V/diarhhea/F/C/dysuria. C/O cramps
in legs b/l.

Past Medical History:
1. DM1 diagnosed 3 years ago
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15 to 20
percent, systolic congestive heart failure in [**2155-7-21**] at
which time a coronary catheterization revealed clean coronary
arteries, history of LV thrombus in [**2154-3-20**].
3. Morbid obesity with recurrent RLL pneumonia
4. Cholecystitis, satus post cholecystectomy.
5. ARF- due to gentamicin-induced ATN, resolving

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shortness of breath
In the ED, she had an elevated ddimer but subsequent LENI([**5-2**])
were negative, and no CTA was performed secondary to renal
failure.  The CXR and clinical presentation were c/w CHF, and
she was diuresed aggressively (with fluid/salt restriction) with
marked improvement in her respiratory status over several days,
initially in MICU and then transferred to the floor.  She had a
TTE on [**5-4**] showing an EF of 15-20%, with LA and RA dilation,
severe dilatation of the LV, mild RV free wall hypokinesis,
3+MR, 2+TR,and moderate PA systolic HTN.  On discharge her lung
exam was clear, O2 sats 97-99% RA and CXR showed resolution of
CHF findings.  She did have an episode of acute dyspnea on [**5-5**]
overnight with clear lung exam and high O2 saturations,
differential PND vs. OSA vs. PE (but completely resolved).  She
was begun on captopril 6.26 tid, toprol decreased to 25 mg qd,
and no aldactone given renal failure for now.

2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency
Noted to have baseline Cr of 1.3, peak in 5's after gent
toxicity, trended down during admission.  Appeared to increase
slightly in setting of aggressive diuresis, at which time she
was put on maintenance lasix 20 mg po qd, and beginning to trend
down again by discharge.  She will be discharged on lasix 30 mg
po qd, with aldactone to possibly be added as outpatient if
renal failure continues to improve or stabilizes.

3. Blood pressure
On ACE, BB, and lasix, her blood pressures were 90s/50s or palp.
 She tolerated this well with no lightheadedness or orthostasis.

4. Apnea
In MICU noted to have multiple episodes of sleep apnea per RNs,
and an episode of shortness of breath at night on the floor in
setting of resolved CHF exacerbation, argues towards possible
OSA.  She has been set up for an outpatient sleep study.

5. MRSA line infection
Documented at OSH, subsequent surveillance blood cultures here
have been negative and no documented endocarditis.  However, per
past notes, to finish 6 week course of vancomycin on [**2156-5-12**].
This was dosed by levels when Cr quite elevated, however when
beginning to recover this was dosed 1g iv qd per pharmacy.

6. DM1
On lantus 110u qhs with regular insulin sliding scale, with fsbg
in high 100s-low 200s.  She may have component of insulin
resistance from obesity on top of type 1 DM, given very high
insulin requirements which still leave her with non-ideal
glycemic control.  This will need continued adjustment as an
outpatient.

7. FEN
Initially with hyponatremia, resolved gradually with diuresis
and fluid restriction, likely from CHF, continued diabetic/low
sodium/renal diet. Continued calcium carb, iron, ascorbic acid.

8. Prophylaxis: SQ heparin, colac
