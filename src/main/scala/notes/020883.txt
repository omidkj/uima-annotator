Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, shortness of breath, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 82 year old female with severe aortic stenosis, PVD,
pulmonary hypertension, and chronic systolic heart failure (EF
35-40%), restrictive lung disease, and chronic hypoxia (on
intermittent home O2, 2 L O2 NC when O2 sats < 88%) who presents
with shortness of breath and lethargy. Family reports patient
has had various symptoms over the past few days of rapid
breathing that has been 'on and off' since Sunday. Family
attributed it to possible increase in her arthritis. On Tuesday,
the patient was noted to have increased wheezing, so dtr called
on call physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended either ED
evaluation if breathing worsened or urgent care appointment,
which was scheduled for the next day with [**Name6 (MD) 228**] geriatrics
NP. In the AM, prior to the appointment, pt appeared less
talkative and slightly altered to the family. When she came to
her appointment, she was noted to be hypoxic in clinic to 72% on
RA so was sent to the ED for further evaluation. Per family, no
medication changes except zyprexa was recently tapered off.
Family denies fevers, chest pain, abdominal pain, or dysuria. Of
note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**2116-2-17**] for
unresponsiveness after a BM, and was intubated for presumed CHF
exacerbation and pleural effusions.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99 107 129/60 24 72% on RA on
arrival to ED. Patient was given combivent nebs, Vancomycin 1
gram IV x1, and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1. Pt was placed on
BiPAP FiO2 33% 12/5. Noted to be lethargic initially but was
reported to be more awake prior to transfer. In the ICU, patient
was unable to speak due to BiPAP mask being in place but was
able to nod her head and squeeze hands to command.

Social History:
She was married and had four children.  She has ten
grandchildren   Her husband died in [**2098**].  She lived by herself
and was able to manage the household by herself until [**Month (only) 216**].

never been alone since that time. She walks less and uses the
wheelchair more.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with severe AS, pulmonary hypertension, CHF presenting
with tachynea and hypoxia admitted to the MICU with hypoxic
respiratory distress.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory
distress. It was initially presumed that it is due to pneumonia
(CAP vs aspiration)or viral URI superimposed on her end stage
restrictive lung disease. Initial ABG with chronic respiratory
alkalosis was likely due to pt's restrictive lung disease. The
patient was started on treatment for presumed aspiration
pneumonia with CFTX/Levofloxacin and was placed on BiPAP which
she tolerated well and transitionted to facemask with O2
supplementation. Lasix was held during hospitalization because
it is believed that the patient is preload dependent. After
improvement in the MICU, she was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **]
where she further improved in her overall status. Antibiotics
were discontinued after being on the medical floor since the
patient was afebrile and no leukocytosis or other indication of
an infection. Her home medications were continued during her
in-hospital stay except for Lasix. Lasix was restarted on
discharge to be every other day 20mg orally. Also Albuterol &
Ipratropium Nebulizers were administered also.
.
# Altered mental status: Likely due to hypoxic respiratory
distress and possible pneumonia. Only recent medication change
had been tapering of her zyprexa. Patient was treated for
presumptive pneumonia initially. She was continued on remeron.
.
# Aortic stenosis: Critical AS with 0.8 cm^2 on recent TTE
([**2114**]). Possible candidate for valvuloplasty if AS worsens.
Patient was likely a pre-load dependent, so was not aggressively
diuresed. Home lasix was held during hospitalization and
restarted on discharge to be every other day 20mg orally. She
was continued on Beta blocker. She will be having an
echocardiogram as outpatient, and then to be evaluated by a
cardiologist for candidacy for valvuloplasty.
.
# Restrictive lung disease: Likely has end stage restrictive
lung disease with markedly reduced FEV1 and FVC on [**5-/2116**] PFTs,
which is most likely due to her scoliosis. Albuterol,
Ipratroprium nebs were given while in-hospital.

# CHF: EF 35-40%, on recent TTE on [**2-/2116**] noted to have EF of
65%. Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]. Home lasix was held during
hospitalization and restarted on discharge to be every other day
20mg orally. continued Carvedilol.
.
# CAD: continued Aspirin, sta
