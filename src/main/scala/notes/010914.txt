CXR:
[**2168-6-21**]: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single
chest view
obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. During the
interval, the
right-sided chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax is
identified in the apical area on either side. Rounded vascular
appearance on the right lung base with some plate atelectasis is
still present, similar to the preceding findings. The lateral
view discloses small amounts of pleural effusion in both
posterior pleural sinuses.
[**2168-6-20**]: Bibasilar opacification is consistent with atelectasis
and effusion. Again, more patchy area of opacification at the
right base could represent a superimposed consolidation.  Right
chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of
pneumothorax.  Again there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary
vessels that would be consistent with some elevated pulmonary
venous pressure

Esophagus: [**2168-6-21**]: Thin barium was administered. The patient
drank
thin barium contrast without difficulty. Contrast passes freely
through the esophagus and esophageal anastomosis through the
stomach, without hold up or obstruction. The esophagogastric
anastomosis is widely patent with no evidence of leak. There is
no definite evidence of ectopic gas, but note is made of
limitation of gas evaluation in this study. Contrast is noted in
loops of small bowel. Mediastinal drains are noted.

[**2168-6-18**]: Chest and abdomen CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy and surgical
changes in the area. Suboptimal evaluation for leak at the
primary anastomosis due to lack of oral contrast. No obvious
fluid collection adjacent to the primary
anastomosis is seen.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent opacities at the
lung bases could be atelectasis; however, hypodensities seen at
the right lung base within the area of consolidation could
suggest superinfection. Ground-glass opacities in the upper
lobes, could be due to infectious or inflammatory etiology.
3. Focal nodular opacity in the right upper lobe about a
centimeter, could be infectious and attention should be paid on
the next followup. Six month
follow-up CT is recommended for surveillance.
4. Non-specific foci of air in the mediastinum could be
post-surgical.
5. No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
6. Fatty liver, with large focal area of fatty sparing in the
left liver
lobe. Subcentimeter hypodensity in the liver, not completely
characterized on the current scan, could be small cyst.
7. Prominent left adrenal gland, similar compared to prior.
8. Partial loss of vertebral body height of T12, of
indeterminate age.
9. No evidence of reflux of oral contrast from J-tube into the
esophagus.
If continuous clinical concern for leak, barium swallow study
can be done when felt as clinically appropriate to evaluate
further.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted following her successful Laparoscopic
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy with laparoscopic
feeding jejunostomy placement.  Following the procedure she was
transferred to the ICU intubated overnight on CPAP, PS12 PEEP 5,
FIO2 50% with oxygen saturations of 100%. On POD 1 she was
extubated with oxygen saturations of 92-94% on nasal cannula.
She was transferred to the floor on [**2168-6-17**] but was readmitted
on [**2168-6-18**] for shortness of breath and increased work of
breathing.  Her chest film showed small effusion, atlectasis.
Chest CT showed no anastomic leak, possible pulmonary infection
versus inflammation. Interventional pulmonary was consulted for
possible pleural effusion drainage but on ultrasound fluid
collection was to small to drain.  With aggressive pulmonary
toilet, nebs, anxiolytics, her respiratory status improved and
she transferred back to the floor on [**2168-6-19**].

Respiratory:  aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs,
incentive spiratometer and ambulation she titrated off
supplemental oxygen on POD6 with oxygen saturations of 95-97% on
room air.

Drains and tubes: NGT tube was flushed to maintain patency and
removed on POD3
Anastomose JP drain and Right chest tube were removed on
[**2168-6-21**] once esophagus study was negative for leak.

GI: bowel function slowly returned.

Nutrition: nutrition was consulted recommended Replete full
strength started at 20 mL/hr POD and titrated to her Goal of 80
mL over 18 hrs.  Esophagus study was done on [**2168-6-21**] which
showed no leak.  She was started on a full liquid diet and can
increased to soft solid as tolerates.

Renal: Excellent urine output with normal renal function.  The
Foley was removed and she voided.  Electrolytes were replete as
needed.

ID: On [**2168-6-18**] her WBC increased to 15 and was started on Cipro
and Vancomycin for possible anastomic leak  or RUL infection.
Her WBC normalized and she was discharged on Cipro to complete
10 day course.

Skin: multiple ecchymotic sites stable.

Pain: Epidural Bupivacaine/Dilaudid was titrate to good pain
control by the acute pain service.  On [**2168-6-20**] this was removed
and she was converted to Roxicet via J-tube with good pain
control.

Neuro: Long standing history of anxiety/depression.  While in
the SICU she became very anxious and her Ativan was slowly
restarted.  Over the course of her hospitalization her mental
status improved, although has short-term memory loss, anxiety
lessened and she r
