History of Present Illness:
78 year old woman who was in in her usual state of excellent
health unti she was admitted to [**Location (un) 62562**] Hospital with
substernal chest pain, shortness of breath and upper mid back
pain on [**2172-11-18**]. She was also noted to have gross hematuria.
*
Her WBC was about 18 and rose to 28 over the following two days.
 On admission: fibrinogen was decreased on admission to 30 and
she was maintained >100 with cyroprecipitate transfusions. Her
fibrin split products was >40.  PTT normal at 29.8 and PT was
elevated at 18.6.  On peripheral smear [**11-19**] she was noted to
have early forms, including [**Last Name (un) **], myelos and myeloblasts.  Her
LDH was 1,500.  Her creatinine rose from 1.1 to 2.5 during her
admission (nephrotoxic drugs included vanco and CT contrast dye.
 Uric acid was normal  Electrolytes were normal and w/o evidence
of tumor lysis.  On admission her plts were 87 and her hct=44.
Today ([**11-23**]) her hct=24, plts=55 and wbc=21. Over her hospital
course, she recieved plts x 7, FFP x 4 and cryo x 3 and one unit
of PRBC.
*
Her temperature was 38.2 max at the OSH. On [**11-18**] CXR w/
increase vasc congestion and small left effusion and ill-defined
desity at right lung base ? RLLL infiltrate. She was treated
with vancomycin and zosyn (both started [**11-18**]).  Blood cultures
x 4 are negative to date by report. Ucrine culture grew several
mixed organisms. CT [**11-17**] showed diverticulosis and precarinal
LAD w/ likely RUL opacity c/w scar. Also showed left adnexal
cystic structure.
*
She was given vitamin K 20mg IV once for PT of 17.8, which
responded by declining to 12.4 on [**11-23**].  PTT was normal
throughout her stay. haptoglobin-127
*
Total bilirubin elevated up to 2.3, but declined to 1.9 the
following day ([**11-20**])
*
Bone marrow aspirate by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and on her review, she had
increased luekemic blasts, without obvious auer rods.  She did
not note schistocytes.
*
On ER presentation [**11-18**] her BP was elevated to 204/92 and she
complained of urine discoloration since starting nitrofurantoin
for urinary frequency x 1 week. A bone marrow biopsy revealed
acute myeloid leukemia best classified as monoblastic M5a (FAB
classification) with >90% cells in her bone marrow being blasts.

Family History:
FAMILY HISTORY: + CAD. NO cancers or blood disorders.

Brief Hospital Course:
AML M5a: She was admitted and started on a low dose Ara C +
hydrea protocol + GM-CSF x 14 days for her AML.  She had a slow
decline in respiratory function in the setting of DIC and
initiation of chemotherapy, and was transferred to the ICU for
noninvasive ventilation and diuresis.  This resolved and she was
transferred back to the floor where her course was complicated
by mucositis as she became neutropenic and her counts declined.
Her hct and platelets were supplemented as needed with
transfusions to keep her hct > 25 and platelets > 10.  The
mucositis was treated with gelclear, viscous lidocaine and
eventually liquid roxicet, and she was placed on TPN.  She also
suffered hearing loss, which was initially thought to be
secondary to vancomycin.  However, this was followed by delirium
and mental status changes.  Benadryl, oxycodone, ativan and
other psychoactive drugs were initially discontinued, but her
mental status continued to vacillate.  A head CT was negative,
but a head MRI ordered [**12-22**] showed a possible infiltration in
the right and left frontal lobes and left cerebellum as well as
a small CVA in the left frontal lobe. She had small vessel
disease.  Radiation oncology was consulted and she was started
on dexamethasone and a 10-course treatment of whole brain
radiation.  Her mental status improved soon after the radiation
was started.  Her counts began to return on [**12-24**] and normalized,
requiring no further transfusions.  Her last CBC showed WBC 13.6
(elevation thought to be due to steroids), Hct 33.1 and
Platelets differential showed Her mucositis resolved, and her
TPN was weaned off and eventually d/c'ed.
*
Respiratory Distress: Patient was admitted with respiratory
distress that was likely multifactorial.  The inciting processes
likely include pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction, as echo
[**11-25**] with EF 60-70%, [**1-26**]+ MR) and pneumonia.  After starting her
chemo, her respiratory status further declined and she was
transferred to the MICU.  There, she was treated for her
pneumonia with vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin, placed on
noninvasive ventilation to decrease her afterload and preload,
and she was diuresed gently given her ARF with lasix.  She was
initially tried on a CCB for afterload reduction, but was
eventually switched over to atenolol 25 mg PO QD.  She was ruled
out for an MI with cardiac enzymes x 5 with a baseline troponin
of 0.05.  On transfer to the floor, she finished her course of
antibiotics.  The vancomycin was d/c'ed early because of
concerns that it was worsening her hearing.  She was sat'ing
97-98%, but still fluid overloaded with LE edema.  Due to her
bad mucositis, she was placed on TPN and her medications were
made IV.  The increased fluid worsened her volume status and her
respiratory status declined with sats at 93%.  As her RF
resolved, she was aggressively diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix QD.
Her respiratory status improved with sats at 99% RA with
resolution of her LE edema at time of discharge.  Her baseline
weight at discharge was 134 lbs.  Over the course of her
admission, she did have a PICC line attempt on her left arm
which resulted in an UE DVT.  This was not treated as her
platelets were <50 at the time.  She then developed a second UE
DVT due to a PICC line in her right arm, which was also not
treated due to low platelets.  As her platelets improved, the
decision was made not to treat her DVTs given resolution of her
erythema, tenderness and edema in her upper extremities and the
risk of bleeding from her leukemic infiltrates.  She had no
evidence of pulmonary embolus secondary to these DVTs during her
admission.
*
Renal Failure: On admission, she was found to be in ARF with a
Cr 2.6 after a contrast-enhanced CT at the OSH.  She had a low
FENA, no glomerular hematuria on sediment, just red cells and
very rare muddy browns (3 total). Etiology of arf was thought to
initially be due to contrast-induced nephropathy.  Her Cr
eventually came down and stabilized at 0.9-1.0 which was
reportedly her baseline.  After aggressive diuresis for her CHF,
her Cr increased back up to 1.2, but resolved with some fluids
and the discontinuation of her diuretics.
*
DIC: Likely [**2-26**] AML.  She was given cyroprecipitate to increase
her fibrinogen to 100 and FFP for procedures.  Her DIC resolved
after her treatment with AraC and hydrea.
.
Hepatitis with Hyperbilirubinemia: Her bilirubin was 2 on
admission and trended up to a peak of 5.9.  Fractionation
revealed roughly half direct and half indirect.  A RUQ U/S on
[**11-30**] was normal.  Her bilirubin began to elevate again and a
follow-up RUQ U/S [**12-24**] showed sludge in gallbladder with no
evidence of acute cholecystitis or gallstones seen or biliary
ductal dilatation.  She also developed a
