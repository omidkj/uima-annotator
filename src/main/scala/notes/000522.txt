         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a h/o CAD, HTN, CHF with
EF of 25% s/p L4-L5 laminectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] in [**5-/2140**], who
presented from a rehab facility with nonhealing lumbar surgical
wound.

#) Wound Infection/Sepsis: She had been started on Keflex [**8-6**] at
the rehab facility and the drainage was cultured on [**8-6**], which
grew heavy growth of MSSA and moderate alpha strep. As a result,
she was switched to Levaquin on [**8-8**] and then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**8-11**]. She was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn on [**8-12**].
She was taken to the OR on [**8-12**], where copious purulent fluid
was encountered, bathing the hardware. This was thoroughly
irrigated, and samples sent to micro, cultures ultimately grew
CoNS. She was initially placed on vancomycin and cefepime and
then transitioned
to a combination of Unasyn 2 q 12 hours (given her renal
function) and vancomycin 1 q 24 hours. Her OR course was
complicated by the fact that she was required requiring a
fiberoptic intubation, and was noted to have significant
tracheomalacia from midtrachea through carina. She was
successfully extubated in the PACU and required Levophed for
blood pressure support in the ICU for two days post operatively.
She was transferred to the general medicine floor from the ICU
on [**8-15**] where she remained afebrile and had reduced wound
drainage requiring twice daily dry sterile dressing changes. She
received a PICC line for the purpose of administering IV
antibiotics at her rehab facility. Finial infectious disease
recommendations are as follows:

Plan for 8-10 weeks for spinal osteomyelitis with hardware in
place, followed by life-long oral suppression given the presence
of hardware in infected bed.

Opat Antibiotic regimen and projected duration
Unasyn 2 q 12 hours x 8-10 weeks from time of operative
debridement, [**Date range (1) 4981**].
Vancomycin 1 q 24 hours x 8-10 weeks from time of operative
debridement, [**Date range (1) 4981**].

Cultura data (organism and susceptibilities)
MSSA, GAS (OSH)
CoNS ([**Hospital1 18**])

Essential diagnostic date for OPAT rx (TEE< bx, ect) baseline
Pertinent co-morbidities or complications:

Laboratory monitoring required: Weekly CBC with differential,
BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, Alk phos, Tbili, vancomycin trough, ESR, CRP.

All laboratory results should be faxed to Infectious disease
R.Ns. at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1353**]. All questions regarding outpatient
antibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns.

.
#) AMS: She was noted to have fluctuating mental status with
narcotic pain [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4982**], thus these were avoided to the extent
possible with pain control primarily with Tylenol and subsequent
improvement in her mentation to baseline per family. At her
baseline dementia she can answer questions about her care
appropriately.
.
#) Respiratory Failure: She was weaned off the ventilator post
operatively and was subsequently weaned from a non-rebreather to
4L O2 on nasal canula in the ICU and finally to room air with
excellent oxygen saturation on the general medicine floor.
.
#) Systolic CHF: She has a reported LVEF of 25% and requires 20
mg of Lasix daily at home. Because of the intravenous fluids she
as received while admitted this dose should be increased to 40
mg daily and titrated to her daily weight and creatinine.
.
#) Hypokalemia: Secondary to diuresis with Lasix required
monitoring and potassium repletion to reflect Lasix dose as
appropriate.
.
#) Iron Deficiency Anemia: She was started on ferrous sulfate
325mg daily while admitted.
.
#) Incontinence: She was incontinent at baseline and thus
requires absorbent undergarment and miconazole powder QID.
.
#) Depression: She was not restarted on her Citalopram 10mg
daily while admitted, however this may be restarted after
discharge if her mental status is believed to be at baseline
.
#) Loose stools were noted by the nursing staff - however her C.
Diff studies were negative and this may be her baseline.
.
#) DVT Prophylaxis was achieved with 5000 units of SC Heparin
TID.
