Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction. False LV tendon
(normal variant). Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting tachycardia
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The mid papillary short axis view looked better in comparison to
the mid esophageal views in terms of LV systolic function. The
increased heart rate made the systolic function appear better as
well

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe focalities in anteroseptal, anterior and inferior
septal walls.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in
person of the results on Mr.[**Last Name (Titles) 81844**].

POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function. There is a mild improvement in the
systolic function of the anterior and anteroseptal walls. LVEF
25%. Trivial MR, AI and TR.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18036**] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For surgical details, please
see operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.  He
was started on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and betablockers.  He
was transferred to the floor postoperative day one.  Physical
therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He continued
to progress, diuretics were adjusted, and beta blockers titrated
for heart rate control.  He was ready for discharge home post
operative day four with plan for VNA to be arranged [**2124-1-31**] by
case manager. Has been prescribed lasix for two weeks with plan
to follow up with cardiologist prior to completion for
evaluation of continued dosing of diuretics.
