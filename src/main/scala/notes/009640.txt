CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2105-6-8**] 7:33 AM

FINDINGS: Non-contrast head CT. There is no intra-axial or
extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of normally
midline structures, or evidence of hydrocephalus. Surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are normal. Visualized
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2105-6-10**] 12:04 PM

Current examination does reveal a thrombus within multiple
segmental and subsegmental branches predominantly affecting the
right lower lobe but also seen affecting the right upper lobe.

Evaluation of the lung parenchyma reveals significant bibasilar
atelectasis, left greater than right. Also, small bilateral
pleural effusions are seen. Patchy areas of peripheral air space
opacity are seen within the lungs bilaterally, predominantly
within the upper lobes. This is a non-specific finding.
Differential considerations would include infectious and
inflammatory etiologies. Clinical correlation is recommended.
Areas of atelectasis are also seen to involve the right middle
lobe.

No significant hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
identified.

The liver, adrenal glands, pancreas, gallbladder, and kidneys
appear grossly unremarkable. The spleen appears normal. There is
no evidence of splenic trauma. Visualized bowel is grossly
unremarkable. There is no evidence of free fluid within the
abdomen.

No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are seen. The
patient's known left-sided rib fractures are again incidentally
noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism is identified as noted above. This finding
is discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at approximately 12:30
p.m. on [**2105-6-10**].
2. Patchy areas of air space opacity and bibasilar consolidation
as noted above.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.
4. No evidence of splenic injury.

 CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post MVC with decreased oxygen
saturation and prior suggestion of splenic injury.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images are acquired through the thorax with
intravenous contrast with CT pulmonary angiogram. Also,
unenhanced images of the abdomen are acquired for
interpretation. Multiplanar reconstructions are provided for
interpretation.

FINDINGS: Direct comparison is made to prior CT dated [**2105-6-8**].

segmental and subsegmental branches predominantly affecting the
right lower lobe but also seen affecting the right upper lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service; Orthopedics was
consulted because of her fractured right tibia. she was taken to
the operating room for ORIF of this. There were no
intraoperative complications; postoperatively later during the
night she was noted to have increased heart rate and drop in her
oxygen saturations. She was transferred to the Trauma ICU; a CTA
of her torso was performed and revealed a pulmonary embolus.
Because of her recent trauma with hemoperitoneum and splenic
injury she was a poor candidate for immediate full
heparinization. She was therefore consented and prepped for an
IVC filter placement; this procedure was without any
complications. Postoperatively she underwent tight
heparinization followed by treatment with Coumadin. She
responded rather quickly with a rise in her INR after only a few
doses; she will be discharged on 2 mg Coumadin with instructions
to follow up with her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31258**] of her
dose as an outpatient. "Mini-coumadin" is considered quite
adequate because she has an IVC filter and no evidence of
symptomatic DVT. Her primary care doctor was notified of this.

Acute Pain service was also consulted for placement of epidural
catheter given her rib fractures; she would later be changed to
oral narcotics for pain control.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and it is being
recommended that she go home with PT services.
