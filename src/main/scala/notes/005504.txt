Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Fluid overload, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54 yo F with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4=437 [**8-3**]), DM2 (diet
controlled), CKD, R-sided CHF w/severe pulm HTN, with two recent
admissions to [**Hospital1 112**] for hypersensitivity reaction c/b
polymicrobial bacteremia (including VRE/MRSA), iatrogenic
[**Location (un) 3484**], C. diffcolitis (currently finishing a course of oral
vanco).  HAART and CHF regimen (hydral, metoprolol, isosorbide,
torsemide) held on d/c; CHF regimen switched to ethacrynic acid
and clonidine, now
with increased weight from 118 baseline to 155 lbs.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] from [**Date range (1) 97386**]/12 after p/w severe rash
with desquamation of skin on palms, soles and oral/vaginal
mucosal involvement.  Suspicious for SJS but w/u in burn unit at
[**Hospital1 112**] ultimately felt more c/w desquamating lichenoid
hypersensitivity reaction thought to be from  ART, specifically
recently started raltegravir and maraviroc (new as of [**5-3**]) +/-
ceftriaxone use.  Admit there c/bCoNS BSI (?line-related), ARF,
mental status changes, brief bout of iatrogenic [**Location (un) **]
presumed d/t mucosal use of topical steroids.  Ultimately d/c to
[**Hospital **] rehab and returned [**Date range (1) 97387**] with polymicrobial
bacteremia (VRE, MRSA, proteus, klebsiella and ESBL Ecoli--?skin
breakdown, ?line) and cdiff colitis along with worsening of her
rash again. She was again briefly in the burn ICU and intubated,
but quickly transferred to the floor where skin improved with
topical therapies (bactroban,
steroid cream, vaseline) and she was treated with
imipenem/vanco/metronidazole for her bacteremia and PO vanco for
C diff.

She was also restarted on a new HAART regimen [**2183-8-29**] after
discussion with her ID team of fosamprenavir 1400mg [**Hospital1 **],abacavir
300mg [**Hospital1 **] and lamivudine 150mg daily.  During this time her
prior CHF regimen of
furosemide/metoprolol/isosorbide/hydralazine was stopped,
reportedly d/t concerns that some may have contributed to her
rash though association not clear.  She was ultimately d/c'd
home [**2183-9-5**] off many of her long-standing meds and newly on
ethacrynic acid 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and clonidine 0.1mg daily for her HTN
and CHF.

Since d/c home patient reports she has felt increasingly SOB for
the last 3 days and is having increased LE edema.  She gets SOB
walking down her [**Doctor Last Name **] and has gained >10lbs since d/c (138 on
d/c up to 155 in clinic). Today she describes that she could not
walk to the door of her hospital room without becoming markedly
fatigued.  She denies CP/palps/F/C/abd pain/N/V.  She has been
taking her meds as prescribed.  She reports not using the
recommended ointments and creams today and is c/o cracking of
the skin on her hands and feet as well as diffuse dryness and
itching.  Lips still sore, but no vaginal soreness currently.

Past Medical History:
- HIV, diagnosed in [**2158**], on HAART (CD4=437 [**8-3**]),
-Patient recently presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-11**] with severe
desquamating rash and transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] burn unit. Rash was
determined to desquamating lichenoid hypersensitivity reaction
which was treated by stopping ART, avoidance of cephalosporins
and drugs of abuse such as cocaine. Dermatology was consulted on

admission and recommended wrapping patient in saran wrap and
using Vaseline for skin care. No mucosal involvement was noted
on admission. She was given copious IVF, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Hugger was
utilized given insensible losses and impaired thermoregulation.
Dermatology re-evaluation on [**2183-8-11**] revealed worsening mucosal

involvement and new erythroderma. This raised concern for
progression of her severe drug hypersensitivity eruption. This
was felt to be secondary to ART, specifically abacavir and
lamuvidine, and potentially ceftriaxone to her recent admission
to [**Hospital1 112**].  She is not currently on any related medications. Of
note, her last attempted ART was on [**7-29**] resulting in
maculo-papular rash. s/p Transfer to [**Hospital1 756**] Burn Unit [**8-11**]
