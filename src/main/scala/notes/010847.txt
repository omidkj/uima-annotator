Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the SICU for close neurologic monitoring.  He
had pre-op work up and was brought to the OR [**2149-1-17**] where under
general anesthesia he underwent right craniotomy with evacuation
of SDH.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to SICU
for close neuro checks. He had drains in and was kept on antibxs
for prophylaxsis until they were removed. He had post op
hypertension and was maintained on IV medication until under
control. His activity and diet were advanced. He transferred to
the floor [**2149-1-19**]. Geriatrics evaluated and made medication
recommendations which were followed. He was seen by PT and OT
and felt to be a good rehab candidate.
On day of transfer he is alert and oriented to self, cooperative
with exam, has an old R eye ptosis, pupils are perrla
bilaterally, eoms are full, no pronator drift, with noted
tremor. Range of motion of bilateral upper and lower extremities
are limited due to joint pain/arthritis/long-standing. Strength
is limited by pain.
Pt needs assistance with nutrition, he needs extensive PT/OT to
return to baseline. Pt family agrees with plan of care.
