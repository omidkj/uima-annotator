COMPARISON: [**2118-1-11**].

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ONE VIEW: There is interval removal of
endotracheal tube. Multiple chest tubes are unchanged. Right
internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in upper SVC.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Since prior study, there is resolved
pulmonary edema with lung fields grossly clear. No large
effusion is identified.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement with resolution of pulmonary
edema. No obvious pleural effusion identified.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine,
epinephrine, and was being A paced.

1. A mitral annuloplasty ring is seen well seated. Trace MR is
noted. A mean gradient of [**4-11**] mm of Hg is obtained. MVA is
estimated to be around 2.0 cm2.
2. RV systolic function was initially moderate-severely
depressed. Subsequent improvement was seen to mild hypokinesis.
3. LV function was preserved.
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
5. Other findings are unchanged
