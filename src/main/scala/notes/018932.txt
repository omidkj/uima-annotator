.
[**2187-5-11**] KUB: Supine and left lateral decubitus views of the
abdomen are
obtained. The bowel gas pattern demonstrates no evidence of
ileus or
obstruction. Left lateral decubitus view is limited to detect
free air given that the right lateral abdominal wall is
excluded, thus limiting the evaluation for air layering along
the edge of the liver. An IVC filter is noted in the mid
abdomen. Bony structures appear normal. Multiple phleboliths are
identified in the pelvis. Included lung bases appear clear.
.
[**2187-5-11**] CXR: AP upright and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. The lungs appear clear bilaterally, demonstrating no
evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony
structures appear intact. An IVC filter is partially visualized
in the upper abdomen. No free air was seen below the right
hemidiaphragm
.
[**2187-5-11**] Chest CTA: segmental pulmonary emboli in the RML, RLL
and LLL. Additional subsegmental emboli are seen in the LLL. no
acute aortic syndrome. ascites noted in the upper abdomen, new
since prior study and of unclear etiology. 2 mm RUL nodule. 3 mm
nodule LUL.
.
EKG: ECG: sinus, rate 85 bpm, no ST/T changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo F h/o DVT s/p IVC filter, h/o PE, transfusion-dependent
MDS, recent admission (discharged [**2187-5-7**]) for mechanical fall
and UTI, presents from rehab with groin pain radiating to abd
and chest, found to have new PE.

# PE: For PE, patient transitioned from heparin to lovenox for
new segmental emboli on CTA chest. No indication for
thrombolysis. She was discharged on lovenox due to benefit of
easier reversibility compared to Coumadin given history of
difficult to control INRs and setting of fall risk. Pt to
schedule follow-up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2187-5-29**].

# Hypotension: In MICU, patient given additional 2L fluids. SBP
stable at 80-100, and pt remained asymptomatic. She was not felt
to be infected given absence of fever, leukopenia, or positive
micro data - *will need to follow up pending cultures.* Also
unlikely to be due to PE. Pt reports that this is consistent
with her baseline low-running blood pressures which has been
noted multiple times in the past. Encouraged po fluid intake.

# Chest pain: Transient episode of atypical pain. Most likely
[**1-29**] PE. Ruled out for MI and remaining chest pain free since
admission.

# Pyuria: Pyuria on admission without any urinary sx; no urine
cx sent but did receive one dose of ceftriaxone in ED.
Antibiotics not continued in MICU as pt asymptomatic. Foley
removed and repeat U/A and Ucx clean. Pt remained asymptomatic.

# MDS: Patient transfusion dependent, was scheduled to get blood
transfusion as outpatient on [**5-14**]. Given Hct 21 on [**5-13**],
transfused 1 unit pRBC overnight with appropriate response and
subjective improvement in clinical status per pt. Outpatient f/u
with Heme-Onc per routine.

# Migraines: Continued precocet and zofran as patient refusing
outpatient imitrex citing decreased efficacy.

# Weight loss: 60-80 lbs over months of unknown etiology.
Suspicion for malignancy. However, last mammogram was in [**2182**]
and colonoscopy in [**2181**]. Extensive w/u at last admission
including CT chest, CT abd w/o masses and nl SPEP. Pt should
continue outpatient work-up, including mammogram.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.

# H/o questionable seizures: Continued anti-seizure meds.

# Peptic ulcer disease status post Nissen fundoplication:
Continued omeprazole.

# Asthma: Continued nebs prn.

# Code: Full

# Dispo: Pt evaluated by PT and recommended for Rehab. However,
pt refused this and instead chose to go home with services
including physical therapy.
