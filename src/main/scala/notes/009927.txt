History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 55542**] is a 62yoF with h/o PAF on coumadin, CVA, HTN, HLD,
who presents with chest pain, afib with RVR, and elevated
troponin. [**Known lastname 20036**] started on [**2133-1-29**], when she was riding in a
car as passenger and suddenly developed [**6-26**] substernal chest
pain with diaphoresis. Lasted 5 minutes then gradually resolved.
NO SOB or palpitations. For the next day she felt some residual
pressure feeling that was constant and did not vary with
activity. Today she is pain free x24 hours. She waited to be
seen because she was visiting on [**Location (un) **] at the time and
returned today. She notes she has had this type of pain before
when has developed afib. Pain was never this severe and never
had diaphoresis previously. Denies SOB, n/v. Had been in NSR on
[**2132-12-9**] at last cardiology appointment.
.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where vitals were T97.9
HR: 147 BP: 134/99 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 100 Normal. INR 2.6,
troponin(t) 0.746. D-dimer was checked and was negative. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 110 114/86 16 99%
Labs and imaging significant for CXR which showed clear lungs
fields with some vascular fullness.
Patient given metoprolol 15mg IV and 25mg PO, and ASA 325.
.
On arrival to the floor, 98.0, 116/85, 123, 16, 99%ra, 69.1kg.
She feels well, and denies chest pain or discomfort, SOB, or
palpitations. She overall feels well.

Studies
TTE [**2133-2-6**]: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium, the body of the right atrium, or the right
atrial appendage. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Right ventircular systolic function is normal
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened with miild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate/severe SEC in the LAA. No thrombus
identified. Depressed LV sytolic function. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-2-2**],
the findings are similar.

Cardiac MRI [**2133-2-5**]:
1. Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without
CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary
vein stenosis.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe hypokinesis
to akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall and akinesis of
the true apex. The LVEF was moderately depressed at 33%. Late
gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrated patchy
transmural late gadolinium hyperenhancement of the basal to mid
inferior wall and true apex, sparing a small segment of the
distal inferior wall. The findings are consistent with poor
(<20%) likelihood of functional recovery of these walls after
mechanical revascularization.
3. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild free wall
hypokinesis. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 37%.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were mildly increased and normal respectively.
The indexed diameter of the main pulmonary artery was moderately
dilated.
5. Mild biatrial enlargement.
6. A note is made of multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in the
liver measuring up to 3.6 x 3.0 cm in the hepatic dome (201:15)
which are incompletely characterized however most likely
represent simple cysts. Multiple sub- centimeter simple cysts
are noted in the left kidney

CXR [**2-6**]:
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2133-1-31**].
Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged. Mediastinum is
unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear. No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 55542**] is a 62yoF with h/o PAF on coumadin, CVA, HTN, HLD,
who presents with chest pain, afib with RVR, and elevated
troponin.
.
# Chest pain/NSTEMI: Troponin(t) elevated to 0.7 at [**Location (un) 620**], up
to 0.87 at [**Hospital1 18**]. EKG showed lateral TWI and some non-specific
ST changes. Cardiac cath on [**2-3**] showed 40% LAD disease. Thus,
likely rapid Afib was the primary problem, and this caused some
degree of stress cardiomyopathy and demand ischemia. It was also
possible that this was due to an MI that spontaneously cleared.
PE was ruled out with negative D-dimer at OSH. TTE showed focal
wall motion abnormality (though not congruous with LAD lesion)
and new decrease in EF (45%). The patient remained
anticoagulated on coumadin. No Plavix was started, but aspirin
was increased to 325mg daily. Cholesterol panel out of range
(per below), last A1c [**2129**] 5.6%
.
# Atrial fibrillation / sick sinus syndrome: She went in and out
of rapid afib and sinus bradycardia during this admission,
consistent with sick sinus syndrome. TSH on [**2132-11-19**] of 1.7. She
was initially anti-coagulated with heparin gtt and coumadin. On
[**2-5**] she had a cardiac MRI for staging for a planned pulmonary
vein isolation procedure. On [**2-6**] she went for PVI, but it was
complicated by oropharnygeal bleeding [**12-18**] TEE probe, and she
went to the CCU. The PVI was otherwise successful. In the CCU
she was intubated for airway protection and briefly on pressors.
She was extubated and off pressors within hours. She was doing
well and called out to the floor in stable condition, without
any more bleeding. Nodal agents were held given her t
