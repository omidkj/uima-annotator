History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5796**] is a 74 yo G3P3 scheduled for TAH/BSO, debulking on
[**8-10**]
presenting to the ED with N/V after initiating her bowel prep
yesterday. She used approximately 1.5 of the 3 bottles of prep,
and since then has had continuous N/V of brown, coffee-grounds
emesis. She also reports diarrhea per the bowel prep, but denies
any blood in her stool; she has generalized mild abdominal
discomfort but denies specific areas of more severe pain.
Otherwise, she has had no significant changes to her health
since she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] in the office, and denies fevers and
chills, or any history of gastric ulcer, GERD, or GI bleeding.
She is passing flatus; uses laxatives at baseline for
constipation.

She initially was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5797**] because of abdominal
distension and CT notable for omental thickening and stranding,
large ascites, and an enlarged pelvic lymph node, 1.3cm.

In the ED she has been started on IVF and has received a dose of
Zofran, but is not feeling much better and is continuing to
intermittently vomit small amounts of coffee-grounds emesis.

Pathology:
[**2117-8-10**] Peritoneal fluid:
Positive for malignant cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Note: The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for WT-1, EMA,
[**Last Name (un) **]-31, CK AE1/AE3, CK7. They are negative for calretinin, CEA
and CK20. P53 shows scattered nuclear staining (equivocal).

[**2117-8-10**] Paracentesis: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANCY consistent with
adenocarcinoma.

.
Imaging:
[**2117-8-9**] KUB Upright: Almost gasless abdomen which could
represent known ascites. Limited assessment of bowel, but no
definitive evidence of small bowel obstruction.
.
[**2117-8-9**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process. Hazy density
throughout the
visualized upper abdomen is likely due to known ascites.
.
[**2117-8-9**] Renal US: 1. Mild cortical thinning compatible with
atrophy but no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. 2. Moderate
abdominal ascites.
.
[**2117-8-9**] LENIs: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the
bilateral lower extremities.
.
[**2117-8-12**] KUB: 1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. No evidence of
obstruction, ileus, or free air in the abdomen. 2. Retrocardiac
density possibly representing LLL atelectasis. Would suggest CXR
to better evaluate.
.
[**2117-8-14**] KUB: Generalized haziness over the abdomen suggests
ascites. Again seen are non-dilated loops of small bowel with
air-fluid levels. Some gas is seen in the hepatic flexure, but
overall there is paucity of bowel gas in the colon. This is a
nonspecific bowel gas pattern and followup is recommended.
.
[**2117-8-20**] Portable Ab: 1. No evidence of obstruction. 2. NG tube
with tip overlying the stomach. 3. Ascites.
.
[**2117-8-20**] Portable CXR: INDICATION: Respiratory failure
post-central line placement. FINDINGS: Comparison to a
radiograph performed five hours prior. The new right internal
jugular central venous catheter is in satisfactory position with
the distal tip projected over the lower SVC. Position of the
nasogastric and endotracheal tubes and right-sided peripherally
inserted central catheter are unchanged and satisfactory.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, allowing for the
limitations of this supine radiograph. Moderately severe
interstitial pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly and small bilateral
pleural effusions are stable. bliteration
of the left medial hemidiaphragm is unchanged and suggests left
lower lobe
atelectasis. IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of newly inserted
right internal jugular catheter with no evidence of
pneumothorax. Stable moderately severe interstitial pulmonary
edema. Satisfactory position
of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes and peripherally inserted
central venous catheter.

[**2117-8-23**] Portable Ab: 1. Non-specific bowel gas pattern with no
definite evidence of obstruction. 2. NG tube with its tip
overlying the stomach.
3. Findings compatible with ascites.
.
[**2117-8-25**] Portabl CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-24**] at
6:23 a.m.: Endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet in
standard placement. Left subclavian line tip projects over the
mid SVC and nasogastric tube passes to the upper stomach. Mild
interstitial pulmonary edema may have improved slightly, small
left pleural effusion is stable. Right pleural effusion is
minimal, if any. Heart size normal. Mediastinal veins are normal
caliber.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2117-8-26**] Abdomen supine: 1. Limited exam secondary to ascites. No
evidence of dilated loops of bowel. 2. Transverse colon
displaced inferiorly, question enlarged liver.
.
[**2117-8-27**] Ab US: 1. Non-distended gallbladder, with no evidence of
stones, sludge, or wall thickening. There is no evidence of
cholecystitis.
2. No focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation
detected. 3. The CBD is normal in caliber, measuring 4 mm. 4.
Large amount of ascites, demonstrated on prior ultrasound
examinations.
.
[**2117-8-28**] Renal US: 1. Extremely limited scan; however, no evidence
of hydronephrosis. 2. Perinephric space difficult to evaluate
due to bowel gas and large ascites. 3. Large amount of ascites.
.
[**2117-8-30**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of
[**8-29**], there are slightly lower lung volumes but otherwise little
change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
some element of increased pulmonary venous pressure in a patient
with relatively low lung volumes. Monitoring and support devices
remain in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5796**] was admitted to the gyn oncology service on [**8-9**].
Transfer to the medical oncology service took place on [**8-16**] for
chemotherapy.  Course will be reviewed by system:

# Cardiovascular:  She was continued on her home
anti-hypertensives and statin.  She was cardiovascularly stable
throughout her hospitalization

# Respiratory:  On admission she had a chest x-ray which was
clear without effusion or edema.  The following day she
developed an oxygen requirement.  Repeat chest x-ray showed
significant pulmonary edema.  She was started on IV lasix which
was titrated to her oxyge
