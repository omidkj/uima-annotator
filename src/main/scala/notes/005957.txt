Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP for biliary sweep and sphincterotomy
Repeat ERCP for bleeding at sphincterotomy site; cauterized and
injected with epinepherine.


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o woman with a history of valvular heart disease, chronic
diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, who is admitted to
the medical service from the GI suite following a failed attempt
at ercp.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 31800**] hospital with
dyspnea, abdominal pain, and elevated LFTs. An ercp was
attempted, but cannulation of the CBD was unsuccessfull. She wsa
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat attempt, but this too was
unsuccessfull. Her INR was 1.7 and she received two units ffp
prior to transfer. In the ERCP suite a small pre-cut attempted
to aid cannulation, but cannulation still not successful.  She
is being transfered to the medical service for monitoring with
plans for a repeat ERCP on monday, [**10-31**].

She currently feels well. There is no discharge summary or
imaging reports available at this time for veiwing. There is
documentation that she had a common bile duct stone on the ERCP
consent form.

Past Medical History:
# Valvular Heart Disease - echo reports requested from Brokton
# Open Heart surgery - [**2135**] in [**State 760**], patient states there
was an aneurysm, but is unclear of further details. She does not
think she has a prosthetic valve.

ERCP Reports:

[**10-28**] Impression: Cannulation of the biliary duct was attempted
with a sphincterotome, 5-4-3 cannula using a free-hand wire
guided technique. Cannulation was unsuccessful, and a small
needle knife sphincterotomy was attempted. Cannulation was still
not able to be achieved. Small amount of self limited oozing was
noted.

[**10-31**] Impression: Evidence of a known previous small pre-cut
sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification.
A moderate dilation was seen at the CBD with the CBD measuring
12-13mm.
There were a few small filling defects at the distla CBD
consistent with sludge.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.

[**11-1**] Impression: Clotted blood and oozing was seen in the major
papilla.
Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete.
A moderate dilation was seen at the CBD with the CBD measuring
12-13mm.
A 10FR by 5cm double pigtail biliary stent was placed
successfully using a Microvasive 10FR stent introducer kit.

RLE LENI: Prelim: incomplete study, but visualized exam was
negative for DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with hx of dCHF, severe TR, presented with
choledocolithiasis for ERCP.  Initial attempt at ERCP was
unsuccessful, and pt returned to ERCP the following day which
was successsful, but was complicated by GIB in the
post-procedure period. Pt underwent repeat ERCP (3rd) with
hemostatsis via cautery and epinepherine injection at the
sphincterotomy site.  Pt received a transfusion of PRBC for
anemia and was monitored in the ICU. After returning to the
medical floor, pt developed hematuria, oliguria, and dCHF. She
was treated with continuous bladder irrigation with clearing of
her urine, her diuretics were restarted, and she was provided
vitamin K to further reverse her INR.  See below for details,
issue by issue.
.
# Choledocolithiasis, s/p ERCP
Pt underwent ERCP with removal of sludge and a sphincterotomy
was performed.  Pt's LFT's maintained a fluctuating course, but
appears to have a general trend of improvement. If LFT's do not
continue to improve, then we would recommend a Hepatology
consult for further evaluation.
Pt was treated with IV Unasyn for biliary obstruction, and this
was transitioned to Augmentin on [**11-8**]. We recommend continuing
through [**11-10**] or [**11-11**].  Please monitor temperature curve to
ensure remains afebrile.
The ERCP recommends repeat ERCP in [**5-16**] weeks.
.
# GI Bleed at site of sphincterotomy
After pt's ERCP with sphincterotomy, pt subsequently developed
large melena requiring urgent repeat ERCP for hemostasis.  Pt
was treated with cautery and epinepherine injection at the
bleeding sphincterotomy site. She was monitored in the ICU for
1+ days.  Her INR was kept normal with po Vitamin K.
- ERCP states OK to resume Aspirin/coumadin on [**11-13**].
.
# Asmmetric LE swelling
On day of transfer, pt was noted to have assymetric swelling of
her lower extremities, R>L, which was concerning for possible
DVT. Pharmaocologic DVT ppx had been held thus far d/t
significant GIB s/p ERCP that required emergent procedure. RLE
LENI was obtained which was negative, but did not visualize one
of the popliteal veins.
- Start SQ Heparin DVT prophylaxis
.
# Oliguria, Hematuria, Acute renal failure
After patient was called out of the ICU, pt was noted to have
oliguria, hematuria, and acute renal failure.  The hematuria was
presumed due to foley cathe
