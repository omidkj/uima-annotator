History of Present Illness:
68 year-old F with multiple myeloma, on Thalidomide and Decadron
who presents with progressive DOE x 6 weeks.  She used to be
able to walk up one flight of stairs without SOB and today she
was unable to walk to her bathroom.  On the morning of
admission, she also reported left-sided chest pain that radiated
to her back.  She had accompanying dizziness and
nausea/vomiting.  No pleuritic or positional components to the
pain.  She denies SOB at rest, orthopnea, or PND.  No change in
her chronic LE edema.  Of note she was taken off her diuretics
(for mild renal failure) 6 weeks ago, but had to restart them 3
weeks ago due to worsened LE edema. She also recently traveled
in a car to VA for the Labor Day weekend.
.
In the ED she was hypoxic to the low 90's on 100% NRB.  Her
lactate was elevated at 3.4, SBP 95, and out of concern for
sepsis, she received 1.2 L of IVF.  Once her BNP returned at
4948, her IVF was stopped and she put out 1200cc to 80 IV lasix.
 She also received a dose of levoflox and was placed on BIPAP.
ABG on 60% FiO2: 7.42/47/72.  Her EKG was unchanged, cardiac
enzymes were negative.

Past Medical History:
Multiple Myeloma - Dx in [**2108**] with IgA Kappa monoclonal protein,
followed without treatment. In [**2112-3-30**], she was noted to have
an IgA level of 2300, with increased fatigue.  Bone Marrow Bx
revealed > 50% plasma cells qualifying her for the Vaccine
Study, for which she is enrolled.  She received 3 cycles of
velcade.  She has been receiving Zometa and started on
Thalidomide and Decadron ([**2112-5-30**]).
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Hyperglycemia on Decadron
5. Restrictive lung dz: by PFTs in [**4-4**]
6. Chronic back pain (s/p MVA)
7. Duodenal ulcer 11 years ago.
8. History of Lichen simplex chronicus.
9. Right knee pain: s/p cortisone injections

Social History:
She is married and lives with her husband.  She has three
children. She works as a high school librarian.  Denies tobacco
use; drinks EtOH socially.

EKG:
NSR @ 85, nl axis/intervals, no ST or T wave changes.
.
<b>Radiologic Data:
CXR [**10-3**]:  Mild cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, but no evidence
for
pneumonia.
.
PFTs [**4-/2112**]: Reduced FVC (72%) and Dsb (63%) with low-normal TLC
suggests a restrictive process.
.
Echo [**3-/2112**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The LV cavity
size is normal.  Regional LV wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF> 55%). Tissue
velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal LV
filling pressure.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. RV systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is no
valvular aortic stenosis.  The increased transaortic gradient is
likely related to high cardiac output.  No aortic regurgitation
is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
estimated because of the lack of a tricusped regurgitation jet.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo F with multiple myeloma on Thalidomide and Decadron who
presents with progressive DOE x 6 weeks, hypoxia, hypotension,
and ARF. The following issues were investigated during her
hospitalization:

1) Resp Distress: On presentation to the CCU, the patient still
was still hypoxic to 80s on room air, requiring 60% face mask.
Her physical exam was unremarkable for CHF - she had no
peripheral edema, no JVD and her lungs were clear bilaterally.
Given her hypoxia, elevated A-a gradient (297), history of
multiple myeloma and her treatment with Thalidomide and Decadron
(known to be thrombogenic and pt. was not on outpatient
anticoagulation), there was significant concern for a PE. Her
Thalidomide was discontinued and she was started on a Heparin
drip. Her elevated creatinine did not allow for a CTA so a VQ
scan was performed and was highly suspcious for a PE with
multiple perfusion deficits. Additionally, an echo showed
depressed RV function and evidence of RV hypertrophy and LE
dopplers showed a DVT in her right popliteal artery. The
evidence of RV hypertrophy and multiple VQ mismatches suggested
an acute and chronic thromboembolic disease.  The Heparin drip
was continued and she was started on Coumadin. As she rapidly
improved she was not thought to be a candidate for
thrombolytics.  Her aPTT goal was 60-80 while she was
transitioned to Coumadin.  Upon arrival to the BMT service, her
hypoxia continued to improve.  By time of discharge, she
maintained normal oxygen saturation on room air.  As the patient
had transient risk factors for DVT/PE (i.e. recent long car ride
and thalidomide), will anticipate ~6 months of anticoagulation
with INR [**3-4**].
.
2.) CARDIAC:
* Ischemia: On admission to the ED, the patient had CE drawn to
r/o an MI. CK = 89 and Trop = 0.07. There is no reported history
of CAD and no EKG changes, but the patient has hyperlipidemia,
HTN, and hyperglycemia. She was continued on ASA 81 mg.
Metoprolol 12.5 was added once her BP could tolerate it. A
statin should perhaps be considered given an LDL in [**March 2112**] of
131; this can be revisited as an outpatient.
.
* Pump: Pt's pro-BNP on admission was 4948. She also has a
history of chronic LE edema for which she takes Lasix and
Triamterine as an outpatient. However, on exam her lung exam was
unremarkable and she had no peripheral edema. Her CXR was also
unremarkable. Given her ARF, her diuretics were held. On
