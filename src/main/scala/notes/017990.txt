Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 3444**] is a 53-year-old
female with a multitude of medical problems who was admitted
on [**2111-2-24**] to [**Hospital1 69**]
with MRSA and VRE bacteremia.  Patient was just recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] at the
pneumonia and pleural effusion as well as mental status
changes.  Upon her discharge to [**Location 6065**], she was noted to have
urinary tract infection with Klebsiella for which she
received a full course of antibiotics namely amikacin
and Cipro which ended on [**2111-2-18**].  Her repeat
urine cultures grew Klebsiella, Staph, and Enterococcus.  Her
blood cultures drawn revealed MRSA and VRE for which the
Center.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 69**], she
began her treatment with Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia.
Initially, she was started on linazolid for VRE, however,
following ID evaluation, that was thought to be
colonization.  No other cultures drawn at [**Hospital1 346**] confirmed VRE.  The patient
underwent an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection
fraction of 75% and no vegetations, as well as spine films to
evaluate for osteomyelitis which were negative.

On [**2111-3-3**], the patient was noted to have increased
oxygen requirement as well as shortness of breath and mental
status changes.  To maintain her saturations of 90%, she
required a nonrebreather mask and due to the mental status
changes was evaluated for Medical Intensive Care Unit
admission.

At the time of being evaluated by the MICU team, the patient
was confused and was not able to provide any history.  She
was using accessory muscles of ventilation and was pulling
off her nonrebreather mask.  An arterial blood gas was drawn
which revealed a pH of 7.37, pCO2 of 24, and pO2 of 60.
Patient was changed to BiPAP mask and transferred to Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a Jehovahs Witness.  She had a 35
pack year smoking history, quit in [**2094**].  She denied any
alcohol.  Healthcare proxy was [**Name (NI) 449**] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99170**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with 35 pack year
smoking history on 2 liters home O2, no CO2 retention per
prior blood gases.
2. Obstructive-sleep apnea on CPAP - patient is poorly
compliant.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to steroid use on chronic
steroids.
5. AVM malformation of the gut status post gastrointestinal
bleeding.
6. History of HIT-antibody positivity.
7. History of liver failure of unknown etiology.  Full workup
was undertaken on prior admissions and was negative.  Two
leading etiologies are alcohol and NASH.
8. Status post cholecystectomy.
9. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
10. Status post left total knee replacement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO MICU:  Temperature is
98.6 rectally, blood pressure 105/70, respiratory rate 20,
heart rate 88, O2 saturation 99% on BiPAP mask [**10-18**] with 60%
FIO2.  Generally, the patient was an elderly female with
moderate respiratory distress using her accessory muscles of
ventilation.  She was somnolent and not oriented.  HEENT:
She had scleral icterus.  Pupils are equal and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Could not assess jugular venous pressure due to the
body habitus.  Heart was regular, rate, and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  Lungs were with
decreased breath sounds on the left base.  Abdomen was soft,
obese.  Could not assess for ascites or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were edematous with 3+ pitting edema.  There is
no cyanosis noted.

LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION TO MICU:  White count 20.9
which is up from 14, hematocrit 27.8, platelet count 118, MCV
107.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride 115, bicarbonate
15, BUN 17, creatinine 2.0, glucose 81.  Calcium was 8.5,
phosphorus 5.3, magnesium 1.8.  Her INR was 2.5, PTT was
43.6.  Vancomycin level was 20.2.  Her last LFTs done on
[**2111-2-25**] showed an ALT and AST of 41 and 46,
alkaline phosphatase of 152, T bilirubin of 6.6.  Her
arterial blood gas drawn on BiPAP of [**10-18**] at 60% of FIO2
showed a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 30, pO2 of 92.   Blood cultures
drawn on 14th and [**3-3**] no growth to date.  Blood
cultures drawn on [**2-25**] had 2/4 bottles growing VRE
linazolid sensitive.  The [**3-17**] blood cultures drawn on [**2-24**] showed MRSA.  Her urine cultures have been negative
throughout the whole hospitalization with exception of culture
drawn on [**2-28**], which revealed more than 100,000 of
yeast.

CHEST X-RAY:  On [**2111-3-2**] showed a PICC line in the
brachiocephalic vein, increased left pleural effusion,
continuous left lower lobe collapsed consolidation.
Echocardiogram performed on [**2111-3-2**] showed
hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 75%,
moderate pulmonary hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 53-year-old
female with liver failure of unknown etiology as well as
renal failure with MRSA bacteremia.  Admitted to MICU for
acute respiratory decompensation.

During this hospitalization, the patient's issues included:
1. MRSA bacteremia.  The patient was continued on Vancomycin.
For the presumed left lower lobe pneumonia, she was started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Linezolid was d/c'd as per ID
recommendations.

2. Hypoxia.  The patient had enlarged AA gradient that was
most likely due to combination of her pulmonary hypertension,
pneumonia, and congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.  She
was not able to tolerate BiPAP due to the mental status
changes and required intubation on [**2111-3-3**].

3. Acute renal failure.  The patient was thought to be
prerenal, however, throughout her MICU stay, she was
aggressively hydrated with normal saline and Lactated ringers
with improvement in her creatinine and minimal urine output.

4. Liver failure.  Patient's INR remained elevated.  Her
albumin was 2.0.  She was presumed to be encephalopathic and
an OG tube was placed for lactulose delivery.

5. Patient has a history of HIT antibody positivity.  She did
not receive any Heparin during this hospitalization.

6. Adrenal insufficiency.  The patient was continued on high
dose hydrocortisone for possible congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation as well as for adrenal
insufficiency.

7. Diabetes.  The patient was maintained on sliding scale and
her glucose was monitored.

8. Access.  PICC line and A-line which was placed on [**2111-3-3**].

Upon extensive discussion with the family, with the light of
the patient becoming hypotensive, a decision was made to
concentrate on patient's comfort.  Patient's severe acidosis
continued to progress and she passed away on [**2111-3-5**] at 1:28 pm.  Family was at the bedside.  Request for
autopsy was denied.

IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF DEATH:
1. Hypertension.
2. Acidosis.

CHIEF CAUSE OF DEATH:  Liver, kidney, and pulmonary failure.
