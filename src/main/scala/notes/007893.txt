Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73882**] was take to the operating room on [**2148-9-23**] for a
laparoscopic resection of the colon mass. Due to multiple
adhesions and friable tissue, the case was converted to open.
The sigmoid colon was resected and an end-to-end anastamosis was
performed via stapler. He tolerated the procedure well with an
EBL of 100cc. He was routinely observed in the PACU. He was
transferred to the floors for routine post-operative care.
.
POD#[**2-3**]: He was triggered for agitation with HR 130's (AFIB), O2
sat 93%RA. He was transferred to telemetry floor. Cardiology was
consulted and he was started on a Diltiazem drip wit improvment
in heart rate. He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and
made strict NPO due to altered mental status. Both his cardiac
and mental condition slowly improved, his bowel function
returned, and his diet was advanced over the next few days.
.
POD#6: He developed abdominal distention, profuse diarrhea with
a increased WBC to 18.3. Stool cultures were sent, and he was
empircally started on IV flagyl. He then had an aspiration event
requiring intubation. Bilious material was suctioned from ET
tube. He was transferred to the ICU, pressure support was
started and a PA catheter inserted for fluid management.
.
POD#7: He remained on the respiratory ventilator. His stool
cultures came back postive for C.Difficile ([**2148-9-29**]). His urine
culture was sent and eventually grew out enterococcus. Over
time, his sputum grew Klebsiella pneumonia and S. aureus that
were coagulase positive. Vancomycin, Zosyn, & orals vancomycin
were added to regimen. A TTE echo was performed and revealed
LVEF46%, no thrombus with mild global hypokinesis.
.
POD#11: He continued on the ventilator with mutliple attempts to
wean, but unsuccessful. Patient developed pneumothorax requiring
placement
