CC:[**CC Contact Info 68070**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with LCx stent placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42751**] is a 58 yo male with a pmh significant only for
hyperlipidemia presented to the ED at OSH with 2 hours of sudden
onset 10/10 chest pain and SOB and c/o nausea and R arm ache.
ECG at that time showed inferior ST elevations with reciprocal
depressions in V1-V3. Patient received Ritavase 10mg IV, with
some relief of pain, but subsequently began to experience
increased R arm pain and nausea about 1 hour later. A nitro gtt
was started and titrated up and EKG repeated showing worsening
ST elevations now including inferolateral leads. He also
received plavix 600mg but went into Vfib arrest at approximately
19:28, received lidocaine and was shocked at 120J, returned to
mobitz type II with a BP 75/53 and a HR of 26. Atropine
administered x 2 and was externally paced, sedated and
intubated. Dopamine gtt started at this time. Vitals were 134/55
paced at 60. Restarted on nitro gtt, went back into Vfib and
shocked twice at 200J to sinus rhythm.
At this time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. On
cath, he was found to have mild LAD disease with a 50% origin
major diag, 80% small ramus of the LCx and 100% mid LCx, and 60%
mid RCA. PCWP 26, RA 11, AO 129/68, PA 49/19, RV 65/10 with a CI
3.32 and CO 7.29. PA sat 81. A drug-eluting stent was placed in
the mid LCX.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was intubated and sedated
with a ABP 110/64, PAP 40/27, CVP 15, pulse 79 in NSR with occ
PVC's, sats 95-97%. AC 600 x 20 FiO2 100 Peep 5.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 yo male s/p emergent cath with mid LCX stent
placement after inferolateral STEMI and multiple vfib arrests
who was extubated after 24 hours of arrival and improved well
clinically in 72 hours throughout admission.
.
Course
.
1. Cardiac:
   Ischemia - patient received emergent intervention on 100% LCX
for his inferolateral STEMI. He received appropriate post cath
hydration and 18 hours of integrillin. He was also started on
Plavix 75mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325mg QD, Lipitor 80mg QD, and was titrated
up on Metoprolol to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 10mg QD for
cardioprotective effects and long term medical management for
his STEMI.
   Pump- The patient was weaned from his dopamine drip upon
arrival in the CCU and he autodiuresed almost 5L of fluid as his
LVEF returned to [**Location 213**] and was able to mobilize displaced
fluid. An echo performed on [**5-24**] demonstrated an EF of 40-50%
and a moderately dilated LA with inferior and posterior
hypokinesis.
   Rhythm - He remained in NSR throughout admission in the CCU,
with cessation of ectopy within 48 hours from last vfib arrest.
At this time, he is not a candidate for ICD implantation, as he
has been hemodynamically stable and there has been no further
ectopy beyond 48 hours.
.
2. FEN - patient had a K of 3.7 on [**2108-5-26**] which was repleted
with good result. Started on cardiac diet, and received diet
counseling before discharge.
