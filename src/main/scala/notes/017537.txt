History of Present Illness:
84 yo male with vascular dementia vs Alzheimer's, HL, DM II, CVA
with right temporoparietal bleed who presents to the ED with
AMS.  At [**Hospital3 **] he was reported to have AMS and SBPs in
the 80s.  Per his wife he was increasingly lethargic at the
nursing home.  For the last 3-4 days he would not open his mouth
to eat and "went down [**Doctor Last Name **] quickly."  He was changed to a soft
diet and was pouching his food.  Prior to that time he was
chewing normally.  He had poor PO intake for multiple months and
especially the last 3 weeks. He's had at least a 25 lb weight
loss since [**Month (only) 216**] per his wife. Wife says he used to weight 200
lbs and now he weighs 158. Prior to [**Month (only) 205**] was walking at home
with a cane and he stopped walking in the middle of [**Month (only) 216**]. At
baseline does not have comprehensible speech.  Per his wife he
also had 4 UTIs in [**Month (only) 359**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.5, HR 124, BP 124/76, RR 16,
SpO2 96% on unknown amount of oxygen.  In the ED the patient was
initially minimally responsive and non verbal.  He was found to
have a UTI with >1000 WBC and few bacteria for which he received
Ciprofloxacin.  He also had hypernatremia to 160 and received 1L
of NS and then a second liter of NS with 40 of potassium since
he was hypokalemic to 2.3. His mental status improved while in
the ED and he became more alert but remained not oriented and
non comprehensible.  He initially was not hypotensive in the ED
but became hypotensive to SBP of 80s prior to transfer and an IJ
was placed.  His lactate 2.2. His Trop was 0.05 and his EKG was
notable for new septal q waves.  He was given Aspirin 600 mg PR.
 His INR was 1.8.  HCT was 29 (recent baseline 37). His left eye
was notable for erythema and tearing which is chronic. He had a
pressure ulcer on his left heel.
.
On arrival to the ICU, vitals were T axillary 100.4, BP 103/52
(dropped pressures to 80s soon after arrival with MAPs in 50s),
RR 31, SpO2 92% on 50% shovel mask.  Labs were notable for
stable lactate (2.3), troponin increasing to 0.14 (from 0.05), K
4.4, bicarb improved from 16 to 21, creatinine to 2.3 (from
1.2), HCT up from 29 in ED to 39, WBC up to 14 from 8.6.  He was
originally groaning but opened his eyes more and became more
interactive during the first hour.
.
Review of systems:  Unable to obtain given AMS.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo male with vascular dementia vs Alzheimer's, HL, DM II, CVA
with right temporoparietal bleed who presents to the ED with AMS
in the setting of poor PO intake and was found to have
hypernatremia, UTI, acute renal failure and hypotension.
Hypernatremia treated with IV fluids D5W and NS and gradually
resolved over first 3 days. UTI treated with vancomycin and
meropenem with subsequent decrease in urinary WBCs. Urine
culture only showed Diphtheroids, felt likely contaminant. Renal
failure resolved gradually and serum creatinine normalized to
baseline. Mental status gradually improved to baseline by around
hospital day 3. Hypotension proved largely treatment resistant.
Patient was ~16.5 L positive in fluid balance for total hospital
stay but presented severely dehydrated with ~7 L free water
deficit. Developed mild respiratory distress with pulmonary
edema that responded to Lasix/albumin. Nevertheless continued to
require IV pressor support. Trial of hydrocortisone for possible
relative AI was not effective. Ultimately, given severity of
patient's underlying dementia and inability to wean pressor
support, family meeting was held and decision was made to make
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3225**].
.
Management by problem:
# Shock: Intermittently hypotensive, likely reflective of
sepsis.  He was minimally responsive to IV fluids and pressors.
He was placed on a Norepinephrine drip and then started on
Midodrine without being able to wean off pressors.  He had a 17
L positive fluid balance for LOS and appeared to be developing
worsening pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. Trial of
hydrocortisone did not show clear improvement in his pressures.
He was treated for infection as below.
.
# Pulmonary edema: Net 17 L positive fluid balance. Taking into
account ~7L free water deficit and dehydration on admission,
still likely total body volume overloaded.
.
# Urinary tract infection: Culture demonstrated Corynebacteria.
