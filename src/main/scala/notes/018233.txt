Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
76 yo WF with PMH of CAD s/p MI, ?CVA, HTN, tobacco abuse and
CRI, who presents with chest pain. The pt reports onset of chest
pain on Monday night while watching TV. She initially attributed
this to her first prednisone which had been started that day for
a gout flare. The patient reported chest pain as sharp, [**9-27**]
with radiation to both arms. The chest pain was associated with
bilious emesis x [**4-23**] at 9p.m as well as diaphoresis and SOB. She
was BIBA to [**Location (un) **] ED at 12MN. At the time, EMT believed her to
be in SVT/RAF and gave adenosine 6mg x3 and diltiazem 18mg IV.
Her initial ECG was concerning for anterior lateral ischemia.
Her CE were significant for CK/MB which trended as follows:
70/na - 389/53 - 487/80 and Trop: 0.12 - 3.14 - 8.93. In
addition, her creatinine was 2.4 and blood sugar was 700. She
was given ASA 325mg x1, Plavix 300mg x1, morphine 2mg x1,
Lopressor 5mg x1, and started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt with
resolution of ECG changes. In addition, she was started on
insulin gtt at 6 units/hour for a FSBG of >500. She has been
pain free since 8AM today. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.


The pt underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed no
significant CAD in LAD, LCx but chronically occluded appearing
RCA. An attempt was made to cross the RCA lesion with a guide
wire, however she developed bradycardia with transient heart
block. She was given Atropine which resulted in tachycardia with
possible Afib. LVEDP was 20 at the beginning of cath but during
this episode, PCWP was 30 and PaSaO2 was 44%. An IABP was placed
during the cardiac catheterization and PaSaO2 inc. to 64%. She
was never hypotensive during this episodes. She was given
protamine to reverse the hep gtt thinking this episode of
hypotension may have been due to tamponade. However the stat TTE
did not demonstrate any tamponade physiology.

[**2163-6-14**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.  The
LMCA
showed no angiographically apparent stenoses.  The LAD showed a
40%
midsegment stenosis and appeared tortuous.  The LCx was a small
vessel
without significant stenoses.  The RCA showed a proximal 100%
stenosis
with considerable left to right collaterals to the distal
segment and
RPDA from the LAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics after onset of atrial fibrillation with
rapid
ventriular response demonstrated severely elevated filling
pressures
including mean right atrial pressure of 27 mmHg and mean
pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 32 mmHg.  Cardiac output was
moderately
depressed with cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m2.  After restoration
of
sinus rhythm and balloon pump insertion, hemodynamics markedly
improved
with mean right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, PCWP mean of 10 mmHg,
and
cardiac index of 3.2 L/min/m2.
3. Attempt to angioplasty proximally occluded RCA were
complicated by
bradycardia with heart block followed by atrial fibrillation
with rapid
ventricular response, with the hemodynamic changes described
above.
4.  Unsuccessful attempt to recanalize the totally occluded RCA.

5.  Successful insertion of a 7 French IABP.
.
[**2163-6-15**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Cannot exclude basal inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-6-14**], left ventricular
systolic function now appears much improved although prior study
was technically suboptimal. Of note, patient on IABP during
today's study.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76yo F with CAD s/p MI, CVA, DM, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, and long h/o tobacco abuse who presented
with acute onset chest pain.
.
1. CV:
A. Coronary Artery Disease: The pt has known CAD which was
confirmed with the finding of an RCA lesion on catheterization.
However it is unlikely that her episode of chest pain was an
acute plaque rupture. Given the appearance of the lesion, the
complication which resulted from the attempt, and presence of
collaterals, this is most likely a chronic occlusion.  Given the
episode of decompensation in the cath lab and the chronic nature
of her occlusion, it was decided that no further attempts at
catheterization would be attempted, and the patient was
medically optimized on ASA, Lisinopril, and Lipitor.  Plavix was
not considered to be necessary in the absence of stenting.
.
B. Pump: The pt has a history of CHF with previously low EF of
20% in '[**58**] with documentation of improvement to 50% in '[**61**].  A
stat TTE performed in the cath lab during her episode of
decompensation revealed a severely depressed LV function with an
EF of [**10-7**]%, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed
emergently.  Repeat TTE on the following day revealed an EF of
50%.  In the presence of high MAP's in the 24 hours s/p
catheterization, the IABP was discontinued without
complications.  Given the documented acute change in her
hemodynamics, this may suggest the presence of a stiff
ventricle, possibly myocardial stunning from NSTEMI.  Her
outpatient regimen of Digoxin was discontinued in the absence of
heart failure at time of discharge.  Through her hospital
course, she was up titrated on her beta-blocker and AceI as
tolerated by her BP, with goals to maintain SBP <130 and HR <70.

.
C. Rhythm: The pt had an episode of bradycardia followed by
tachycardia/afib which may be the result of vagal stimulation
from attempts to intervene on RCA. She remained in NSR for the
remaining duration of the hospitalization.
.
D. Valve: Some evidence of mitral valve leaflet thickening on
TTE.
.
2. DM: The pt has admission glucose of 700 (gap of 11) but
reported no known diagnosis of diabetes.  She was eventually
transitioned from an insulin gtt to SSI coverage and finally to
oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with good cont
