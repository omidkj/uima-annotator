weeks ago he presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with complaints of
chest pain, ruled out for myocardial infarction, and was sent
home for outpatient stress test which was abnormal. He presented
on [**9-7**] for cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease. Now presents for surgical
revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-15**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium.. No thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
In addition, the distal lateral, anterolateral, and anterior
walls seem more hypokinetic than the other segments. The overall
ejection fraction is about 35%. The right ventricle displays
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POSTBYPASS The patient is atrially paced on a phenylephrine
infusion. Global left ventricular function is now slightly
improved (overall ejection fracture about 40-45%) although
global left ventricular hypokinesis persists. The distal
lateral, anterolateral, and anterior walls continue to be more
hypokinetic than the other segments. Valvular function is
essentially unchanged. Thoracic aorta is unchanged after
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73256**] was a same day admit after undergoing his cardiac
cath and pre-admission testing during previous hospital visit.
On [**9-15**] he was brought directly to the operating room where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one his chest tubes were removed
and he was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care.
Beta blockers and diuretics were started and he was diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing well and his pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
