Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**] is a 63yo M w/hx of CHF (EF 15-20%), s/p ICD
placement, severe TR, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.8), afib on
coumadin, elevated LFTs, who presented to the ED with chest pain
and L arm pain. By report of wife and patient he has had bad
gout over the past several weeks to months.  Principally this
has been involving his right foot limiting his ability to walk.
In the past few days had increasing right arm pain that patient
thought was also his gout.  Then starting about yesterday,
patient had severe left arm pain at the shoulder and the elbow.
This is ultimately what prompted him to come to the ED.  ROS
notable for +sharp midsternal chest pain with coughing,
non-productive cough, sinus congestion for several weeks,
chills.  Patient denied back pain, neck pain, pain with chewing,
changes to his urine output or other complaints beyond those
noted.
.
Of note, recent medication changes include uptitration of
allopurinol to 250mg PO qday for gout after recent gout flare
[**4-7**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T101.4 HR71 BP90/42 RR20 100%RA .
Blood pressures dropped to the 70s systolic and he was given 1L
IVF, a CVL was placed and CVP was 13-16.  A R IJ was placed and
after dopamine was turned up to 20mcg/min, he was started on
Levofed and dopamine was weaned down.  He was given Vanc and
Levofloxacin and nothing further due to allergy to Unasyn.  He
underwent non-contrast CT of the abdomen which was grossly
normal. CXR was clear.  A FAST scan in the ED did not show
pericardial effusion, kidneys without hydronephrosis.  Received
3L NS, ASA 325, Vanco 1gram Morphine 4mg IV x1.  Levo/aztreonam
ordered but not given.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient c/o total body pain, and
feeling cold.


Past Medical History:
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 15-20%
ICD placement for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death
Diabetes mellitus type 2 insulin dependent
Gout
Peripheral neuropathy
Chronic atrial fibrillation
Chronic kidney disease
Elevated transaminases, unknown etiology
Umbilical hernia repair, [**8-/2175**]
Gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP ([**2176-6-28**])

Social History:
The patient is originally from [**Country 3515**] currently living with his
wife.  Returned to [**Location 3515**] this past fall, but came back to US
after severe gout flare of his foot.  No smoking.  He quit
alcohol use, no IV drug use.  He says his diet is generally
difficult because he
feels like any food he eats causes gout flare
.


Family History:
No first-degree relatives with coronary artery disease.  His
mother had breast cancer.
.


Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
THREE VIEWS, LEFT SHOULDER: Examination is limited by
nonstandard views as
well as the overlying pacemaker. There is moderate degenerative
change at the acromioclavicular joint with narrowing and
subchondral sclerosis. The
glenohumeral joint appears intact. There is no visualized
fracture.
.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT ELBOW: There is no fracture or abnormal
alignment. There
is no joint effusion. Mineralization is normal.
.
NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT: Imaged thyroid gland is grossly
unremarkable. There
is a left-sided cardiac pacer with the lead terminating in the
right
ventricle. There is also a right internal jugular intravenous
catheter with the tip at the mid-distal SVC. A few subcentimeter
mediastinal lymph nodes with no evidence of lymphadenopathy are
noted. There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy on this
non-contrast study. The aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic
calcifications. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary
arteries are also seen. Heart is enlarged. There is no
pericardial effusion. Bibasilar atelectatic changes and/or
pneumonia, left more than right are noted. Mild emphysema is
likely present. Calcified granulomas in the right lower lobe
(2:46 and 2:30) are noted. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.

NON-CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT: The unenhanced liver, spleen,
pancreas, adrenals are unremarkable. Small pericholecystic fluid
was also seen on prior study.  Both kidneys are in normal
anatomic location. A focal, somewhat band-like calcification in
the interpolar region of the left kidney is stable since [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2177**]. There is a probable 2-mm nonobstructive stone in the
inferior pole of the left kidney (2:74). There is no
hydronephrosis. Abdominal aorta and
iliac vessels demonstrate severe atherosclerotic calcifications
with no
aneurysmal dilatation. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.
Evaluation of
the GI tract demonstrates no evidence of bowel obstruction or
bowel wall
thickening. Tubular blind ending structure in the right lower
quadrant likely represents a normal appendix.

NON-CONTRAST PELVIC CT: The urinary bladder is collapsed and
contains a Foley atheter. Air within the urinary bladder is
likely secondary to
instrumentation. Bilateral small fat-containing inguinal hernias
are seen.  The rectum contains stool, otherwise unremarkable.
Seminal vesicles are symmetric. The prostate gland measures
about 5 cm in transverse diameter.  The urinary bladder wall
thickening may be secondary to underdistension. A few mildly
prominent inguinal lymph nodes are noted. A hypoattenuating
structure measuring 2.3 cm in the right lower abdomen to the
right of the urinary bladder is stable.
  .
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no bony lesion to suggest
malignancy or
infection.
  .
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild emphysema.
2. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid was also seen on prior
study. Please clinically correlate.
2. Probable 2 mm nonobstructive left renal calculus.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old male with PMH of severe systolic HF with
an EF=25%, afib on coumadin, who presented with hypotension and
found to have questionable adrenal insufficiency in the setting
of a likely gout flare.
.
#. Hypotension:  Possibly due to adrenal insufficiency, given
symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils,
hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia with low cortisol failed ACTH
stimulation ([**Last Name (un) 104**] stim 6->10->10).  Confounding factors are that
colchicine causes diarrhea and allopurinol induces
hypereosinophilia.  An abdominal CT without contrast showed no
evidence of adrenal pathology.  Initially, the patient had fever
and tachypnea concerning for septic shock possibly from a
pulmonary source as a possible pneumonia was seen on CT scan.
He did have a normal lactate and no leukocytosis.  Septic
arthritis was considered given prominent joint complaints and
history of gout, althoug
