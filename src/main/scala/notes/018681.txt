Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  fall, leg weakness

Reason for MICU transfer: intubation, percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiogram

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- ERCP
- IR percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram with placement of
10F left internal/external drain
- R CVL placement by IR
- L CVL Removal
- IR placement of IVC filter
- IR placement of stent and removal of biliary drain

History of Present Illness:
69F h/o developmental delay, seizures, OSA on CPAP, GERD, who
initally presented to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] with LE weakness and fall, as well
as blood in stools. She was found to have an increased troponin,
anemia, and hyponatremia. She was given 2U RBC's and may have
had a transfusion reaction although this is unclear from [**Name (NI) 4199**]
documentation.

She is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from Wooden (admitted [**5-4**] for
weakness and anemia). During a prep for cscopy, had afib with
RVR, then developed hypotension briefly requiring pressors while
on dilt gtt. She was rate controlled with dilt gtt thereafter
and was volume resuscitated. She was electively intubated for
increased work of breathing and respiratory distress at the OSH.
She was given vanc, CTX, flagyl for GPC's and GNR's in BCx
(initially was on CTX and gent, but after speciated as
klebsiella, gent was d/c'd). She was found to have increased
Tbili to 4, and RUQ US was unrevealing but CT scan showed abnl
gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated
CBD.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

RADIOLOGY:
-[**5-5**] TTE from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]:
Summary: LV size and wall thicknesses are nl; LVEF is ~75%.
-[**5-10**] CT abd/pelvis from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]:
Two gallbladder-to-distal small bowel fistulas with associated
severe gallbladder wall thickening. This is highly suspicious
for gallbladder carcinoma with possible local invasion of the
adjacent liver and adjacent loop of colon. Alternatively, and
probably less likely, this could be due to chronic inflammatory
process of the gallbladder. Severe extrahepatic and intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation with pneumobilia. Dilatation tapers at
the level of the distal CBD without obvious obstructing mass
lesion visualized. Debris or sludge ball may be present in the
distal CBD. No bowel obstruction. Mild ascites and small b/l
pleural effusions.
-[**5-10**] CXR
Bibasilar opacities are largely attrributible to small effusions
and
atelectasis, as seen on recent CT.  A small opacity in the
lingula could
represent a small focus of pneumonia.
- [**5-12**] RUQ U/S
1.  Limited study. Irregularity in the gallbladder region as
expected. No
targetable liver lesion identified.
2.  No intrahepatic bile duct dilation.  Borderline common duct
dilation. PTBD in place.
-[**5-13**] Abdominal MRI
1.  Circumferential gallbladder cancer erodes into a small bowel
loop in the right upper quadrant (21: 24) and also possibly into
the liver. Two hepatic lesions are most consistent with bilomas.

2.  No intrahepatic duct dilatation, the common bile duct is
dilated within its central portion measuring up to 1.2 cm but
tapers distally.
3.  Moderate ascites.
4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
- [**5-14**] CXR
AP chest compared to [**5-10**] through 18:
There are now more discrete areas of consolidation in the right
mid and lower lung zones, which could be due to pneumonia.
Aeration in the left lower lobe is compromised but unchanged
since [**5-10**], probably atelectasis.  The heart is moderately
enlarged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  A
right jugular line ends deep in the right atrium.  No
pneumothorax.
- [**5-15**] LUE U/S: There is an occlusive clot in a short segment of
the left
cephalic vein.  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis or hematoma.

- [**5-17**] Lower extremity U/S: Non-occlusive thrombus involving the
distal left superficial femoral vein. No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the right lower extremity deep veins.
- [**5-18**] echo The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular out
