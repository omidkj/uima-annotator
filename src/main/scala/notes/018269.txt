History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 YOF with history of alcoholic cirrhosis who
presented to [**Hospital3 **] today with altered mental status,
new onset jaundice, hypotension, and renal failure. At [**Hospital1 46**],
her SBP was in the 70s and Cr found to by 6.0 (reportedly new).
She was given 2L IVF and transferred by med-flight to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.
.
In our ED she continued to be hypotensive to 70s when dopamine
stopped. A right femoral line was placed given coagulopathy and
dopamine restarted. She was confused and had positive asterixis.
She was given levofloxacin and flagyl. A RUQ U/S was done which
showed sludge in the gall bladder but no stones and normal
hepatopedal blood flow. Vitals when she left the ED on 10 mcg
dopamine, afebrile HR 140 BP 100/60.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient is not able to answer questions
secondary to encephalopathy. history take from husband and
sister. She has never been hospitalized before. She had new
onset of jaundice about 1 week ago. This was associated with
abdonimal distention, weakness, lehtargy. Has been in bed since
Monday. Husband [**Name (NI) 71737**] last alcohol was Monday. Has not eaten
or drank in several days. Today she refused to go in the
ambulance until she took a shower. She locked her self in the
bathroom and fell hitting her left temple and back.

Peripheral smear
PLTs nl count, no clumping, occasional large plt
RBC macrocytic, no central pallor, no schistocytes, occasional
nucleated RBC and retics seen
WBC - leukomoid reaction with PMN predominance, bands,
occasional atypical lymphocytes. No hypersegmented neutrophils
seen


EKG:
poor tracing. sinus. 129 bpm. nl axis and intervals. No st
changes or TWI.
-


Imaging/Studies:
CXR - Lung volumes are somewhat low. The aorta is unfolded.
There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of focal
infiltrate or pleural effusion, however left costophrenic angle
is partially obscured by overlying external device. Pulmonary
vascularity is normal.
.
Liver U/S - No prior for comparison. This study is limited due
to portable nature and patient inability to cooperate with
examination. The liver is diffusely echogenic. Gallbladder wall
is thickened, but the gallbladder does not appear distended.
Layering sludge is seen within it. No definite intrahepatic
ductal dilatation is seen. Common bile duct is not dilated.
Portal venous flow is maintained in the appropriate direction.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 YOF with alcoholic hepatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis,
and renal failure.

# Alcohol hepatitis - Patient had long history of alcohol abuse
and positive tylenol level on admission. Bilirubin greater 30 on
admission and discrimanant function 38, MELD 33. She was treated
initially for 48 hours with N acetylcystiene. Liver was enlarged
but no evidence of portal vein thrombosis. She was also started
on solumedrol and transitioned to PO prednisone.  Hepatitis
serologies were sent and were negative. EGD revealed no varices.
Gradualt LFT's improved.  However, she returned from the ICU and
then developed worsening diarrhea which precipitated hepatorenal
syndrome.  She became dehydrated but could not be fluid
resuscitated due to renal failure and resultant hypoxia with
fluid administration, and was therefore transferred back to the
ICU.  given her rising MELD, 42 prior to transfer, patient's
family was informed of her poor prognosis.  She was made comfort
measures only and subsequently passed away.

# Renal Failure - Initially in renal failure which improved with
volume resucitation. Cr stablilized at around 1.8. Started on
octreatide and midodrine for emipric treatement of hepatorenal
syndrome with improvement of creatine to 1.0. Then, Patient was
then started on lasix and spironolactone. Several days later,
upon transfer to floor, she had newly elevated creatinine.
FEUrea 30, urine Na 33. She also had positive eos and elevated
Vanc level previously. She was started back on HRS protocol, but
suspicion very high for ATN/AIN picture as well. Renal was
consulted and ultimately felt that this was more likely AIN/ATN.
Creatinine gradually improved.

# Respiratory failure: Intially intubated for worsening acidosis
and volume overload. She was diuresed and extubated on [**2142-4-10**].
She initially improved. Then on [**4-16**] had worsening abdominal
distension and had paracentesis of 3L; also had fever to 101,
dyspnea/tachypnea to 30's, increased oxygen requirement with A-a
gradient of 50, tachycardia. ABG was 7.46/22/69, lactate of 3.4.
V/Q was done - negative for PE. LENIs were negative for DVT as
well. Over remainder of hospital course, she continued to have
episodes of tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia requiring several
MICU transfers for closer observation and paracentesis PRN. No
obvious etiology of her symptoms was isolated.

# fever/tachycardia: currently afebrile.
- serial paracenteses [**4-9**], /11, /14, /21, /26 have shown no
evidence of SBP
- tapped again 2.5 L on [**4-28**]
- continue fluc
- Blood Cx revealed no growth except 1 bottle presumed
contaminant

# Sepsis/Hypotension: When she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], she was
hypotensive to 70's and placed on dopamine and neosynephrine
gtt. A femoral line was placed at the OSH which was switcher to
a left IJ. She was admitted to the MICU and received empiric Abx
including Vanc, Zosyn, Meropenam. Very extensive MICU course
most notable for prolonged pressor-dependent hypotension,
encephalopathy; was treated with steroids for etoh hepatitis;
had multiple therapeutic paracenteses; multiple transfusions;
intubated [**3-24**] for acidosis and altered mental status, extubated
[**4-10**].

# Alcohol abuse/withdrawl - Intially very delerious. History of
seizure. Was treated with IV ativan. Given
multivitamin/folate/thiamine. During the rest of her hospital
course, she received lactulose and had improvement in mental
status.

# esophageal candidiasis: extensive candidiasis seen on EGD
- continue po fluconazole (started [**4-19**]): plan for [**2-4**] wks
course

# Substance abuse: Had been on CIWA scale for EtOH abuse, but
now >3 weeks from last drink so no further ativan needed.
- Social work involved
- Cont thiamine, MVI, folate

# ANEMIA:
- Macrocytic anemia, likely due to alcohol abuse. Hct seems to
have stabilized
- active T&S, guaiac stools

# FEN: S&S passed, on nectar-thick liquids, soft sol
