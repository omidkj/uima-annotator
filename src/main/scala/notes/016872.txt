HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male with
history of multiple medical problems who was recently
admitted to the [**Hospital6 256**] from
[**2178-11-26**] to [**2177-12-5**] with projectile vomiting and
hematocrit of 13.

He had negative hemolysis workup and negative EGD times two
and a colonoscopy times one.  Found to have a right upper and
right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**]
filter was placed, and he was transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab
and went home in late 01/[**2177**].

units of fresh frozen plasma, and one unit during previous
hospitalization and two units of packed red blood cells while
he was at [**Hospital1 **].  He had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum.

Ten days ago his Coumadin and aspirin were continued for
planned EGD and colonoscopy with good prep.  On [**2178-1-15**] he

negative.  His colonoscopy revealed two polyps which were
adenomatous without any complications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
[**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient
could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held.
Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and
Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on [**2178-1-27**] per GI.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his
home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was
stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most
recently 8.9 in 02/[**2177**].  Patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 261**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in
[**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
[**2178-1-27**].  Patient was continued on his statin.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary emb
