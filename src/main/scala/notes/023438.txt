Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ triple lumen catheter

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3175**] is an 88M with DM and CAD s/p CABG who presents with
SOB. Approximately 10 days prior to admission, he developed a
cough productive of yellow sputum, with some associated coryza
and headache. He was prescribed an albuterol inhaler by his PCP
and told to follow up if his symptoms worsen. The evening prior
to admission, he developed a fever to 100.8F for which he took
tylenol. He also had chills and sweats. The morning of
admission, he did feel short of breath and took nitroglycerine.
He had no associated chest discomfort,
lightheadedness/palpitations, nausea, or vomiting.

Review of systems otherwise negative for abdominal discomfort,
dysuria, myalgias, arthralgias, no diarrhea or constipation.
Only sick contact was wife who had some nausea/vomiting at home,
no contact with children.

In the ED, his vitals were T 98.2 P 70 BP 74/32 RR 16 O2 96% on
room air. A central line was placed and he was given
approximately 2 liters of saline as well as levofloxacin 750mg
and Zosyn 4.5g empirically for pneumonia. His blood pressures
improved to the 110-120's without need for any pressors.

He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of possible sepsis.

EKG Irregular 56bpm likely atrial fibrillation, left axis with
LAFB, QRS 122ms, T inversions V1-V6 and III, vF which appear new
in comparison to [**3-5**] EKG

CXR
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of [**2150-4-22**].
SINGLE PORTABLE ERECT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 1255 HOURS:  There
has been little interval change since the prior examination.
Within the lungs, there is no focal consolidation, pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is unchanged.
Cardiomegaly is stable, and median sternotomy wires and surgical
clips are unchanged.  There is no hilar or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
My read - question of increased opacity left CP angle

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2151-1-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best
excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with more
prominent hypokinesis of the inferior wall (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
88M whose PMH includes CAD s/p CABG, DM II, CKD, and
sensorineural hearing loss, presents with cough, dyspnea, and
hypotension, initially requiring MICU care.

1. Cough/Dyspnea: Fever, leukocytosis, and dyspnea suggestive of
pneumonia. Although CXR not officially read as showing new
infiltrate, there is increased opacity at left base, and
clinical context supports community-acquired pneumonia. He was
stabilized in the MICU on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
and blood cultures remained negative. He was transferred to the
floor on [**1-27**] and maintained normal oxygen saturation on room
air. His symptoms significantly improved, and the ceftriaxone
was switched to cefpodoxime the day before discharge. He will
complete a total 14-day course.

2. CAD/ acute on chronic diastolic CHF/ acute systolic CHF: His
exam and high proBNP were consistent with CHF, especially after
aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED. He diuresed well with
IV lasix in the MICU. EKG was without acute ischemic changes and
cardiac enzymes were negative. Mildly elevated troponin was
attributed to the CHF as well as renal insufficiency. He was
transferred to the floor on [**1-27**] and was started on his
outpatient lasix dose, 60mg, confirmed with his cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. As the last TTE in our system was from [**2143**], another
one was obtained on [**1-27**] and showed decreased LVEF to 40-45%.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who confirmed his last TTE was
actually in [**2150-10-29**] and showed preserved LVEF with
diastolic dysfunction. Clinic notes and echo report were faxed
and placed in the patient's inpatient chart, and a summary was
typed into his OMR. His newly depressed LVEF is likely in the
setting of the above acute infection with early sepsis, and a
follow-up echo in the outpatient setting was deferred to Dr. [**Name (NI) 80071**] discretion. He was maintained on his lisinopril, ASA, and
Plavix. He was not discharged on a beta blocker for reasons
explained below.

3. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/ asymptomatic bradycardia: Mr.
[**Known lastname 3175**] is not on chronic anticoagulation, and he was not on a
beta-blocker on admission for unclear reaso
