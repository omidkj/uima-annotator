PERTINENT STUDIES:
.
L-Spine XRay ([**1-31**]): AP and lateral views of the lumbar spine
are btained. There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type
vertebrae. Vertebral bodies maintain normal alignments. There is
no evidence of compression fracture. Degenerative disc disease
is most notable at T12-L1 with endplate spur formation seen. The
posterior elements are suboptimally assessed given exclusion on
the second image of the series and underpenetrated technique on
the third image of the series. Extensive vascular calcifications
are seen along the distal aorta on the lateral projection. SI
joints and visualized portions of the hip joints appear
unremarkable.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia with rate ~120s. ST depressions II, V3-V5
and TWF in III

CTA Chest: Prelim read: Esoph thickening, no PE, no dissection

CXR: No acute C-P process

ABD U/S: FINDINGS: There is a single adherent subcentimeter
stone along the wall of the gallbladder, which is otherwise
unremarkable. The liver has an increased echogenic appearance
since the prior study, suggesting worsening liver disease. Flow
in the main portal vein is hepatopetal. The spleen is not
enlarged, measuring 12.2 cm in length. The pancreas is not well
visualized because of overlying bowel gas. No ascites is
present.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief this is a 56 yo man presenting with back pain, alcohol
intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases.

# Rhabdomyolysis: Patient had elevated CK on admission. The
exact cause for this process is unclear but it is suspected that
he must have suffered trauma while intoxicated. He was treated
with IVF and urine alkalinization. His CK trended down with this
intervention.

# Back pain: He was noted to have small T12 and L1 compression
fractures. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient. His pain was
managed with Morphine.

# EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH
abuse and EtOH withdrawal seizures, with a recent drinking binge
for two weeks prior to admission with last drink the night prior
to admission.  Patient was placed on valium withdrawl protocol.
He required high doses of valium in order to prevent withdrawl
symptoms.

# Agitation: This was attributed to a paradoxical valium effect.
This medication was discontinued and his aggitation improved.
While agitated he was places on restrains, temporarily, because
he exhibited aggressive behaviour toward house staff. He was
placed on haldol standing and prn. His electrolytes and QTc
remained within normal levels during haldol administration.
Psychiatry saw the patinent. When his aggitation decreased
haldol was stopped and his home seroquel was restarted.

# Elevated lactate, hypotension: The patient was hypotensive in
the ED and he had a lactate which was elevated. These resolved
with IVFs. There was a concern for thiamine deficiency, given
the patient's history of alcoholism.  He was started on thiamine
supplements.

# COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o
COPD for which he takes inhalers including advair at home. He
was placed on nebulizer treatments for the duration of his stay.
