shortness of breath, chest pain

none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66 year-old man with a history of COPD, AAA, and
HTN, recently discharged on [**2131-12-3**] after being treated for
pneumonia/COPD exacerbation with levofloxacin and prednisone.
His sputum culture grew 2 types of GNR that were not speciated.
He was also discharged on [**10-11**] after being intubated in the
MICU for COPD exacerbation/pneumonia that eventually grew S.
pneumonia and treated with levoflox.
.
The patient reports for the last four days he has been having
worsening SOB, cough and sputum production. The patient also
developed sharp/pleuritic right lower chest and flank pain. He
states that the breathing and cough has worsened. Pt denied
hemoptysis, fevers, chills, abdominal pain or N/V.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 97.6 123 145/72 24 95% 3L. He
underwent CTA that showed RLL segmental PE with associated RLL
infarct. There was also a LLL consolidation concerning for
pnuemonia. Additionally, his AAA had increased in size to
4.2x7.5cm without evidence of rupture. He was given
Vancomycin/Levofloxacin for his pneumonia and started on a
heparin gtt (guaiac negative). CE x1 were negative. Leukocytosis
of 22.0 and lactate of 2.9. UA was negative. He was also given
morphine 2mg x2 for pain. The patient continued to be
tachycardic with rates 105-110, SBP stable ranging 120-140, and
O2 sats 100% on 3L.
.
On the floor the patient is complaining of SOB and pleuritic
right sided chest/flank pain. He denied fevers/chills.
.
Called by radiology regarding CTA [**Location (un) 1131**]. Pancreatic ductal
dilation would recommend MRCP/ERCP. AAA has area of
calification/hyperdensity likely represents thrombus, but would
recommend non-con CT to better evaluated for possible leak.
.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
CXR Portable [**2131-12-29**]: The lungs again are hyperinflated with
flattening of the diaphragms and prominence of the interstitial
markings with relative lucency of the upper lobes, suggesting
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Scattered parenchymal
scarring is again noted, most pronounced in the bilateral apical
region, right greater than left, where biapical thickening is
seen. Mild opacities along the peripheral left lung base are
without significant interval change to mildly decreased since
the prior study. Interstitial opacities are seen along the right
lung base. No discrete focal consolidation or pleural effusion
is seen. The heart is not enlarged. The aortic knob is
calcified.  Partially visualized spinal metallic hardware is
again noted.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis w/o Contrast and CTA [**2131-12-29**]:
1. Right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus with
possible right
lower lobe pulmonary infarct vs infection.
2. Focal consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for
infection.
3. Debris within the trachea; while most appears aerosolized,
underlying
endobronchial lesion cannot be entirely excluded particularly
within the right main stem bronchus.
5. Cholelithiasis. Dilated common bile duct and prominent
pancreatic duct.
MRCP or ERCP should be performed.
6. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as described above, with
interval
increase in size when compared to [**2125**].
7. Mild antral wall thickening and enhancement, may in part
relate to
underdistention or gastritis. Correlation with endoscopy.
8. New hyperdensity within the aortic aneurysm which is likely
calcification. Noncontrast CT scan of this area is recommended
to confirm.
.
Bilateral Lower extremity U/S [**2131-12-30**]:
Extensive thrombus within the left common and superficial
femoral, popliteal and peroneal veins. No right lower extremity
deep venous
thrombosis.
.
CXR for line placement of 42 cm PICC [**2131-12-31**]:
The cardiac, mediastinal and hila contours are normal and
unchanged
from [**2131-12-30**]. The right-sided PICC terminates at the
cavoatrial
junction. Lung opacity is worsened since [**2131-12-30**].
Worsened bibasilar opacities are noted compared to [**2131-12-30**], worrisome for pneumonia.  Severe emphysema is noted.
Spinal hardware is unchanged compared to most recent priors.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided PICC line at the cavoatrial junction.
2. Worsening bibasilar opacities compared to [**2131-12-30**],
worrisome for pneumonia.
3. Severe emphysema, unchanged since prior.
.
MRCP [**2132-1-1**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Mild dilatation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct
which taper
normally at the ampulla and are smooth in contour. This is most
likely from papillary stenosis versus sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction as no obstructing lesion is seen, however, a subtle
lesion could be missed given limited evaluation secondary to
patientinability to breath hold. If concern persists, ERCP could
be performed for further evaluation.
2. Cirrhosis. Trace ascites.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aor
