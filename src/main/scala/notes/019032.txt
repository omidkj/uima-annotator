Date of Birth:   [**2110-3-11**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
female with a history of 02 dependent COPD who began having
increased shortness of breath at rest and was found by EMS in
respiratory distress with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing
and accessory muscle use, tachypneic with respiratory rate to
the 30s and decreased hilar volume.  The patient was
reportedly having cold symptoms for a couple of days.  On the
day of admission, the patient developed worsening chest
congestion with low-grade temperature.  The patient had a
productive cough for several days producing yellow sputum.
The patient denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever.

In route to the outside hospital, the patient desaturated and
was intubated.  At the outside hospital, the patient was
treated for COPD/pneumonia with steroids, Rocephin, Levaquin,
and bronchodilators.  The patient was noted to have ST
elevation in the precordial leads on EKG and positive cardiac
enzymes.  The patient was started on Lovenox, Plavix, and
later switched to Aggrastat.  A chest x-ray was negative for
infiltrate or CHF.  Echocardiogram performed showed
hyperdynamic right ventricle, left ventricular ejection
fraction of 50%, with apical dysfunction, 1+ MR/TR and small
pericardial effusion.

The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has eight siblings, one brother
with MI in his 50s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.4, blood
pressure 112/67, pulse 123, respiratory rate 17, pulse
oximetry 100%, SIMV/pressor support 450, 12, 0.35,
spontaneous 500/14.  In general, the patient was an elderly
thin woman intubated, agitated, but in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Positive conjunctival inflammation and edema.  ETT
and nasal gastric tube in place.  The neck revealed no JVP,
prominent sternocleidomastoid muscles.  Cardiovascular:
Distant heart sounds, difficult to auscultate secondary to
breath sounds.  Lungs:  Positive expiratory wheeze from
prolonged expiratory phase.  Abdomen:  Tense, abdominal
muscles contracted with respirations.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema, warm.  Periphery:  Positive radial
pulse.  Positive dorsalis pulse on the right, unable to
palpate left.  Neurological:  The patient was sedated, not
responsive to commands.  Skin:  Thin, multiple ecchymoses.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES:  The last ABG 7.37, 40, 97,
24, 97.  White blood cell count 11.1, hematocrit 30.1,
platelets 157,000.  The Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 133,
potassium 4.0, chloride 100, bicarbonate 22, BUN 18,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 160, calcium 7.5, albumin 2.6,
protein 5.9.  ALT 43, AST 43, bilirubin 0.5, alkaline
phosphatase 66.

The EKG showed normal sinus, multifocal atrial tachycardia at
126 beats per minute, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V2 through V3,
new T wave inversions in V3 through V6, II, III, and aVF.

The chest x-ray showed hyperinflation, no evidence of CHF or
pneumonia.

Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25-30%,
severely decreased function.  No mass.  No thrombus.  Apical
hypokinesis of anterior septum, anterior wall, and
anterolateral wall hypokinesis of free wall of right
ventricle, 1+ MR, trivial pericardial effusion.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 75-year-old female with a
history of COPD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who
presented in respiratory distress likely secondary to COPD
exacerbation/pneumonia.  The patient was noted to have
questionable EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes, but
normal echocardiogram since [**Hospital1 18**] catheterization.  On
arrival, the EKG showed T wave inversions.  The
echocardiogram showed severely depressed systolic function
and wall abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  The patient was initially stabilized in the CCU
and was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where normal
coronary arteries were found.  Right ventricular failure with
high output state was found.  Repeat echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 70%.  The patient was started on
pressors after being transiently anuric.  Subsequently, the
patient began urinating again without ever having an increase
in creatinine.

The patient continued to have a septic physiology but no
source of infection other than lungs identified.  The patient
was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.  The patient was
originally started on a Diltiazem drip for the multifocal
atrial tachycardia but was switched to pressors when she
became hypotensive.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was with severe COPD.  Difficult
ventilation but adequate oxygenation.  Possibly secondary to
tracheobronchitis course.  The patient was continued on
steroids, beta agonists, ceftriaxone initially but this was
changed to levofloxacin for better atypical coverage.  The
patient had a difficult course on weaning off her ventilator
and was eventually switched to DNR/DNI status, extubated and
transferred to the floor.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient developed a GI bleed, a
slow ooze, most likely secondary to gastritis while on
Aggrastat and heparin in the setting of her MI.  The patient
was started on b.i.d. Protonix and was transfused p.r.n.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was with questionable
pneumonia/tracheobronchitis treated initially with
ceftriaxone and then switched over to levofloxacin.

5.  OVERALL REVIEW:  Overall, the patient was treated
initially in the CCU and then was transferred to the MICU
after a difficult course of extubation.  She was eventually
weaned off pressors and transferred to the MICU.  The MICU
course was marked by episodes of hypertension, leukocytosis,
and difficulty in weaning off her ventilator.  She was
diuresed p.r.n. in the setting of diastolic dysfunction.

Her post extubation course has been marked with C02 retention
which was treated with invasive ventilation.  Additionally,
she had Guaiac positive stools.  Her blood cultures remained
negative.  Her sputum cultures never grew fungus.  She was on
Levaquin when she was transferred to the floor for
presumptive tracheobronchitis.  She was transferred over to
DNR/DNI/CMO care on the floor.  She was started on a morphine
drip for comfort as well as a scopolamine patch.

The patient persisted for several days, but eventually
expired secondary to cardiopulmonary collapse on [**2185-8-27**].

The attending and family were informed.  An autopsy was
refused.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's family refused an autopsy.
Attending and family were both informed.
