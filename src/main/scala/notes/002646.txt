p.o.t.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg
p.o.q.h.s., Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Atrovent one to two
puffs q.12h., albuterol one to two puffs q.4-6h.p.r.n.,
Flovent one to two puffs b.i.d., Epogen 4,000 units with
hemodialysis, Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d., levofloxacin 250 mg
p.o.q.48h., Flagyl 500 mg p.o.t.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 97.3, pulse 72, blood
pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 16 and oxygen saturation
94% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light, no erythema, no
exudates.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Right dry gangrene
over lateral aspect of right foot, gangrenous toes #2 and 3
on the right foot, left transmetatarsal amputation, incision
site clean, dry and intact, 1+ ankle edema bilaterally.
Pulses:  Carotids 1+ with bruits heard on right, femoral 2+
bilaterally, popliteal not palpable, dorsalis pedis
Dopplerable right and left, and posterior tibialis
Dopplerable on left, nonpalpable and non-Dopplerable on
right.  Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times
three, cranial nerves II through XII intact, sensory intact,
motor intact, deep tendon reflexes 1+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission hematocrit was 32.9, sodium 139,
potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 54,
creatinine 3.6 and blood sugar 82.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service and placed on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.  A
cardiology consult was obtained and a recommendation was made
for the patient to remain on Plavix due to his recent cardiac
procedure.

On [**2173-7-18**], on recommendation from cardiology, the
Plavix was stopped because it was felt that the patient had
had an adequate amount of time on this medication.  The
patient remained asymptomatic until [**2173-7-21**], when he
was taken to the Operating Room for a right carotid
endarterectomy.

At the end of the case, during suturing, the patient
developed severe hypotension with a systolic blood pressure
dropping down to 50 and heart rate in the 40s and 50s.  The
patient was supported on epinephrine.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
was placed showing a central venous pressure of 14, pulmonary
artery pressure of 60/22, cardiac output 3.4.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed in the Operating
Room, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
35%, distal anterior septal hypokinesis, and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.

The patient responded well to pressors and was transported to
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit with a blood pressure of 120/70
and electrocardiogram showing no significant changes at that
time.  The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit, where he remained completely asymptomatic.  He was
ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes and
electrocardiograms.  The patient was transferred to a regular
floor on [**2173-7-23**].

Laboratory data on discharge:  Hematocrit 27, white blood
cell count 8.2, platelet count 199,000, sodium 140, potassium
3.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 35, creatinine 3.8,
blood sugar 135, prothrombin time 12.7, partial
thromboplastin time 29.5, INR 1.1, calcium 7.3, magnesium
1.6, phosphorous 4.3.

DISPOSITION:  The patient continued to be asymptomatic and
was discharged home on [**2173-7-24**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
VNA services.
