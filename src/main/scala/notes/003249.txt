Afib on coumadin, Parkinson's disease, myelodysplastic syndrome
with anemia and thrombocytopenia, transferred from OSH with left
hip fracture. History obtained from the patient and his
daughter. The patient lives alone in an apartment downstairs
from his daugther who helps with all ADLs. He walks with a

was increased, and at the OSH today his creatinine was 2.5
(baseline 1.5-1.7). He sleeps with his head elevated in a
hospital bed; denies PND.
.
Pt underwent L hemiarthoplasty of the hip for a L femoral head
fx. Pt unable to wean from vent in PACU. Admitted to MICU for
VAP, hypotension (briefly on levophed) and ATN thought to be [**3-12**]
hypotension. Pt placed on lasix gtt with good u/o to this. Now
continues to have altered MS but improved improved creat and
treatment of presumed infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, AS s/p valvuloplasty, CHF EF
35%, COPD, AF, CRI, Parkinson's Disease presenting with failure
to extubate secondary to poor mental status after left hip
hemiarthroplasty transferred to the MICU with hypoxic
respiratory failure, hypotension.
.
# Respiratory/PEA arrest: Pt self-extubated [**5-23**]. CXR with mild
vascular congestion, LLL collapse. s/p treatment w/ 8 day course
of Vanco/Zosyn for VAP completed on [**5-22**]. Lasix gtt d/c'd [**5-24**]
d/t hypotension. US did not show a large enough LLL effusion to
tap. After transferred to the medical floor on [**5-26**], pt
complained of acute shortness of breath. He became hypoxic and
then had a PEA arrest. He was resuscitated with EPI and
atropine. He was shocked x 3 for probable VT and bolused with
amiodarone 300 mg IV x 1. On tranfer to the MICU, again had a
PEA arrest with bradycardic rhythm x 2 unresponsive to multiple
doses of Epi, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium chloride,
transcutaneous pacing and maximum pressor support on Levophed,
Dopamine and Neosynephrine. Laboratory results were significant
for severe metabolic lactic acidosis. Discussions were made with
the family regarding pt's poor prognosis despite maximal medical
efforts. Time of death was 1832 on [**5-26**]. Possible etiology may
have been acute PE, though patient had been anticoagulated x 2
weeks for his atrial fibrillation. CXR did not show signs of
fluid overload/PNA/PTX. Pt's family declined a post-mortem.
.
# ID: Pt treated for VAP s/p 8 day Vanco and 7 day Zosyn on
[**5-22**], MRSA in sputum.
.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr elevated from baseline of
1.5, peaked at 4.1, trending down to 2.9 likely from ATN. Renal
had been following, HD had not been started.
.
# CV:
> CAD: increased enzymes earlier in admission were c/w demand
ischemia [**3-12**] hypotension. Was on ASA, statin, BB
> Rhythm: atrial fibrillation- rate controlled, anticoagulated
on heparin gtt.
.
# Anemia: s/p 1u PRBC [**5-17**]. Hct remained stable.
.
# Mental Status: Initial somnolence likely secondary to
narcotics administered in the PACU. Slow improvement in MS
likely from uremia.
.
# s/p Left hip hemiarthroplasty:  Ortho had been following along
with PT for mobilization.
.
# MDS: Anemia/thrombocytopenia at baseline. Had been on
EPO/Iron.
.
# Parkinson's Disease: was on Sinemet
.
# Conjunctivitis: was on erythromycin ointment
