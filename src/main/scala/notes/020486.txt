Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:

Pt arrived in MICU with GAS septicemia, UTI, ARF, and LE wounds.
 Started on Clinda and unasyn for UTI and GAS septicemia.  IVF
rehydration for ARF, which after 3 days of trending up, reached
a [**Location (un) **] of 6.9, and since has trended down, now at 6.5.
Gen Surgery, vascular surgery and wound care were consulted for
LE wounds.  In light of ARF, vascular surgery deferred angio
study of known PAD until renal function returned, although they
feel that the LE wounds will not fully heal without
revascularization.  Wound care recommendations were formulated
and followed.  ID was consulted regarding both LE wounds and
documented infections.  Dermatology was consulted regarding LE
wounds, and recomended PTH for ?calciphylaxis, remaining unclear
if they plan to biopsy wound.  Patient has been markedly
uncomfortable throughout MICU stay, complaining of pain and
unwillingness to participate in her care, including taking PO
therapies.  Son closely involved in her care, and after long
discussions, has agreed to make her DNR/DNI and not allow an NG
tube for tube feeds.

Course on the floor:

Pt was transitioned to CMO per conversations with family and
patient who expressed her wish to not have any further
interventions. Pt was made comfortable with morphine boluses and
fentanyl patches (pt prefered to not be touched). Palliative
care was involved.  Antibiotics and IV fluids were discontinued.
Labs were not checked and heparin sc was dicontinued. All
non-comfort oriented medicines were also discontinued. Pt
appeared comfortable c frequent visits from son until she passed
away.
