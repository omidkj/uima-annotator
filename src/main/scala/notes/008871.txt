History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 51902**] is a 70 year old man with a long history of marginal
zone lymphoma s/p auto SCT [**2140**], s/p four cycles of bendamustine
and Rituxan ([**7-/2148**]) but with progression of disease noted on
interval PET scan, course c/b mycobacterium chelonae cutaneous
infection on abdomen (recently initiated for treatment with
clarithromycin with noted resolution of symptoms), recently
admitted [**Date range (1) 51905**] with disease progression during which he was
started on RIME (Ifosfamide, Mitoxantrone, Etoposide), also with
history of kidney cancer s/p nephrectomy [**2139**]; CAD s/p CABG,
bronchopulmonary aspirgillus s/p treatment with voriconazole,
who presents with fevers at home in the setting of neutropenia
with an outpatient sputem sample growing pansensitive
pseudomonas.

He was discharged [**10-1**] to home where he reports having done well
for several days. He was seen by ID on [**10-2**] at which time he
mentioned a cough and a sputem sample was sent. He has a cough
at baseline (x3 years) however this has become productive of
brownish sputem over the last few weeks. He has also noticed a
sore throat for the last few days. Over the last 2-3 days he has
also felt overall weakness. The day of admission he had a
temperature of 102.9 at home. He called his oncologist who
requested that he be evaluated in the ED.

He presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where his white blood
count was found to be 0.2. He received 2 g of cefepime prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. No acute process on OSH Hospital CXR.

Denies nausea/vomiting/dysuria/diarrhea. Denies chest
pain/headache. Denies worsening of his abdominal wound
infection.

In the ED, initial VS were 99.1 76 121/64 16 99%. Labs were
notable for leukopenia with WBC count 0.2 (34% PMNs). Blood
cultures were sent. He received Cefepime 2g IV at [**Hospital3 **],
Vancomycin 1g at [**Hospital1 18**], and Roxicet for a sore throat. His
pressures fell to 89/52. He was given a total of 3L of NS and
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further workup and management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.2 91 110/59 14. He
denied any specific complaints.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC TREATMENT HISTORY:
 -  Status post eight cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy from [**4-/2139**]
to 08/[**2139**].
 -  Status post left nephrectomy in [**12/2139**] with clear cell
carcinoma of the kidney with stage limited to kidney only with
no
lymph node involvement.
 -  Status post Zevalin treatment in 02/[**2140**].
 -  Status post autologous stem cell transplant in 05/[**2140**].
 -  Status post radiation to the right supraclavicular area
following his autologous transplant.
 -  Noted recurrence of his disease in [**12/2141**] with initiation
of treatment on the bendamustine study, status post five cycles
of therapy, which was then put on hold as of [**2142-3-27**] due to
development of hemolytic anemia.
 -  Status post Rituxan x 3 for noted paraspinal lesion then
received XRT to the area, completed [**2143-1-2**].
 -  CT scan in [**1-/2143**] showed wall thickening with 4-cm segment
of sigmoid colon; follow up colonoscopy with noted focal
prominent atypical B-cell infiltrate with immunoperoxidase
studies revealing CD20 + B cells with co-expression of CD5.
 -  Initiated treatment with R-CEP, first cycle given on
[**2-/2143**],
supported with Neulasta; the second cycle given on [**2143-3-13**]
with only day one of Cytoxan and day two of VP16 due to travel;
resumed cycle three of CEP on [**2143-4-10**]; cycle four of RCEP on
[**2143-5-8**] with follow up CT scan showing stable disease; cycle
five of RCEP on [**2143-6-5**].
 -  Maintenance Rituxan with one dose given on [**2143-7-3**],
[**2143-8-19**], and [**2143-9-18**], two doses then given in 01/[**2144**].
 -  Rituxan on hold as CT scan in [**3-/2144**] showed no evidence for
lymphoma, but notable gallbladder soft tissue nodule confirmed
on
ultrasound on [**2144-5-20**].  Cholecystectomy and liver biopsy on
[**2144-7-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**].  Biopsy revealed the gallbladder with
adenomyoma and mild chronic cholecystitis with no gallstones
present.  Liver core biopsy showed no definitive fibrosis with
features consistent with toxic/metabolic injury.
 -  Persistent anemia with some dysplastic features noted on his
differential which was followed over time and advised to
decrease/stop drinking, which he has successfully done since
[**42**]/[**2144**]. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2144-10-14**] showed a
normal cellular erythroid dominant marrow with maturing
trilineage hematopoiesis, although with numerous mononuclear
megakaryocytes and Pelger-Huet neutrophils.  His counts have
normalized with no further immature cells in his differential.
 -  [**2145-1-27**], surgical replacement of aortic valve and coronary
artery bypass surgery to correct coronary artery disease.
Cardiac catherization had shown 80% blockage of LAD with single
vessel coronary artery disease.
 -  Persistent abdominal cramping and change of bowel pattern.
CT scan in [**8-/2145**] showed no increased adenopathy but noted
large sigmoid polyp; biopsy from [**2145-9-8**] revealed non-Hodgkin
lymphoma with more aggressive phenotype with Mib fraction about
70%, initiated treatment with bendamustine and Rituxan on
[**2145-10-12**] and status post four cycles of therapy completed on
[**2146-1-4**].
 -  FDG tumor imaging on [**2145-12-6**] following three cycles of
therapy showed no evidence for FDG-avid lymphoma with no
adenopathy noted within the bowel in particular.
 -  Colonoscopy on [**2146-2-1**] showed no abnormalities noted on
the sigmoid biopsy.
 -  Status post three doses of Rituximab in [**2146-3-7**].
 -  Status post right hip replacement on [**2146-4-8**].
 -  Admitted to OSH for pneumonia treated with antibiotics with
resolution after a period of time.  CT scan done noted nodule in
right lung which was new from prior images. Repeat CT scan at
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-8-2**] showed the previously described left upper
lobe nodule has decreased in size and become less round with two
new lung nodules, measuring 13 mm in the right upper lobe, and
measuring 5 mm in the right lower lobe corresponding to areas on
CT from OSH.
 -  VATS with right upper lobe wedge resection for biopsy of
nodule on [**2146-9-9**] which revealed extranodal marginal zone
lymphoma(MALT).  Positive for CD20 and CD79a, but do not
co-express CD5, CD10 or CD43.  MIB-1 proliferative is 30%
overall.
 -  Persistent sinus symptoms with CT scan showing significant
sinus disease.  Received prolonged course of antibiotics with
plan for possible sinus surgery.  Received monthly IVIG to
improve immune functioning.
 -  PET scan on [**2147-1-31**] showed progression of his lymphoma in
the head and neck area including cervical nodes, left temporalis
muscle, and likely left parotid involvement as well as within
the
left rectus muscle and left mesenteric external iliac nodes.
Core biopsy of the rectus abdominal muscle on [**2147-2-13**] showed
involvement by his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma marginal zone.  MIB-1
staining showed a proliferation fraction to be approximately
40%.
-  Dose of Rituxan given on [**2147-2-22**], followed by 5 cycles of
Rituxan/Bendamustine from [**2147-3-1**] to [**2147-5-31**].
 -  CT scan of the chest from [**2147-9-29**] showed new diffuse
peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities predominantly in the
upper lobes, most suggestive of an infectious etiology.
Evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] and felt to have bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis and treated with Voriconazole with improvement in
ground glass opacities.  Completed 5 weeks of treatment on
[**2147-11-8**].  Continues on monthly IVIG at low dosing.
