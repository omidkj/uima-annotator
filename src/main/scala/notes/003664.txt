Brief Hospital Course:
The patient expired on [**2168-2-9**] after a long hospital
course managing the problems listed below. On the day of his
death, he underwent HD and returned without incident. Later that
day he was found pulseless in his room, after having been
reported to be fine only 10 minutes before by the nursing staff.
A code was run, and then called when he failed to respond.
Please see more details of his hospitalization below:

# R heel gangrene: R heel wound cultures grew out multiple
organisms including psuedomonas, MRSA, and VRE. Pt was seen by
vascular [**Doctor First Name **] and R BKA was performed (guillotine [**12-11**],
revision [**1-3**]). He was started on vanc and meropenem. Meropenem
was d/c'd after a 36 day course, and vanc will be continued
until [**2168-2-15**] to complete a 6 week course (levels were checked
daily after HD and pt was redosed for vanc levels <15). The pt
was initially kept on a heparin gtt and then changed to coumadin
for target INR of [**2-18**] for vascular grafts.

# Hypotension- multifactorial including low CO, MR due to MV
vegitation, failed [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Pt was supported with
levophed throughout his ICU stays. Finally was able to be weaned
from pressors and was transferred to the floor. Digoxin was
continued for inotropy- goal post HD 1-1.5 (redosed with
0.0625mg). He was continued on steroids since tapering these
agents seemed to cause him to relapse with his hypotension.
Midodrine was used initially, but the pt responded better to
florinef, and this was later able to be tapered to 0.05mg qd for
presumed adrenal insuff. His BP's improved and Captopril 3.125
tid was added.

# ID/Endocarditis- An echo performed on [**2168-1-18**] showed a new
vegetation on the mitral valve. However, the only blood culture
that was positive was that from the day of admission on [**2167-12-10**]
with MRSA. Interestingly no Cx positive since that time. He was
continued on Vanc with a plan to continue for 6wks total (would
have completed [**2168-2-14**]) with redosing for levels less than 20
after HD.
.
#Low grade temps and leukocytosis: Pt had an extensive workup
for other sources of infection since WBC remained elevated and
pt continued to have low grade fevers even while on IV vanc and
meropenem. No other sources of infection were found.
.
#ESRD- Due to pt's hypotension, he required CVVHD for the first
part of his stay, and then was changed to qd ultrafiltration
with HD qod once BP improved.
.
#Chronic LUE edema: Pt was noted to have chronic LUE edema.
Workup showed a (-) U/S on [**12-29**] and [**1-31**] repeat U/S was also
(-). Pt will keep his arm elevated to avoid worsening of the
edema.
.
# Abd pain: Pt continued to c/o epigastric discomfort that was
occasionally accompanied by SOB. This was relieved with mylanta.

.
#Anemia - most likely secondary to ESRD currently on EPO and
iron per renal with dialysis.
.
#[**Name (NI) 1568**] Pt was continued on SSI and NPH. Steroids exacerbating
sugars and supposedly eats food from OSH and non-compliant with
diet.
.
9. FEN- renal/cardiac diet. Hyperkalemia - adjusting with HD.
Nutrition consult for recs re: nutrition supplement other than
Boost - i.e. sth with less K.
