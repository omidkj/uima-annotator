Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Sudden onset of left sided weakness at 11.00 am today.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV tPA
PEG tube placement
Nasal packing for epistaxis


History of Present Illness:
73 year old RH female with past medical history significant for
atrial fibrillation (not on Coumadin), severe CHF, and
hypertension, who awoke this morning at 6AM asymptomatic.  At
10AM, she talked to her sister on the phone and was normal.
Patient states that around she slipped in the bathroom, looked
at her watch, which said 11AM, and activated life alert.  Her
son says that at 11:45AM, he heard the life alert voice go off
saying that they were on their way.  He went downstairs and
found that she had fallen out of bed (not the bathroom).  EMS
states that the life alert was actually activated at 12:50PM.
She was ten transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

At arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she had a dense left hemiparasis, left
hemisensory loss, in addition to a left neglect. A head CT was
done, which confirmed a right MCA stroke and she was given tPA
at 3PM.  Repeat examination 30 minutes later was relatively
unchanged.

In review of systems, she does not have fever, cough,
rhinorrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
dysuria, or rash.  She does not have diplopia or blurred vision
or dysphagia.

Past Medical History:
1. Pulmonary hypertension
2. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation
3. Atrial fibrillation--on Plavix. Had been on Coumadin, but
developed hemoptysis in the setting if supratherapeutic INR of
22
requiring intubation and bronchoscopy in [**4-2**].
4. TIA ([**2166-1-28**])
5. Hypertension
6. SLE with joint involvement, malar rash
7. Chronic Pain syndrome

HCT:
Large acute infarct of the right MCA territory. Hyperdense right
MCA indicates acute thrombus. No hemorrhage is seen.
.
EEG: Abnormal EEG due to the marked interhemispheric asymmetry
with the right hemispheric slowing in evidence both anteriorly
and posteriorly. No frank discharging features were seen.
.

Transesophageal echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast (smoke) is seen in the body of the left atrium. Severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage and presence of thrombus formation can not be excluded
due to severity of dense smoke. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is borderline depressed ( There is symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta and at least simple
atheroma in aortic arch (compex atheroma can not be excluded).
Sponteneous echo contrast is also seen in descending aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Presence of dense spontaneous echo contrast in left
atrium and left atrial appendage. Thrombus in formation in LAA
can not be excluded. Complex aortic atheroma and spontaneous
echo contrast in the descending thoracic aorta.

No evidence for DVT, right upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 73 year old woman with a PMH s/f atrial
fibrillation off of coumadin, diastolic CHF, and HTN who was
initially admitted on [**12-26**] with sudden onset of left sided
weakness.  A head CT confirmed the presence of a right MCA
stroke, and she was given tPA.  She was initially admitted to
the neuro-SICU for monitoring, and upon doing well she was
admitted to the neurology service.  Her residual deficits
included left hemiparesis, left facial droop, and dysarthria.  A
TEE confirmed the presence of a left atrial thrombus, and her
stroke was thought to be embolic secondary to afib off of
coumadin.  On [**1-3**] she was noted to be hypotensive to a SBP of 58
in the setting of a fever to 101.4, leukocytosis, EKG changes,
and CK's peaking to 2500.  She was transferred to the MICU for
pressure support with neosynephrine, fluids and intubation.  The
MICU team felt her shock picture was more consistent with septic
shock, and initially covered her with vancomycin, meropenam, and
flagyl.  Cardiology was consulted for her cardiac picture and it
was felt that this was like
