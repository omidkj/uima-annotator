Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
82 y/o male ESRD on HD, DM, HTN admitted after presenting with
shortness of breath to dialysis. He was unable to be dialyzed
and was sent to the ED.

While in the ED, he was noted to have elevated JVP, pulmonary
edema. In addition, he was noted to be 6.8kg above his dry
weight. Initial vital signs were T-97.1, HR-58, BP-110/58, SaO2-
100% on RA. He received 3 dosees of SL NTG, lasix 40mg IV x 1
and placed on a non-invasive breathing mask. His tidal volumes
were into the 150s and patient seemed to be in respiratory
distress. He was intubated and admitted to the MICU. Renal was
consulted for urgent dialysis. He underwent HD yesterday and
4.5L of fluid was removed. Patient was stablized and extubated.
He remained hemodynamically stable. Given his current condition,
he was transferred to the floor for further care.

TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction. Dilated aortic sinus.

CXR [**2159-12-6**]:
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Improve left retrocardiac opacity consistent with improving
atelectasis, there are new plate-like atelectasis in the right
mid lung; right lower lobe aeration has also improved.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, small bilateral
pleural effusions are stable, there is no pneumothorax. Mild
pulmonary edema is stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
82yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, DM2 admitted for shortness of
breath

1. Pulmonary Edema with acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure:
Patient admitted with SOB [**1-29**] pulmonary edema and volume
overload which improved with hemodialysis on his usual schedule.
Per discussion with renal, it is possible they were
underdialyzing him and he needs more agressive dialysis. He was
continued on his usual HD schedule here (T/Th/Sat) and was
extubated without difficulty and satting mid to high 90s on room
air at time of discharge. He had an ECHO which revealed "Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function and diastolic
dysfunction. Since he was mildly hypertensive, his [**Last Name (un) **] was
uptitrated. He was ruled out for MI. He should continue on low
salt cardiac diabetic renal diet to avoid issues with volume
overload in the future.

2. Respiratory Failure:
Improved as above with dialysis. He did not have any focal
infiltrates or fever to suggest leukocytosis. He was also given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed for wheezing as he is
on Advair but he is unsure why he is on this medication.

3. COPD/Asthma:
Patient continued to wheeze during his admission. Unclear
pulmonary history and PCP was on vacation so we were unable to
obtain further information regarding his pulmonary status. He
was continued on advair and albuterol/ipratropium nebs.

4. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued Simvastatin at home dose

5. Hypertension: Continued amlodipine, labetalol, valsartan.
Patient on olmesartan at home but substituted for valsartan in
house. Valsartan increased to 160mg daily.

6. ESRD on HD: He was continued on his hemodialysis on
Tu/Thurs/Sat schedule.

7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled and with
complications: Continue insulin + SS. Lantus dose decreased at
night for low blood sugar in am [**2159-12-7**]

8. Diarrhea: Pt was having loose stools on [**2159-12-7**]. C. diff
toxin was ordered but not sent. He should have C diff checked if
diarrhea recurs although he has not been on antibiotics here and
did not have a leukocytosis.
