History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24446**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] s 67 year old woman with iron deficiency anemia,
anorexia nervosa, and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis who
presented approximately 1 month of melanotic stool.  She
describes this as intermittent "diarrhea"; per her report, the
stool has been dark black, tarry, and loose.  She wasn't having
these stools with every bowel movement, but intermittently over
the past several weeks.  Over the past few days, she has felt
lightheaded, but without any vertiginous symptoms.  She hasn't
had chest pain, heartburn, vomitting, hematochezia.  She has had
her baseline epigastric pain.  She does not drink alcohol, and
she has not been using NSAIDs aside from a daily 81 mg aspirin.
.
This morning, she woke up and felt that she was having this
"diarrhea" again, as well as nausea.  As she was walking to the
bathroom, she felt extremely lightheaded, and her legs gave out
from underneath her.  She did not hit her head or lose
consciousness.  She did have a large melanotic stool at the time
which did also have visible red blood.  Her daughter called EMS
who brought her to [**Hospital6 3105**].  She was afebrile,
BP 82/45, HR 85, and O2 sat 100% on room air.  There, she was
found to have a hematocrit of 13.9% with normal platelets and
coagulation studies. She was given pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus
followed by a continuous infusion at 8 mg/hr; she was also given
octreotide 100 mcg/hr bolus followed by 50 mcg/hr.  She was
given 1500cc of crystalloid and received 2 units pRBCs.  A third
unit of pRBCs was hung prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.

   HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2186-3-27**]):
      NEGATIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

[**2186-3-24**] - 2 sets of blood cultures: negative.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2186-3-29**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2186-3-29**]):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2186-4-2**]):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE
SET ONLY.
         SENSITIVITY REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] #[**Numeric Identifier 24447**] [**2186-3-30**].
         COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions,
regardless of
         resistance.
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2484**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
patient's isolate.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
