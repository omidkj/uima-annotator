CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2158-10-23**] 11:29 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman s/p avr cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2158-10-23**]

COMPARISON: [**2158-10-22**].

INDICATION: Pleural effusions. Postop.

The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
replacement. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the
postoperative period. Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural
effusions are again demonstrated, with no substantial change
allowing for technical differences between the studies.
Additionally, a hazy area of opacity is present in the right
upper lobe just above the minor fissure, slightly more
conspicuous than on the prior study but not evident on the prior
preoperative study from [**2158-10-17**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
2. Subtle right upper lobe opacity. Attention to this area on
short-term followup CXR is recommended to exclude an early focus
of pneumonia.

Date/Time: [**2158-10-20**] at 09:13
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007AW-1:

Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 92 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 62 mm Hg

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid
anteroseptal -
hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal
inferior -
hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid
inferolateral -
hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo;
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex -
hypo; apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The TEE probe was
passed with
assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.
No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
LV systolic
fxn is globally midlly depressed.There are simple atheroma in
the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

 Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2158-10-20**]  12:46:20 PM


Normal sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads III and aVF consistent
with old inferior
myocardial infarction. Downward sloping ST segment depressions
and T wave
inversions in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 suggest possible
anterolateral ischemia.
Delayed R wave transition and possible lead reversal in leads
V2-V3. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2158-10-17**] the prominent Q waves in the
inferior leads
with slight ST segment elevations and downsloping ST segment
depressions in
the lateral precordial leads are new. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 73286**] was admitted through same day admission and was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 1 and aortic valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned
from sedation, awoke and was extubated. On post-op day one she
started on beta blockers and diuretics. She was gently diuresed
towards her pre-op weight. She was found to have right arm
clumsiness and neurology was consulted.  Head CT scan was done
that ruled out intracranial bleed and no ischemia noted.  She
continued to progress and right arm drift and clumsiness
decreased.  Physical therapy followed her during entire post-op
course for strength and mobility. She continued to make steady
process and was ready for discharge to rehab on post operative
day 4.
