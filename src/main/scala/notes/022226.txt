Date of Birth:   [**2107-10-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Fenard Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with
multiple medical problems with a recent admission complicated
by PEA arrest x2, Intensive Care Unit admission, respiratory
arrest, who presented on [**3-25**] after being intubated at
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital.  The patient reported increasing
shortness of breath starting on [**3-23**].  Initially, she
had received an increasing Lasix dose and was later found to
have pneumonia with a sputum culture which was showing both
gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods at the outside
hospital.

By [**3-24**], she was requiring increasing oxygen and
attempts at BiPAP were unsuccessful.  Therefore, she was
intubated secondary to respiratory failure and was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  On
arrival here, arterial blood gas showed 7.27/52/93.  She was
given azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl in the Emergency
Department.  She had a left subclavian line placed in the
Emergency Department, and then was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Lasix 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2. Lopressor 150 mg [**Hospital1 **].
3. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
4. NPH insulin 95 units q am, 30 units q pm.
5. Erythromycin eyedrops.
6. Nystatin swish and swallow.
7. Protonix 40 mg q day.
8. Amiodarone 400 mg q day.
9. Diltiazem 120 mg qid.
10. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
11. Zinc.
12. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
13. One day's worth of levofloxacin and Flagyl.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Temperature 102,
heart rate 86, blood pressure 88/palp.  She was intubated and
sedated, with response to painful stimuli.  Markedly obese.
Injected sclerae.  ETT in place.  Neck is supple.  Coarse
rhonchi bilaterally.  Heart rate irregularly, irregular, S1,
S2, with no murmurs appreciated.  Obese abdomen, soft,
nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities showed bilateral 2+ pitting edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Chem-7 shows a sodium of 135,
potassium 5.6, chloride 98, bicarb 21, BUN 41, creatinine
1.5, glucose 270.  Calcium 8.4, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus
5.4.  Complete blood count shows a white count of 16.7,
hematocrit of 29.5, platelets of 386.  Differential shows 78%
segs, 12 bands, 7 lymphocytes, and 1 monocyte.  Initial coags
show an INR of 1.6 and a PTT of 30.5.  CK of 69 with a
troponin of less than 0.3.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of
96 beats per minute with T-wave inversions in II, III, and F
which were new compared to prior study from [**2170-3-10**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Intensive
Care Unit and treated for respiratory failure secondary to
presumed aspiration pneumonia that required intubation.  Her
course thereafter was most notable for persistent and
progressive anasarca and pulmonary edema, which failed to
respond to aggressive treatment with diuretics and titration
of her cardiac medications.  Her course was then complicated
by persistent worsening of renal failure.

When she failed to significantly improve, she initially
underwent tracheostomy.  However, when she continued to show
no signs of improvement, appear to be in significant pain,
and had a slim chance for meaningful recovery in a way that
would be consistent with her previously expressed wishes for
her care, a series of family meetings were held.  Finally, on
[**2170-4-19**], the patient's family was in agreement that the
patient would not want to undergo prolonged suffering given
the slim chances for meaningful recovery.  At that time, the
decision was made to remove mechanical ventilatory support.

The patient expired the next day on [**2170-4-20**] at 2:10 pm.
The patient's family consented to autopsy.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia due to
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
2. Acute renal failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Diabetes mellitus.
5. Severe sacral decubitus ulcers in multiple locations.
6. Anasarca.
7. Hypoalbuminemia.
8. Hypotension.
