Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-5-12**] - CABGx2 (Left internal mammary->Left anterior descending
artery, Vein graft->Diagonal artery).
[**2149-5-8**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
73 y/o with a PMH of HTN, HLP, CHF with preserved EF (EF 80% on
C Cath on [**5-8**] @ [**Hospital1 1474**]),  paroxysmal A fib (not on coumadin)
who was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital 2 weeks ago with CHF and
AF.  At that time she had a nucler stress that showed apical
ischemia.  Cardiac Catheterization was recommended, but she
refused and was discharged to home on medical managment.  Then
she re-preseneted to [**Hospital1 1474**], continuing to complain of
shortness of breath.  On [**5-8**] she underwent elective cath
showing LAD 90% lesion and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI
(dye load=116cc).  Upon arival, prior to C Cath, pre-procedure
creat was noted to be 1.8 (basline 1.1-1.3) so she was given
mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate.  Cardiac Catheterization at
[**Hospital1 18**] showed 80-90% lesion in the mid LAD with unsuccessful PCI
attempt of the mid LAD despite multiple attempts.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2230**] was
called, and plan for surgical revascularization of the LAD with
a LIMA after plavix washout.

[**2149-5-12**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. MR remains mild to
moderate. The study is otherwise unchanged compared to
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2149-5-8**] via transfer from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for a cardiac catheterization and angioplasty.
This revealed an 80% stenosed left anterior descending artery
which was unamenable to angioplasty or stenting. The cardiac
surgery service was consulted and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. As she had a history of atrial
fibrillation and poor compliance with coumadin, it was decided a
concommittant MAZE procedure would also be performed. The
psychiatry service was consulted for assistance with her care as
she was at times unagreeable and argumentative. Through further
evaluation, she was found to be at her baselne however no
conclusion of her decision making ability was made. A 1:1 sitter
was maintained and social work was consulted. Plavix was allowed
to wash out over the next several days. On [**2149-5-12**]. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to two vessels and a MAZE procedure. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was transferred
to the intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day
one, she had awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She
developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with
amiodarone. She was transfused with packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. Coumadin, aspirin and beta blockade were
resumed. Chest tubes were removed.  She was transferred to the
floor by POD#3 and wires were removed and she did well.  She was
discharged to rehab on [**2149-5-17**].
