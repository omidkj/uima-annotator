Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Bronchoscopy
Central Venous Cannulation
Arterial Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
58 yo female who at [**Hospital3 **] facility was noted to have
changes in mental status, eye rolling, gait instability at home.
 Had also reported to outside providers that she was coughing
and low grade temps for several weeks -> started on augmentin
[**1-12**].  Call to PCP reported some pain from abdominal incision,
fatigue and depression.  Brought to ED on [**2130-2-9**] and was found
to have fever and hypoxia and respiratory distress.  She was
started on NIPPV.  She was eventually intubated upon transfer to
ICU for somnolence and no significant improvement in terms of
respiratory status.  Started on levo, vanco, cefepime.  [**Hospital **] facility reported [**1-4**] pills missing from trazadone
bottle.  Toxicology consult obtained but it turned out the
facility was mistaken and was referring to another patient, so
erroneous.  MICU course ([**Date range (1) 33280**]) was significant for mucus
plugging s/p bronchoscopy on [**2-10**] showing thin secretions,
sputum cx growing H flu, oliguria responsive to IVF, bradycardia
from Precedex, development of HTN while on steroids.  Was
extubated on [**2-16**].  HCT also showed frontal lobe hypodensities of
unclear chronicity, family declined MRI for now.  At this point,
leukocytosis, hypercapnia, mild transaminitis have all improved.
 She has some paranoid thoughts about her health care which are
new.  Denies any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.  Reports that
breathing is "at 100%" and reports no pain.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
EKG on Presentation [**2130-2-9**]:
NSR, NI, LAD, TWI in V1-V3, transition point V5. Similar to
prior dated [**2128-8-31**].

CXR [**2130-2-9**]:
Impression:
1. Pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Area of increased opacity lateral right upper lung could be
due to
overlying vascular and osseous structures, although underlying
consolidation may be present, due to infection or aspiration.

CT Head [**2130-2-9**]:
Impression:
1. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and subtle
hypodensities in the left frontal lobe, inferior putamen, and
subinsular region . The etiology is unclear. Would recommend MRI
for further evaluation.
2. Small air-fluid levels in the right maxillary sinus and
sphenoid sinuses may be related to intubation.

TTE [**2-13**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional wall motion abnormalities could not be
excluded due to suboptimal imaging. However, overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional wall motion
abnormalities could not be excluded due to suboptimal imaging.
However, overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
normal. No significant valvular regurgitation/stenosis.

CXR [**2-17**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-15**], the endotracheal
tube and
nasogastric tube have been removed. Continued hyperexpansion of
the lungs
with substantial decrease in opacification at the right base.
Pulmonary
vascularity is within normal limits, and there is no definite
pneumonia. Mild atelectatic changes at the bases.

CT Head [**2130-2-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Previously seen vague hypodensities in the left
insular region
are less apparent on today's examination. No acute hemorrhage
detected.

MRI Head/ MRA Head/ MRA Neck [**2130-2-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings involving the parieto-occipital subcortical white
matter,
bilaterally, without significant mass effect or associated
diffusion
abnormality or hemorrhage. These findings are most suggestive of
so-called
PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) and should
be closely
correlated with history o
