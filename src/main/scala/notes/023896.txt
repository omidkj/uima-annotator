Chief Complaint:
dysarthria and ataxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 82 year-old R-handed F who presents with acute
onset
dysarthria and ataxia. She reports that she felt fine when she
went to bed around midnight last night. She awoke around 3am
with
a "noise" in her head, which she describes as similar to
tinnitus
she has had in the past but much worse. She thinks it was this
noise that woke her from sleep. She got up to go to the bathroom
and noticed that she felt dizzy and was having trouble walking.
She thinks she was falling to both sides and had to hold on to
the walls to be able to walk. She went back to sleep but got up
a
few more times throughout the night and continued to feel
unsteady on her feet. She got up at 8:00 this morning and again
found it difficult to walk so she called her son. At that point
she and her son both noticed that her speech was slurred and she
decided to go to the hospital. On evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she
was noted to have dysarthria and ataxia on exam. Labs were wnl,
and a CT head showed extensive deep white matter hypodensity
extending to the subcortical regions most likely representing
chronic small vessel ischemia, but no acute infarction. CTA
showed occlusion of the basilar artery and she was transferred
to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Currently she continues to experience dysarthria and gait
instability. Does not think these symptoms have changed since
their onset. She denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision,
diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, or hearing
difficulty. Her tinnitus has currently resolved. Denies
difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal
weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.
