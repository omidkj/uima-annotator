Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 41411**] was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the
Emergency Room and admitted to the hospital with acute
cholecystitis.  She was admitted to the ICU, made NPO, hydrated
with IV fluids and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics. Her WBC
was 20K and blood cultures were done in the ER. Her admission
chest xray showed a small right pleural effusion and a
retrocardiac opacity that could represent atelectasis or
pneumonia.  She had no cough or other pulmonary symptoms.

On [**2112-1-11**] she had a percutaneous cholecystotomy tube placed for
drainage. A large amount of purulent , foul smelling fluid was
aspirated and the drain was placed to gravity.  Her admission
blood cultures were positive for E Coli ([**1-27**]) and she was
treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Her symptoms improved and
her WBC gradually decreased.  Her cholecystotomy tube drained
500cc the first day.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
good progress.  She remained afebrile and was taking a regular
diet without difficulty.  Her Foley catheter was removed [**2112-1-13**]
around 11am and she is due to void by 9pm.  She will continue
oral antibiotics for 10 more days The cholecystotomy tube
drained 250cc in the last 24 hours.
