Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2006**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, intermittent hypoxia.
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Shortness of breath, PE, tracheostomy,
likely bronchoscopy.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible Bronchoscopy
Tracheostomy tube changeout


History of Present Illness:
62yoF with complicated medical history including DVT, CAD s/p
stent, spinal surgery complicated by [**First Name3 (LF) 39850**], tracheostomy
presenting for shortness of breath and transient hypoxia.
.
The patient has reportedly been undergoing chest PT by her
family at home for chronic secretions in the setting of her
tracheostomy.  She reports having increased secretions recently
but denies cough, fevers at home prior to presentation, recent
chest pain or shortness of breath prior to her current acute
symptoms.  The day of presentation, the patient reported
shortness of breath at rest and on exertion.  She was noted to
be hypoxic by her VNA, and was brought to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
Of note, the patient has a history of an upper extremity DVT and
was on Coumadin up until a few days ago (last [**Doctor First Name **]).  She was
also recently treated with Bactrim for a UTI.
.
In the ED, intial VS:  88 99/59 16 88% 3L
Her hypoxia on initial presentation subsequently recovered and
she was consistently in the low 90's on 3L NC through her
tracheostomy throughout the remainder of her ED course.  She
underwent CTA chest given her symptoms, hypoxia, and history of
DVT, which showed a R sided PE with LLL collapse.  She was
started on a Heparin gtt.  CTA chest also showed LLL collapse
with debris slightly worse than previously seen.  The patient
was started on Vanc 1gm x1/Cefepime to cover for HAP/HCAP.  Her
UA was positive in the setting of multiple UTI's in the past,
and she was started on Ceftriaxone 1gm.  Tmax in the ED was
101.8 per report but documented as 100.2 in the ED records.  Her
K was 5.7 without acute EKG changes and she was given Kayexalate
30mg po x1.  She was noted to have diarrhea x2 through the
course of her ED stay.  She was also noted to be hyponatremic
and received 1L NS.  She was given Morphine 4mg IV x1 for
chronic shoulder pain.
.
On transfer, VS were:  81, 18, 116/62, 97% on 3L
On arrival to the ICU, the patient reported continued dyspnea
but PO2 was stable on 3L NC through tracheostomy.  The patient

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 105209**] is a 62 year-old woman with [**Known lastname 39850**]
(complication of past surgery), DVT, CAD s/p stent, and
tracheostomy who presented [**2167-10-7**] with shortness of breath
and transient hypoxia.  She was found to have right main
pulmonary embolism and left lower lobe collapse.

#. Pulmonary Embolism:  The patient developed acutely worsening
SOB and presented to the ED here.  On arrival a CTA was done
which revealed a pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary
artery. The patient had been taking coumadin until 6 days PTA
for an UE DVT.  She had a subtherapeutic INR on admission.
Heparin drip was started but she was then switched to enoxaparin
as a bridge to coumadin therapy, which was started at 5 mg dose
on [**2167-10-8**]. [Of note: enoxaparin has a black box warning from
the FDA for patients who have received procedures of the spinal
column.  This patient's spinal surgery is remote and no other
procedures are planned at this time.  The enoxaparin is only a
bridge to coumadin and should be discontinued upon therapeutic
INR].  In house the patient's INRs increased appropriatly and IS
1.9 on day of discharge with goal of [**3-12**]. The patient will
follow with the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 2786**] clinic.  She is being
discharged on 5mg of warfarin daily.
.
#. LLL Collapse: In addition to the PE described above, initial
imaging also revealed left lower lung lobe collapse with debris.
 LLL collapse was believed to be [**3-11**] mucus plugging given
significant yellowish-white sputum suctioned on initial deep
tracheostomy suction in the ED.  Patient was given one dose of
vanc/cefepime in the ED for suspected PNA, but this treatment
was discontinued on the floor.  Therapeutic bronchoscopy was
performed on the floor confirming mucus plugging and the LLL was
transiently re-expanded however it collapsed again.  Also tried
positive pressure ventilation which too transiently expanded the
lung.  The patient was continued with intermittent
deep-suctioning and cough-assist throughout her hospital stay.
At time of discharge, the LLL is still collapsed although the
patient is reporting less secretions a
