History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 23976**] is an 87 year-old Jamaican male with history of
mucinous breast cancer (s/p MRM in [**2172**] and tamoxifen therapy),
hypertension, CHF and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from an OSH for further
evaluation of hemoptysis. The patient had a recent admission to
the same OSH from [**Date range (1) 23977**] for increasing dyspnea and was
treated for a CHF and COPD exacerbation, as well as a RLL PNA.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition on a
course of Levaquin. On the following day, the patient
re-presented with increasing dyspnea and several episodes of
gross hemoptysis beginning on the day of discharge. He reported
coughing up about 100-200cc of maroon blood. On presentation the
patient complained of increased SOB and mild generalized
fatigue. He denied frank fever, chills, HA, dizziness, LOC, or
chest pain at that time. Admission imaging showed a CXR with a
dense infiltrate in the LLL. CT scan reported bilateral patchy
infiltrates with small bilateral blebs. Hemoptysis was thought
to be secondary to pneumonia (possibly staph) and patient was
treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient was
admitted to the ICU for further monitoring, where he continued
to have persistent spoonfuls of gross hemoptysis. The patient
subsequently had a bronchoscopy to identify a source of
bleeding. Bronchoscopy showed a small amout of blood diffusely
but no clear sourc of bleedinge. No frank endobronchial lesions
in segmental and subsegmental divisions were identified. The
patient tolerated procedure well, but continued to have
significant hemoptysis. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of hemoptysis and for possible invasive endoscopic
therapy.
.
Upon admission the patient continued to c/o hemoptysis and SOB
with minimal exertion (even walking to bathroom is difficult).
Otherwise he feels well, denies F/C, weight loss,
dizziness/light-headedness, CP/palp, abd pain, n/v/d, weakness/
numbness. He c/o recent fatigue over past few months, but notes
that he was walking 3-4miles/day before these events occurred.

Imaging:
[**10-6**] CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION:
1.  Nonoccluding pulmonary thrombosis, left descending pulmonary
artery, may be due to vascular stasis from hilar infiltration
rather than emboli; see 3. below.
2.  Two lung masses at the lung bases are highly concerning for
malignancy, especially metastases given the patient's history of
breast cancer.
3.  Diffuse bronchial wall thickening.  More severe occlusive
narrowing and obliteration of the encased bronchial and arterial
supply to the lingula and left lower lobe could be due to
malignant infiltration of the hilus or inflammation such as
fibrosing mediastinitis.
4. Bilateral lower lung lobe airspace consolidation could
represent aspiration given its distribution, or postobstructive
pneumonia. Bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions,
probably secondary.
5.  Apical predominant emphysema. Fluid filled left perifissural
bulla could be superinfected, not hemorrhagic.
6.  Tiny round foci in the left kidney are too small to
characterize but may represent small cysts.
.
[**10-6**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen
in the body of the left atrium. No mass or thrombus is seen in
the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac mass/thrombus seen.
.
[**10-7**] B/l LE Doppler US: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in either leg.
.
[**10-11**] CT chest w/ contrast: IMPRESSION:
1.  Worsening lower lobe consolidation with mass-like and
lobular components, accompanied by extensive bronchovascular
bundle thickening, bronchial narrowing and arterial narrowing,
left greater than right.  Given the immune- suppressed status of
the patient following chemotherapy, atypical organism should be
considered including fungal organisms (Aspergillus and
mucormycosis), although the appearance is not specific for a
particular organism.
2.  Slight reduction in size and decrease in the fluid level
within large bullae or pneumatocele within left lower lobe,
likely due to hemorrhage or infection.  New pneumatocele in
right lower lobe with fluid/hemorrhage and debris.
3.  Left lower lobe pulmonary artery thrombus no longer
visualized, but marked narrowing of lower lobe arteries is
present, and may be due to adjacent compression by perihilar
soft tissue that
