Admission Date:  [**2190-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-12-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2114-3-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  PLASTIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female, admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
composite definite resection of a large expanding verrucous
carcinoma in the right floor of the mouth, adjacent to the
body of the right mandible.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Hypothyroidism

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left breast biopsy
2.  Cholecystectomy
3.  Left eye enucleation

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levoxyl
2.  Aspirin
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene

ALLERGIES:  Percodan, Demerol, morphine, adhesive tape

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2190-11-4**], and taken to the
operating room, where she had (1) tracheostomy; (2) composite
resection of floor of mouth and alveolar ridge for right side
of mandible in continuity with a modified right radical neck
dissection; (3) left radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap to
floor of the mouth and left cheek (microvascular); (4) full
thickness skin graft to left volar forearm, 8 x 6 cm.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by neck
hematoma and thrombosis of the venous outflow from the left
radial free flap, requiring multiple returns to the operating
room.  The patient remained intubated with a #6  Shiley
tracheostomy due to copious secretions and drainage following
surgery, as well as edema of perioral tissues, including
tongue.  Tube feeds were initiated by nasogastric tube on
[**11-5**].  The patient was taken to the operating room on [**11-15**]
for placement of a gastrostomy tube for continued feeding,
with debridement of her radial free flap also being
performed.  Sputum was sent for culture [**11-11**].  Treatment was
initiated with vancomycin.  A swab taken from deep neck
hematoma [**11-15**] also grew methicillin resistant staphylococcus
aureus, alpha strep and enterococcus.

Over the next two weeks, the patient remained in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, and efforts were made to wean her off
her ventilator.  A cuffed tracheostomy tube remained in
place, with frequent suctioning performed for secretions.

By [**11-20**], the patient was able to spend periods of time out
of bed in a chair.  She had developed a sacral decubitus
ulcer that was managed.  Her radial free flap was monitored
and required multiple debridements for nonviable tissue, with
resulting eventual exposure of the mandible.  A bronchoscopy
performed with suctioning of considerable volume of
secretions was prematurely terminated for bradycardia.
Sputum culture from lavage grew methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter.

On [**11-29**], a trial of a Passy Muir valve was initiated by
Speech Therapy for verbal communication by the patient.  By
[**2190-12-3**], the patient had a large defect of her left neck and
chin with approximately 7 cm of mandible exposed.  The
patient's lip incision was also noted to be somewhat necrotic
in the right, and was dehisced.  The patient was taken to the
operating room for right pectoralis muscle flap to right
neck, split thickness skin graft to right neck (18 x 12 cm),
and debridement and closure of full thickness lower lip
wound.  The patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter,
although her lip incision dehisced on [**12-14**].

The patient remained in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
until [**12-16**], by which time the patient was better able to
manage her secretions and her pectoral flap appeared stable.
The patient received a brief course of Diflucan for yeast in
her urine.  The patient underwent a swallow evaluation on
[**12-17**], with recommendations and teaching given over about
three sessions.  The patient was made nothing by mouth on
[**12-17**] for some spillage through the defect in her lower lip
with contamination of her chest wound.  The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**12-22**] for repair of the defect and
irrigation and debridement of her chest wound.

The patient's tracheostomy was down-sized to a #4 Shiley
cuffless on [**12-24**].  Her tracheostomy was capped successfully
on [**2190-12-26**], with the patient tolerating the procedure well.
By the time of discharge, the patient was just being
restarted on sips of clears and ice chips for comfort by
mouth, with aspiration precautions.  She will need to undergo
further speech and swallow evaluation following discharge.
Her respiratory function will need to be monitored, with
suctioning provided as needed.  The patient will also need
continued physical therapy.
