Brief Hospital Course:
1) DKA:
Pt was started on insulin gtt and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The
underlying etiology was her UTI and sepsis.  With treatment of
this and insulin gtt, her gap slowly closed.  She was
transitioned to SC insulin once the gap was closed.  After this,
her BG remained occassionally high over 200, so her lantus dose
was increased to 10U daily.  With this, BG was improved, though
further titration may be required as outpt for optimal control.
.
2) SEPSIS secondary to UTI:
Pt has a very large leukocytosis on admission which resolved
over the course of her stay.  Both the urine and blood cultures
grew pansensitive E.coli.  The patient was maintained on IV
ceftriaxone for about 6days.  Her blood cultures cleared right
away and repeat urine was also clear.  Given rapid resolution,
she was switched to PO cipro to complete a total 14d course of
abx.
.
3) CARDIOVASCULAR:
Though her diuretic was initially held, this was restarted on
discharge.  Her other outpt regimen was continued with exception
of valsartan which was held as her BP was well controlled.  This
may need to be restarted once she is recovered from her acute
illness.
.
4) ANEMIA:
Pt's Hct was in mid-high 20s, which is lower than her previous
values in OMR.  However, her Hct was stable.  There was no sign
of bleeding.  Iron studies were consistent with iron defeciency
and anemia of chronic disease.  She was continued on iron
supplementation.
