Allergies:
Shellfish / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent Pericarditis, Pleural Effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
59 year old Male w/PMHx of HCV, IVDU, asthma, recurrent viral
pericarditis, who presents w/chest pain simliar to prior
episodes of pericarditis pain. Pt reported pain of 5 days
duration, worse when lying flat and experiencing some SOB. Pt
reported current IVDU, shooting suboxone w/last use yesterday.
Presnted to the ED stating "i think I have pericarditis" b/c
symptoms were simliar to prior. Found to have fever at triage.

In the ED, initial vs were: Temp:101.2 HR:115 BP:88/50 to 100/65
Resp:20 O(2)Sat:97 Normal. Patient was given 2L NS bolus which
initially only improved HR and urine output. CE were neg x1. No
other complaints, only CP while lying flat. CXR enlarged
silouette. Given previous hx of IVDU w/osteo and pervious
pericardidtis and concern for endocarditis, pt given
nafcillin/gent/vanc for "possible endocarditis". Blood cultures
were also sent for endocarditis. Lactate 1.8. EKG showed 1/2mm
st elevations diffusely and PR depression, new compared to
prior.Echo showed small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion without overt evidence of pericardial tamponade; EF of
>55%. CXR showed no acute pulmonary process but small bilateral
pleural effusions and interval enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. Pt was admitted to ICU for further managment and
workup of possible pericaditis, r/o endocarditis.

On the floor, pt's VS were 99.8 120/79 92 19 and 97% sat 2L. Pt
was irritable from spending a long time in ED. He also reported
chest pain when he breathed deeply or got up. Stated this was
identical to previous episode of pericarditis, no different.
Also noted constipation but no other complaints other than
feeling fed up and exhausted.

Past Medical History:
H/o HBV infection
Relapsing IVDU of heroin
Intermittent cocaine use
Asthma
Chronic hepatitic C (genotype 1)
Chronic hyperbilirubinemia  compatible with Gilberts syndrome
s/p viral perdicarditis [**10-17**]
Papillary renal CA, s/p R radical nephrectomy/R adrenalectomy
[**1-14**]
Serratia Bacteremia on [**2122-1-30**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]

Social History:
Recent IV heroin and cocaine abuse .
Inhaled cocaine as well. Denies EtOH and tobacco. Previously
homeless, was in section 8 housing unclear if still. He was
convicted
and imprissioned for 10 years and declared innocent afterwards.
His father died ~[**2122**] which resulted in pt returning to drug
use.

Family History:
Patient is unaware of his family history

   LYME SEROLOGY (Final [**2124-7-11**]):
      EIA RESULT NOT CONFIRMED BY WESTERN BLOT.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2124-7-5**] at 6:35:38 PM      FINAL

IMPRESSION: Small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion without overt evidence of pericardial tamponade. On
image #15, the right ventricle has slight compression during
early diastole suggesting elevated pericardial pressures.


TTE (Complete) Done [**2124-7-6**] at 11:09:22 AM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is an abnormal systolic flow contour
at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
to moderate siz
