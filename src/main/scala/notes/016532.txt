Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
severe three vessel native disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing.
The LAD
had a proximal 30% stenosis. The mid LAD was diffusely diseased
with a
50% stenosis. There was a major D1 with a 60-70% proximal
stenosis.
There was diffuse disease in the distal LAD. The RCX had an
ostial 80%
stenosis in branching and long OM1 (vs. recanalized total
occlusion)
with total occlusion of the AV groove LCX beyond OM1. The RCA
had a
total occlusion in the mid segment after AM1.
  2. Selective vein graft angiography showed a patent SVG-PDA
graft with
ostial 80% stenosis with pressure damping and poor reflux of
contrast
dye.The RPL and the mid RCA filled retrogradely with collaterals
to OM.
  3. Limited resting hemodynamics showed moderate pulmonary
hypertension
(PA mean 37 mmHg). The right sided  filling pressures were
moderately
elevated (RVEDP 20 mmHg). The left sided filling pressures were
severely elevated, PCW mean 28 mmHg). The cardiac output and
index were
normal (CO 4.5 l/min, CI 2.1 l/min/m2).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe ostial stenosis in SVG-PDA.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was aggressively diuresed in house using lasix and
natrecor so that he would be able to tolerate cath. Integrilin
and heparin were stopped when patient began having melena. NG
lavage was not performed secondary to fragile respiratory
status. GI was consulted and the decision to do EGD if patient
became unstable was made. Patient was placed in PPI and HCT was
kept above 30. Heparin was restarted once INR fell to below 2.5;
Hct was stable. Patient then had cath (see result above)
although procedure was stopped b/c patient complained of back
pain (most likely muscle spasm). Patient was then taken to cath
lab a day later for stent placement of SVG-PDA. Patient
continued to have decreases in hematocrit and melena. EGD showed
ulcers in stomach body, erythema in stomach compatible with
gastritis, erythema in duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis,
polyp in the duodenal bulb, mass in cardia entering distal
esophagus (biopsy, thermal therapy, injection). While waiting
for biopsy results, patient was anticoagulated (AVR) on heparin
and bridged to coumadin. Once patient was therapeutic and Hct
was stable he was dc'ed with close PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and cardiology
follow up. He was not discharged home on Lasix as the patient
had some low bp while in house, but he should follow up with
cardiologist within one week in order to reevaluate use of
lasix.
