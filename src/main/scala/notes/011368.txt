ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CONGESTIVE HEART
FAILURE/VALVULAR DISEASE:  Patient status post aortic valve
repair and aortic root repair.  Patient oxygenating well at
time of discharge with no evidence of overt CHF.  Patient
actually hypovolemic to euvolemic by exam, and has been
getting gentle hydration x two days with improved urine
output.  Diuretics are being held, and patient is continued
on his ACE inhibitor at the time of discharge.

2) CHRONIC VENT DEPENDENCE:  Patient with chronic illness,
myopathy and neuropathy with malnutrition and severe weakness
contributing to chronic vent dependence.  Patient stable on
current vent settings which include pressure support
ventilation during the day with pressure support of 18, PEEP
5, FIO2 40%.  Patient has been comfortable, resting on assist
control during the evening with tidal volume of 400 by
respiratory rate of 10 with PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 40%.
Patient should be continued on these settings including AC in
the evening until he has significant improvement in his
nutritional status and improvement in his level of strength.
Aggressive attempts to wean him by switching him to pressure
support in the evening should not be attempted, at least in
the short-term.

3) PSEUDOMONAL PNEUMONIA/CHRONIC SPUTUM COLONIZATION:
Patient with a history of pseudomonal pneumonia and
pseudomonal UTI earlier in this admission.  Patient with
persistent sputum cultures positive for Pseudomonas and has
been placed on pseudomonal precautions.  However, he shows no
evidence of an acute infection, has been afebrile with stable
oxygenation and minimal sputum production.  Chest x-ray is
notable for a persistent left lower lobe density which we
have interpreted as a chronic resolving infiltrate versus
atelectasis.

4) HYPERCALCEMIA:  During the last two to three weeks of the
patient's prolonged hospitalization, the patient developed
refractory, severe hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
Work-up of his hypercalcemia revealed a low-normal PTH level
with low Vitamin D levels.  PTH-RP was also negative.  The
etiology of his hypercalcemia was thought more likely to
represent chronic immobility with bone leeching of calcium
versus a primary bony process such as Paget's disease.  On
bone scan, patient was noted to have increased uptake in the
area of a soft tissue/bony mass adjacent to the left
glenohumeral joint, but not invading the joint space itself.
This lesion had been noted on a prior MRI in [**Month (only) 956**], but
has increased in size since that time.  Bone scan also
revealed symmetric uptake in the knees and ankles bilaterally
which was not thought to be significant.

On [**2159-3-27**], patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left
bony mass with pathology pending at the time of discharge.
For treatment of the patient's hypercalcemia, he initially
was treated with aggressive IV fluids and diuretics.  He
received a dose of calcitonin.  He ultimately responded to a
dose of 30 mg IV of pamidronate wit a calcium level that
began to trend down.  However, on [**2159-3-25**], the calcium level
stabilized and began to trend back upward in excess of 12.5.
On [**2159-3-25**], the patient was redosed with pamidronate 50 mg
IV x one.  Vitamin D levels were aggressively repleted
parenterally, and the patient was discharged on a stable dose
of calcitriol Vitamin D.   A repeat Vitamin D level is
pending at the time of discharge, and I will follow-up on
this and communicate results to rehab.  Osteocalcin level as
a part of a work-up for Paget's disease is also pending at
the time of discharge.  Bone biopsy results will also be
passed on to rehab.  The patient will be required to have
daily calcium level checks to verify that he is neither
hypercalcemic requiring further dosing of pamidronate versus
hypocalcemic secondary to pamidronate.

5) PANCREATITIS:  Patient with pancreatitis of unclear
etiology earlier in his hospitalization.  His amylase and
lipase have trended down, and he has been tolerating tube
feeds with a benign abdominal exam indicating that it is not
currently an active issue.

6) HYPERNATREMIA:  Patient has been continued on free water
boluses to supplement his tube feeding to maintain a sodium
level of approximately 140.  Sodium level should be checked
at least several times per week for the next several weeks.

7) VOLUME STATUS:  As noted, the patient appears to be
clinically hypovolemic to euvolemic with no evidence of overt
volume overload or congestive heart failure.  Urine output
was approximately 40 cc/h at the time of discharge.

8) ANEMIA:  Patient has had a stable hematocrit of
approximately 28-30 for the majority of his hospitalization.
Iron level was normal, but TIBC was low, and ferritin level
was very elevated consistent with an anemia of chronic
disease.  His iron stores appear to be good.  He was started
on Epogen [**Hospital1 **]-weekly and had received one dose prior to
discharge.

9) NUTRITION:  Patient with poor nutritional status secondary
to chronic hospitalization and immobility.  He is unable to
tolerate PO secondary to recurrent aspiration, and has a
cuffed trach in place.  He is to continue current tube feeds
which are at goal of 85 cc/h until his nutritional level
improves.

10) SEIZURE DISORDER:  Patient was continued on Keppra with
no evidence of seizure activity.

11) DEPRESSION:  Patient was continued on Zoloft with stable
mental status.  The patient has been tearful and depressed at
times, including plans to move him to rehab.

12) IV ACCESS:  Patient with a left PICC line which was
placed on [**3-4**], and shows no evidence of any surrounding
erythema or drainage.

13) PROPHYLAXIS:  Patient was maintained on subcu heparin and
a proton pump inhibitor for prophylactic medications.

Chronic ventilatory dependence.  3) Pseudomonal
pneumonia/sputum colonization.  4) Hypercalcemia of unclear
etiology.  5) Pancreatitis of unclear etiology.  6) Left

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1) Patient should have a daily to
qod Chem-7 and calcium level for the next 2 weeks.  Should
his calcium level rise, he needs to be redosed with
pamidronate ideally 30-60 mg IV.  Calcium level at the time
of discharge was 10.7, uncorrected for low albumin.
Alternatively, if the patient's calcium level becomes very
low secondary to pamidronate, which it may given his low
Vitamin D stores, he will need to be repleted.  A Vitamin D
level is pending following parenteral repletion at the time
of discharge, and this result will be communicated to rehab
by the [**Hospital3 **] house staff.  Results of his bone mass
biopsy will also be communicated.  2) Patient will need to
continue on tube feeds which currently consist of Criticare
full strength at 85 cc/h.  3) Regarding his ventilatory
dependence, the patient should not be aggressively weaned,
but should be rested on AC during the evening as noted in the
discharge summary.  The patient's primary care physician is
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21704**] located at [**Hospital6 2018**] in [**Location (un) 86**].
