Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p MVC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year-old female who was driving her car when she
believes she lost consciousness and then hit a tree. She was
transferred from [**Hospital3 15402**] for internal injuries.

She denied any memory of the incident, remembering only the
broken windshield. Prior to the incdent she had gone to a long
spinning class at the gym and then to the beach. She denied any
presyncopal symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, chest
pain, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness.

She has a history of a prior MVC in [**2129-11-7**], with head
trauma and residual memory problems. She denied any history of
seizure or loss of consciousness.

Past Medical History:
history of head trauma in [**2129**] with residual memory problems

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
On discharge:
T97.6 P80 BP102/68 R18 95%RA
Gen: Awake and alert, somewhat flat affect.
Neck: Soft collar in place. No midline tenderness
Chest: Clear bilaterally. Chest tube site clean, dry and intact
with no erythema, pus or swelling.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm.
Abd: NABS. Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Ext: Left toes taped together with hard sole boot in place. Good
toe perfusion. 3/5 strength shoulder abduction, rest of motor
exam unremarkable.

Pertinent Results:
Abd CT (intial):
1. Left pneumothorax.
2. Right 10th and 11th rib fractures.
3. Large hepatic laceration, which abuts the mid hepatic vein.
No evidence of active extravasation.
4. Small splenic laceration. No evidence of active
extravasation.
5. Complex right renal laceration. Rupture of an anterior medial
upper calyx. Perirenal space hematoma with no evidence of
arterial extravasation.
6. Questionable small pancreatic tail laceration.
7. Hemoperitoneum.

Abd CT (repeat):
1. No evidence of a renal abscess.
2. Hepatic and right renal lacerations.
3. Decreased size of right perirenal hematoma.
4. Unchanged appearance of hemoperitoneum.
5. Right tenth and eleventh rib fractures.
6. New bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Persistent left pneumothorax, partially visualized.

HIDA:
1) Normal scintigraphic appearance of the gallbladder without
evidence of
cholecystitis. Normal biliary to bowel transit of tracer.
2) Focal tracer activity that persists on the delayed images
which in this
patient with known hepatic laceration is likely due to a small
contained biliary
leak.

Spine XR:
No evidence for fracture or dislocation in the cervical,
thoracic, or lumbar spine. Degenerative disc disease at C5-C6.

Carotid US:
No plaque was found on either side. The velocities and waveforms
in the bilateral internal, common, and external carotid arteries
and bilateral vertebral arteries were normal, with antegrade
flow.

TTE:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

EEG:
This is an abnormal routine EEG obtained in wakefulness
progressing to stage II sleep. Due to the presence of
intermittent,
independent and synchronous [**Hospital1 **]-temporal slowing in the delta and
theta
frequency range, left-sided predominence. These findings suggest

subcortical dysfunction in both temporal regions and is
regarding
epilepsy is a relatively non-specific finding. No epileptiform
abnormalities were seem.


Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was hemodynamically stable, and
her initial evaluation revealed the following injuries: right
kidney laceration, liver laceration, splenic laceration, right
toe fractures, left pneumothorax with broken ribs. A chest tube
was placed and she was admitted to the Trauma ICU. She was
followed by Urology for the non-operative kidney laceration and
transferred to the floor after observation and serial
hematocrits; she did not need surgery for her organ injuries.

She had a work-up including a TTE, carotid ultrasound, EEG, and
MRI of her head to rule out cardiac or neurologic causes of her
apparent loss of consciousness before the MVC. Please see the
Neurology note for details. Ultimately it was felt that she had
a vasovagal incident in the setting of dehydration after
exercising and a long day at the beach, but she was instructed
to follow-up with a Neurologist given her history of prior head
trauma.

She was also seen by the Orthopedic/Spine service given the
tingling and weakness of her left shoulder and chronic-appearing
cervical spine canal narrowing seen on MRI. Based on their
recommendations she was instructed to wear a neck collar for
comfort only and to follow-up at their office.

A thyroid mass was incidentally noted on her c-spine MRI and an
ultrasound revealed a large nodule with necrotic areas. She was
instructed to see her primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] possible
outpatient biopsy.

She was seen by physical and occupational therapists and was
given a hard-sole boot to wear on her left foot, on which the
toes were buddy-taped together.

She had a fever while hospitalized and was started on Zosyn out
of concern for a hospital-acquired pneumonia on the left, where
she had had the pneumothorax. A HIDA scan, abdominal CT scan,
blood cultures, UA and examination of the chest-tube site did
not suggest any other sources of infection such as a renal
abscess.

after discharge, prior to Urology appointment.

Discharge Instructions:
You should call a physician or come to ER if you have worsening
pains, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath,
chest pain, or if you have any questions or concerns.

It is important you complete the full course of antibiotics and
take other medications as directed. You may continue to take
your pre-admission medicaitons. You should not drive or operate
heavy machinery while on any narcotic pain medication such as
percocet as it can be sedating. You may take colace to soften
the stool as needed for constipation, which can be cause by
narcotic pain medication.

You should continue to wear the hard boot and keep your toes
taped together.  You can wear the soft neck collar for comfort.

Followup Instructions:
Call for a follow-up appointment at the Trauma Surgery Clinic
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2359**]) in 1 week.

Call for an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] (Spine Orthopedics,
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3573**]) in 2 weeks. You do not need to wear the neck
collar.

Call for an appointment with Urology in [**2-10**] weeks
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 164**]). You will need a follow-up CT scan of your
abdomen at that time.

Call your neurologist or the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 878**] Clinic
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**]) for follow-up with Drs. [**First Na
