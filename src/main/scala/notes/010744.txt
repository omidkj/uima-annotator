Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-2-10**] Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, vein
grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal and posterior descending
arteries.
[**2141-2-10**] Re-exploration for bleeding


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5762**] is a very pleasant woman with a history of HTN and DM
who reported a "pulling" sensation in her neck with an
occasional "blocked-up" feeling in her ears to her PCP one year
ago, which she states occurs while walking or doing house work.
She was sent for carotid ultrasound which was reportedly
negative and then to an ENT specialist who started her on
Protonix for reflux but the symptoms did not go away. In
[**2140-12-8**], she was found to have non-diagnostic EKG changes
during a routine physical and was scheduled for a stress test,
results are as follows: [**2141-1-11**] Stress Test - Exercised 4 minutes
of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to 96% APMR stopping due to fatigue. No
chest pain. No ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear images showed
moderate inferior and septal ischemia and a possible apex
infarction with an EF of 49% and apical akinesis. Cardiac
catheterization in [**2141-1-8**] revealed three vessel coronary
artery disease and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LAD and LCx had separate ostia from the left coronary cusp.
The LAD had mild diffuse disease proximally and distally,
however the mid LAD had a 90% diffuse stenosis. The LCx gave off
a large OM branch that had a 90% mid-vessel stenosis. The RCA
was occluded proximally and was fed by collaterals from the LAD.
Left ventriculography revealed a normal ejection fraction
without evidence of wall motion abnormality or mitral
regurgitation. Based upon the above results, she was referred
for coronary revascularization.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5762**] was admitted and underwent four vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The operation was complicated by
bleeding. She required multiple blood products and surgical
re-exploration on the same operative day. For further details,
please see seperate dictated operative notes. Following surgical
intervention, she was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. Early postop, she was noted to have diffuse ST
elevations, more prominent in the inferior leads. Serial EKGs
were obtained. EKG findings were more likely related to
pericarditis. There was very low suscipion for graft failure.
Post op cardiac enzymes remained within normal limits. She
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics. Beta blockade was
resumed for tachycardia. Her CSRU course was otherwise
uneventful. On postoperative day three, she transferred to the
SDU. She remained fluid overloaded and required aggressive
diuresis. Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. She remained
in a normal sinus rhythm. Over several days, she continued to
make clinical improvements and made steady progress with
physical therapy. At time of discharge, her BP was 130/57 with a
heart rate of 84. She was tolerating room air(92-94%)and her
chest x-ray was notable for mild congestive failure with
cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
patchy atelectasis. All surgical wounds were clean, without
evidence of infection. At time of discharge, she also remained
fluid overloaded and will continue to require Lasix as an
outpatient. She will followup with her cardiologist in one week
for appropriate diuretic titration. She will return to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one month for routine follow up.
