IMAGING:

[**11-3**] CXR COMPARISON: [**2194-8-15**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to overlying
soft tissue, although a trace effusion cannot be excluded.
2. Hiatal hernia.

[**11-5**] Sigmoidoscopy
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12303**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of hypertension,
diastolic heart failure (CHF, last EF 55% in [**11/2193**]), atrial
fibrillation on coumadin status post cardioversion x2, most
recently in [**Month (only) 958**], irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with
intermittent rectal bleeding, osteoarthritis, who is presenting
with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR).

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Lower GI bleed:  Initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
GI was consulted and they recommended a CT scan of the abdomen
and an inpatient colonoscopy.  However, the patient declined
both of these studies since her bleeding resolved and she was
claustophobic.  Also, she reported that she already had 2
colonoscopies which she did not think had ever been helpful.
Her hematocrit dropped from 36 to 30 initially, however, it then
remained stable at 30 and she did not have further bloody bowel
movements while in the ICU.  She did not require blood
transfusions since she was not symptomatic from blood loss.  She
did agree to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed
diverticulosis and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids but no active
bleeding. Given these findings, she most likely had a
self-resolving diverticular bleed.  As these are prone to recur,
the risk of continuing coumadin therapy did not seem worth the
benefit, so she was told to stop this on discharge.  Will defer
to her PCP and cardiologist for further management and
discussion of risk vs benefit of coumadin therapy.

# Atrial fibrillation:  status post cardioversion in [**2194-1-28**]
with CHADS score of 3, on coumadin at presentation.  She was
given 2 units FFP to reverse here INR, and her aspirin and
warfarin were held due to active bleeding.  She was continued on
her home amiodarone. She was not restarted on her aspirin or
warfarin at discharge given her recent bleed, however will defer
to outpatient PCP and cardiologist for further management.

CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Diastolic heart failure (dCHF):  The patient has a history of
diastolic CHF.  Not on daily diueretic regimen, but takes PRN.
Her diuretics and metoprolol were held due to potential GI bleed
and hypovolemia.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Anticoagulation:  will need to determine if she should restart
warfarin and/or aspirin
