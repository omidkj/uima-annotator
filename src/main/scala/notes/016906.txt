History of Present Illness:
34 yo woman with history of steroid dependent asthma presenting
with chest tightness and wheezing and back pain x2 days. Of
note, she was recently seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for asthma flare [**12-27**] and
went home on steroid taper which she remained on when admitted.
She also recently was started on a zpak by her pcp. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] initial
evaluation, her VSS. She had chest tightness, SOB as well as
urinary frequency and subjective fevers. She recieved nebs,
morphine and oxycodone in the ED and was then notes to have a ?
anaphylaxtic rx with subjective sensation of throat closing, and
was given Epinephrine with improvement. She was given additional
nebs but then transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring
(likely b/c pt has had many admissions for asthma exacerbation
requiring intubation).
In the MICU, pt was continued on nebs and home inhalers with
good improvement in her symptoms. She was noted to be
tachycardic and given her h/o DVT she had a CTA done to rule out
PE. CTA showed no major PE but subsegmental PE could not be
ruled out b/c of body habitus and poor imaging study.
.
Currently pt feels well. She does not occasional chest tightness
but her sx improve with nebulizers. She denies SOB or
palpitations. She does report some + flank pain and dysuria
which she states is ongoing x3 years. Says she doesn't have
pelvic issue but something is wrong with her kidneys that no one
has found. Otherwise pt feels well. No N/V, tolerating PO, no
diarrha/constipation or abdominal pain.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: Please eval for PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
34 year old woman with persistent tachycardia, questionable hx
of DVT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 34-year-old female with persistent tachycardia and
questionable history of DVT to rule out pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed post-administration of
intravenous contrast, reconstructions were performed in the
axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.

COMPARISON: With CT of [**2157-12-27**].

FINDINGS:

CT CHEST POST-ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The examination is severely limited due to patient's body
habitus as well as artifact from breathing. There is no central
pulmonary embolism, however, segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli cannot be excluded given the poor quality.
There is no aortic dissection. There is atelectasis in the lower
lobes. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.

The visualized liver and spleen appear unremarkable.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no worrisome bone lesions.

CONCLUSION:

The study is suboptimal due to patient body habitus as well as
artifact due to breathing. There is no central pulmonary
embolism, however, the possibility of subsegmental and
subsegmental pulmonary emboli cannot be excluded and if there is
high clinical suspicion, a CT chest may be repeated.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2158-2-16**] 1:09 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Evaluate for PNA, other intrathoracic process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
34 year old woman with worsening dyspnea, wheezing and R flank
pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for PNA, other intrathoracic process
INDICATION: Worsening dyspnea, wheezing and right flank pain.

COMPARISONS: [**2158-1-13**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable with unfolding of the aorta. The lungs are clear. There
are no pleural effusions. The pulmonary vasculature is within
normal limits.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
#SOB/Wheezing: Upon initial evaluation the patient had chest
tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath. Her vital signs
were stable.  She recieved nebulizer treamtents, morphine and
oxycodone in the ED and was then notes to have a ? anaphylaxtic
reaction with subjective sensation of throat closing, and was
given Epinephrine with improvement. She was given additional
nebs but then transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring
(likely b/c pt has had many admissions for asthma exacerbation
requiring intubation).  In the MICU, pt was continued on nebs
and home inhalers with good improvement in her symptoms. SHe was
also given a dose of Solumedrol and then started on 60mg
Prednisone.  She was noted to be tachycardic and given her h/o
DVT she had a CTA done to rule out PE. CTA showed no evidence of
a pulmonary embolism. Overall it as felt the patient suffered an
asthma exacerbation plus ? component of paradoxical vocal cord
dysfunction. After 16 hours in the MICU she was transferred the
floor.  She was continued on the high dose prednisone, nebs,
home inhalers.  Pts breathing has subsequently improved and she
was satting 99% on RA.   She was discharged on the high dose
Prednisone 60mg with a slow taper to 20mg daily and asked to
follow up with pulmonary.   In addition, given the chronic
prednisone use, she was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim.
 She was continued on her home nebulizers and inhalers on
discharge.
.
2. Right flank pain: Per OMR notes, this has been chronic for
patient for many months. A U/A was negative on admission. On
review of old records, a CT scan in [**12-27**] was suggestive of
pelvic congestion syndrome and she was asked to see gynecology.
Also, a RUQ U/S [**12-27**] showed no evidence of gallstones. On this
admission, the patients pain was improved with a lidocaine patch
and she was mildly symptomatic.  She remained afebrile and had
no other sign of infection.  She was again asked to make a
follow up appointment with gynecology on discharge.  She was
given 7 days of a lidocaine patch to help with the pain but
asked to return if the pain worsens or persists.
.
3. DMI: The patient was continued on her home insulin regimen
during this hospitalization.
.
4. HTN: The patients BP remained well controlled on her home
HCTZ and ACE.
