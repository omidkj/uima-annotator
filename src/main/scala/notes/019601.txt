Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2167-6-17**] via direct
admission from home.  She had an x-ray at home which showed
right hip hardware failure.  She was seen by medicine and
prepped for surgery.  On [**2167-6-18**] she was taken to the operating
room.  She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the recovery room.  In the recovery room she was extubated, but
unfortunately she needed to be reintubated due to respiratory
failure.  She was then transferred to the intensive care unit,
intubated, for further care and monitoring.  During her stay in
the intensive care unit she was transfused with packed red blood
cells due to post operative anemia.  She was also started on a
lasix drip to help with diuresis.  Renal was consulted for acute
on chronic renal failure.  On [**2167-6-23**] she underwent a broncospy
for her left lower lobe pneumonia.  On [**2167-6-27**] she was extubated.
 She tolerated the extubation well.  On [**2167-6-29**] she was
transferred to the floor for further care.  She was seen by
physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility.  The rest
of her hospital stay was uneventful with her lab data and vital
signs within normal limits and her pain controlled.  She is
being discharged today in stable condition.
