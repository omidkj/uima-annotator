Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation

History of Present Illness:
A 56 yoM with PMH medically managed inferior wall MI, anterior
wall MI s/p athrectomy in LAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF 15%
s/p BiV pacer and AICD, VT s/p ablation is transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Hospital1 **] CCU for repeat VT ablation. Pt presented to
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] hospital [**12-24**] with SOB and presyncope x 2
days. He reports that he began feeling unwell and SOB [**12-23**] and
felt his AICD fire 1x, the symptoms gradually worsened and he
received another shock [**12-24**] prompting him to present to
[**Hospital1 **] where he was treated initially for heart failure with
furosemide 20mg IV and diuresed one liter. The morning of [**12-25**]
he had an episode of SVT vs VT which was self limited, a second
episode occurred and he received lopressor 5mg IV and ativan and
transfered to the CCU where he had another episode of SVT and
was treated with lidocaine 100mg bolus followed by drip at
2mg/min. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for VT
ablation.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, his vitals were T:97.0 P:73
BP:108/65 RR:18 SaO2 97% 2L. Initial EKG revealed sinus rhythm
with RV paced beats at 91 BPM, and TWI in V5-V6, aside from
twave chanes EKG was similar to 5/[**2130**]. Shortly thereafter, he
had multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia lasting ~15
seconds. His pacer was interrogated which showed that the AICD
had fired twice on the day of arrival and that he had been ATP
paced out of VT multiple times throughout the day. The pacer was
changed from BiV pacing to LV then RV pacing, while on LV
pacing, multiple runs of VT occurred and fewer occurred while on
RV pacing. The pacer was left in RV pacing with a plan for VT
ablation.

Cardiac Cath [**12-27**]:Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated
left sided filling pressure with mean PCWP 16 mmHg.  There was
mildly elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure PASP
33mmHg, with a normal PVR.  The cardiac index was depressed at
1.9L/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure and pulmonary
artery
pressure
2. Low cardiac output.
3. Low PVR.
.
CXR [**12-29**]: FINDINGS: No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip
lies above the clavicular level, approximately 7.5 cm from the
carina. A three-channel pacemaker-defibrillator device is in
place. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
.
ECHO [**12-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There are filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. An eccentric, laterally directed jet of
severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior transesophageal
study (images reviewed) of [**2130-1-23**], left ventricular systolic
function is probably significantly worse although views are
suboptimal for comparison. Mitral regurgittaion is now worse.
