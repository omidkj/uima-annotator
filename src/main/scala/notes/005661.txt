Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from OSH for EP evaluation (? complete heart block) &
possible cardiac catheterization.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of temporary pacemaker line
Placement of permanent pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
85 yom with afib, dm, pvd, copd, h/o priof MI admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] 4 days ago with acute SOB & chest pressure.  Patient is
wheelchair bound. According to notes, pt has been developed
chest pressure and shortness of breath on day of admission to
OSH.  He had a few episodes of this pressure during
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 46**].  The chest pressure occured along
with some sob, nausea and right shoulder pain.  Denied
diaphresis.  He had trop of 0.09. ECG showed intermittent CHB on
admission to osh.  Because of this he was taken of BB.  An Echo
was performed, revealing an EF of 30%.   He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for w/u of possible cardiomyopathy and catheterization.
.
Pt was admitted initially admitted to cardiology [**Hospital1 **].  He did
not have any complaints on presentation. He was given metoprolol
12.5mg at 8 pm and one hour later, while sleeping, was noted to
have complete heart block.  BP was stable and pt asymptomatic.
Episode self resolved.  However, given concern for intermittent
chb he was transferred to CCU.  He denied any complaints at time
of transfer.

Social History:

drugs. Has reportedly gotten VNA and PT at home.  Lives at home

accesible.

[**6-3**]-CXR--REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the pacemaker
placement.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to the previous film from
[**2128-6-1**]. The right atrium and right ventricle pacemaker
leads inserted on the left are in standard positions. No
pneumothorax or a pleural effusion. The heart size is enlarged
and the aorta is tortuous and calcified.
Multiple bilateral pleural plaques, including the bilateral
costal pleura and bilateral diaphragmatic pleural surfaces
suggest previous asbestos related disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of the pacemaker.
2. Unchanged appearance of the bilateral pleural plaques
consistent with prior asbestos exposure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 85 yom with h/o DM, paroxysmal afib, severe peripheral
vascular disease s/p multiple bypass grafts, copd and remote MI,
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac
catheterization and EP evaluation.
The pt was initially admitted to the cardiology [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 18**],
where, after recieving a dose of beta-blocker before bedtime, he
had 20 minutes of complete heart block.  The episode was
asymptomatic.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for closer
observation and placement of a temporary pacemaker wire, which
was uncomplicated.  The following day ([**6-1**]) pt had a permanent
pacer implanted (DDD).  Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the pt has had
low BP's (SBP-80's to 100's & occasionally lower).  His
anti-hypertensives were held because of this.  The pt was noted
to be volume overloaded, and was given IV Lasix (20mg) PRN.  He
diuresed well, and his SBP would often improve following
diuresis.  This lead us to conclude that he likely had active
CHF, leading to poor forward flow & a pre-renal state.  Because
of this, he discharged on PO lasix.
.
Other issues:
.
#) CV
-CAD: Given pt's h/o CAD, he was treated with ASA, statin, &
plavix during his admission.  Once BP improved, b-blocker
therapy was resumed; however, he was unable to tolerate more
than a few doses.  His ACEi was also held because of low BP.
The pt did not have CP/pressure during his admission here.  At
[**Hospital3 3583**] the pt did have chest pressure and borderline
elevated troponins.  However, given the pt's age & physical
status (minimal activity & wheelchair bound), we felt that the
risks of cardiac catheterization out weighed the benefits, and,
thus, we did not pursue catheterization during this admission.
-Pump: Pt reportedly had an EF=30% from an echo done at OSH.  He
did show signs of volume overload and presumed CHF while here,
which were treated with diuresis.
-Rhythm: Episode of complete heart block treated with permanent
pacemaker.
.
#) Renal - The pt was in acute renal failure (thought to be
pre-renal) with Crt peaking at 1.8 and trending down to 1.5
after diuresis.  (It was thought that due to volume overload and
CHF, the pt had poor forward flow, leading to hypo-perfusion of
his kidneys.)
.
#) PVD - Patient has an extensive history of lower extremity
bypass surgeries.  He was noted to have two left lower extremity
ulcers which were treated with wound care.  No evidence of
cellutis.
.
#) Diabetes - The pt's home gluburide was discontinued while
hospitalized and he was covered with RISS.  He will be
discharged on glypizide (rather than glyburide) given his
decreased renal function: crt clearance estimated at 33.
.
#) Paroxysmal afib. - no documented a. fib on tele at OSH or at
[**Hospital1 18**].  Coumadin was re-started here following EP recomendation.
 However, it was later discontinued as pt was felt to be at high
risk for falls and would be receiving aspirin and plavix for his
CAD.
.
# )COPD - Patient has history of emphysema (20 pack-year smoking
history) and asbestos exposure.  He was given nebulizers &
inhalers prn.
.
# AAA - per outside records, pt has AAA of ~2 cm width.  No
interventions undertaken while in hospital.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia - Pt's plts were noted to have dropped from
159 to 130 at OSH, and initially 125 here.  Cause unclear.  It
resolved on it's own.
.
#) Dispo - Based on pt's inability to perform his baseline
physical activities (ie, transferring, etc...), physical therapy
recommended that pt go to rehab for further strengthening and
conditioning prior to going home.  Pt initially refused, but
later agreed once his family discussed the issue with him.
