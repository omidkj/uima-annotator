RRR
Abd with seatbelt sign, soft
Rectal with normal tone, no gross blood
hematoma over L prox tib/fib, R dorsum of foot

Pertinent Results:
Orthopedic survery [**9-21**]:
1. External fixation device applied to the left elbow,
unchanged.
2. Comminuted fractures of the coronoid process and lateral
epicondyle of the
humerus.
3. Healing nondisplaced fracture of the distal radius and of the
lunate.
Ununited fracture fragment at the dorsum of the wrist.

CT Chest [**9-18**]:
1. No relevant change in pleural effusions and bilateral dorsal
basal areas of atelectasis.
2. Newly occurred consolidation in the right lung, an infectious
genesis is likely.
3. Tracheostomy, removal of nasogastric tube.
4. Decrease of pericardial effusion.
5. Ascites, abdominal drains, status post splenectomy, diastasis
of the
midline.


Brief Hospital Course:
79yo F in MVC, hypotensive upon arrival to ED. FAST scan
negative, but CT scanner non-functional. Noted to have a flail
chest, intubated in ED and brought initially to TSICU. A TEE
demonstrated no cardiac dysfunction, and a repeat FAST scan
showed hemoperitoneum. Accordingly, she was brought to the OR
for exploratory laparotomy with finding of splenic hemorrhage
and thus splenectomy was performed.  The remainder of her
hospital course, and injuries, will be reviewed here by system:

Neuro - no traumatic injury.  Patient was sedated as needed
during her period of intubation, but was weaned to minimal
sedation as vent settings were weaned.  At time of discharge,
pain/sedation were well controlled on prn roxicet/ativan via
g-tube.

CV - Episodes of rapid afib, eventually controlled with
amiodarone (bolus and drip), currently on amiodarone via g-tube,
in normal sinus rhythm.  Hemodynamically unstable prior to first
exploration secondary to hypovolemia from splenic hemorrhage,
then later again unstable during abdominal compartment syndrome,
subsequently stable and currently off any pressors for nearly a
week.

R - initial injuries included rib fractures of L4-10 and R [**2-11**],
several of which were displaced, as well as sternal/manubrial
fracture, all resulting in flail chest.  She remained intubated
after initial operation, vent dependent, and s/p trach [**8-22**].
Vent weaned to CPAP/PS with PS setting of 12.  Any further
weaning causes patient to c/o subjective shortness of breath,
although saturation and vent parameters remain normal.  Current
plan is to wean PS by 1 each night while patient sleeping.

GI - s/p PEG placement [**8-22**].  Over the next few days she
developed increasing airway pressures, worsening renal failure,
as well as a bladder pressure over 30. She eventually became
hemodynamically unstable, requiring fluid resuscitation, as
well as pressor requirement.  She was thus taken for exploratory
laparotomy on [**8-26**], finding of gastric perforation at the site
of g-tube insertion and bilious ascites.  Post-operatively she
continued to have respiratory and renal failure with bilious
output from her PEG site.  She then returned to the operating
room on [**8-28**] for exploratory laparotomy, finding no new
perforation, and a nasojejunal [**Hospital Ward Name **] tube was passed and two JP
drains were placed.  JP#1 was bilious, with output decreasing
over the remainder of the hospital stay, without changing in
quality/quantity as tube feeds were initiated via the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
tube.  JP#2 was mostly serosanguinous and was removed on [**9-21**].
The abdominal fascia was closed primarily but the skin was left
open, initially covered with wet-to-dry and currently being
managed with VAC dressing, demonstrating decrease in size and
good granulation tissue.

GU - Concomitant with hemodynamic instability and significant
fluid resuscitation in context of gastric perforation, patient
developed acute renal failure.  Pt required CVVH from [**8-29**] -
[**9-10**], with gradual improvement. Transitioned to intermittent
lasix, which ultimately d/c'd a week before discharge.  BUN 29
and creatinine 0.8 at time of discharge.

H - Currently stable hematocrits (28.7 at time of d/c),
platelets (548 at time of d/c), and coagulation.

ID - Pt experienced multiple infectious complications,
including: UTI (pan-sensitive EColi [**8-15**]), MSSA PNA ([**8-17**],
[**8-20**]), enterobacter peritonitis (res Zosyn and cephalosporin),
and finally an enterobacter and MRSA line sepsis (positive
cultures from catheter tip, urine, and sputum on [**9-11**]).  Final
infection is being treated with Vanco/Meropenem with 14 day
course due to complete on [**9-24**].  Pt currently has R subclavian
central line, changed over wire on [**9-22**], which should be removed
after completion of antibiotic course.  WBC stable at 16.0 at
time of discharge.

Endo - RISS. on levothyroxine for h/o hypothyroid.

FEN - currently receiving tube feeds with post-pyloric Dobhoff.
Mild hypernatremia improving with addition of free water via
Dobhoff.

Spine - fracture of C2 Left transverse process, evaluated by
Ortho-Spine consult. No operative intervention indicated, placed
in [**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar, to remain until follow-up.

Ortho -
1. L elbow dislocation, initially splinted and casted at ICU
bedside but redislocated.  Therefore went for open reduction
internal fixation of
left elbow dislocation with placement of hinged external fixator
on [**9-1**] by Orthopedics.  Ex-fix kept locked in place for 2
weeks, subsequently unlocked to permit ROM on [**9-22**].
2. Dislocation of first metatarsal cuneiform joint on the right
side, s/p pin placement on [**8-17**] by Orthopedics.  She was
permitted for touchdown weight-bearing beginning [**9-20**].
3. L2 finger fracture of proximal phalanx, extending into 2nd
MCP joint. volar splint applied by Plastics/Hand.
4. intraarticular fracture of R distal radius

Proph - IVC filter placement by OR on [**8-23**].  Also on Heparin SQ
[**Hospital1 **], as well as Prevacid solutabs.
