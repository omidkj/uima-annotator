History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 9581**] is a 54 y/o F with DM2, HTN, 3vCAD (s/p MI s/p RCA
stent in [**2110**]), EtOH and tobacco abuse, h/o depression/[**Hospital 9582**]
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on [**8-15**] from [**Hospital 487**] Hospital for
VF arrest on [**8-14**], shocked in the field.

Pt was in her USOH until [**8-14**]. In the evening she cooked dinner
for her husband, then watched a movie and went to bed. At around
1am, she woke her husband up with substernal chest pain. She
thook sublingual NTG, which resolved the pain immediately.
Approximately 15minutes later, the patient again experience
chest pain. Her husband called 911, and by the time he returned
to her side, she began to slump in her chair and became
unconscious, eyes "rolling back", no incontinence. EMS arrived 2
minutes after this episode, found her to be in v-fib and
proceeded to electric defibrillation. The shock resulted in a
perfusing rhythm. She was intubated in the field, received 200mg
IV lidocaine and was started on IV fluids. She was taken to
[**Hospital6 3105**], where she was started on dopamine for
persistent hypotension. She was also started on heparin and
eptifibatide drips for ACS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent
cardiac cath.

At [**Hospital1 18**], she was taken immediately to the cath lab where she
was found to have moderate 3 vessel disease with a "hazy lesion"
in OM-1 that was stented with a BMS. Concomitant TTE verified
severe global left ventricular dysfunction (EF ~20-25%), repeat
documented improvement with Ef ~45%.

ROS unattainable at time of transfer, pt intubated and sedated.

Past Medical History:
1) Coronary artery disease: Status post inferior myocardial
infarction with right coronary artery stent placement on [**6-26**], [**2110**], at [**Hospital1 18**].
2) CEA performed in [**2118**] at [**Hospital6 3105**]
3) Depression
4) Alcohol abuse
5) Hyperlipidemia
6) H/O Gastrointestinal bleed with two episodes of bright red
blood per rectum.
7) Post-traumatic stress disorder secondary to domestic abuse by
ex-husband
8) Bipolar disorder
9) Tobacco abuse

Social History:
Patient lives in [**Location 9583**], MA with her husband. She has
smoked 1.5-2 ppd for 30 years. Patient drinks EtOH occasionally;
she has a documented history of alcohol abuse in OMR. Patient
does not currently work secondary to disability (MI's and
bipolar disorder).

Patient has an extensive FamHx of DM2, PVD, HTN, [**Location **]. [**Name (NI) **]

CARDIOLOGY:
.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2119-8-15**]):
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Hypotensive shock with elevated filling pressures, elevated
cardiac
index and depressed SVR.
3. Echocardiographic evidence of severe left ventricular
systolic heart
failure.
4. Severe biventricular diastolic heart failure.
5. Severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.
6. Severe hypercapnea and acidemia despite aggressive
ventilation.
7. Successful placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal
OM1.
8. Unsuccessful angioplasty (balloon inflation not attempted) of
the OM
distal branch, left posterolateral branch of the circumflex, and
acute
marginal branch of the RCA.
.
TTE ([**8-15**]):
There is severe global left ventricular dysfunction with more
severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral
walls and mid to distal anteroseptum. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The severity of the
regurgitation may be underestimated. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery pressure cannot be determined.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe global hypokinesis
with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mid to
distal anterior septum c/w multivessel CAD. Distal right
ventricular hypokinesis. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
LVEF 20-25%.
.
TTE ([**2119-8-23**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structural
