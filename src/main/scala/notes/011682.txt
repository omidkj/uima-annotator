Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected necrotic ulcers of the right lower extremity.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
11/23/9 Debridement of infected necrotic right extremity ulcers.
11/30/9 Right above-knee amputation

History of Present Illness:
81-year-old woman with history of severe peripheral arterial
disease, who had previously presented with acute limb ischemia
and she has subsequently underwent endovascular
revascularization of the right lower extremity with stent of the
right superficial femoral artery, balloon angioplasty of right
superficial femoral artery in-stent stenosis and angioJet
thrombectomy of the right superficial femoral artery, popliteal
artery, and tibioperoneal trunk. Despite revascularization she
was not able to heal the right lower extremity and therefore
developed significant gangrene of the right leg with necrotic
ulcers on the posterior calf. She was admitted for IV
antibiotics, wound care and possible debridement in the OR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2200-12-11**] with multiple necrotic infected
ulcers after undergoing revascularization of her right leg
chronic ischemia. She was started on iv antibiotics, wound care
and underwent debridement of these necrotic infected ulcers on
[**12-15**]/9. She has failed a course of antibiotics and nonoperative
treatment, therefore patient was consented for a right
above-knee amputation. As a result of her multiple high-risk
comorbidities, postoperatively she developed acute renal
failure, A.Fib with RVR and sepsis. Cardiology was consulted and
measures to keep her chronic atrial fibrillation with adequate
HR were made. Nephrology was also involved and HD was suggested
as a possible therapy for her uremia. On [**12-26**]/9 patient
significant abdominal distention with ?colonic
pseudo-obstruction, CT scan consistent with [**Last Name (un) 3696**] disease
and hemodynamic compromise on [**12-27**]/9. No free air or fluid, no
bowel wall edema, mesenteric or portal venous air were seen. NGT
and rectal tubes were placed. GI and general surgery were
consulted. She was then transferred from the VICU to the
intensive care unit. After extensive conversations with the
family and son [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 10132**] - health care proxy), patient was
made DNR/DNI. After seing progressive impairment on her clinical
status, family was contact[**Name (NI) **] again and she was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], and
died soon thereafter. Report of death at 16:30 11/05/9.
Patient's family, the admitting office and Medical examiner were
notified. The ME did not accept the case, and therefore the
death certificate was signed.
