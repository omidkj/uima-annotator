Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, scrotal edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
62M hx of CVA 7 yrs prior, CHF with reported EF 25% thought
secondary to EtOH, afib of unclear duration not on medications
due to compliance, asthma, going EtOH abuse who presented to
[**Hospital3 26615**] hospital with dyspnea and scrotal edema.  States
that for the past few months he has had worsening dyspnea
without chest pain, first occurred with exertion but for the
past 2-3 weeks has been at rest.  He has a history of asthma and
recently received a script for an albuterol inhaler, which he
has been taking 4-5 times per day for the past 2 weeks for his
dyspnea.  He also noticed over the past 2 weeks progressive
lower extremity edema that began in his ankles and has spread to
his mid thorax, notably with a large amount of scrotal edema.
For the past 3 days, his scrotum has also become painful and
tender.  Denies fevers/chills.  States that he was drinking (~1
6pk per day) up until 2 weeks ago when his dyspnea at rest
began.  He is not the best historian, however, as he exhibited
some word finding difficulties and some difficulty with recall.
.
He went to [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital where he was noted to be in afib
with RVR with rates to the 140s.  He was given IV diltiazem
multiple times and eventually placed on a dilt drip, which
dropped his BP into the 80s.  He was PO loaded with 50 metop and
was given 60mg IV lasix with ~500cc output.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, he was mildly dyspneic at rest but felt
comfortable.  Denied chest pain, palpitations.  States he had
pain in his scrotum exacerbated by the ambulance ride from the
OSH.  Otherwise, ROS is negative.

STUDIES:
ECG on presentation [**2144-12-30**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. RSR'
pattern in
leads V1 and V2. Anterolateral T wave inversion, possibly
related to ischemia. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
CXR [**2144-12-30**]
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are associated with
adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. There is mild vascular
congestion. Cardiac size is obscured by the pleural parenchyma
abnormalities.
TTE [**2144-12-31**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mildly dilated left ventricle
with normal wall thickness and severely depressed global left
ventricular systolic function. Mild global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild to
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
62M hx of CVA, afib not compliant with medications, CHF with
reported EF of 25%, going EtOH abuse, who presents with multiple
months of progressive dyspnea now at rest and 2 weeks of lower
extremity edema, as well as atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate.
.
# Afib with RVR: unclear history of afib, per the patient, was
diagnosed 2 months prior at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He is supposed to be
taking medications at home, which he does not know the names,
and which is is not taking.  He has been previously asymptomatic
from his rhythm/rate.  Etiology likely secondary to CHF with
marked volume overload (caused by ETOH direct myocardial
toxicity). Ischemia was thought to be unlikely. Pt was rate
controlled on admission after receiving 50mg Po metoprolol at
OSH. Metoprolol was continued. Regarding anticoagulation, pt was
started on a heparin gtt and eventually bridged to coumadin
(CHADS2 score 4 - CHF, HTN, stroke). Pt was counseled at length
about the importance of anticoagulation and the importance of
abstaining from alcohol use while on coumadin.
