Pertinent Results:
[**5-23**] Echo: PRE CPB Suboptimal study due to heart rotation likely
due to left atrial enlargement. The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail that appears to
be limited to the P3 scallop though there may be some slight
involvement of P2. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study. POST CPB Normal right ventricular systolic
function. The left ventricle displays mild to moderate global
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of about 40%. There is a
mitral valve annuloplasty ring in situ. It appears well seated.
The mitral valve is s/p repair. Mitral regurgitation is not
appreciated. The peak gradient through the mitral valve is about
7 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 3.5 mm Hg at a cardiac output of
4 liters/minute. The thoracic aorta appears intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up prior to admission. On [**5-23**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a Mitral Valve Repair. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one chest
x-ray revealed right apical pneumothorax therefore a chest tube
remained in place. Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated
and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. On
post-op day two she was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. Pneumothorax remained small and stable and chest
tube was dc'd. She was restarted on coumadin for chronic atrial
fibrillation. She did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD # 6.
