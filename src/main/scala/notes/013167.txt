History of Present Illness:
88 y/o male with HTN, HLD, LE claudication, AF on coumadin, MDS,
moderate to severe AS, who initially presented on [**2159-2-24**] to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital via EMS with 2-3 days of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, ? viral prodrome. During the
days up to admission, he also developed DOE and had
progressively more difficulty climbing stairs, requiring rest,
which was a change in baseline. In hindsight, he actually
reports progressive dyspnea while walking for the past several
months (4-6 months), when he was evaluated for LE claudication.
Functionally, he feels he can no longer walk 1 block or do 1
flight of stairs due to his breathing. He also reported weakness
and fatigue. En route, he received 4 aspirin tablets, 81 mg,
along with CPAP.
.
At [**Hospital3 417**] ED, his HR was 113, RR 30s, BP 149/109. He was
in tripod position while breathing. On ROS, he reported cough
for 3-4 days without fever or sputum. He denied abdominal pain
or headache. Denied dizziness. Denies syncope. He also reported
pressure in his epigastrium. He was noted to be tachypnic,
eventually requiring Bipap. X-ray confirmed acute CHF
exacerbation with ? RML infiltrate, and he was placed on nitro
gtt. He was also in rapid AF with ? rate related ST depressions,
requiring lopressor. Once nitro was weaned off, he again went
into flash pulmonary edema. On saturday, he again went into
rapid AF, and developed chest pressure with acute CHF
exacerbation. He has intermittently required Bipap, lasix, and
nitro gtt in CCU. Echo there showed critical AS with valve area
0.4 cm2, and he is transferred for consideration of aortic valve
intervention. Of note, cardiac enzymes were notable for negative
troponin x 2 and BNP 268 then 560.
.
Per review of [**Hospital3 417**] admission note, suspicion was for
congestive heart failure possibly triggered by early pneumonia.
He improved with Bipap, nitro gtt, lasix gtt. He also received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but this was discontinued prior to
transfer.
.
Vitals on transfer - afebrile, 95, 116/74, 16, 94% on 3L NC
.
On review of systems, patient reports that his baseline SBP is
110-120. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is positive for epigastric discomfort,
DOE, and PND. Reports sleeping on 1 pillow. Notable for absence
of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2159-3-6**]
The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is
>=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

and an 25 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement
The patient is on an Norepinephrine drip at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and
a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min

The aortic valve is well seated with no peri/paravalvular
leaks.The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 11 mm hg
There is persistent moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation
The aorta is intact post decannulation
LV function is preserved at an EF of>55%

Cardiac Catheterization [**2159-2-27**]
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
