Imaging:
Chest X-ray [**2116-4-1**] - New diffuse alveolar opacities throughout
both lungs and perihilar haziness are findings consistent with
moderate-to-severe
pulmonary edema. Probable moderate layering pleural effusions
also exist.
Opacification of the bases is greater than the upper lung zones,
likely de to underlying chronic interstitial lung disease seen
on prior chest radiographs and CT. Median sternotomy wires are
intact. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to pleural
fluid. There is no pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION:  1. New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema
superimposed upon known chronic interstial lung disease.
2. Possible new bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CT scan [**2116-4-3**]:
Known fibrotic changes, likely to reflect mild-to-moderate UIP.

Newly appeared ground-glass opacities in both lungs and in
diffuse
distribution, suggesting either acute exacerbation or
superinfection, for
example with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] the distribution of the changes, acute
allergic
alveolitis is less likely.
.
ECHO [**2116-4-2**]: Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2116-2-20**], the posterior wall is now
severely hypokinetic/akinetic
.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with h/o CHF, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary
hypertension presenting with dyspnea, hypoxemia, elevated BNP
and bilateral infiltrates on chest xray. Likely had CAP and CHF
exacerbation with underlying IPF, improved with antibiotics,
prednisone course and diuresis.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Hypoxemia: Initial differential included CHF, pneumonia or
worsening UIP/IPF. Ruled out for flu. He was started on
non-rebreather and did not require intubation. He was diuresed
with IV lasix, started on high dose IV steroids and covered for
CAP with Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone. He continued to require
100% NRB on hospital day 2. High dose steroids were stopped for
one day as unclear whether IPF flare but re-started once CT
chest findings more consistent with IPF and overlying pulmonary
edema. He was weaned to 5 L nasal cannula with high-dose
steroids, aggressive diuresis (-4L) and antibiotics. He was
stable after coming to the floor and was maintaining sats on 4L
O2 nasal cannula. He completed a 5-day course of azithromycin
and will have a total of 7-days of ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime. He
was restarted on his home lasix dose for continued diuresis and
was largely euvolemic on exam. Pulmonology evaluated patient and
recommended a taper of prednisone from 60mg over 2 weeks until
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was started on bactrim prophylaxis
while on steroids. Patient's initial hypoxemia was likely in the
setting of CHF exacerbation and community acquired pneumonia
causing severe symptoms given underlying structural disease due
to IPF. Patient was discharged to rehab on 3-4L O2 and will
likely need temporary home O2 after going home.
.
# NSTEMI: Had elevated troponin which peaked at 0.25 with normal
CK and CK-MB, no new ECG changes. TTE showed a posterior wall
motion a
