HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old woman
with history of hypertension, who was admitted to an outside
hospital prior to being admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**12-31**].  At the outside hospital the patient
had investigation for two month history of abdominal pain
which showed mainly epigastric.  This work-up included
abdominal CT which showed thickened duodenal valve, 2 cm
adrenal mass, question of colon lesion consistent with
intermittent intestinal obstruction.  Her CEA at the outside
hospital was 41.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**12-31**] with worsening of the abdominal
epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting for two days.  In the
hospital the patient had work-up which included CT angiogram
due to abnormal EKG initially which revealed pulmonary
embolism and patient had been started on Heparin.  Her
initial EKG revealed T wave inversion at V2 and V6 plus ST
depression so she was also admitted for rule out MI.  CT also
revealed dilated common bile duct up to 18 mm.  Her
hematocrit on admission was 29.0 and drifted to 22.5 on
[**1-1**].  She had two episodes of coffee ground emesis on
[**1-1**], became hypotensive and bradycardic and acute EGD was
performed which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the lower
third, ulcer in the stomach, body and antrum, blood in the
stomach and anterior vault.  There was large oozing clot in
the duodenal bulb.  Hemostasis was achieved with Epinephrine
injection.  Anticoagulation was discontinued and patient was
started on Protonix drip and had been transferred to medical
Intensive Care Unit due to hypotension and active bleeding.
The same day she had IVC filter placed which was done on
[**1-2**].  The patient received two units of FFP followed by 6
units of packed red blood cells.  On [**1-2**] the patient was
transferred back to the medicine floor and on [**1-3**] she had a
second EGD done due to hematocrit of 33.6 which drifted to
32.2.  EGD at that time revealed esophagitis, ulcers in the
antrum which were injected with Epinephrine and also
posterior bulb injection and thermal therapy, a large
inferior posterior duodenal ulcer with oozing refractory to
injection.  For this reason the patient underwent angiography
revealing the source of bleeding and underwent duodenal
gastric artery embolization.  She was then transferred with
additional two units packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit
after transfusion went to 38.5 on [**1-4**].

Other studies during the hospital course included chest x-ray
which revealed widened mediastinum secondary to tortuous and
dilated thoracic aorta and bibasilar atelectasis.  CTA
revealed moderate intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation,
left pulmonary artery embolism and left adrenal mass.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed no DVT, KUB
revealed no obstruction and chest x-ray on [**1-5**] revealed
bilateral small pleural effusion with consolidation of the
lower lobe presenting either atelectasis or infection.  She
was transferred to general medicine floor on [**1-5**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 85-year-old woman with history
of hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,

history of epigastric pain.  She was found to have peptic
ulcer disease with massive GI bleeding requiring twice EGD,
injection with Epinephrine, embolization of gastroduodenal
artery.  Her detailed hospital course is described in the
HPI.  After transfer to medicine service she remained stable
and her hematocrit remained stable as well.
