History of Present Illness:
59 yo white male with metastatic lung cancer, renal transplant
on predisone, h/o CAD s/p CABG, and SVT s/p right
hemi-arthroplasty being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia in
the setting of recurrent atrial tachycardia. He was admitted
[**11-16**] for a right hemi-arthroplasty for an impending
pathological right femoral neck fracture, developed atrial
tachycardia pre-operatively that was unresponsive to esmolol and
amiodarone (it was controlled by dilt-gtt), and he was
,therefore, cardioverted in the OR ([**2112-11-16**]). His amiodarone
dose has been increased (200-->300). He was transferred from the
SICU to the medicine floor [**2112-11-20**]. He has been diuresed since
[**11-19**] for volume overload (20mg iv lasix) with good response.
Last night a trigger was called for pulse 140s-150s, that
responded to IV metoprolol (5mg x2). Tonight another trigger was
called for tachycardia to 150s and hypoxia (sats to 75% on 4l
which he had required since extubation). He was treated with 5
mg metoprolol IV and developed hypotension (sbp to 80s). At the
time of evaluation, he was tachypneic with R 30s up from 20,
pulse down to 80s, and BP 100/58.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23952**] is a 59 yo M w/ h/o metastatic lung cancer, s/p renal
transplant on predisone, h/o CAD s/p CABG, and h/o SVT s/p CV
this admission who was admitted [**11-16**] for right
hemi-arthroplasty following a pathologic fracture. Patient was
transferred to the MICU on the evening of [**2112-11-22**] for
hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Patient was initially
tried on BIPAP but upon return of worsening labs, poor
improvement in oxygenation, and lack of response to lasix,
patient was intubated for aggressive management of presumed
sepsis. Following intubation, patient's sats continued to fall.
Bronchoscopy was performed but minimal secretions were obtained,
all airways were patent, and the ETT was confirmed to be in
appropriate positioning. Following this intervention, patient's
sats improved and repeat ABG w/ PaO2 64->183. However, patient
was requiring high dose levo, neo, and vasopressin to maintain
MAP 60. In addition, course c/b recurrent atrial tachycardia
controlled w/ an esmolol gtt. Lab called re: blood cx positive
for GNR from [**11-21**]. Patient's family arrived at this point and
discussion was initiated re: clarification of code status (per
NF and notes, patient documented to be full code). Wife clearly
and deliberately stated patient wished to be DNR. When asked re:
intubation, wife stated they had not discussed that. Family
informed that Mr. [**Known lastname 23952**] was critically ill and pressor
dependent and requiring high ventilatory support; if support
d/c, patient would likely die. Family requested a moment and
then approached me re: d/c of all support. ICU attending made
aware of family's wishes. Patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
also made aware and reiterated patient's short life expectancy
(likely, months). Wife and sister at the bedside and were
offered continued care to see how things go but that the
decision was ultimately theirs to decide what [**Doctor First Name **] would want.
Wife and sister agreed [**Name (NI) **] would not want continued ICU support
to sustain his life. They requested all care be discontinued.
Pressors and esmolol gtt d/c and ventilator adjusted to provide
23% FiO2 w/o PEEP or PS. Patient expired within 5 minutes.
Family declined an autopsy. PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], and oncologist
emailed. ICU and floor attending notified by page
