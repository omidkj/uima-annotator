Chief Complaint:
Vomiting and abdominal pain/distention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5549**] is a 76 year old male with a history of CHF, HTN
and [**Hospital 5550**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2111-7-28**] with
4 days of worsening abdominal distention and feculent vomiting.
He reportedly had not had a bowel movement or passed gas since
[**2111-7-24**].  While being transported to the hospital, he reportedly
had a low oxygen saturation to 80%.  He denied fever, chills,
SOB, or CP.  In the ED, imaging was concerning for large bowel
volvulus, and the patient was admitted to the CSICU under the
acute care service for episodes of desaturation and further
workup of his abdominal symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
[**2111-7-27**]- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
1. Severe colonic distention with a transition point in distal
sigmoid colon
concerning for colonic obstruction possibly due to a small
segment of
volvulus. No perforation.
2. Severe bladder distention. Foley placement would be
recommended.
3. NG tube above the GE junction and should be further advanced
for optimal positioning.
4. Chronic changes at the right base may be due to aspiration.

[**2111-7-30**]- PATHOLOGY EXAM OF SIGMOID COLON SPECIMEN:
Colonic segment with submucosal edema and vascular congestion;
otherwise within normal limits.
No mucosal ischemic change identified.

[**2111-8-4**]- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
1. Massive pneumoperitoneum. Rectal contrast traverses the
sigmoid
anastomotic sutures without evidence of leak, however, the
sutures demonstrate an abnormal, non-circular configuration.
Scattered foci of air are seen surrounding the anastomotic
sutures as well as throughout the small bowel mesentery and in
the paracolic gutters. In the setting of recent anastomosis,
this is concerning for anastomotic leak
2. Dilation of small bowel up to 3.2 cm. There is no clear
transition point, this likely represents ileus.
3. Right basilar consolidation, slightly worse than on the prior
examination with small right pleural effusion. Given location,
aspiration must be considered.
4. The gastric tube loops in the stomach and terminates near the
gastric
cardia. Recommend repositioning before administering tube feeds
or medication via the NG tube given possibility of aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on
[**2111-7-28**] in the setting of four days of increasing abdominal
distention, abdominal pain and emesis.  KUB obtained in the
emergency dept was highly suspicious for sigmoid volvulus.  GI
consult was obtained by ED and sigmoid was detorsed via
decompression by flexible sigmoidoscopy.  Patient was then
admitted to the SICU for observation as he had desaturated to
the 80s while in the ED.  Patient did well overnight in the SICU
and was deemed fit for transfer to the floor on hospital day#2.
Following detorsion, the surgical team had a frank discussion
with the patient indicating the high likelihood of recurrence
for him given the megacolon demonstrated on KUB.  Understanding
this the patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day
3 ([**7-30**]) for sigmoid colectomy. Patient tolerated the procedure
well and was admitted to the floor (CC6).

Neuro: Prior to surgery on [**7-30**] an epidural was placed with good
effect.  Epidural was removed on [**8-1**].  Following this, the
patient received Morphine IV with good effect and adequate pain
control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.  Following second
procedure [**8-4**] patient was discharged the SICU intubated/sedated.
 As sedation was lightened, he was given intermittent dilaudid
IV and tylenol IV with adequate pain control.  Analgesia
transitioned to po when tolerating oral intake.

Extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to psychiatric medications
were treated with zyprexa with good effect.

CV: On admission to SICU [**7-28**] patient required prn doses of
lopressor/hydralazine for BP control.  These were continued on
the floor postoperatively.  Lasix was initially held then
resumed when patient had achieved adequate fluid balance.
Following second surgery [**8-4**], the patient transiently required
pressors to maintain adequate BP.  Pressors were weaned [**8-5**] and
patient was transferred back to CC6.  Vital signs were routinely
monitored.

RUE swelling noted [**8-10**] prompted U/S RUE [**8-11**] that showed
basilic v thrombosis extending to axillary vein.  RUE PICC
removed with plan to replace on contralateral side at
rehabilitation facility. The patient was started on SC
therapeutic lovenox on [**8-11**], to bridge until therapeutic on
coumadin, with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0.

Pulmonary: Patient was appropriately extubated following surgery
[**7-30**].  Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and early
ambulation were encouraged.  Remained intubated/sedated
initially following procedure [**8-4**].  Successfully extubated [**8-4**]
and transferred to floor [**8-5**].  Patient maintained adequate
pulmonary function following this.  The patient was stable from
a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU: Patient presented as above and was made NPO/IVF/NGT
following surgery [**7-30**].  NGT was self-d/c'd on POD0-1.  Patient
tolerated sips on POD1.  Patient was slow to resume bowel
function and was maintained on sips.  On POD5 patient complained
of significant abdominal distention/pain.  CT scan showed
copious intra-abdominal free air and patient was taken back to
operating room for exploratory laparotomy [**8-4**].  Small pinhole
leak at anastomosis was taken down and Hartmann's procedure was
performed.  Postoperatively, patient had ileus and colostomy was
cannulated with a red rubber catheter to aid in decompression.
KUB's obtained were consistent with ileus.  Given failure to
resume bowel function, TPN was started [**8-8**].  Bowel function
then returned and patient then tolerated clears [**8-9**].  Diet was
advanced to regular [**8-10**] and TPN was discontinued at this time.
He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel
movement.

Foley was removed on POD#3 with removal of epidural and patient
failed trial of void.  Foley
