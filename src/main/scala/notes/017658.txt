Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67 F transferred to ICU from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with gallstone
pancreatitis complicated by acute renal failure and respiratory
failure requiring intubation. Patient was initially admitted on
[**10-9**] for abdominal pain w/ CT showing gallstones, dilated CBD
and pancreatic ducts, pancreatitis, probable common duct stone,
and small-mod ascites. Admitted and started on Zosyn. On
arrrival, labs were WBC 19K, AP 120, AST 223, ALT 142, Tbili
1.9, amylase 993, and lipase 2200. She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-9**]. During the procedure, the ampulla was
found to be edematous and boggy, preventing a sphincterotomy and
a 10F 7 cm plastic stent was placed; mild sludge was seen with
bile flow into the duodenum. After the procedure, patient
returned to [**Hospital3 26615**]. Labs after procedure: Tbili 3.1, AST
89, ALT 155, [**Doctor First Name **] 1120, Lip 1375, WBC 26k (60 segs, 34 bands).
Hypocalcemic to 6.4. On [**10-10**], patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress w/ CXR showing bilateral pleural effusions
L>R, but did not require intubation. On [**10-11**] labs continued to
trend down: Tbili 2.4, [**Doctor First Name **] 604, and Lip 492. Patient received
PICC for TPN but unclear if TPN administered. Urine output
continued to decrease and creatinine continued to increase:
BUN/Cr 54/2.1 on [**10-12**] and 69/3.0 on [**10-13**]. Urine output did not
respond to diuretics and diagnosed with ARF w/ possible ATN.
During stay, patient received a significant fluid volume:
admission weight was 79 kg and transfer note describes 40 kg
weight gain. The morning of [**10-14**] patient was in worse
respiratory distress with a pCO2 of 65 and was consequently
intubated. CXR showed slight increase in R-sided pleural
effusion. Patient was transferred in the afternoon due to need
to greater acuity of care and consideration of surgical options.

ON DISCHARGE:


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the TSICU on [**2188-10-14**] for treatment
of acute gallstone pancreatitis complicated by respiratory and
renal failure. She was transferred to the floor on [**2188-10-27**] and
recovered well during the remainder of her stay. Her hospital
course is described by system below.

Neuro: Patient's sedation was weaned in ICU, although patient's
mental status was slow to improve with minial responsiveness
until HD4 when she began to follow commands. After transfer to
floor, patient's mental status improved dramatically with
ability to follow commands and communicate appropriately. She
was oriented x3 for most of the time, but had episodes of
dilirium that gradually decreased in frequency. Her pain was
well controlled with IV dilaudid initially and later with
tylenol and po oxycodone.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Patient was
hemodynamically stable throughout ultafiltration and dialysis.

Pulmonary: The patient's asthma was managed with albuterol
inhalers with Duonebs for persistent wheezing.

GI: Pancreatitis steadily resolved throughout hospitalization as
evidenced by decrease in amylase/lipase, improvement in pain,
and increased po tolerance. Patient was treated with tube feeds
through NG tube while in ICU and later with TPN on the floor
while abdominal pain resolved. NG tube was removed on [**2188-10-25**]
after patient began to pass flatus. She underwent a
speech/swallow study on [**2188-10-29**] after improvement in mental
status and was able to tolerate liquids and solids without
evidence of aspiration. She was started on clear liquids on [**10-30**]
which she tolerated well but was reverted back to sips because
of abdominal pain. Diet was kept at sips. Patient will
ultimately need a cholecystectomy, however given acute medical
issues currently, will reasses in [**1-30**] weeks and determine
optimal surgical time.

GU: Patient was transferred in acute renal failure, essentially
anuric and grossly fluid overload with anasarca. Lasix diuresis
was attempted, however patient did not respond. CVVH was started
on [**2188-10-16**] with 3L extracted daily. Intermittent HD was started
on [**2188-10-19**] for continued ultrafiltration and treatment of
hyperkalemia. Renal team was consulted throughout this period
and recommendations for treatment of likely ATN were followed
daily. By [**2188-10-29**], patient's Cr, K, and phos began to normalize
and patient started making urine. Her renal funtion improved
gradually,no longer requiring dialysis. Her foley was d/ced on
[**2188-11-12**].She was able to void witout any difficulty.

ID: On arrival, patient was afebrile with negative blood
cultures and no evidence of infected fluid collections on CT
scan. However, WBC count continued to rise daily and peaked at
36.2. Although patient was not having diarrhea, Cdiff was sent
and found to be positive. Patient was started on po vanc via NG
tube while in ICU with improvement in CBC. When NG tube was
dced, patient was switched to IV flagyl. After transfer to
floor, patient's WBC began to rise again although she remained
afebrile. U/A was positive and empiric cipro was started. Urine
culture grew [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro and patient completed 3 day
course of treatment. IV flagyl was changed to po vanc on [**2188-10-28**]
after patient passed speech/swallow study.Her antibiotics were
discontinued on [**2188-10-12**].

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

On the day of discharge the patient was on TPN,sips, needed help
with ambulation,voiding spontaneously and the pain was well
controlled.
