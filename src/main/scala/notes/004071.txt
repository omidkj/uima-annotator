.
CXray [**2181-5-6**]
- New airspace opacities in left mid and both lower lungs, which
may be due to asymmetrical edema or aspiration pneumonia.
- Diffuse irregular interstitial opacities consistent with
patient's history of fibrosis.
- Multiple calcific densities projecting over the right upper
quadrant likely gallstones.
.
Abd USG [**2181-5-6**]
- findings consistent with chronic liver disease
- no evidence of ascites
- portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.
- Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
.
ECHO [**2181-5-7**]
- EF 55%
- left atrium is dilated
- mild symmetric LVH Right ventricular chamber
- mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2)
- Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
- Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
- Mod pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
- no pericardial effusion

Endoscopy:
Erythema and mosaic appearance in the stomach body and fundus
compatible with portal gastropathy
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of
the esophagus
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of
the esophagus
Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with
esophagitis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o M with pmhx of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, CHF p/w
altered MS and found to have hepatic encephalopathy
.
# Chronic liver disease: The etiology for his liver disease is
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] does drink alcohol but not excessively per patient
and family report. Hepatitis serologies, hemachromatosis, A1AT,
and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent and unremarkable. EGD revealed large varices,
and he was started on nadolol and [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

# Altered Mental Status: This was felt to be secondary to
hepatic encephalopathy as well as a UTI. His mental status
improved with lactulose and levaquin for UTI. It remained
unclear what precipitated the hepatic encephalopathy, but may be
infection. Patient remained afebrile, but with mild
leukocytosis. Ultrasound revealed no ascites and thus no SBP. He
continued lactulose, MVI, thiamine, folate.

# Infectious: Patient noted to have urinary tract infection and
possible radiographic evidence of PNA (although no cough,
fever). He was started on levaquin on [**2181-5-6**]. He should continue
for total of 14 day course.

# Anemia: Patient noted to have macrocytic anemia felt likely
from liver disease. B12 and folate were high.  Although
haptoglobin low and LDH high and fibrinogen 100, he was not felt
to to be in DIC because no schistocytes on smear and he was
hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit. Low haptoglobin
was attributed to cirrhosis. He did have guaiac positive stools
and will need outpatient GI follow-up.  EGD revealed ulcerations
and Barrett's, and he was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

# Thrombocytopenia: Baseline in [**2171**] was 150's. Now lower
possibly due to splenic sequestration. No evidence to suggest
TTP/HUS.

# Mild Coagulopathy: Felt likely from chronic liver failure.

# HTN: Patient was found hypertensive on admission with elevated
BP during MICU stay.  He was initially on lopressor, but then
switched to nadolol given varices.

# Aspiration: NGT placed in MICU for possible aspiration and
inability to swallow [**2-2**] delirium. Speech and swallow eval
cleared him for ground solids. He will need further speech and
swallow therapy at rehab.
