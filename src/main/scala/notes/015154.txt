Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
supratherapeutic INR, rigors, delirium

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**4-16**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old man with h/o CAD s/p MI [**2095**], Afib
on Coumadin, CMP EF 45%, s/p AAA repair, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass,
cognitive impairment, HTN, HLD, biliary obstruction s/p biliary
stent placement and revision in [**2126**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with supratherapeutic INR, rigors, and confusion.

The patient was seen in [**Hospital 197**] clinic and noted to have a
supratherapeutic INR to 7. Also noted to have altered mental
status and rigors, so was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED. Wife
has noted increased confusion from baseline (typically mild
cognitive impairment and confusion when he moves from [**State 108**] to
[**State 350**]) x 1 week.

At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was admitted to the ICU for further
workup of AMS, rigors, and low grade fevers (100.8). Initial
concern for UTI given recent instrumentation of the bladder
(bladder tear s/p repair in [**State 108**] recently) and dirty UA, but
UCx was negative. Patient noted to have elevated AP, as well as
biliary sludge on Abd U/S and ?obstruction on CT abdomen,
concerning for cholangitis, started on Zosyn for empiric
coverage. Patient had a biliary stent placed in the past for
obstruction that migrated and was replaced in [**1-3**]. According
to records, this was supposed to be removed in [**5-3**], but that
was not done. ERCP team at [**Hospital1 18**] was notified and will evaluate
his stent further.

Hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was complicated by hypotension
(SBP 90s), for which the patient was given some gentle IVF with
improvement of pressures. He developed flash pulmonary edema and
responded well to Lasix 20mg IV x1. Patient was also
delirious/agitated, given Ativan and Haldol prn.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: T 97.4 P 96 BP 145/84 RR
33 O2sat 96%. Patient is confused, but denies pain, SOB, or any
other complaints.

STUDIES:
[**2128-4-16**] ERCP:
- A  previously placed metal stent in the biliary duct that
migrated distally was found in the major papilla.
- Given the malposition of the stent decision was made to remove
the stent using a snare.
- Pus, sludge, and debris was seen coming out of the bile duct
after stent removal.
- Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
- Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial
opacification.
- Further contrast injection was not done given cholangitis.
- There were possible filling defects suggestive of sludge and
debris in the bile duct.  However, this could not be fully
delineated given limited contrast injection.
- A previously placed plastic stent was noted that had migrated
well into the right hepatic duct/bilary tree - removal was not
attempted given concurrent cholangitis.
- A 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed
successfully for decompression with the proximal end terminating
in the left hepatic duct. Good bile flow was seen after stent
deployment.
- Repeat ERCP in 4 weeks to attempt removal of previously placed
migrated stent from the right hepatic system and repeat biliary
evaluation.
.
[**2128-4-20**] CT head
Technically limited study.  No acute hemorrhage or mass effect
.
[**2128-4-20**] CT abdomen pelvis
1.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.

2.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly with aortic and mitral valve,
coronary
artery calcifications, and calcification along the inferior
myocardial wall of the left ventricle.

3.  Pneumobilia with double pigtail biliary stent with one end
of the stent
appearing to open within the duodenum and the other appears to
end in the
common bile duct.

4.  Dilated pancreatic duct up to the ampulla with ill-defined
soft tissue
around the pancreatic head, unclear if this is secondary to
technique or due to recent procedure; however, recommend
dedicated imaging to rule out presence of pancreatic mass such
as multiphasic MR if the patient is able to optimally
breath-hold versus consideration of dedicated multiphasic CT.

5.  Aortobifemoral stent with occlusion of the native aorta and
common iliac arteries.

6.  Area of infarct along the upper pole of the right kidney.
.
CXR [**2128-4-20**]
1. Worsening vascular congestion, with possible mild edema.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion with right basal atelectasis.
