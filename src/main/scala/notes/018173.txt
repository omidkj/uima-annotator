Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion, dark tarry stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. EGD with hemoclip placement
2. Angiography with coiling to the gastroduodenal artery
3. Repeat EGD to evaluate clips


History of Present Illness:
63-year-old gentleman with history of diastolic CHF, chronic
kidney disease stage III, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
history of upper GIB from AV malformation in [**2192**] who presented
to the ED on evening of admission with shortness of breath for
one week. He noticed difficulty breathing when walking up to 40
feet with oxygen set at 2 liters for the last 4-5 days. He was
also complaining of some "chest tightness." He had called his
primary care physician earlier on day of admission who told him
to come to the emergency room for evaluation.

In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 96.8, HR 77, BP
122/59, RR 20, satting 96%RA. A chest x-ray showed question of
pulmonary edema, per report, and patient was given 40 mg of
intravenous furosemide prior to labs being drawn. Labs then came
back showing a hematocrit of 16.5 down from recent baseline in
the mid 30s. White count was stable at 6.3 and platelets were
276. INR was 1.1, and PTT was slightly elevated at 38.0. Notably
the BNP was 1243, which was down from 5088 one month ago.
Patient was then given 1L of normal saline. Rectal exam showed
guiaic positive brown stool, per report. 2 peripheral IVs were
placed, GI was consulted and an NGT lavage performed which was
reportedly negative. GI saw the patient and plans for upper
endoscopy and colonoscopy tomorrow, as they are uncertain where
the bleeding is coming from. Patient was typed and crossed for
four units PRBCs prior to transfer. Current vital signs are BP
103/45, HR 80s (patient takes carvedilol as outpatient).

Of note, patient was recently admitted to the hospital [**Date range (1) 74897**]
for shortness of breath requiring intubation. He was treated for
congestive heart failure and pneumonia with vancomycin and
levofloxacin, ultimately completing a seven-day course of the
latter. Addtionally, he was started on CPAP to treat suspected
obstructive sleep apnea. He was discharged with home oxygen due
to desaturations to 85% on ambulation.

ROS: No cough, fever, chills, or pedal edema. Appetite normal.
Patient currently without chest pain, shortness of breath (at
rest), leg swelling, palpitations, lightheadedness, or
dizziness.

duodenal bulb. However, there is no visible vessel or ulcer
seen. (injection, endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

coils.
5. Post-coil deployment angiogram reveals markedly reduced flow
through the GDA and is expected to completely occlude with time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 99999**] is a 63 year old man admitted for dyspnea and found
to have a Hct of 15.4. He is known to have acquired [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] syndrome factor VIII deficiency) attributed to his
underlying MGUS.

1. Acute upper GI bleeding.  Presented with dyspnea and found to
have HCT of 15.4 in setting of guaiac positive stools and known
bleeding disorder (VWD).  He underwent EGD which showed bleeding
at the duodenal bulb with hemoclip placement.  Post-procedure
his HCT continued to trend slowly down so he underwent
angiography with coiling of gastroduodenal artery on [**1-13**].
Before each of these two procedures he recieved Humate-P
infusions, under the guidance of hematology and the blood bank.
He did not appear to respond to these treatments. A repeat EGD
was performed on [**1-19**] which did not show persistent bleeding.
An impacted clip was seen, and surgical and GI consultants felt
that this could be observed unless bleeding recurred. His
hematocrit was subsequently stable, and at the time of discharge
he was having one dark brown to black stool a day. He was sent
home on pantoprazole 40mg PO BID with instructions to continue a
low-residue diet for two weeks. He will follow-up with
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI at the beginning of [**Month (only) 958**].

2. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) 100000**]'s Disease.  In addition to giving Humate-P
infusions, the Hematology service further recommended checking
vWF levels and ristocetin cofactor assay levels.  IVIG was
initiated in addition to the factor VIII, given persistent
bleeding and lack of hemostasis at the GI site. The factor VIII
levels increased following this treatment, administered with the
assistance of the hematology consult team. He will follow-up
with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**1-30**].

3. Acute renal failure.  Creatinine was variable during
admission with ACEI and furosemide held at times given blood
loss and use of contrast for angiography.  His serum creatinine
also remained stable after the IVIG infusions. His Lisinopril
was resumed at his home dose on the day of discharge, and his
Lasix was resumed at half his home dose. He will have his
electrolytes checked on Saturday, [**1-24**], with results sent
to Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 11616**].
