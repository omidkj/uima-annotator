Allergies:
Oxycontin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, GI bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old man with a history of colon cancer
metastatic to lung, liver, abdominal wall, and ureter who
presents with N/V, hypotension.  History is obtained from the
patient's daughter and from the medical record.  According to
the daughter, the patient had been having N/V for several days
and she was worried that he was becoming dehydrated.  Apparently
today he was less alert and had decreased urine output.  His BP
at home was 70/40 and he appeared to be having trouble
breathing.  He was also having trouble swallowing his pills, due
to being more somnolent.
.
In the ED, VS: 99.9, HR 130s, SBP 60s, O2sat not initially
recorded, but per ED resident 70s-80s. He was reportedly
unresponsive at that time.  R groin cordis was placed emergently
due to inability to obtain BP.  Patient was intubated due to
concern that he was aspirating on bloody emesis.  OGT placed,
immediately post intubation, draining 2500cc dark red blood,
which did not clear with lavage.  Rectal revealed guaiac + brown
stool.  He was started on IVF (5L NS) and levophed and dopamine.
 L IJ was later placed for additional access.  He was transfused
3U PRBC and 2U FFP.  He was also given vitamin K and protamine
(to reverse lovenox), as well as protonix IV.  He was given
vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
.
His abdomen was noted to be rigid (in the setting of known
extensive mets and GI bleed), so he underwent CT abdomen/pelvis
(in addition to CTA chest).  He was then transferred to the MICU
for further management.  GI was also made aware of the patient.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONC HISTORY: The patient initially presented in [**2125**] for
evaluation of mild hematuria when a CT abd showed thickening of
the sigmoid colon. A sigmoidoscopy showed a large non-bleeding
mass and he underwent sigmoid colectomy which showed moderately
differentiated ulcerated adenocarcinoma reaching the serosa with
[**5-18**] lymph nodes were positive for metastasis. Since his initial
presentation of stage III colon CA, he has progressed to
metastatic disease to the lung, liver, abd wall, ureter.
1.  He is status post 5-FU, leucovorin as adjuvant therapy.
2.  He is status post 5-FU, irinotecan, and Avastin with disease
progression.
3.  Status post oxaliplatin and Xeloda.
4.  He is status post Erbitux and irinotecan.
5.  He is status post Avastin, 5-FU, and mitomycin.  He has not
received therapy in several months.  He has progressed on all
these therapies.
6.  He developed a PE in [**9-17**] and is being anticoagulated with
Lovenox daily.
7.  He was recently placed on a phase 1 Reata clinical trial,
which has since been held due to progression of disease.
.

illicits, IVDA.

No family h/o colon CA. Aunt with rectal CA at the age of 85.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.9, HR 102, BP 127/76, RR 18, O2sat 100%
Vent: AC 600/18, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%
Gen: intubated, sedated, chronically ill appearing
HEENT: PERRL, ETT and OGT in place
Lungs: CTA anteriorly
Heart: RRR, no m/r/g
Abd: +BS, firm palpable masses in epigastric and suprapubic
areas.  Otherwise nondistended.
Rectal: guaiac + brown stool per ED
Extrem: No edema, warm.

reports:
ct pelvis [**4-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip is located at the carina.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation may reflect pneumonia.
3. No pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
4. Extensive metastatic disease has progressed compared to
[**2131-1-12**], with increased hepatic and pulmonary metastases
as well as increased right pleural disease. Abdominal wall
disease appears similar.
5. Unchanged right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with multiple
nodules in the right ureter suggestive of tumor.
.
[**4-4**] cxr:
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in appropriate
positions.
2. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
3. Multiple pulmonary nodules which were better assessed on a CT
chest from [**2131-1-12**].
4. Worsening retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity could be
consolidative in nature.
.
echo [**4-5**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis, without regional wall motion
abnormalities. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction and evidence of
pressure/volume overload. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Liver US [**4-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No cholelithiasis. Normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance to
gallbladder. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.
2) Multiple unchanged liver metastases. Unchanged right
hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
65M with metastatic colon cancer admitted with hypotension, GI
bleed, pneumonia, and NSTEMI. Hospital Course described below by
problems:
.
1. Hypotension: Felt to be primarily secondary to sepsis.
Possible septic sources included UTI and LLL pneumonia (seen on
chest CT).  Blood cultures and BAL came back positive for
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].  GI bleed was felt to be a less likely
etiology as his Hct was stable.   Possible aspiration event
prior to intubation.  There may have also been a component of
cardiogenic shock given biventricular dysfunction on TTE.  He
had no PE on CTA.  He received aggressive IVF and blood products
without improvement in his blood pressure.  He was started on
norepinephrine and vasopressin.  ID was consulted for fungemia,
and he was treated with caspofungin.  He was also maintained on
broad spectrum antibiotics.  Bronchoscopy [**4-5**] ruled out
endobronchial obstruction.  His antimicrobials and pressors were
discontinued when he was made CMO.
.
2. GI bleed: Possible upper GI bleed given + NGL in ED.  Could
be related to metastatic disease vs. PUD, etc.  GI aware.  EGD
was deferred as hematocrit was stable and GI bleed was felt
unlikely to be the primary issue.  His Lovenox was held.  He
received vitamin K and FFP to correct coagulopathy.  His
hematocrit remained stable.  He was maintained IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], which
was discontinued when he was made CMO.
.
3.  Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated due to concern for
mental status, aspiration.  Also has pneumonia, underlying
pulmonary mets.  The patient was to be continued on ventilation
until his mental status and sepsis resolved, though the patient
was extubated on [**4-9**] after being made CMO.
.
4. ARF: Creatinine improved to 2.9 from 4.2, baseline 1.1-1.3.
Most likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration +/- ATN due to
hypotension.  He also received IV contrast for CTA, so might
expect renal function to worsen further despite aggressive
hydration he has received so far.  CT showed
