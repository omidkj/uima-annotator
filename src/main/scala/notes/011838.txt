LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell 10.3, hemoglobin
10.2, hematocrit 29.3, platelets 310,000, PT 12.8, PTT 26.5,
INR 1.1, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 101, bicarb 27,
BUN 26, creatinine 1.2, glucose 199.  Urinalysis was positive
for nitrite, 0 to 2 red blood cells, no white blood cells,
rare bacteria, no yeast, no epithelial cells.  Chest x-ray
showed no acute pulmonary disease.  Electrocardiogram showed
a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 77.  First degree left
ventricular block.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.  Inferior
infarct, age undetermined.  Echocardiogram from [**2127-3-3**]
showed an ejection fraction of 60 percent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Podiatry
Service Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His wound was excisionally debrided at
the bed side.  Cultures were sent.  The patient was started
on intravenous Oxacillin.  Cultures grew MRSA.  Oxacillin was
stopped.  Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl were ordered.
A VAC dressing was placed over the wound.

Vascular Surgery was consulted.  PVR of the right metatarsal
showed a 9 mm deflection.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room by Podiatry for excisional debridement of the
right first MTP joint on [**2127-5-16**].  The VAC dressing was
continued.

The [**Last Name (un) **] Consult Service was asked to manage the patient's
diabetes.  They made adjustments to his insulin dose.

Cardiology was consulted for preoperative clearance.  They
reviewed his echocardiogram from [**Month (only) 958**]  [**2127**], which showed an
ejection fraction of 60 percent.  His cardiac catheterization
in [**2126-8-2**] showed patent graft.  The patient had a
troponin leak of 2.2 during admission in [**2127-3-3**] with
urosepsis, hypertension and renal insufficiency.  However,
cardiology felt that the patient either had a very small non
ST elevation myocardial infarction versus troponin leak
secondary to renal insufficiency during urosepsis.  They felt
no further tests were necessary and cleared the patient for
bypass graft.

On [**2127-5-20**] the patient had a right lower extremity
angiogram in the cardiac catheterization laboratory by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  This study showed an occluded anterior
tibial and posterior tibial arteries with peroneal
collaterals.  Vein mapping was done.

On [**2127-5-23**] the patient underwent a right superficial artery
to dorsalis pedis in situ saphenous vein graft.  At the end
of surgery the patient had a warm right foot with a palpable
graft pulse.  Postoperatively, the patient had a five beat
run of ventricular tachycardia, which was asymptomatic.
Cardiology evaluated the patient.  He ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes.  Postoperatively, the
patient's creatinine peaked at 2.0.  It slowly was decreasing
at the time of dictation was 1.5.  His creatinine in [**2127-3-3**] was 1.0.  The patient was diuresed slowly with Lasix
keeping his chronic renal insufficiency in mind.

On hospital day five the patient was noted to have a
hematocrit of 24.7.  He was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells. Postoperatively, the patient ;received one unit
of packed red blood cells and again on postoperative day
number five.  The patient had a history of anemia, but no
known workup.

On [**2127-5-28**] the patient underwent a debridement of his right
foot of his first MPJ resection and rotational flap by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], Podiatry.  The patient will remain nonweight bearing
times one month.  He will have a bivalve short leg cast
placed.  His right leg will remain elevated as much as
possible.  At the time of discharge his Vancomycin will be
stopped and he will continue on two weeks of Linezolid 600 mg
po b.i.d.  He will follow up with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] in
approximately seven to ten days after discharge.

At the time of dictation the patient's right leg incision is
clean, dry and intact.  He has staples along his thigh
incisions and sutures from the knee down to the foot.  His
foot is warm and he has a palpable graft pulse.  His foot is
warm with intact sutures along the medial and plantar
surface.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Linezolid 600 mg po b.i.d. times two weeks.
