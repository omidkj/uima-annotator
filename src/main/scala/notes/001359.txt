Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS, Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous abdominal drainage


History of Present Illness:
53M quadraplegic s/p MVA in [**2180**], chronically vent
dependent through trach, neurogenic bladder, SVC filter on
coumadin, and pacemaker for episodes of bradycardia/asystole who
presents after a recent hospitalization for sepsis with
lethargy, a fever, and inability to speak or eat. He was
discharged from the hospital on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**10-5**] and was
near his baseline at home over the weekend. On the day of
admission his wife noted that he was agitated, speaking in
nonsense words, was febrile and speaking in nonsense words. He
was reportedly swearing at the VNAs, which is uncharacteristic
for him. He endorses ongoing abdominal pain which predates his
previous admission, loose stools since a bowel prep was
attempted during his previous admission, and nausea. His blood
glucose was elevated in the 200s today. He did not have any
changes in his secretions and no blood in his secretions. Loss
of appetite today whereas he usually eats a regular diet.

On [**9-14**] the patient presented to an OSH with a fever x 2 days.
Work up
there demonstrated vent associated pneumonia and mucus plug of L
lung, and transaminitis. He was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics. During his hospitalization at the OSH, the patient
had a CT abdomen demonstrating colonic thickening at the hepatic
flexure. He required 4 units of blood (circumstances unclear
from
the OSH documentation).The patient had continued fevers and
leukocytosis despite antibiotics so the family requested
transfer patient care to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-19**].

During his work-up for leukocytosis here, the patient was found
to have a fluid collection in the RUQ. An IR placed drain
produced bilious fluid. Drain was removed prior to discharge.
Also during this admission he was found to have a partially
collapsed left lung likely secondary to mucous plugging.
Multiple bronchoscopies were done to relieve the obstruction
without clinical benefit. He was also noted to have seizure
activie in the setting of missing several doses of his baclofen
and he was started on keppra. A colonoscopy was scheduled for
[**11-13**] in follow up of the hepatic flexure inflammation.

In the ED, initial VS were: Tmax 102.9 HR 86 BP 140/80 RR 18. He
received Morphine 5 mg, ondansetron 4mg ODT, Acetaminophen 650
mg. Attempts were made at bilateral femoral lines and may have
gotten artery on the left. Pressure was held for 15-20 minutes.
Was hemodynamically stable in the ED. CXR is unchanged and UA
does not show evidence of infection. In ED was more alert and
able to converse and answer questions.

On arrival to the MICU, he is alert and appropriately responsive
to questions. Wife is with the patient and provided much of the
history above.

CT Abd [**10-11**]
1.Interval development of air-fluid level in the previously seen

extraluminal pericolonic fluid collection near the hepatic
flexure of the
colon. New pneumobilia and moderate amount of air within the
gallbladder and common hepatic/common bile duct.  Suspect
fistulous communication with an adjacent hollow viscus, either
enteric or colonnic, with exact location
unknown. If there is no recent history of intervention within
the biliary
system.  Additional small pockets of air extend above and below
this hepatic flexure colonic air-fluid collection.
2.No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
3.Incompletely characterized hypodense lesions in the left mid
kidney.
Probably benign adrenal adenoma.

HIDA scan [**10-15**]
IMPRESSION: Normal hepatobiliary scan. No choledocho-colonic
fistula was
detected during the course of the scan.

CT Scan [**10-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Significantly improved extraluminal air and fluid in the
right paracolic gutter region with pigtail catheter in place.
However, there is a questionable small amount of rounded fluid
collection abutting or within the right ascending colon which
may represent a short segment loop of bowel versus a residual
loculated fluid collection.  Recommend CT sinogram before
catheter removal to ensure absent communication with hollow
viscus.
2.  Resolution of pneumobilia and air in the gallbladder with
mild amount of debris within the gallbladder.
3.  Improved but persistent r
