Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-11-13**]: Right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21006**] is a 53 yo Hispanic/Latino gentleman, with a PMH
significant for non-ischemic CMP (diagnosed [**11/2124**], [**2-28**] severe
flu-like syndrome) last EF 25% in [**12/2124**], HTN, HLD, t2DM, and
obesity. He presents to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on [**2125-11-13**] as a direct
admission from outpatient cardiologist, who noted a Cr of 4.0,
up from 2.9 recently (baseline is ~2.5), and recommended a
right/left heart catheterization w/ possible milrinone drip.
.
On interview, pt endorses recent worsening of PND, fatigue, and
loss of sex drive x 1 week, as well as decreased PO intake x 2
weeks. In addition, he reports mild, non-productive cough.
Otherwise, he denies recent illnesses, fevers, chills or rigors.

.
On review of systems, he specifically denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. He denies SOB, chest pain, palpitations,
increased weight, increased swelling in legs. He describes
urination as normal in amount, color, and smell recently, with
no associated dysuria or incontinence. All other review of
systems are negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
At baseline, he is a chef, is up and about in the kitchen, and
bikes up to 5 miles daily (CHF NYHA class 1 in [**2125-8-27**]).
.
Of note, he is on Torsemide 100mg at home, which was decreased
from 160mg daily recently (over the summer), [**2-28**] worsening
creatinine.

1. Hemodynamic measurements demonstrate the presence of severe
pulmonary artery hypertension and elevate pulmonary vascular
resistance. There was elevation of the wedge pressure consistent
with left ventricular failure. Right heart filling pressures
were moderately elevated consistent wiht right ventricular
failure
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
2. Severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
.
Renal U/S w/ doppler to eval RAS, [**2125-11-14**]:
- Normal appearance to bilateral kidneys without evidence for
renal artery stenosis, stones, masses or hydronephrosis.
- Normal diastolic flow bilaterally
- Normal bladder
.
TTE [**2125-11-14**]:
- LA ?????? dilated
- LV ?????? mild, symmetric hypertrophy; mildly dilated ventricular
cavity (smaller than prior study in [**12/2124**]); unable to exclude
focal wall motion abnormality; mildly depressed systolic
function (LVEF= 50-55 %), though improved from prior study
(LVEF= 25% to 30%)
- Septum - no ventricular septal defect
- RV - chamber size and free wall motion are normal
- Aortic Valve - aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened; no
aortic valve stenosis
- Mitral Valve - mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened; no
mitral valve prolapse; trivial mitral regurgitation
- Other: very small pericardial effusion.
.
[**2125-11-15**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Frontal view of the chest was
obtained. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates over the right
ventricular outflow tract. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
unchanged. Mediastinal, hilar, and pulmonary vessels are mildly
congested with mild pulmonary edema, new since [**2125-1-24**]. Left lower lobe appears similar to [**2125-1-24**]
radiograph with retrocardiac opacity compatible with left lower
lobe pneumonia and probable left pleural effusion that is
moderate and unchanged. No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Left lower
lobe probable pneumonia with probable
