[**2139-2-17**] EGD:
"Indications: Iron deficiency anemia, OB positive stools

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. The
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an
endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under
direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was
reached. Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was
performed. The procedure was not difficult. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
 Protruding Lesions A sub-mucosal 3cm lesion was found at the
middle third of the esophagus at 22 cms from incisors. The scope
traversed the lesion.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other procedures: Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the second part of the duodenum.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia.
Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum.
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results
Avoid NSAIDs. "

Colonoscopy [**2139-2-17**]:
"Findings:
 Flat Lesions A single medium angioectasia was seen in the
proximal ascending colon. Three 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
injections were applied for hemostasis with success. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully. A single
small angioectasia was seen in the descending colon. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
 Protruding Lesions A single sessile 3 mm non-bleeding polyp of
benign appearance was found in the cecum. A piece-meal
polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps. The polyp was
completely removed. A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of
benign appearance was found in the proximal ascending colon. A
single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare. The
polyp was completely removed. A single sessile 4 mm polyp of
benign appearance was found in the sigmoid colon. A single-piece
polypectomy was performed using a hot snare. The polyp was
completely removed. Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were
noted.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with mixed
openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Impression: Polyp in the cecum (polypectomy).
Polyp in the proximal ascending colon (polypectomy).
Polyp in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy).
Angioectasia in the proximal ascending colon (injection, thermal
therapy).
Angioectasia in the descending colon (thermal therapy).

Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to
cecum.
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results
Serial Hct, transfuse as needed.
F/U colonoscopy to be determined based on polyp biopsy results.
If polyps are adenomatous, all family members over the age of 40
should undergo screening colonoscopy."
.
.
Repeat EGD [**2139-2-24**]:
"Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Flat Lesions A few small angioectasias that were not bleeding
were seen in the stomach body. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied
for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in
the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
 Flat Lesions A single small angioectasia that was not bleeding
was seen in the second part of the duodenum.
Impression: Angioectasias in the stomach body (thermal therapy)
and in the second part of the duodenum. Source of recent
bleeding is likely due to angioectasias of upper GI tract.

Recommendations: Plan for push enteroscopy tomorrow in GI unit.
Serial Hct's.
Advance diet as tolerated. Please keep pt NPO after midnight.
Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire
procedure."

Push Enteroscopy [**2139-2-24**]:
"Findings: Esophagus:
 Protruding Lesions The previously visualized submucosal nodule
was seen in the middle third of the esophagus.
Stomach:
 Other Two superficial, nonbleeding ulcers secondary to recent
coaptive cauterization were visualized in the gastric body.
Duodenum/Jejunum: Normal duodenum and jejunum.
Impression: 1. No new vascular ectasia or source of bleeding was
visualized.
2. Two superficial, nonbleeding ulcers secondary to recent
coaptive cauterization were visualized in the gastric body.
3. Previously visualized dodule in the middle third of the
esophagus.
4. Otherwise normal push enteroscopy to mid-jejunum.
Recommendations: Advan
