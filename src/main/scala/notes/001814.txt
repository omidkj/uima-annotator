CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a  53-year-old male with
a history of nephrolithiasis and known diverticulitis here
for followup who presented back pain and shortness of breath.

The patient was in his usual state of health until
approximately 10 days prior to admission when he started
passing 100 cc to 200 cc of bright red blood per rectum at
home without any abdominal pain.  He had several episodes of
near syncopal events at home and called 911.  He was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 3583**].

The patient had several episodes of further bright red blood
per rectum; however, his diet was advanced, and no further
episodes of bleeding were noticed until 10:00 p.m.  Again,
the patient had a near syncopal episode in the bathroom with
the passage of painless bright red blood per rectum and was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The patient
was observed at [**Hospital3 3583**] over the next several days.
No endoscopy or colonoscopy was performed, and the patient
was discharged home on [**2103-4-16**].  Per the patient, his
hematocrit on discharge was 34.6.

On [**2103-4-17**] the patient with sporadic episodes of right-
sided low back pain associated with shortness of breath.  The
patient presented to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**] with back pain and shortness of
breath with oxygen saturations of 75 percent on room air.  A
computed tomography scan was performed showing multiple
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  At that time, the patient denied
any further episodes of bleeding since discharge from [**Hospital3 6265**].

Rectal examination in the Emergency Department showed dark
brown/guaiac positive stool.  The patient denies any history
of black tarry stool, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, or chest
pain.  His hematocrit in the Emergency Department was 33.5.
The patient was started on a heparin drip and transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diverticulosis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed in [**2103-4-16**].
3. History of nephrolithiasis.

Hm ah.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aspirin 81 mg (however recently
discontinued).

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.  No
history of colon cancer.  No history of inflammatory bowel
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
his temperature was 98.1, his blood pressure was 163/93, his
heart rate was 100, and his oxygen saturation was  98 percent
on 100 percent nonrebreather.  Generally, obese.  Talking in
full sentences.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  There were no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were normal bowel sounds.  Extremity
examination revealed right ankle with chronic venous stasis
changes.  No lower extremity asymmetry.  No calf tenderness.
No Homans' sign.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 16.1, his hematocrit was 33.5, and platelets
were 294.  Chemistries were within normal limits.  D-dimer
was 4919.  Prothrombin time was 13.  INR was 1.1.  Creatine
kinase was 45.  Troponin was less than 0.01.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed
sinus tachycardia at 125 beats per minute; otherwise, no
acute changes.

A chest x-ray showed a rounded opacity overlying the third
posterior rib; likely calculous, prominent right hilum.  No
evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.

A computed tomography angiogram showed areas of tachy
consolidation involving both lower lobes.  Impression was
consistent with bilateral pulmonary emboli.

IMPRESSION:  A 52-year-old male with recent hospitalization
for diverticulosis/gastrointestinal bleed now here with
subsequent pulmonary emboli secondary to immobilization.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES-SYSTEMS:
1. PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  The patient was continued on a
   heparin drip, and ultimately Coumadin therapy was
   initiated.  Oxygen saturations improved upon initiation of
   heparin therapy.  Pulmonary emboli thought to be secondary
   to immobilization during outside hospital course.  The
   patient had a 7-day stay at the outside hospital without
   any deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and subsequently
   presented with shortness of breath.  After further
   gastrointestinal procedures performed, the patient was
   started on Coumadin, and his INR was therapeutic at the
   time of discharge.

1. QUESTIONABLE ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  The patient's
   admission chest x-ray was concerning for possible
   aspiration pneumonia versus atelectasis.  Vital signs did
   not indicate an infections etiology; however, the patient
   had evidence of crackles and changes at the lung bases.
   The changes were thought to be more consistent with
   infarction and atelectasis given new diagnosis of
   bilateral pulmonary emboli; however, the patient was given
   a 7-day course of levofloxacin.  Again, his oxygen
   saturations remained stable.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient did not have any
   workup of gastrointestinal bleeding at the outside
   hospital.  During this admission, an
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed
   showing early questionable early [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus and
   multiple nonbleeding diverticula.  The patient was started
   on a high-fiber diet.  A repeat colonoscopy was
   recommended within five to ten years, and a repeat
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended in about two
   years to reevaluate GE junction. The patient was continued
   on a proton pump inhibitor.  Stools remained occult-
   blood/guaiac negative, and his hematocrit remained stable
   during his hospital course.

1. BACK PAIN:  The patient's back pain was controlled with
   oxycodone and morphine as well as Tylenol.

1. PROPHYLAXIS:  Heparin/Coumadin and a proton pump
   inhibitor.

1. CODE STATUS:  The patient remained a full code.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable with improved oxygenation on
room air.  Hematocrit was stable.  INR was therapeutic.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism.
2. Diverticulosis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. History of nephrolithiasis.
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6. Early signs of [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once per day.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:
1. The patient was to have outpatient laboratory work to
   monitor INR.
2. The patient was to follow up  with primary care physician
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 49621**] within five to seven days.
3. The patient was to have followup in the [**Hospital 6283**]
   Clinic in one to two years for a repeat
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
4.
   The patient was also to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**4-30**]
,
   [**2103**].
