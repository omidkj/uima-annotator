Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Ampullary Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.
2.  Open cholecystectomy.
3.  Staging laparoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19407**] is an 81-year-old woman who lost
weight, got jaundiced, felt bad, apparently fell and was
admitted
through [**Hospital6 54196**] back in [**2176-8-9**] for
evaluation. She was profoundly jaundiced, and an ERCP was
necessary to stent a distal biliary stricture in the
periampullary area. Apparently, her bilirubin got up in the
range of 12 mg per deciliter. She had a 35-pound weight loss
over the past 2 months. Her periampullary mass was biopsied,
negative. Her jaundice has since fully resolved.

A CT scan later showed a 6-7 mm mass at the pancreatic head
adjacent to the
CBD (1.8 mm).


Past Medical History:
Her past surgical history is significant for total abdominal
hysterectomy and an appendectomy remotely. From a medical
standpoint, she has diet-controlled diabetes, which has gotten a

lot better since she has lost weight. She has mild hypertension
and she had uterine cancer, prompting the hysterectomy eight
years ago.




Social History:
She stopped smoking over 40 years ago and does not
drink alcohol.



Physical Exam:
On exam she is non-distressed, alert and
oriented. She is not jaundiced. Her neck
is supple with a midline trachea, and no jugular venous
distention or lymphadenopathy. Her chest is clear on
auscultation. Breast exam was not performed. Her cardiac rate
and rhythm is normal. Her abdomen shows lower, old, well-healed
incisions. The upper abdomen is without incisions. Otherwise,
the belly has no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal exam is
guaiac negative, and there are no masses. She has no hernias.
Pelvic exam was deferred. Her extremities are normal with full
range of motion and symmetrical pulses though she does have 1+
pitting edema bilaterally at the ankles.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Expired POD 36

The patient was admitted for surgery-day-admission.  The patient
tolerated the surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive
care unit and had a complicated stay.  She had acute MI
(NSTEMI), alterned mental status, pneumonia with acute
respiratoy failure, new onset of Afib, and became septic.
Several consult teams became involved in her care including
Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Infectious Disease.  Multiple
procedures where done inorder to maximize her recovery,
including tracheostomy, central line placements, chest tubes,
and VATS.  She was placed on antibiotics such as Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Zosyn, Meropenum, and Ambisone.  She was
transfused several times with pRBC's.  All efforts were made to
resusitate the patient.  However, the patients WBC remained
elevated in the 20,000's (although seldomly febrile) and she
required pressors to maintain the BP.  She continued to
detiorate and expired on POD 36.
