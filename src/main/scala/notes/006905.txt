[**2164-11-2**] C Spine CT : 1. Displaced fracture of the right C5
spinous processes with extension intothe right C5 lamina.
  2. Multilevel degenerative changes, as above, including small
posterior
osteophytes. If clinical concern for ligamentous or spinal cord
injury, MRI is more sensitive.

3. Scattered areas of focal osseous lucency, which may relate to
degenerative change or osteopenia. However, if patient has
history of malignancy, these would be of more concern, and
further evaluation with MRI or bone scan could be obtained.
  4. Suggestion of hypodensity in the inferior right lobe of the
thyroid, for which further evaluation with ultrasound can be
obtained.



[**2164-11-2**] Head CT : No acute intracranial process.

[**2164-11-2**] CXR : 1. Suboptimal examination due to patient motion
and exclusion of the right costophrenic angle.
2. Small amount of fluid seen in the azygos lobe fissure.
3. 4-mm rounded density in the right mid lung, as above, not
clearly seen on prior radiographs or on prior chest CT. Consider
further evaluation with chest CT.

[**2164-11-3**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1093**] :
1. Findings indicative of injury to the C4-5 interspinous
ligaments and the ligamentum flavum at disc level likely
secondary to extension injury with fracture of the C5 spinous
process.
2. Subtle signal change in the anterior portion of C5-6 disc
could be
secondary to trauma to the disc from extension injury.
3. Prevertebral hematoma in the upper cervical region from C1-C4
level.
4. Degenerative changes as described above.
5. No evidence of abnormal signal within the spinal cord to
indicate spinal cord trauma. No intraspinal hematoma.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15716**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU with an INR of 20 and
received 5 units of FFP and 1 unit of blood. His lowest
hematocrit was 20 and stabilized after that at 25. He did have
some neck pain and right shoulder pain which was controlled with
Percocet.  He did have some episodes of agitation and impulsive
behavior and for that reason was placed on the CIWA protocol
which was effective.

Atrial fibrillation was a problem during his hospitalization and
his pre admission Diltiazem was resumed and lopressor was
started.  He converted to NSR at a rate of 76 BPM and has been
able to maintain regularity.

His C spine injury was further reviewed with an MRI which
indicated ligamentous injury of C [**5-13**] and the recommendations by
the Neurosurgery service were to wear a hard collar for 6 weeks
and then return to the Clinic for follow up xrays.

Mr. [**Known lastname 15716**] had a temperature of 101 early in his hospitalization
and 1 set of blood cultures was positive for coag negative staph
([**2164-11-5**]). His echo in [**Month (only) 216**] showed tricuspid valve
endocarditis and he was treated with 6 weeks of antibiotics. He
was placed on Linazoilid pending repeat cultures as he is VRE
positive from his last admission.  While blood cultures were
pending he had a TEE which showed no vegetations and trace
tricuspid regurgitation.  His repeat cultures were negative and
his antibiotics were discontinued.  He remained afebrile for the
remainder of his hospitalization.

Following the assurance of no bacteremia he had an IVC filter
placed uneventfully on [**2164-11-6**].  He subsequently started
Coumadin and was transitioned off Lovenox.  His INR's were
monitored carefully and will be followed by the [**Hospital 18**]
[**Hospital3 **].
