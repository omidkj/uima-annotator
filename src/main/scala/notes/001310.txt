Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
transfered here for epicardial abscess management

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated, R-SCV placed, A-line, Pacer Wire placed, PICC line

History of Present Illness:
65 y.o. M with steroid dependent COPD/asthma, recurrent
pulmonary infections due to MRSA/pseudomonas, s/p [**Hospital 39700**]
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2146-4-12**] with endocarditis
and complete heart black with temporary pacer with no escape
rhythm.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-9**] with presumed COPD
exacerbation and CHF. Overnight he became more tachypnic with
hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated in the morning
of [**4-10**]. He was also found to have [**3-23**] second paused and
responded to atropine. Patient was also hypotensive to 80s
during the episode and then recovered to SBP of 100s. Patient
was also found with with 3:4 Wenckebach rhythm varying with
Mobitz pattern rhythm, then PAF with tachyarrhythmia 1-teens,
with 4-5 second pauses. TEE was performed on [**4-10**]. He went into
patient was found to be in in complete heart block. Luckily, by
that point he had a single temporary V wire inserted through R
IJ on [**4-10**]. Since then patient with no escape rhythm.
.
Patient has severe undelrying COPD (FEV1 0.79) requiring chronic
high dose steroids. He was started on high dose solumedrol at
[**Hospital1 **]. Patient was also found to be bacteremic with MRSA [**3-22**]
BCx upon initial admission with less than 24 hours, started on
Vanco and Levo. Gentamycin was added the next day for synnergy.
Patient also with 4/23 GNR in his sputum. Patient was recently
treated for MRSA bacteremia and sepsis back in [**10-23**]. Presumed
source was IV thrombophlebitis. Patient was also found to have
lung septic embolic. Patient underwent 6 week course of Vanco IV
and 4 week of Linezolid (for presumed improved pulmonary
penetration). Repeat CT on [**1-/2146**] showed improvement of
pulmonary cavitations on chest CT.
.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On the
morning of transfer patient with Hct from 33 to 27 with minimal
coffee ground emesis and guiac positive stools. Hct appears to
be stable @ 27 upon repeat.
ROS: upon arrival to CCU, patient is intubated, he stays he is
in mil pain. He denies any cp, sob. No fevers/chills.
Communication is limited due to intubation but he appears lucid.



Past Medical History:
# NO known CAD
# HTN
# COPD - FEV1 .79 ~ 29%, requiring persistent high dose steroids
and mulitiple admission to [**Hospital3 **]/[**Hospital1 1872**] Rehab. CO2
33 on [**4-9**] with pH of 7.39, CO2 63, pO2 74, HCO3 38, Sats 94%.
# Multiple cavitary lession- NOS - in lungs after MRSA skin
infection in [**2145-10-19**], appears to be improved [**1-/2146**]
# MRSA septicemia - [**10-23**] from IV line Tx with Vanco 6 weeks,
then Linezolid x 4 weeks with septic emboli to the lungs.
# Pseudomonas in sputum
# Cervical disk disease - C4-5 discectomy [**2142-9-18**]
- chornic management with moderate narcotics
# ? epidrual abscess or a large disk herniation - due to
complain of increased neck pain detected on MRI on [**12/2145**]
---- repeat CT on [**4-11**] showed no evidence of epidural mass
although a small epidural abscess may not be excluded if very
small and unable to be picked up by CT resolution
---- C3-C4 small posterior protrusion, also milD dorSal bulging
consistent with degenerative narrowing of C5-C6 narrowing of
left C6 foramen, same @ C6-C7.
# Chronic Hepatitis C -s/p succesful IFN therapy 8 years ago
# Chronic Anemia -
# Multiple surgeries including ventral hernia repair s/p bullet
wound in 20s.
# Chronic Anxiety and depression
# Nl renal function - Cr 0.7 upon admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**4-9**]
# Recurrent epistaxis - s/p septal repair - thus no
anticoagulation
