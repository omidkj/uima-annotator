**************RADIOLOGY****************
CXR [**2147-2-3**] 10:23 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.There is no significant
change compared to previous.

MRI HEAD [**2147-2-3**]
official read P, per neuro-onc there is no acute process or
bleed

CTA chest [**2147-2-6**]
1.  No pulmonary embolism.
2.  Unchanged appearance of bilateral pulmonary metastastes and
dominant right upper lobe mass.
3.  Left upper lobe pneumonia.
4.  New left lower lobe collapse, which could be secondary to
upward
compression by new large volume ascites in the abdomen, or could
be due to
mucous plug, although no definite plug is visualized.
5.  Small pericardial effusion, and trace left pleural effusion.

6.  New large volume ascites.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-2-8**] 8:58 AM
1. New susceptibility artifact, perhaps from the right side of
the mouth since the prior study of five days ago. Please
correlate clinically.
2. No central findings to explain the new facial nerve palsy. If
there is clinical concern for an upper motor neuron facial
palsy, additional imaging with an IAC protocol can be performed.
3. Persistent fluid/mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells
bilaterally.
4. Assessment for meningitis or focal lesions like masses,
metstases is limited due to lack of IV contrast. If necessary
for further management, this can be performed after appropriate
precautions like dialysis.

CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2147-2-10**] 12:45 PM
1. No evidence of abscess, mass or lymphadenopathy.
2. No vascular abnormalities.
3. Mass-like opacity in the right lung apex. Correlation with
chest imaging is recommended.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-2-10**] 12:44 PM
Scattered tiny foci of soft tissue density in the frontal and
ethmoid air cells. Mucosal irregularity of the inferior
turbinates bilaterally. These could indicate chronic
inflammatory changes.

CT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ CONTRAST  [**2147-2-14**] 11:24 AM
No abnormality in the region of the temporal bone facial canal
is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
49F with metastatic colon CA, s/p renal transplant, who p/w
headache and SIRS.

# SIRS: Unclear etiology. Presented with leukocytosis,
tachycardia, and tachypnea. She was afebrile, though on
prednisone. Given h/o headache, an MR head was performed that
was negative by report. Since she was hypotensive and
tachycardic and had been suffering from N/V and poor po intake,
we aggressively rehydrated her. Her BP stabilized, however her
HA persisted. U/A was clean, CXR unrevealing, peritoneal
dialysis fluid was negative, and BCx negative. An LP was
performed out of concern for meningitis. LP studies showed NL
glucose and protein, 1 WBC in CSF, negative cryptococcal Ag,
cultures negative, HSV negative. She was briefly on
vanc/ceftriaxone/ampicillin (D1=[**2-4**], D/C [**2-5**]), also received
one dose of dexamethasone. Acyclovir was continued until HSV PCR
returned. On day of transfer to ICU, pt developed new hypoxia
and fever, CXR was concerning for question of new retrocardiac
infiltrate, vs effusion (volume overload with wt gain of >5 lbs
since admission), so CTX was begun empirically (D1 = [**2-6**]). A
CTA chest was significant for LUL PNA along with LLL collapse
and was negative for PE. She was started on vancomycin and zosyn
to cover for likely HAP and was weaned off of high flow 100%
face mask down to 2 L nasal cannula on the day of transfer back
to the OMED floor.  By time of discharge, had completed full
course of antibiotics for presumed pneumon
