Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, right subclavian central line, PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and
bacteremia who presents from rehab with altered mental status.
Per the report from the rehab, at baseline he desats with
activity, requiring 3-6L O2 to maintain O2 sats 88-92% and is a
chronic CO2 retainer.  He was given IV Lasix and was refusing
bipap. Given he was more disoriented he was brought to the ED.
Of note, his wife says that he received a blood transfusion on
[**2168-11-12**] and has been more confused since that time.
.
In addition, in [**8-12**] he was hospitalized for a fall and
subsequent right subdural hematoma. This was complicated by a
strep bovis endocarditis which was treated with 6 week of
ceftriaxone. Shortly after stopping the antibiotics he developed
line sepsis from the PICC which grew out MRSA and enteroccus.
The tip was removed and he was treated with vancomycin given his
penicillin allergy from [**2168-11-3**] until [**2168-11-14**].
.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were T 98.1 HR 92 BP 118/78
RR28 94% 2L NC. Temp rose to 101.8. He was oriented x1 or 2 and
complained of abdominal pain intermittently. Was given combivent
neb and became more lethargic. Surgery was consulted for ?
ischemic bowel given is abdominal tenderness. Lactate was normal
though and CT scan was ordered. His blood pressure then dropped
to systolic 64/48s and he was given 3L IVF, CVL was placed and
levophed was started. He was intubated for airway protection
given his altered mental status, but per report was not in any
respiratory distress. He was given etomodate and succ, ativan.
He had a CT torso looking for a source of infection. The only
acute finding was a right pericardial effusion and right pleural
effusion. He was given vancomycin and zosyn for empiric
coverage.

Studies:
[**2168-11-15**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2163-6-6**] no change in comparable leads.

.
[**2168-11-15**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to low inspiratory
effort. Evaluation for new focal consolidation is limited, and a
dedicated PA and lateral view of the chest is recommended.
Alternatively, CT can be performed for further evaluation.
Asbestos-related pleural disease.
.
[**2168-11-15**] CT Head without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or edema.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Age-related involutional change.
.
[**2168-11-15**] Central Line Placement - IMPRESSION: Relatively stable
x-ray examination with possibility of added volume imbalance and
overload. The central line has been introduced with no
pneumothorax. Distal tip at adequate position. Support tubes as
above.
.
[**2168-11-15**] CT abdomen & pelvis without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. New right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.
2. Possible cholelithiasis, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Bilateral atrophic kidneys.
4. No evidence of diverticulitis.
.
[**2168-11-16**] Pleural fluid cytology:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Scattered mesothelial cells present singly and abundant
  lymphocytes.
.
[**2168-11-17**] TEE - No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is a
moderate-sized (1.1 x 0.9 cm) nonmobile density on the right
cusp of the aortic valve associated with partial cusp prolapse.
The bulk of the echodensity is likely an old/healed vegetation,
although a more acute superimposed valvular infection cannot be
excluded on the basis of echocardiography alone. There is an
associated eccentric, anteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation. There is mild aortic valve stenosis, with
a valve area by planimetry of 1.6cm2. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be
fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass
is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Likely aortic valve endocarditis, without evidence
of an abscess or involvement of other valves. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
.
[**2168-11-17**] Bilateral upper extremity veins - IMPRESSION: No
evidence of DVT in either the right or left upper extremity.
.
[**2168-11-17**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**], MRA Brain without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. Focal area of slow diffusion in the left frontal lobe
consistent with an area of acute infarction secondary to
proximal emboli.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
.
[**2168-11-17**] MR C, T, & L spine - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for abscess, spinal cord compression, or other
spinal cord
abnormality.
2. Multilevel degenerative joint disease. Disc protrusion at the
level of
T8-T9, and disc bulges at the level of L3-L4, and L4-L5.
.
[**2168-11-18**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Veins - IMPRESSION: No lower
extremity DVT.
.
[**2168-11-21**] Carotid Ultrasound - IMPRESSION:
1. Normal right carotid ultrasound with 0% stenosis.
2. Minimal echogenic plaque within the left proximal internal
