[**2170-2-8**]: Cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction
and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman who has had a tracheostomy.
She also developed severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia which
was treated with the right thoracotomy and posterior splinting
of her thoracic airways. After this procedure, she was noted to

tracheomalacia and some minor narrowing at the site of the
previous stoma. She was admitted following tracheal resection
and reconstruction.

Physical Exam:
VS: T: 98.7  HR: 81-82 SR  BP: 102-118/64  Sats: 95% 2L nasal
cannula.  Room air 86-88%
BS: 126-170
Gen: pleasant in NAD
Neck: cervical incision with slight erythema, slight swelling
without drainage.
Lungs: decreased breath sounds bilateral with faint bibasilar
crackles. no wheezes
CV: RRR S1, S2, no MRG or JVD
Abd: soft, NT, ND,  PEG site clean no erythema or discharge
Ext: warm without edema
Neuro: awake, alert oriented


Pertinent Results:
CXR:
[**2170-2-15**]: Calcified left basal granuloma. Status post old left
ribs fracture. Bilateral areas of atelectasis that are basically
unchanged. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. No
larger pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**2170-2-12**]: Right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated
substantially. Persistent obscuration of the left diaphragmatic
contour indicates combination of small pleural effusion and
worsening left lower lobe atelectasis, now probably collapsed.
Upper lungs are grossly clear. Heart size normal.
[**2170-2-10**]: Lung volumes remain very low, and there is greater
consolidation at both lung bases, particularly the right since
[**2-9**], most likely atelectasis.  Small left pleural
effusion has increased. Heart is top normal size, unchanged. I
see no endotracheal tube. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 42611**] was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2170-2-8**] for a cervical tracheal resection and
reconstruction and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage for
cervical malacia and guard suture placement. She transferred to
the ICU intubated monitored overnight.

Neuro/Pain: Initial pain management was achieved with IV
Dilaudid and propofol while intubated. This was later
transitioned to Roxicet via PEG with good control. The patient
remained neurologically per her baseline: intact but with some
memory loss. She is compulsive with taking off oxygen and
getting out of bed. She was kept under fall precautions. Her
home Seroquel of 150 mg po daily was divided to 50 mg per NGT
TID, with good effect.

Pulmonary: She was extubated on POD1. Heliox and BiPAP for
hypercarbia during POD's [**1-15**]. With Aggressive pulmonary toilet,
mucolytics nebs and incentive spirometry her oxygenation
improved.  Supplemental oxygen was titrated to 2 L nasal cannula
with saturation of 97%.  Titrate oxygen to maintain oxygen
saturations > 92%.  Room air oxygen saturation 86-88%.

Serial Chest X-ray's (see above report)

Bronchoscopy, flexible [**2170-2-14**] showed intact cervical
anastomosis, with abnormal bronchial mucosa in the cervical
anastomosis, and abnormal bronchial mucosa in the proximal and
mid trachea.  Her guard suture was removed.

CV: The patient was tachycardic initially which improved with
home diltiazem, switched to 60 mg po qid for PEG tube. She
remained hemodynamically stable throughout in sinus rhythm 80's,
blood pressure 100-120's.

GI/Nutrition: Tube feeds were resume via PEG POD1. Strict NPO
for known aspiration. She was evaluated by the registered
dietician with tube feed recommendations of replete with fiber
at 70 ml/hour.

Renal/GU: Foley removed [**2170-2-12**]. She voided well thereafter.
Electrolytes were monitored and treated as needed. Hypernatremia
peak NA 148 discharge 145, normalized with free water and
Aldactone.

Heme: No blood transfusions. Stable anemia.

ID: She remained afebrile, with stable WBC counts. CBC trends
were watched throughout her stay.

Endocrine: Fingerstick blood sugars < 200.

Drains: JP removed [**2170-2-12**].

Prophylaxis: SQ heparin and SCD's were instituted to prevent
VTE.

Disposition: Physical therapy deemed the patient appropriate for
rehabilitation.  She continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to [**Hospital1 41724**] in [**Location (un) 701**] on [**2170-2-16**]. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
