Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-8-3**]: Right craniotomy for tumor resection


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year old woman with a h/o stage III NSCLC s/p
completion of chemoradiation approximately 8 weeks ago,
transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] with L-sided weakness and head CT
demonstrating a new right brain lesion. Reportedly, the patient
experienced left arm pain approximately 4 weeks ago although
thought the symptoms were related to her pre-existing diagnosis
of polymyalgia rheumatica. However, over the past 1 week, the
patient has experienced generalized left-sided weakness in
association with tingling of her left hand/fingers.

In the evening on [**2142-7-31**], she was noted to "slump" to the floor,
having lost strength on her left side, and was subsequently
taken to [**Location (un) 620**] ED for further evaluation. She underwent a head
CT which demonstrated an approximate 4x4cm right brain lesion
with mass effect (1cm right-to-left) and surrounding vasogenic
edema. She was then  transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical
evaluation. Of note, she reports mild headache, although denies
vertigo, dizziness, lightheadness, blurry/double vision,
nausea/vomiting, head/neck/abdominal pain. No history of similar
symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
MRI Brain w/and w/o contrast [**2142-8-3**]:
2.9 x 3.9 x 4.8 cm heterogenous ring enhancing mass in the
medial aspect
of the right temporal lobe with associated extensive vasogenic
edema and mass effect over the right lateral ventricle. A 1.1 cm
midline shift to the left is noted. This finding likely
represent a metastatic lesion.

CT Head [**2142-8-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with right temporal
craniotomy,
pneumocephalus, a small amount of hemorrhage surrounding the
tumor resection site, and small amount of hemorrhage in the
right lateral ventricle. Leftward shift of normally midline
structures by 8 mm.

MRI Brain [**2142-8-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right temporal mass.
Postoperative
changes are seen with some residual enhancement, particularly at
the
posterior, as well as at the anterior margin of the surgical
cavity. No
evidence of hydrocephalus or significant change in the mass
effect.

CT Head [**2142-8-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes, with residual vasogenic edema and
blood products.
2. Resolving pneumocephalus, resulting in decreased 8-mm
leftward shift.
3. Increased right subgaleal seroma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83476**] was admitted from the emergency room to the floor on
the Neurosurgery Service for neurological observation. She was
started on decadron and dilantin, and continued her home
medications except for aspirin. She was on SQH for DVT/PE
prophylaxis. PT was consulted for mobilization. An MRI of her
brain was obtained....
Neuro and Radiation Oncology were consulted for assistance with
plan of care.

On [**8-2**], patient had an MRI of brain with and without contrast
which showed large right frontal temporal mass. Medicine was
consulted for medical clearance.  They recommended proceeding
with the craniotomy for tumor resection.

Patient went to the Operating room on [**8-3**] for a right frontal
temporal craniotomy for tumor resection. Post operatively
patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to the ICU for
close monitoring.  Post operative CT showed a good
decompression. On [**8-4**] floor orders were written as she was
neurologically stale. SQH was started. Post-op MRI was done.
This showed expected post-op changes and some residual tumor as
expected. PT thought she would benefit from acute rehab.
Overnight she had an episode where she was going to the
bathroom, slumped over and was unresponsive. She had a CT that
was stable. Dilantin was increased as this epsidoe could have
been a seizure but she started to develop a rash and she was
swicthed to Keppra.

On [**8-5**] she remained stable.

On [**8-6**], she was awake and alert. Ambulating with assist. PT saw
her and felt she was clear for home with services. She was
discharged home with her Daughter and services.
