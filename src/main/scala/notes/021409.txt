Tachypnea, tachycardia and suspected PE.

R Thoracentesis
pleurex catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
48 yoF with metastic Breast CA, now presents with worsening
dyspnea. Over past 2 weeks has had worsening SOB with minimal
activity and sometimes at rest, which has acutely worsened over
the past 3 days. Her symptoms have been refractory to nebulizer
treatments; she notes that she has also been on a 1 month
prednisone taper. She has also had intermittent coughing spells
productive of clear sputum. Has had intermittent HA, but no

that resolves with lorazepam.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4, HR 108, BP 107/60, RR 24,
Pox 100. Patient underwent CXR that revealed emphysema, stable
bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia. A CT head
was done prior to anticoagulation, as PE was high in the
differential, (given her history of metastatic breast CA) and it
revealed a new 7 mm mass possibly metastasis vs vascular lesion.
Due to this anticoagulation was not started. LENI's were found
to be (-). D-dimer was 655. She was given 2 L IVF, solumedrol
125 mg and benadryl 50 mg in preparation for possible contrast
study. A CTA with gadolinium was performed that revealed no
acute PE or aortic pathology.
.
On the floor, was found to be in stable condition.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
1. Metastatic Breast Cancer
a.  First primary: Stage I (T1C, N0, M0) 1.5 cm, ER positive,
infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed in [**2100**]. She underwent
lumpectomy, 5 cycles of adjuvant CMF and radiation.  Did not
receive tamoxifen.
b.  In [**10/2107**], diagnosed second primary, stage II B (T3, Nx,
M0) 6 cm, grade III, ER positive, HER/2-neu negative
infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast.  She underwent
modified radical mastectomy followed by 4 cycles of Cytoxan and
Adriamycin chemotherapy.  The patient began tamoxifen in
07/[**2107**].
c.  Diagnosed with recurrent disease involving the left chest
wall 01/[**2110**].  Initiated Femara.
d. As the nodule continued to grow, she was treated with weekly
Taxotere till the late fall of [**2110**], and on [**2112-3-18**] she
underwent chest wall resection and was placed back on a
different aromatase inhibitor (Aromasin 25 mg daily).
e.  Lost to follow up since early [**2114**].
6.  Last mammogram was of right breast on [**2115-1-7**]: No evidence of
malignancy.
f.  Malignant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade -
diagnosed [**2116-9-12**] during pericardiocentesis.
g.  Malignant pleural effusion diagnosed [**2116-9-16**] during
diagnostic thoracentesis.
h.  s/p left VATS pericardial window as well as a talc
pleurodesis, both performed on [**2116-9-17**].
i.  Chest and abdomen CT with contrast on [**2116-9-16**]:
Large non hemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion, multiple new
scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine
compatible with osseous metastasis, new 5-mm nodular soft tissue
in the anterior mediastinum since [**2111-12-29**].  Metastasis not
excluded.
j.  Bone Scan ([**2116-10-6**]):  no obvious evidence of osseous
metastatic disease. However, regions of new osseous sclerosis on
[**Month (only) **] CT Torso were too small for total body bone scan detection.
k.  Taxol at 80mg/m2 started [**2116-10-9**].  Received seven doses.
l.  [**2117-1-8**]: osseous progression on re-staging.
m. [**2117-1-15**]: C1D1 vinorelbine/avastin, stopped after one cycle
due
to toxicity (constipation, hypertension).
n. [**Date range (1) 9597**]: lost to follow-up, not reachable by phone.
