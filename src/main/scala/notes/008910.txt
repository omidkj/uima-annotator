Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2856**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p MI
and 2-vessel CABG in [**2097**], presenting with troponin elevation
to 0.35, new ST depressions, and hypotension after nitroglycerin
and furosemide, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. She
developed left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath at 9am
prior to admission with a report of bloody, loose stools as
well. She denies any prior bloody stools, nausea/vomiting, or
dizziness. She took one nitroglycerin with relief of pain.
Patient lives alone with visiting nurse services, but was not
herself this AM per report of her family. The family is unsure
if she had been taking her medications reliably and per the
representatives from Meals on Wheels she may have been losing
weight lately due to poor PO intake. She was taken to the
outside hospital ([**Hospital1 **]) and notable labs were
creatinine of 1.2, normal CBC, and grossly normal complete
metabolic panel. CK 57 and Trop 0.35, as above. CXR showed
evidence of pulmonary edema after 1.5L of IVF, and EKG
demonstrated new ST depressions compared to old without evidence
of >1mm STEs in 2 contiguous leads, so she was started on a
heparin gtt. She became hypotensive with nitroglycerin and
furosemide treatment (30mg). Her pain seemed to improve with
morphine, but no further morphine was given due to hypotension.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac intervention.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she dropped her oxygen sats to the high 70s was
initiated on a NRB. She was then intubated for hypoxemia and
oxygenated well after that. She was persistently hypotensive and
levophed was initiated at that time. EKG showed evolving STEMI
(elevations in III, avR, V1-V2 and depression in I, II, aVL,
V4-V6) with reciprocal ST depressions. She was then transferred
to the cath lab for intervention.
.
There was a delay in getting to the cath lab due to hypoxemia
and volume overload. The family also initially did not want her
to be intubated. Following family discussion, it was decided to
intubate her and take her to cath lab to diagnose the problem
and potentially fix it. In the cath lab, arterial access was
obtained in the left radial artery. Left forearm angiography
showed a very small and tortuous vessel. A left subclavian
lesion was crossed with a balloon for pre-dilation. The lesion
was then re-crossed from the groin approach and stented with a
6.0 x 24 mm PS Blue stent (BMS), with 10% residual stenosis and
no significant pressure gradient. Final angiography revealed
normal flow, no dissection or thrombosis. Coronary angiography
showed a right dominant system, with left main ostial lesion of
90% stenosis with post stenotic dilation, diffuse noncritical
disease in LAD, 50% stenosis of LCx at origin into an ulcerated
OM1 with a filling defect but normal flow. RCA showed a proximal
90% stenosis and diffuse disease with total occlusion and
collaterals filling distal vessel from LCA. Grafts were
identified as an occluded SVG-RCA and widely patent LIMA-LAD. No
stents were placed in the coronaries. Post-procedure ECG
demonstrated resolution of ST segment changes.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
