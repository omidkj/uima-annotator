History of Present Illness:
47F s/p lap-assisted total proctocolectomy w/end ileostomy
[**2133-4-29**], complicated by wound infection and pelvic abscess, now
with incisional hernia and pain.  Her initial hospital course
was uncomplicated, but Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] was re-admitted [**2133-5-29**] with
purulent vaginal drainage and wound drainage.  She was
discharged
to rehab [**2133-6-4**] with a VAC dressing to her surgical wound and a
pigtail drain in her abscess.  She had one post-discharge
follow-up visit on [**2133-6-22**], at which time her midline wound
was healing well with the VAC and her pigtail drain was removed.
 She failed to make/keep her follow-up appointments after that
visit, and has not been seen in clinic since that time.  Since
her last
visit, she has developed a large hernia in her surgical
incision.  Her sister, who is her healthcare proxy, called the
office one day PTA, stating that [**Known firstname **] is in terrible pain from
her hernia and that it needs to be repaired.  Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**]
presented to clinic [**2133-12-2**] for admission.  She states that the
pain
has been developing over the past 2 months, and has worsened
over the past 2 weeks.  She also states that the pain is
impairing her breathing, and that she only feels ok when she is
lying down.  She also complains of passing gas from her vagina
over the past few months.  She saw her doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1474**] and
had a CT scan performed, and was told that she may have a
fistula.  She has also had several UTI's in the past few months.
 She has been afebrile.  She denies nausea, vomiting, change in
ostomy output, chest pain, cough, SOB, hematemesis, melena,
muscle weakness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] was admitted to the colorectal surgery service on
[**2133-12-2**] for evaluation and management of her large incisional
hernia.  She was seen by plastic surgery for assistance with
closure of her large abdominal wall defect.  She was taken to
the OR on [**2133-12-11**], where she had an exploratory laparotomy,
lysis of adhesions, re-siting of her end ileostomy, and closure
of her hernia with the assistance of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic
surgery service.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the floor post-operatively.

Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: On [**12-15**], Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] developed atrial fibrillation.
Troponins were negative. She was initially rate controlled with
diltiazem.  However, the atrial fibrillation continued and
cardiology was consulted for recommendation of management.  On
[**12-16**] she was started on metoprolol and titrated up to 37.5 TID,
aspirin 325 QD, and had a trans thoracic echocardiogram which
revealed: "Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen. Left
atrial enlargement."  She remained tachycardic and was started
on diltiazem 30mg every 6 hours. This did not sufficiently
control her rate and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on
[**12-18**] for diltiazem drip. She converted to NSR on [**12-19**] and was
transferred back to the floor on [**12-20**].  Cardiology recommended a
PO regimen of 180mg diltiazem extended release QD and 325mg
aspirin QD. She remained asymptomatic, but she had sinus
tachycardia to 140s on [**12-21**], likely realted to post-op
deconditioning as her pain was controlled, she was
well-hydrated, and she had no signs of infection or pulmonary
embolism. Her diltiazem was increased to 360 QD.

Pulmonary: Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] was treated with incentive spirometry
and encouraged to have good pulmonary toilet during this
admission.  Her asthma was managed with Fluticasone-Salmeterol
Diskus (250/50) 1 INH IH [**Hospital1 **] and albuterol inhaler prn.

GI/GU/FEN: Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] was made NPO for scans, procedures, and
operations. After the surgical ventral hernia repair on [**12-11**],
she was initially NPO, then experienced nausea and vomiting and
an NG tube was placed and remained until [**12-16**]. On [**12-17**] she
tolerated clears, then full liquids on [**12-18**]. She was advanced to
a regular diet on [**12-19**]. She tolerated this diet and was
supplemented with Ensure. Her electrolytes were monitored and
repleted as needed.

ID: A urine culture on admission revealed E.coli sensitive to
cephalosporins. She was treated with ceftazadine for 14 days.
Ms. [**Known lastname 28315**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever to 102.3 on POD 3, for which blood
and urine cultures and chest/abdominal x-rays were obtained. The
radiology studies were normal. Her urine culture was negative,
blood cultures revealed Strep viridans and coagulase negative
staphylococcus. She was treated with IV vancomycin and her PICC
line was replaced.

Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; She was transfused 1 unit packed RBCs for a
heamtocrit of 24.6 on [**12-15**].

Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous hepari
