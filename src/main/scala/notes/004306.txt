HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, CABG in [**2136**],
hypertension, and GERD, who presented to an outside hospital
on [**2149-3-14**] with chest pain occurring at rest.  The
chest pain was substernal radiating to the jaw, and as well
to both arms.  He denied nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.  As
well, he denied shortness of breath.  At the outside
hospital, he received aspirin, Nitroglycerin x 5, morphine 2
mg IV, and the chest pain resolved.  However, he did have
persistent neck and arm pain.  The patient was started on
heparin and received Nitro spray.

At the outside hospital, his vitals were blood pressure
96/62, pulse 79, respiratory rate 20, 99% on 2 liters.  Labs
at the outside hospital revealed a CK of 144, MB 7.9, index
5.5, as well as troponin of 0.5.  His EKG, by report, was
normal sinus rhythm, poor R wave progression, nonspecific
ST-T wave changes.  No changes compared to an EKG on [**2149-3-9**].  The chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm
which had been seen on the previous chest x-ray since
[**2148-12-1**].  The patient reports being relatively
pain-free since his CABG.  His last episode of chest pain was
approximately one year ago.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], blood pressure 106/60, pulse 73.  He
was given Lopressor 25 po x 1, sublingual Nitroglycerin x 1,
heparin drip, nitropaste.  His chest pain went from being
[**1-10**] on arrival to being chest pain-free.  His EKG showed a
normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, poor R wave
progression, T wave inversions in III, T wave flattening in
II and AVS.

The patient was admitted with unstable angina, non-ST
elevation MI.  He was continued on aspirin, beta blocker, IV
Nitroglycerin, nitropaste, heparin drip, and started on
Integrelin.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 85-year-old male admitted with
unstable angina with a significant CAD history, for non-ST
elevation MI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was continued on aspirin, beta
blocker, nitropaste, heparin drip, and started on Integrelin.
He remained chest pain-free, and on the [**2149-3-17**], he
underwent a cardiac catheterization.  His peak CK was 617, MB
3, index 13.5, troponin 34.9.  These were from the [**2149-3-15**].

On cardiac catheterization, he had a right atrial pressure of
20, mid RCA 100% lesion, acute marginal 60% lesion, proximal
LAD 100%, midcircumflex 60%, OM 80%.  His grafts, SVG1 to the
PDA had a 90% discrete midlesion.  The SVG2 to OM, as well as
the left LAD to LIMA, were patent.

The patient underwent PCI of the SVG to PDA.  The procedure
was complicated by perforation of the SVG/RV.  A GelMed stent
was placed in the perforated region.  The patient continued
to leak dye distal to the GelMed stent.  An additional GelMed
stent was placed distally.  The graft was occluded using a 3
mm balloon.

At that time, the patient was noted to have severe chest
pain, and also became hypotensive.  STAT echo revealed a
hemopericardium with pericardial tamponade.  Physiology
pericardiocentesis performed, complicated by RV perforation.
The patient was intubated and went emergently to cardiac
surgery on dopamine and neo-synephrine.  The surgery portion
of the vein from the lower leg was harvested.

Stroke monitoring was performed and a moderate amount of
blood from the RA was drained.  There was no bleeding found
from the RA graft with perforation present in the lower
aspect of the RV which was cauterized.  Two drains were
placed.  The patient had severe biventricular failure despite
inotropic support.  He spiked a temperature to 101.8 on
[**3-18**].  He was started on vancomycin, as well as heparin and
Plavix.  He was weaned off pressors.  Epi was weaned on
[**3-19**].  Levo was weaned on [**3-20**].  He was extubated on [**3-19**].
Chest tube removed [**3-21**].

Per nurse's report, the patient's course has been complicated
by delirium in the Cardiothoracic Unit.  He had atrial
fibrillation on the 20th.  He was started on amiodarone drip
and heparin and converted to normal sinus rhythm on the 21.
He had 18 hours total of atrial fibrillation.  He had another
episode the evening of the 23 into the 24 that lasted four
hours.  Since then, he has been in normal sinus rhythm.  He
was transferred to the CCU for management on the [**3-21**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On the day of discharge, the patient's
exam revealed a blood pressure of 112/57, heart rate 70, 96%
on 5 liters nasal cannula.  He was in no acute distress,
sitting up in chair, answering questions appropriately, A&O x
3. Surgical pupils.  EOMI.  Poor dentition.  Dobbhoff NG tube
in left nostril.  JVD approximately 8-9 cm.  Cardiovascular -
regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Crackles - one a quarter the way up
bilaterally.  Abdomen - soft, normoactive bowel sounds, no
tenderness.  Extremities - no edema.  His left leg harvest
site had mild erythema.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  He had 4/5 strength.  Able to ambulate a small
number of steps with assistance from bed to chair.

LAB DATA DAY OF DISCHARGE:  Hematocrit 33.9, hemoglobin 11.3,
platelets 199, white blood cell 8.3, sodium 135, potassium
3.7, chloride 107, bicarb 28, BUN 25, creatinine 0.9, calcium
7.8, phosphorus 3.3, magnesium 1.8.  The patient had a
negative HIT antibody.

The patient had blood cultures on the 21 and urine cultures
on the 21 that have no growth.  One out of four bottles on
the blood culture showed the Staph epi.  The patient has been
afebrile since his transfer to the CCU, with a normal white
count.

An echocardiogram on [**3-24**] showed a 5x2 cm mass extending to
the left atrium that was compressing the left atrium.  The
left atrium was mildly dilated.  The right atrium was normal
size.  Mild depressed LV.  No reliable measure of EF.  Right
ventricular chamber size was normal.  Trivial MR and 1+ TR.
No tamponade.  No effusion.  The patient had oropharyngeal
swallowing study on the [**3-25**].  Nonfunctional
swallowing ability with aspiration of pureed foods and nectar
thickened liquids after the swallow.

It is anticipated that when the patient gets a little bit
stronger and gets out of the unit, can safely swallow on
clear and secretions, he should be able to eat and swallow.
