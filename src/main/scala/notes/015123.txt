Chief Complaint:
S/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory
distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with esophageal stent placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA,
s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2113-11-24**] to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for esophageal stenting.

The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 2436**] and [**Hospital1 3278**] notes. The
patient [**Hospital1 1834**] EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found
to have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On
[**11-1**], she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] partial proximal gastrectomy and
pylorplasty with J-tube placment. She was discharged home on
[**11-9**] but returned to the ED later that day for hematemasis. EGD
was done showing some clots in the stomach but no active
bleeding. The follwing day she had another episode of
hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively intubated
for airway protection. She [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat endoscopy which
showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric
anatomosis with oozing. She then [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] exploratory
laparotomy on [**11-11**] where a tear in the capusle of the spleen
was found, but was not able to be repaired given concerns with
disrupting the anastomosis. Tear was controlled with
thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] an
arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseudoaneurysm. She was
transfused multiple units during these few days, HCT around 26.
She was on Zosyn and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.

She was transfered to [**Hospital1 3278**] SICU for treatment on the
pseudoaneurysm. She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic
artery aneursym. She was weaned off the ventilator. However, she
was noted to be on 3L NC during ambulance transport. Lasix was
given. There was a question of vomiting enroute. She was then
reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and hypotension on
[**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and then
extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] CT chest, which only
showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched
from Zosyn to Cefepime.

During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the
GE junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.
Gastrografin swallow on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic
leak to the left of the remaining stomach measuring approx
6x3cm. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for esophagastric
stenting.

Here she [**Hospital1 1834**] ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal
9cm x10mm stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was
verified by a pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated
prior to the procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post
proceedure, she was ordered 125ml/hr NS; she likely received
400cc LR during the procedure. She then developed respiratory
distress with respiratory rates in 40's, no documented hypoxia.
She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was given lasix 20mg
IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on AC 500x 14,
FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was aggressively diuresed with
furosemide because of flash pulmonary edema.  The patient's
respiratory condition improved and pt subsequently extubated on
[**2113-11-26**]. An echocardiogram performed revealed an EF 40%, severe
diastolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, akinesis
of the septum and hypokinesis of the inferior wall which could
suggest recent MI. Serial troponins were negative.

The patient was to return to [**Hospital3 **], but the
admitting surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64258**], does not have ICU admitting
privileges, so the patient is to be transferred to the floor and
then have transfer reattempted.

Studies:

CT abdomen w/ contrast [**2113-11-28**]:
1. Extraluminal gas collection to the left of the body of the
somach, NG tubes through an area of surgical clips in the GE
junction into this extraluminal gas collection, findings
compatible with perforation at the GE junction
2. Retroperitoneal hematoma in the right anterio pararenal space

3. J-tube in place

Bilateral LENI's [**11-20**]: No DVT above the knees

Abdominal Flouroscopy [**2113-11-24**]: A metal stent is visualized
projecting over the GEJ, extending from the T9 vertebral body to
the L1 vertebral body. There is dense material in the T9
vertebral body likely secondary to prior vertebroplasty. There
is a small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity. Chest
radiograph is recommended for further work-up.

CT Chest [**11-20**]: no PE, bilateral moderal pleural effusion L>R

CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-24**]: New esophageal stent. Mild pulmonary
edema, left lower lobe atelectasis.

CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-25**]: The esophageal stent, right-sided IJ
venous catheter and endotracheal tube are unchanged since stable
in position. There is a tortuous thoracic aorta and some mild
cardiomegaly. There is a unchanged left retrocardiac opacity and
bilateral pleural effusions. There is mild fluid overload as
evident by mild pulmonary interstitial marking prominence.

EGD [**2113-11-24**]: A large defect was seen at the esophagogastric
anastamosis. The endoscope was passed into the stomach. A 10.5cm
by 23mm Wallflex fully covered metal stent was placed
successfully across the defect. The position was verified
endoscopically and fluoroscopically. An endoclip was
successfully deployed to clip the proximal end of the stent to
the esophageal wall to maintain stent position. ref 1673 Lot
