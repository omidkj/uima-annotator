Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU monitoring


History of Present Illness:
45 y.o. male with PMHx of ? protein C deficiency, who presents
with a chief complaint of hemoptysis and right flank pain. The
patient states that he recently was enrolled in a trial for
hormonal therapy for cancer (he does not have cancer). The study
was conducted in [**State 26110**] which he drove down prior to
enrollment. A few days later he took one dose of the study drug
and had severe nausea/diarrhea. He left the study and the next
day developed L calf pain. He drove back to MA and eventually
the pain went away, but he then noted the sudden onset of
intermittent cough with R flank pain/back pain radiating to the
shoulder. His symptoms were intermittent but returned 2 days
ago, with assoc hemotpysis. He also noted shortness of breath
with aggressive movement, as well as "palpitations." He
otherwise denies any trauma to the leg, chest, or back. Given
that his hemoptysis returned, he presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED. At
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], labs were unremarkable except for a positive
D-dimer. He then underwent CTA which demonstrated a saddle
pulmonary embolus. He was bolused with a heparin gtt and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of tPA.
.
In the ED, initial vs T 99.1, HR 99, BP 132/87, RR 16, 98 RA. He
was maintained on his heparin gtt and given tylenol and codeine
x1. Cards was called who felt an Echo could wait until the AM
given his stability. Transfer VS T 101.2, BP 134/88, HR 79, RR
25 98% 2L
.
On arrival to the floor, he complains of mild R back pain with
deep inspiration, otherwise he feels well.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Pertinent Results:
CTA There is extensive evidence of pulmonary embolism involving
all the major lobar pulmonary arteries but more prominent in the
lower lobes,      particularly on the right side.  There is also
a complete collapse of      portions of the right lower lobe
which could represent an infarction      or portions of that
lobe.  There is no significant pleural effusion on   either
side.  There is no pericardial effusion.
     IMPRESSION:
     EXTENSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM BOTH LUNGS.

     THE EXAMINATION WAS MONITORED BY A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF
     RADIOLOGY AT [**Hospital1 18**] WHO GAVE THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY
REPORT:
     EXTENSIVE BILATERAL PE INCLUDING RIGHT-SIDED EMBOLUS.
SMALL RIGHT
     PLEURAL EFFUSION.  LIKELY EVOLVING RIGHT LOWER LOBE
PULMONARY INFARCT.
     DISCUSSED WITH DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 52943**] 1700 [**2138-6-23**].
.
TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular
regional and global systolic function. Right ventricle not
well-visualized, but is probably normal in size and function.
Normal estimated pulmonary artery pressures. Impaired left
ventricular relaxation.
.
LENIS: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal
veins were performed. There is normal compressibility, flow,
augmentation without evidence of DVT. Compression of the tibial
and peroneal veins of the calf were demonstrated in both legs.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo male with questionable protein C deficiency being
transferred out of the MICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli
.
# Pulmonary Embolus: Confirmed by CTA to have bilateral
pulmonary emboli predominantly in the lower lobes and right
side. The most likely cause was determined to be prolonged cross
country drive, despite negative LENIS on arrival.  The patient
had a questionable history of protein C deficiency, however
levels during this hospitalization in the presence of extensive
clot burden normal, thus ruling this out as a problem.  [**Name (NI) **]
appropriate cancer screening, PSA, negative.   Despite extensive
clot burden, there was not evidence of RV strain on echo from
today. The patient remained hemodynamically stable during
hospitalization.  The patient was initially treated with
heparin.  Once the patient was determined not to have protein C
deficiency, he was started on coumadin with lovenox bridge.  He
was discharged on this regimen.  His pain was controlled on
tylenol and percocet.  He was monitored on telemetry without
event.  The patient was scheduled to follow up in the Heme/[**Hospital **]
clinic three days following discharge for INR check.
