Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath	Study Date of [**2169-2-22**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Takotsubo pattern cardiomyopathy with preserved EF.
3. Hyperkalemia with acute renal failure.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT	Study Date of [**2169-2-23**] 10:03
AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No ultrasonographic evidence for acute cholecystitis. No
evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Thin renal cortices bilaterally consistent with chronic renal
parenchymal disease.
3. Limited Doppler evaluation of the kidneys but no obvious
evidence for renal artery stenosis.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2169-2-23**] at 12:10:35 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
distal septum and apex. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.


CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2169-2-23**] 4:01
PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper and patchy right lower lobe consolidations, may
represent pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe
in the setting of emphysema raises concern for infection as
well.
2. No source of infection in the abdomen and pelvis.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Pleural effusions, total body wall edema, small amount of
abdominal ascites, consistent with third spacing.

Cytology Report	SPUTUM	Procedure Date of [**2169-2-24**]
ATYPICAL.
Atypical epithelial cells in a background of pulmonary
macrophages and inflammatory cells.

Cytology Report	SPUTUM	Procedure Date of [**2169-2-27**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages, squamous cells, and numerous neutrophils.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2169-3-1**] 7:24 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the course of
the right PICC line is unchanged, the line appears to have been
retracted by approximately 2 cm. Unchanged appearance at the
right lung base. On the left, however, the image is improving,
with increased transparency of the left lower lung.  Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged hilar and mediastinal
contours.

AFB smear - negative x3
