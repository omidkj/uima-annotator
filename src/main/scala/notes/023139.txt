CODE STATUS:  Full.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 98.3,
heart rate 80, respirations 18, blood pressure 90/60, 95% on
4 liters.  In general, he was in no apparent distress, alert
and oriented times three.  HEENT revealed pupils were equally
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  Neck had no jugular venous distention or
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs revealed crackles on the right
one-half the way up, rhonchi at the left base.
Cardiovascular had a regular rate and rhythm, distant heart
sounds, a 2/6 systolic murmur maximal at the apex.  No
gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin.  No splenomegaly.
No masses.  Normal active bowel sounds. Extremities had no
edema, 1+ distal pulses.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.  Pupils were symmetric but minimally
reactive.  Strength was [**2-26**] to [**3-28**] in the upper and lower
extremities.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count 3.8, 75.8% neutrophils, 18.7% lymphocytes,
hematocrit 36.4, platelets 107.  Sodium 137, potassium 5.4,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 40, creatinine 6, glucose 74.  INR 1.2,
PT 13.3.  ALT 46, AST 29, alkaline phosphatase 164, total
bilirubin 0.4.  Calcium 8.2, phosphate 5.4, magnesium 1.9.
Sputum revealed multiple polys, oropharyngeal flora.  Sputum
and blood cultures were negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray revealed bibasilar patchy
opacities read as aspiration versus pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Pneumonia.  The patient was
continued on levofloxacin on the floor, and his oxygen
requirements improved.  At the time of this dictation he was
back to his baseline oxygen requirement of 3 liters by nasal
cannula.  Day one of levofloxacin was on [**9-17**].

2.  PULMONARY:  Status post chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation.  Respiratory care has been following
the patient, and he has been receiving nebulizers p.r.n. as
well as chest physical therapy.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Blood pressure remained somewhat low in
the 90s and low 100s.  He continued on amiodarone for his
history of ectopy secondary to human immunodeficiency virus
cardiomyopathy.  He continued on captopril and Lopressor.

4.  RENAL:  The patient continued with hemodialysis and
Renagel.

5.  PAIN:  The patient was on a baseline pain regimen of
Fentanyl patch and methadone.  We have added oxycodone p.r.n.
for breakthrough pain.

6.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS:  The patient was taking
lamivudine, stavudine, and Bactrim for prophylaxis.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient continued on Protonix and
subcutaneous heparin.

8.  ORTHOPAEDIC:  On [**9-19**], the patient fell on left hip
while trying to get to the bathroom.  X-ray revealed left
intertrochanteric fracture.  It was felt that he should go to
the operating room for surgical correction given that his
respiratory status would decline if he were to be bed ridden.
His surgery has been delayed due to the fact that he was
taken to the operating room at one point but refused at the
last minute.  A second attempt at surgery will occur on
[**9-24**].  He has designated his wife as his health care
proxy.
