History of Present Illness:
60 year old male with no PMH, non smoker, who presented to
[**Hospital6 8283**] [**9-26**] after experiencing SSCP while
working excavating and shoveling dirt. States that the pain was
sharp and crescendoed to a [**10-11**]. It was initially located on
the right side of his chest but then progressed to involve his
entire chest, without radiation to his neck, arm, or jaw. It did
not subside despite resting. It was associated with diaphoresis,
and later on with some nausea. Taken by ambulance to MVH, found
to have STs elevation in inferior and precordial leads. Given 4
ASAs, 3 sl nitro sprays, and Medivac'ed to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent
cath.
.
AT [**Hospital1 18**] ED, given 600 plavix at 1215, heparin bolus of 4000 at
1215, heparin gtt at 800u/hr. At cath, found to have TO of LAD
and diag, and 2 BMSs were deployed.
.
After his first cath he was noted to have AIVR as well as runs
of NSVT (8-12 beats), with occasional symptoms such as
lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He was started on a lidocaine
drip but continued to have NSVT. His BP began to drop and he was
started on wide open IVF for a total of approximately 1.5
liters. After this volume resuscitation he desatted to low 90's.
He was also started on a dopamine drip but was still
hypotensive. Given his symptoms he was taken back to the cath
lab when a repeat procedure showed patent stents. A spot film of
the groin showed no bleeding. His lidocaine was changed to
amiodarone. A right heart cath was performed and he was given
20mg IV lasix for what was felt to be volume overload.
.
Currently he states his CP remains much improved, approx [**1-11**].
Denies N/V/palpitation/diaphoresis. States that although he has
never had CP like this before in his life, he did note a brief
episode of self limiting CP last week while at rest.

stent.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the jailed first diagonal

Brief Hospital Course:
60M with no cardiac risk factors except +FH who presented with
acute STEMI, got PCI with with 2 BMS to LAD and diag, post-cath
with resolution of STE's but symptomatic NSVT and hypotension
leading to re-cath (no re-thrombosis). Currently stable with 2
runs of asymptomatic VT on tele.
.
1) STEMI: patient found to have large anterior MI, cathed with
stents to LAD. PAtient was hypotensive immediately after cath
with IAVR and many runs of Vtach. He was also very hypotensive.
He was recathed and found to have a caged diagnonal, but no
stent rethrombosus. He was in integrillin immediately after
cath, and heparin, which was bridged to coumadin. He was started
on ASA, plavix, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] (unable to tolerate higher
doses seconary to hypotension), lisinopril, and a statin. His
LDL is 98, his goal is below 70. An ECHO was done and showed EF
of 35-40% and apical and anterior wall hypokinesis. Patient
showing some sighns of acute systolic heart failure. He is to
f/u with his PCP later this week, and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 2
weeks.
.
2) Runs of NSVT: Patient had many runs of NSVT immediately after
MI, he was started on Lidocaine gtt for the arrythmia, with no
change, got 2 grams Mg iv, and was switched to amiodarone gtt.
he remained on this for a total of 24 hours. After this he
reverted to NSR, bradycardic with 2 runs of NSVT 5 days post MI.
He was on amiodoarine PO for several days, but this was dc/ed
because his blood pressure did not tolerated it.
.
3) Hypotension - Per hemodynamicss in cath lab, patient with
signs of mild pulmonary hypertension. Patient put out 2 L in
response to 20IV lasix in cathlab, found to be hypotensive post
cath. got fluid bolus, and was briefly on dopamine. He has
maintained pressure with systolics in high 80s-90s during
hospitalization.
.
4)abdominal pain. patient described this as gas pains. resolved
with simethicone.
