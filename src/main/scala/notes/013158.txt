Imaging:
[**8-5**] CTA Chest:

1. Eccentrically located focal right upper lobe pulmonary
embolism, age
indeterminate, but which does not have the typical appearance of
an acute
embolus.

2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with significant collapse
of the lower
lobes bilaterally.

Micro/Cytology:
[**2182-7-30**] Peritoneal fluid(ascites) negative for malignant
cells
[**2182-8-5**] Blood Culture: [**1-9**] sets w/ ABIOTROPHIA/GRANULICATELLA
SPECIES.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32400**] was admitted pre-operative for a bowel prep prior to
her planned debulking procedure for metastatic ovarian cancer.
She tolerated the procedure well; please see operative note for
full surgical details.  She was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
monitoring post-operatively.  She did well overall but her
course was complicated by pulmonary embolism, bacteremia, atrial
fibrillation and UTI.
.
#. Pulmonary Embolism: seen on CTA [**2182-8-5**] in the right middle
lobe.  Lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT.
Patient has history of Heparin allergy (severe rash with
desquamation) and thus received Arixtra postoperatively. She
developed a PE while on Aritxta, therefore she was started on
Argatroban drip per recommendations from the allergy team. She
was simultaneously started on Coumadin. She reached INR goal on
[**2182-8-12**] and Argatroban was discontinued on [**2182-8-14**]. She was
discharged on Coumadin 2.5mg PO with INR of 2.9. She should not
receive Aritxta in the future as per hematology.
.
#. Bacteremia: She had blood cultures from [**8-5**] showing
ABIOTROPHIA/GRANULICATELLA.  She was started on IV Vancomycin 1g
[**Hospital1 **] on [**2182-8-9**] and ID was consulted.  Knee plain films were
normal. TEE revealed no vegetations. She was sent home after her
last Vancomycin dose on [**2182-8-19**].
.
#. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response: In the ICU her rhythm was converted with metoprolol,
which was continued on the floor. The afib was likely
secondarily to her bacteremia and she had no further Arrythmias
noted during the rest of her hospitalization. She was continued
on metoprolol at discharge.
.
#. UTI: Urine culture on [**2182-8-15**] noted to grow Proteus Mirabilis
and was started on Bactrim on [**2182-8-18**] for 3 days. The Bactrim
was switched to Amoxicillin on [**2182-8-19**] for the remainder of the
course given the fact that Bactrim interacts with Warfarin. She
was asymptomatic.
.
She was discharged on [**2182-8-19**]. She will follow up for
chemotherapy with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for chemotherapy as an
outpatient.
