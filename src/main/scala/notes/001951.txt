Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
admission for total knee replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
total knee replacement
tracheal intubation
mechanical ventilation
cardiopulmonary resuscitation

History of Present Illness:
71yo woman with HTN, GERD and hemochromotosis treated with
periodic phlebotomy who underwent an elective right total knee
replacement for osteoarthritis on [**2132-1-28**]. The patient
was transferred from the PACU at 17:30PM. The nursing acceptance
note documents the patient was alert and oriented with stable
vital signs, and that she was given juice and jello at 2100.
During the course of the day a dilaudid epidural was placed by
anesthesia for continuing post-operative pain (T11-12 epidural
14skin/9space APS20@[**6-27**] Hydromorphone 20 mcg/ml + Bupivacaine
0.1% 1 mg/ml infused at 6-10 ml/hr). The pt was well until at
least midnight, the time of the last nursing check.
.
At 01:43, a code blue was called. On arrival to the scene, the
patient was cyanotic and cold. CPR was initiated with good
peripheral pulses appreciated. The cardiac monitor demonstrated
asystole. The patient was given two rounds of epinephrine and
atropine. A brief wide complex rhythm was obtained but was not
sustained. Another round of epinephrine and atropine was given
with establishment of an unclear wide complex rhythm without
pulse. A pulseless electrical activity code was initiated, but
she subsequently was able to establish a narrow complex
tachycardia with palpable radial pulses without any further
medications administered. BP at the time was 190/110 with heart
rate in the 120s. The length of time the patient was
unresponsive was unclear, however a perfusing pulse via CPR was
established within several minutes and a native beat was
established within 15 minutes of initiating the code. During
this time, anesthesia attempted intubation with endotracheal
tube, but was met with difficulty. There was moderate amounts of
brown aspiration material appreciated with bagging, and
difficulty with the wall suction prevented rapid intubation.
After copious suctioning, the patient was subsequently intubated
with good breath sounds bilaterally. Additional access via
femoral line was obtained. Initially the right femoral was
cannulated and dilated but a catheter was unable to be threaded;
subsequently the left femoral was accessed and a triple-lumen
catheter was placed. The patient was transported to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] by
02:30.

CXR [**1-28**]: Endotracheal tube is seen in good position.
Improvement of previously described central pulmonary vessel
prominence was likely positional.

LLE u/s: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.

CTA: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: In the most superior
aspects of the visualized field, there is an enlarged right
thyroid. Within the lungs, there are bilateral infiltrates seen
within the posterior lower lobes, along with small patchy
infiltrate seen in the posterior right upper lobe. These
infiltrates along with pulsation artifact slightly obscure the
evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary vasculature. However,
within the subsegmental and segmental pulmonary arterial
vasculature in the right lower lobe there are filling defects
consistent with pulmonary emboli. No pleural effusions or
pneumothoraces are seen. There is no evidence of pathologic
lymphadenopathy seen within the mediastinum, hilum, or axilla.
The heart and remaining great vessels are otherwise
unremarkable. This patient is status post intubation and gastric
tube placement.
Within the liver, there are two areas of low attenuation, the
first along the border of the right and left lobes measuring
approximately 30 x 21 mm and the second in the left lobe,
measuring 19 x 18 mm. Both demonstrate fluid attenuation that
probably represent liver cysts.
BONE WINDOWS: There is no evidence of lytic or sclerotic lesions
seen within the chest.
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli seen within the segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary arteries of the right lower lobe.
2. Bilateral lung infiltrates seen within the lower lobes and
posterior aspect of the right upper lobe.
3. Two areas of low attenuation seen within the liver that
likely represent liver cysts.

ECHO:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

MRI: FINDINGS: Both the diffusion and FLAIR images show high
signal throughout the cortex of both cerebral hemispheres. High
signal is also seen within the hippocampus, more evident on the
FLAIR than the diffusion-weighted sequence. There is also
possible slightly elevated signal seen within the dorsal pons on
both sequences. Taken together, these findings are consistent
with a global hypoxic/ischemic injury. There are no areas of
abnormal susceptibility seen. The principal vascular flow
patterns are identified. There is an air-fluid level within the
sphenoid sinus, presumably a result
