Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, bilateral eye swelling, and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
54yoW with h/o atypical thrombotic microangiopathy/TTP on
chronic plasmapheresis, CKD, obesity, HepB and HepC, presenting
with shortness of breath, bilateral eye swelling, and fever. She
was admitted [**7-24**]/-[**2198-7-29**], [**Date range (1) 25044**]/06 and [**Date range (1) 98602**]. During
the [**7-/2198**] admission she was treated for coagulase negative
Staph bacteremia with Vancomycin. She was then admitted with
acute on chronic renal failure. ARF was attributed to
vancomycin, and she antibiotics were changed to Linezolid. She
was again admitted for acute renal failure. The last admission
was for SOB and eye swelling. In [**7-/2198**] her right AV fistula,
used for plasmapheresis, clotted. A tunnelled left IJ was
placed; however, she developed a left IJ thrombosis, and this
line was pulled. Upper extremity U/S [**2198-8-17**] demonstrated right
subclavian and left IJ thrombus. She was treated with
antibiotics for line infection and warfarin for anticoagulation.
She also has a stent in the right subclavian to SVC. She was
without plamapheresis access and missed her last session of
plasmapheresis.
.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] w/ periorbital edema,
disorientation, found to be hypotensive in the ED, responded to
IVF.  While in the MICU, the pt was was thought to be
hypercapneic [**3-8**] obesity hypoventilation.  In addition, she was
found to be volume overloaded and aggressive diuresis was
initiated.  The initial periorbital edema was thought to be
secondary to SVC syndrome from R SC/ L IJ thromboses.  She was
continued on anticoagulation, and a MVR was recommended to
better categorize the clots.  She was initially rx with
cipro/Ceftriaxone and Linezolid for prior line infection,
possible septic thrombophlebitis, but these were then tailored
to Linezolid as monotherapy.  She was found to have ARF in the
setting of CKD, thought to be secondary to nephrotoxicity from
Vancomycin.
.
Denies pain or difficulty breathing, cannot describe the
inciting event that brought her to the hospital.  Does not have
dyspnea, but has no 02 requirement at home.   Complaining of
nausea, no vomiting.

Imaging:
CXR [**9-6**]: Mild pulmonary edema.  Interval removal of a left
central venous catheter.

L hand XRAY [**9-7**] (pt has distal radius fracture): Interval
callus formation with fracture lines still visible with
approximate neutral angulation of the distal margin of the
radius

CXR [**9-10**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Venous stent is

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo female with h/o of atypical thrombotic microangiopathy/TTP
on chronic plasmapheresis, CKD, obesity, HepB and HepC, recently
treated for bacteremia/ line infections, who initially presented
with SOB and periorbital swelling, found to be severely volume
overloaded with L IJ and R SC clots.
.
1. Heme- LIJ and RSC vein thrombosis - the patient was continued
on anticoagulation with heparin bridge to coumadin with a target
INR of [**3-9**], which was achieved on [**2198-9-11**] with an INR of 2.0. The
patient is well known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**], who followed her throughout
her admission, recommended that an MRV be done to establish
sites of future access for plasmapheresis, however the patient
exceeded the size requirement for the MR machine and was also
not willing to undergo the procedure at the level of sedation
necessary for following commands. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] also feels that the
patient can be discharged without plasmapheresis access for now
and can follow up with weekly labs to monitor for TTP relapse.
.
2. [**Doctor First Name **]/TTP- the patient is on chronic plasmapheresis for
chronic smoldering atypical TTP. She remained stable throughout
admission and plasmapheresis was held per recommendation of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] given poor access and recent line infections
.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure- the patient's baseline
creatinine was 1.9 back in [**2198-1-4**], and with aggressive
diuresis with metolazone and bumetanide, the patient's
creatinine trended down to baseline by discharge.
.
4. ID- the patient was febrile while in MICU, but was afebrile
once she was transferred to the floor with no leukocytosis.  She
was treated with empiric antibiotics for a possible PNA
secondary to physical exam findings and CXR, as well as a
previous line infection, and possible septic thrombophlebitis,
given LIJ and RSC clots in the setting of bacteremia. The last
positive blood culture was on [**8-14**]--> 2/4 bottles positive for
CNS and peptostreptococus. She was started on Linezolid and has
completed 4 weeks at time of discharge. She will be discharged
on oral Linezolid for 2 more weeks, for a total of 6 weeks of
antibiotic treatment.
.
5. Left radial fracture- cast removed, x-ray shows interval
callus formation, neutral angulation, and the patient continues
to have soft tissue swelling and mild pain. The patient was
started on alendronate, Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation.
Should follow up with ortho as an outpatient.
.
6. Hep B/Hep C- viral loads checked in [**5-/2198**], Hep B
undetectable, Hep C > 8 million.  Currently stable.  The patient
will need liver follow-up as outpatient.
.
7. Hypertension- BP meds initially held secondary to
hypotension, resumed Metoprolol and Amlodipine on [**9-9**] given BP
stability which were well-tolerated.
.
8. Anemia- secondary to [**Doctor First Name **]/TTP.  Hct was stable throughout
admission.
.
9. Elevated bicarb - the patient is likely having a contraction
alkalosis. Labs should be rechecked in
