History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 23y male admitted to the trauma
service on [**2125-5-18**] after sustaining 4 stab wounds the the right
back/axilla.  He was initially found down by a friend on his
front lawn w/ multiple stab wounds to the back, as well as
defensive wounds to the arms. He was taken to [**Hospital **] hospital
where a right sided chest tube was placed.  His hemodynamics
were
borderline unstable at the time, w/systolic BP's in the 90's.
He
received a single unit of packed cells, was intubated for
respiratory distress and O2 sats in the 70's. Subsequent to this
he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **]. On arrival he had
approximately 800mL of blood in the pleuravac and was
hemodynamically stable, he received a second unit of PRBC's in
the trauma bay. He was admitted to the TSICU and extubated on
HD1. On HD 2 his chest tube output was minimal and he was placed
to water seal, the output remained low and the chest tube was
d/c'd on [**5-20**]. On [**5-21**] he had increased respiratory distress as
well as increase in infiltrate and effusion on the right.  A
chest tube was then replaced. A chest CT was performed on [**5-23**],
this demonstrated a moderate sized posterior fluid collection as
well as consolidation of the right lower lobe with no evidence
of
pneumothorax. Thoracic surgery at this point was consulted for
management of the patient's hemothorax. He had no outstanding
trauma issues at the time of consultation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the trauma service on [**2125-5-18**].
[**5-18**] Extubated; serial Hcts stable; held overnight in ICU due to
SOB.
[**5-19**] Transferred to floor, CT to water seal, foley d/c'd.
[**5-20**] Increased PTX, CT back to suction. No significant output,
so CT pulled.
[**5-21**] CT chest done, small R PTX and hemothorax; new chest tube
placed to suction.
[**5-22**] Adjusted pain meds; ambulated.
[**5-23**] CT placed to water seal; CT chest done, showing unchanged R
PTX and hemothorax. Thoracics consulted.
[**5-24**] CXR with worsening R PTX. Thoracentesis by IP, drained
300cc of old thick blood.
[**5-25**] Stable, awaiting to go to OR with thoracics.

On [**5-26**] the patient was taken to the operating room for a right
VATS washout, evacuation of hemothorax.  The patient was noted
to have, a fair amount of clot and fibrin as well as old blood
in the chest. Two chest tubes were placed and the patient was
admitted to the floor post-operatively.  His diet was advanced
and he was tolerating regular diet on POD1, his pain was
controlled with IV medications, this was transitioned to PO.
Chest tube outputs were monitored daily as well as vital signs
and urine output. On POD #2 the posterior chest tube was d/c'd,
and a CXR was completed showing a small apical pneumothorax.  On
POD#3 the anterobasilar chest tube was discontinued, a CXR was
obtained.  The patient was deemed fit for discharge on POD #3,
at that time his pain was controlled with PO medications, he was
ambulatory, voiding, tolerating a regular diet, and breathing
without distress.
