CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman

blood in stools.  Patient states that she first noticed a
small amount of blood approximately one month ago when she
was living in a rehab facility.  Patient had no history of
pain, but had noticed loose stools previous to that point.
Patient was evaluated by the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab house officer and
managed expectantly.

As the problem had not resolved over the following few weeks,
the patient was sent for a colonoscope, which revealed a 6 cm
circumferentiated mass in her colon.  Patient denies any
fever or chills, weight loss, night sweats, headache,
shortness of breath, cough, bloating, dysuria, hematuria,
jaundice.  Patient only endorses positive nausea, but states
that she feels well, and denies any current vomiting or
abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Patient was afebrile.  Temperature of 98.0,
pulse 53, blood pressure of 160/62, and breathing 12 times
per minute, and 98% on room air.  In general exam, she was
alert and oriented times two, not to be place, nonambulatory
in no distress.  There was no rash, no jaundice noted.
HEENT:  There was no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly
appreciated.  Her carotids ...... 2+ bruit.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive.  Pulmonary:  Positive for right
lower lobe crackles, otherwise were clear to auscultation
bilaterally, no wheezes were noted.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, no rubs or gallops, 1-2/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.  Rectal exam was guaiac
positive, normal tone.  Lower extremities revealed no
erythema or edema.

The patient was admitted to the Blue Surgical service with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] as the attending.  The patient was placed on IV
fluids and scheduled for colonoscopy in the morning.  In
preparation for possible surgical intervention, the patient
was seen by Cardiology on [**5-4**], who had recommended an
echocardiogram and starting of aspirin.  In the preoperative
days following the admission, the patient had a chest x-ray,
which revealed marked improvement in congestive heart failure
with linear opacities towards the lung bases.

The patient underwent stress testing on [**5-4**], which
revealed an EKG with evidence of a prior myocardial
infarction.  During the testing there was no ST segment
changes over the baseline abnormalities.  The patient had no
anginal symptoms and no ischemic EKG changes.

On the following day, [**5-5**], the patient underwent a
transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of
approximately 45%.  There was mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.

Still in the preoperative operative, the patient underwent a
colonoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  The colonoscopy
revealed a high grade obstruction in the rectum that the
scope was unable to pass through it.  It was determined that
the patient should be worked up for a left colectomy.

To further evaluate the mass within the left rectum, the
patient underwent a transrectal ultrasound, which revealed a
rectal mass with an extension beyond the muscularis propria
and therefore considered to be a T3 lesion.  There is also a
single lymph node along the left lateral aspect of the
rectum, which had a dimension of 2.8 mm.

Over the next couple of days, the patient continued to do
well with no complaints and to complete her cardiac workup
prior to surgery, the patient underwent a thallium stress
test, which revealed a hypokinesis of the inferior wall that
was moderate and reversible.

On the day of the patient's surgery, [**2198-5-8**], the
patient underwent CAT scan to further delineate the extent of
the mass.  The results were as follows:  A circumferential
enhancing mass noted in the rectum measuring up to 6 mm in
thickness.  Multiple colonic diverticula, enumerable
diverticula noted in the sigmoid colon, and resultant in
sigmoid wall thickening.

On [**5-8**], the patient underwent a low anterior
resection, coloproctostomy, feeding jejunostomy.  The
procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**] and assisted by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  There were no complications during the
procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The
patient did require a Swan-Ganz catheter for continuous
monitoring of the SvO2 and as the patient did require a
dobutamine early in the case with a cardiac output dropping
from 2.0 to 1.3.  The dobutamine stayed at a low dose of 5
mcg/minute.

The patient was returned to the recovery room in good
condition, and after a brief stay in the PACU, the patient
was transferred up to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

In the PACU, the patient continued her recovery.  Placed on a
nitroglycerin drip and with a Demerol epidural.  The
patient's epidural needs to be changed over to a
Dilaudid/bupivacaine solution for an increase in pain
control.  From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient's
systolic blood pressure remained high in the 130s-180s, and
was controlled with nitroglycerin drip.

During her stay in the PACU, the patient was slowly weaned
off her nitroglycerin drip for a cuff pressure of less than
170.  The patient tolerated this well and there were no
difficulties.

By postoperative day #3, the patient was completely off her
nitroglycerin drip and blood pressure was controlled with IV
hydralazine.  Her J tube was draining a dark green fluid at
this time, and tube feeds were started at 1.5 strength Impact
with fiber at 10 cc/hour.

By postoperative day #5, the patient had her epidural removed
and pain was controlled only with IV Morphine as needed.

The patient was then transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #5.  Patient continued her recovery on the
surgical floor and did very well.  Patient had brief episodes
of confusion, but these resolved with the presence of a
sitter in the room, and constant contact with the nurses.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, the blood pressure was well
controlled on IV medications.  By postoperative day #7, the
patient had two bowel movements and the patient's diet was
advanced to include sips of clear liquid diet and increase in
the tube feeds.  The patient continued to do well and was
able to tolerate tube feeds at 40 and clears adlib by
postoperative day #8.  Patient was started on soft solids and
cycling of her tube feeds in the following days, and then
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on postoperative day #10.

During the patient's stay in the hospital, the pathology from
her surgical procedure was finalized.  The results are as
follows:  1. Colonic mucosal biopsies revealed no convincing
features of malignancy are identified.  2. Highest node
revealed fragment of fibrovascular and adipose tissue, no
lymph nodal tissue identified.  3. Sigmoid revealed A)
diverticulosis, B) no diagnostic abnormalities recognized at
the resection of the margins, C) lymph nodes, no evidence of
malignancy.  4. Resection of rectosigmoid colon revealed
adenocarcinoma.  The adenocarcinoma was low grade invading
through the muscularis propria int
