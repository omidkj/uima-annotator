Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: SOB/hypoxia
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Unable to wean off non-rebreather

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
86 yo F with a h/o CVA, HTN, and dementia admitted from her
nursing home with respiratory distress.  The patient is unable
to provide much history, but nursing home staff reports she
seemed short of breath x ?4 days and questioned possible
aspiration.  She was found to be hypoxic (90% on 5L NC), was
given O2 and morphine and sent by ambulance to the ED.
.
Initial ED vitals were T 103(rectal) BP 140/96  HR 104 RR 25 O2
sat 99% on NRB.  Exam was notable for tachypnea and accessory
muscle use.  Labs notable for WBC of 16.4, trop 0.14, and
lactate of 2.4. EKG with no significant change from prior, CXR
unrevealing, and U/A with no sign of infection.  CTA showed no
sign of PE, LLL and RLL atelectasis.  She was given IV
vancomycin and cefepime and 300cc NS with meds.  Vitals on
transfer were 102.8 84  118/59  30  100%on NRB. Weaning to 3L NC
was attempted, but sats dropped to high 80's.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is very sleepy and unable
to answer questions.  She is in mild respiratory distress.
.
Review of systems:  unable to obtain due to patient's mental

CXR ([**8-29**]):
FINDINGS: Please note the lateral lower left chest has been
excluded from
view. Again noted is a markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm
occupying the
inferior half of the right hemithorax. There is also significant
volume loss of the left hemithorax as well. Ill-defined
opacities project over the cardiac silhouette likely signifying
left lower lobe atelectasis. Of the aerated lung seen, there is
no consolidation or superimposed edema noted. The trachea is
midline. There is marked aortic tortuosity. Mitral annulus
calcification is incidentally noted. The cardiac silhouette size
is difficult to assess but is grossly stable. Blunting of the
right costophrenic angle is again noted and stable. There may be
a small underlying effusion. No left effusion is noted. The
bones are diffusely osteopenic.

IMPRESSION: Numerous limitations but grossly stable x-ray
examination. There is slight increased density in the
retrocardiac left lower lobe, which may be due to atelectasis in
light of even further volume loss.

CTA Chest ([**8-29**]):
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Marked right hemidiaphragm elevation with resulting marked
atelectasis of the right lower lobe, which may be chronic.
3. Soft tissue within the left main stem bronchus may be
secretions, but an endobronchial mass is not excluded. A repeat
CT of the chest could be
performed after deep suction to distinguish between these two
possibilities.  Alternatively, bronchoscopy could be performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 86 yoF with h/o multiple
CVAs and vascular dementia admitted with hypoxia.

# Hypoxia:  Presents with acute hypoxia with new oxygen
requirement slowly improved through her MICU course.  CT chest
showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with possible aspiration
pneumonia vs pneumonitis in the setting of a fever and
leukocytosis.  She has a history of chronic aspiration and given
she is from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, she was covered broadly for HCAP vs
Aspiration Pneumonia.  Her daughter (HCP) would like her to
return to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab as soon as possible, and she had a PICC
placed this morning in anticipation of discharge back to rehab
today with a 8 day course of Vanc/Cefepime/Doxycycline.  Speech
and swallow assessed her yesterday for aspiration but their exam
was limited by her mental status and ability to cooperate.
.
# Decreased Hct:  Patient with hct which trended from 36 to 31
(baseline 35-36) in the setting of receiving multiple NS
boluses, with all cell lines are down.  [**Month (only) 116**] be dilutional with a
component of lab variation. HCT was stable on recheck prior to
discharge.
.
# Elevated troponin: No complaints of chest pain although
assessment limited by dementia.  ECG showed no significant
change from prior, cardiology was consulted in the ED
recommended continuing to trend CE??????s.  Likely [**1-31**] demand
ischemia due to tachycardia and respiratory distress. Troponins
trending downwards prior to d/c.
.
# Airway secretions: Has significant issues with controlling
secretions and aspiration at baseline. She will continue home
scopolamine patch.
.
# Goals of Care: Her daughter (HCP) feels transfer to hospital
is disturbing for her mom and causes her to feel stressed. She
would like to discuss options to treat in place, offer comfort
medications prn. She understands her mother may have further SOB
with aspiration events.
