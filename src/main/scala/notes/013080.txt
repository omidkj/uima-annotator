Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
61F with history of obesity hypoventilation, trached
chronically, CHF EF >60% 4/12, presents with hypoxia at home
today when checked by her [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 269**]. She denies any acute symptoms, no
chest pain, no SOB, but when asked, says she feels fluid
overloaded, and similar to prior CHF exacerbations. No fevers,
no chills.
.
She was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**11/2126**] for hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring intubation and tracheostomy. She
was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] and she was weaned of the vent. She was
managed at rehab with red capping during the day and passe muir
valve at night with humidified air. She was then readmitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**3-/2127**] after routine visit to PCP where she was found to
be volume overloaded. She was initially admitted to the MICU due
to transient hypotension and then was transferred back to the
MICU after triggering for hypoxia on the floor. During this
admission she was also restarted on sildenafil for her pulmonary
hypertension. She was diuresed with IV lasix and discharged on
lasix 40 mg po daily. She was admitted [**Date range (1) **] with nausea,
abdominal pain, dyspnea and SOB. After nebulizer treatments, she
was persistently hypoxic to the 70s-80s on FiO2 of 100%. Patient
was then started on BiPAP 12/5 FiO2 60% with improved sats to
93%. Patient then became somnolent and desatted to 70s-80s. She
was evaluated by respiratory and placed on CMV with TV 350 PEEP
10 FiO2 60% and sat 100%. Blood pressures also dropped to
70s-80s and considered starting peripheral levo but did not.
Patient refused central access and ABGs that admission.
.
In the ED, VS 98.2, 92, 127/87, 22, 85/6L. She was placed on
bipap. Labs notable for 144/4.2/96/36/38/2.2<170. BNP was [**Numeric Identifier **].
WBC was 11.2 with 91 N, Hct 37.4, Platelets 298. Troponin was
0.04. VBG: 7.34/73/55/bicarb 41 with a lactate of 1.3. Declined
ABG. EKG was nonspecific.
.
She given Furosemide 40mg IV X 1. She was given Nitroglycerin
and qickly dropped her SBPs 102-> 80s so it was stopped. She was
noted to never look to be in respiratory distress. VS on
transfer were 105/70, HR 100, 97% possibly on [**5-3**], RR 20s. Never
febrile.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she states that she currently feels like
her normal self. Her daughter is present for discussion and
states that she did not think that her mom looked well yesterday
and may have been having difficulty with her breathing but
overall did not look good. Both state that she did not increase
her lasix to [**Hospital1 **] dosing as suggested by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3029**] (daughter
states change not made due to cost). She has been on 2-3L NC at
home wihtout fevers or chills. There were no other recent
medication changes. Ms. [**Known lastname **] states that she had increased her
oral fluid intake the past few days, without reason and has been
drinking a larger amount of cranberry juice, water and tea.
.
She was seen by IP on [**5-27**] and discussion was had to defer to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 101574**] [**Name (STitle) 101575**] to change to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] T or because of
needed nocturnal ventilation stay with a tracheostomy.
.
Her weight on admission to the floor is 114 kg ( 250.8 lbs). Her
most recent discharge weight was 119 kg.  Her outpatient weights
have been 249 lbs and 251.4 lbs in OMR.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2127-6-2**] Urine culture: no growth
[**2127-6-2**] Blood culture: no growth to date
.
IMAGING:
[**2127-6-2**] CXR: Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. A
tracheostomy tube is seen. As on prior study, cardiomegaly and
pulmonary edema is re-demonstrated. There is no large pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Evaluation for subtle superimposed
pneumonia is limited. Mediastinal contour is stably widened.
Bony structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Overall stable exam with pulmonary edema
