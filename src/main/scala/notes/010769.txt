Left Cardiac Catheterization
EGD with esophageal dilation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 467**] is an 86 y.o. woman with HTN, known significant 3v
CAD, CHF with an LVEF of 45% admitted to Lakes [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital
on [**2178-7-28**] with difficulty swallowing, found to have esophageal
impaction, now transferred for NSTEMI. Patient lives alone and
is independent in her ADLs. She denies history of trouble
swallowing. Patient states that she ate cereal for breakfast on
the morning of [**7-28**], and noted that she was unable to swallow
even her own saliva acutely afterwards. She presented to [**Location (un) 59322**] Hospital and underwent scope with retrieval of food.
Patient subsequently developed chest discomfort typical for her
anginal symptoms, slight ST depressions on EKG, and ruled in for
NSTEMI with troponins of 0.03, 1.62 and 2.04 this AM. She was
started on Lovenox and is currently pain-free. Of note, patient
is currently receiving IV protonix and IV antibiotics for
suspected aspiration pneumonia (WBC of 14.4 this am, extensive
opacification of the left lung on CXR). Patient is being
transferred for further treatment of suspected aspiration
pneumonia and management of her NSTEMI. Patient was alert and
oriented x3 and afebrile at time of transfer, with BP 94/43, HR
80, O2sat 94% on 2L NC.
.
Patient has had significant 3v CAD since [**2164**], and was
successfully managed medically until [**2174**]. The most recent cath
was performed on [**2174-4-18**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center, where she
was found to have 90% first diagonal stenosis, 60-70% second
diagonal stenosis, a 90% mid LAD lesion, an 80% OM-3 lesion and
diffusely diseased LCx and RCA.  She subsequently had a balloon
angioplasty of the LAD but lost flow to the very apical LAD with
the Grand Slam wire.
.
ROS: Patient endorses chronic joint pain secondary to
osteoarthritis and dry cough from Lisinopril. She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for some shortness of
breath with exertion and chronic mild ankle swelling R > L. No
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 98.6  HR: 75 SR  BP: 120/78  Sats: 95% RA  Wt: 141.9
General: sitting up in chair no apparent distress
HEENT: normocephalic mucus membranes moist
Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy
Card: RRR normal S1, S2 no murmur/gallop or rub

Extr: warm 1+ edema
Neuro: non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2178-7-29**] CXR: Cardiac size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous.
Fine ill-defined opacity in the left mid lung is consistent with
aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural
effusions are small better seen in the lateral view.  Multiple
compression fractures are in the thoracic spine.
[**2178-8-17**]  mild increase in the atelectatic change in the right
lower lung.

[**2178-8-18**] Esophagus study no leak

[**2178-8-10**] Chest CT: Subtotal resorption of pneumomediastinum. No
newly occurred esophageal rupture. The occluded rupture site
appears unremarkable, with a left lateral sequela of fluid
collection that has, however, decreased. Increased bilateral
pleural effusions, no relevant changes in the lung parenchyma.
Unchanged aspect of the large mediastinal vessels.

[**2178-8-4**] IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically guided dual-lumen PowerPICC line placement via
the right basilic venous approach. Final internal length is 37
cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

[**2178-8-3**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
NSTEMI: Patient with report of chest pressure consistent with
her typical anginal symptoms following endoscopy, new slight ST
depressions and positive, upward trending troponins (max 2.04
[**7-29**] AM) consistent with NSTEMI. EKG showed poor R wave
progression in lateral leads suggestive of septal ischemia
versus infarct. Vital signs were stable upon arrival. Cardiac
enzymes were cycled q8h initially and were downward trending
(TropT 0.17 to 0.14). Aspirin was increased to 325mg daily, and
statin was increased to Atorvastatin 80mg daily. Lovenox therapy
initiated at OSH was continued until noon on [**7-30**]. Patient was
continued on Plavix 75mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], Isosorbide
Dinitrate 60mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  Patient
underwent cardiac catheterization for evaluation of CAD on [**7-31**]
with imaging of left heart circulation; no intervention was
undertaken.  Once her PO intake was resumed she was started on
lopressor 25 mg tid, Isordil 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], ASA 325 mg.  Restart
Lisinopril as an outpatient.
.
Pulmonary: On [**2178-8-11**] CXR film a right lower effusion was noted.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and 200 ml of
serosanguineous fluid was drained. A Pigtail was placed which
continued to drain and subsquently was removed on [**2178-8-18**] once
the esophageal leak resolved.
.
# DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING: Patient without history of difficulty
swallowing, however presented to OSH with esophageal impaction.
Unknown etiology at this time. Patient has been able to swallow
both soft foods and thin liquids since
