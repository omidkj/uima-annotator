Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Patient had a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2112-7-11**], performed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], to observe the patency of the stent
previously placed in his left mainstem bronchus for invasive
esophageal cancer. Report stated that the stent was
approximately 50% obstructed by tumor/granulation tissue, and
showed proximal migration of the
stent into the trachea, jailing the right mainstem bronchus. No
significant change was noted from previuos bronchoscopy on
[**2112-6-20**]. Recommendations were close surveillance with a follow
up bronchoscopy in two weeks. Removal of the stent was not
recommended due to tumor ingrowth, and balloon dilation of the
stent would be considered if the patient continued to have
problems with airway obstruction.


History of Present Illness:
78M w/ esophageal CA (s/p resection and stent placement),
prostate CA, and GERD presenting from an OSH after admission for
respiratory failure. He was in his USOH until [**7-7**] when he
became acutely dyspneic. He was intubated in the field by EMS
and sent to an OSH where he was dx w/ MRSA PNA (ceftaz/azithro
-> zosyn/azithro/vanco -> vanco alone). He failed extubation
twice between [**7-7**] -> [**7-10**] because of secretions but was
extubated successfully prior to transfer on [**7-10**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent repeat broncoscopy showing a proximal
migration of his stent w/ near-complete obstruction of the R
mainstem bronchus. No intervention was attempted given the fact
that there little change from his previous bronch in [**6-16**] and
significant tumor ingrowth over the stent. He tolerated the
procedure well w/out need for intubation and was called out to
medicine for further management.


Past Medical History:
- Esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy [**4-12**]
with recurrence [**2110**], currently undergoing chemotherapy
- s/p left mainstem bronchus stenting [**2-17**] [**2-12**] tumor invasion,
complicated by cardiogenic shock, bronch in [**6-16**] revealed some
proximal stent migration and nonobstructive (50-60% of lumen)
tumor growth at the distal end of the stent
- Prostate CA s/p XRT (dx ~10 years ago), currently on Casodex
and Zoladex
- Throat cancer in [**2096**] s/p radiation and surgery
- GERD


Social History:
The patient [**Doctor Last Name **] with family ( wife and grand-daughter). He is
a vacuum system mechanic,and was in the Navy before that.
Patient reports being exposed to asbestos about 30 years prior,
during his time in Navy shipyards. Patient admitted to ETOH use,
approximately 4 cans per day. He has a 25 pack/year history of
tobacco use, but quit in [**2096**].


Family History:
Patient had a brother who died of esophageal cancer at age 65.
Patient also mentioned that multiple deceased family members had
carried a diagnosis of cancer,but he could not recall the
specifics.

[**7-10**] UPRIGHT AP CHEST: A left central catheter has been placed
via the subclavian approach, with the tip overlying the left
side of the superior mediastinum and aorta. The left main stem
bronchus stent protrudes into the trachea, at the carina. No
pneumothorax is seen. There is a left pleural effusion, moderate
and left lower lobe atelectasis. The right lateral costophrenic
angle is excluded from the image, but appears blunted were seen.
There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Probable arterial central catheter placement. This finding
was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] at the time of interpretation on
[**7-12**].
2. Left effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.

[**7-13**] Chest CT. IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of mediastinal metastatic disease, including
lymphadenopathy and mediastinal and left hilar mass.

2. Progression of narrowing of left segmental bronchi distal to
left mainstem bronchial stent.

3. Mixed interval behavior of pulmonary metastases, with
individual nodules appearing stable to equivocally increased,
but with increased left upper lobe opacity, possibly suggestive
of lymphangitic spread of tumor.

[**7-13**] ECG Sinus rhythm with ventricular and atrial premature
beats. No significant change
compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-10**]


Brief Hospital Course:
At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent repeat broncoscopy showing a proximal
migration of his stent w/ near-complete obstruction of the R
mainstem bronchus. No intervention was attempted given the fact
that there little change from his previous bronch in [**6-16**] and
significant tumor ingrowth over the stent. He tolerated the
procedure well w/out need for intubation and was called out to
medicine for further management.
.
On the floor, the patient was stable and w/out significant
complaints. He was continued on IV Vancomycin for his MRSA
pneumonia. He notes that his breathing is much better than it
was at home and he denied any CP, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea,
weakness, paresthesias, HA, or dizziness.  He developed
tachycardia up to 150's on [**7-13**], unclear whether sinus or not.
Tachycardia was ubnresponsive to fluid bolus.  the paient was
asymptomatic throughout episode.  He was transferred to MICU,
given Metoprolol 25mg TID, and his HR dropped to 80s.  He has
been stable in the 80's since receiving metoprolol.
Radiation Oncology consulted with the patient, and after
reviewing his old records, and discussing the patient's goals of
treatment, it was decided not to proceed with further radiation.
 The patient was transferred back to the floor, where he
remained stable.  He had one episode of a 12 beat run of VT on
[**7-14**].  He was completely asymptomatic, without chest pain or
hypotension. His metoprolol was increased to 37.5mg PO tid, and
he did not have any further runs of VT on [**7-15**].  The patient's
breathing and cough continued to be a problem, and were both
relieved with nebulizers, saline mask, mucinex, guafenesin with
codeine.  On [**7-15**], the patient was discharged per his request.
He was afebrile, with stable vital signs. He was instructed to
follow-up with interventional pulmonology, and to continue a
course of linezolid.
