MICRO:

IMAGING:
[**2124-10-8**]: CXR. Interval decrease in right basilar opacity with
residual mild opacity remaining. 2. Patchy left lower lobe
opacity, atelectasis/consolidation, grossly stable to possibly
slightly decreased.
.
[**2124-10-8**]: CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis:
1. Pancolitis with relative sparing of the descending colon. No
evidence of perforation, pneumatosis or portal venous air.
However, there is extensive atherosclerotic calcification
involving the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] raising concern for
ischemic colitis. Colitis may be ischemic, infectious or
inflammatory.
2. Gallbladder sludge and distention without secondary signs to
suggest acute cholecystitis. Clinical correlation recommended.

3. Bilateral lower lobe consolidations consistent with stated
history of pneumonia.
.
[**2124-10-10**]: TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with ECHO report [**2122-3-27**], the severity of mitral
regurgitation has decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
SICU Course ([**Date range (3) 38845**]): Pt was admitted to the
transplant/SICU team for evaluation and management of acute
abdomen and concern for ischemic colitis. CT abdomen [**2124-10-8**]
demonstrated pancolitis. Pt was C. diff positive and started on
IV flagyl and PO vanco on [**2124-10-8**]. UCx demonstrated enterococcus
and she was started on augmentin ([**2124-10-10**]) which was changed to
unasyn [**2124-10-12**] when her WBC increased from 17-->26.9. Pt also
went into new onset A-fib with RVR. She was put on diltiazem
drip which was transitioned to PO metoprolol with intermittent
IV boluses of lopressor. HR remained ~80 on PO metoprolol 50mg
TID. Pt's isosorbide mononitrate held in setting of metoprolol
increase with SBP 100-120s. TTE done [**2124-10-10**] demonstrated  LVEF
>55%, No AS, No AR and there was no comment of vegetations.
Finally, her INR was supra-therapeutic (5.3 on admission, peaked
at 7.3 on [**2124-10-10**]) given interactions between coumadin and
antibiotics so coumadin held and she was given 10mg PO vitamin
K. INR today is 2.3. Renal saw patient and she continued
[**Date Range 2286**] [**Date Range 12075**] via right AV fistula. Pt was transferred to the
medical floor on [**2124-10-12**] for further evaluation and management.
.
Medical course ([**Date range (3) 38846**]):
.
# C. diff colitis: Pt completed 7 day IV flagyl course. PO vanco
was started [**2124-10-8**] and will continue for 1 week after discharge
(end [**2124-10-25**]). Her abdominal pain and diarrhea improved
throughout her hospitalization and she was able to eat without
difficulty.
.
# Enterococcus UTI - Pt started on augmentin [**2124-10-10**], broadened
to unasyn [**2124-10-12**] as above, completing 7 day course without
recurrence of symptoms.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - New onset this admission. Per ECHO, pt
not with decompensated CHF and no evidence of ACS (troponins
likely elevated due to renal disease). Rate controlled with HR
~80s throughout hospitalization with metoprolol 50mg TID s/p
diltiazem drip in SICU. INR at discharge remained
supratherapeutic (supratherapeutic on admission) and coumadin
was held. Plan is to check INR daily and re-initiate coumadin
when INR<3.
.
# ESRD - on HD [**Month/Day/Year 12075**] with right AV fistula. Pt's sevelamer was
stopped in setting of delirium earlier in hospital course and
restarted on discharge with plan to monitor phosphate.
.
# Type II DM - on insulin; HbA1c 6.1 on [**2123-2-16**]. Current
status unknown. Pt was continued on NPH 10 units at breakfast
per home regimen and controlled on Humalog ISS with FSBS
100-160.
.
# HTN - Initially well controlled on amlodipine, metoprolol and
hydralazine with SBP 100-120 (occassional 150 most likely
pre-meds). Her isosorbide mononitrate was held in SICU in
setting of increasing metoprolol. During hospital course, SBP
was noted to be <100 and pt not receiving many meds. Hydralazine
was stopped with SBP 120-130.
.
# Back pain - pt complained
