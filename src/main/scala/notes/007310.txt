CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash, low grade fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year-old
man who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 69**]
in early [**2193-6-1**] and was found to have MSSA bacteremia.  At

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Russian speaking gentleman
who lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 86**].  Their daughter is a physician
at [**Hospital6 **].  Both the patient and his wife are
retired mathematicians.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initially physical examination the
patient had a temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 136/76,
heart rate 76, respiratory rate 24 and oxygen saturation 95%
on room air.  In general, he was an elderly gentleman
appearing his stated age sleeping in no apparent distress.
His mucous membranes are moist.  He had no lymphadenopathy or
JVD.  His heart rhythm was irregular.  He had a normal S1 and
S2.  There was a [**2-6**] holosystolic murmur at the upper sternal
border bilaterally and there are no rubs or gallops.  He had
scattered rhonchi bilaterally and pulmonary auscultation.
His abdomen was mildly distended.  There was normoactive
bowel sounds and there was mild left lower quadrant
tenderness.  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses
bilaterally.  His extremities were warm and there was no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He had petechial lesions on his
lower extremities greater in his upper extremities
bilaterally.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 5.3, hematocrit
31.9, platelet count 222.  The differential demonstrates 60%
neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 6.6% eosinophils
and .4% basophils.  His PT was 11.7, PTT 31.6, INR 0.9.
Initial serum chemistries sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride
106, bicarb 16, BUN 60, creatinine 3.1, glucose 116.  ALT 28,
AST 65, alkaline phosphatase 238, amylase 157, lipase 57, T
bili 2.9.

Given his mildly elevated liver enzymes an abdominal ultrasound
was performed in the Emergency Department.  This study
demonstrated no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no
hydronephrosis, a cholestic structure of the lateral segment
of the left hepatic lobe, gallstones, a small amount of ascites
and a small right sided pleural effusion.  Chest x-ray
demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions and slight
worsening congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION:  Given the patient's presentation with the petechial
rash, low grade fevers, peripheral eosinophils, elevated serum
creatinine and onset of symptoms ten to twelve days after
Oxacillin was started the presumptive diagnosis was Oxacillin
induced acute interstitial nephritis.  Urine eosinophils and a
urine sodium were sent.  Given the recent increase in the
patient's Furosemide dose from 20 to 40 the possibility of
prerenal azotemia was considered and urine electrolytes were
sent.  Given his acute renal failure the patient's Furosemide and
Lisinopril were held, Oxacillin was discontinued and Levaquin was
started.  Although the rash was most likely secondary to
Oxacillin induced AIN, given the associated acute renal failure
and low grade fever the possibility of vasculitis was considered
and serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent.  Aside from the above the
patient was continued on all of his outpatient medications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the evening of hospital day number two the
patient developed chest pain in conjunction with JVD and
bilateral crackles.  Sublingual nitroglycerin relieved the pain
slightly.  Chest x-ray showed increased bibasilar haziness.  No
acute changes were noticed on electrocardiogram.  Arterial blood
gas was performed, which showed 7.29/37/99 on 3 liters oxygen by
nasal cannula.  He was assumed to be in acute congestive heart
failure and diuresed with good symptomatic relief.  He ruled out
by cardiac enzymes during this time period as well.  On hospital
day number three the patient's urinalysis showed eosinophils
supporting a diagnosis of AIN.  Hemolysis panel came back
negative.  Serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] tests were negative as well. Urine
electrolytes showed a sodium of 53, therefore the possibility of
prerenal azotemia was felt to be less likely. The night of
hospital day number three the patient became tachypneic with
respiratory at 38, oxygen saturation 86% on room air.  A chest x-
ray again showed bilateral pulmonary edema with effusions, which
increased a magnitude from a chest x-ray done earlier that
afternoon.  There were no changes on electrocardiogram.  Arterial
blood gas showed 7.12/58/107/19.  The patient had no urine output
to a total of 70 mg intravenous Lasix, and he was subsequently
intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia.  He was then
transferred to the MICU where he became hypotensive and
transiently required pressors to maintain his blood pressure.

Serum chemistries done on the morning after transfer to the MICU
demonstrated an increase in anion gap metabolic acidosis.  He
also showed worsening uremia with a BUN of 71 and a creatinine of
3.6.  He was therefore started on intravenous steroids for
empiric therapy of AIN as well as bicarb to increase his serum
pH.  Given his hypotension the resulting concern for sepsis the
patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened with the addition of
Vancomycin to Levofloxacin.  By hospital day number five the
patient was off pressors.  His creatinine was up to four.  He was
continued on steroids and bicarb and he was started on Furosemide
drip with Dyazide diuretics for clinically apparent congestive
heart failure exacerbation.  He was also started on Hydralazine
for after load reduction.  By hospital day number six diuretics
were held.  Serum creatinine increased to 4.8.  A trial of
weaning the patient off ventilators was not attempted secondary
to his metabolic acidosis.  Given a hematocrit of 21.9 the
patient was transfused 2 units with appropriate increase in
hematocrit.  An echocardiogram demonstrated no change from the
same study done in [**Month (only) **] of this year.  The patient was also
started on tube feeds.

On hospital day number seven a right Quinton catheter was placed
and the patient was initiated on hemodialysis.  Blood cultures
were drawn, which came back positive for yeast.  He was then
started on Fluconazole renally dosed and the PICC line was
pulled.  Urine sputum and fungal isolates were drawn on [**2193-6-29**],
which came back negative at the time, but the patient had
increasing thick oral secretions and therefore an ID consult was
obtained.  ID Service felt the patient should be started on
Vancomycin for a treatment of MMSA bacteremia and that Levaquin
should be stopped.  He was also continued on Fluconazole, which
later speciated and deemed to be a contaminat
