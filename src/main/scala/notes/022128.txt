History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70197**] symptoms began 2 weeks ago when she experienced
sudden, severe pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen;
the pain did not radiate to any other part of her body, was not
precipitated by the intake of food, and became worse on deep
inspiration. She immediately called her rheumatologist, who,
after discussion over the phone, advised her to increase the
dose of her prednisolone (her lupus was controlled with
methotrexate, low-dose prednisolone, and Planquenil). After
following these instructions, she felt healthy for 2-3 days,
after which the pain returned with a new onset of
breathlessness. The pain was similar in nature to the first
episode, and she felt like she could not take deep breaths
because of it.  The breathlessness was not associated with any
chest pain or cough; it did not increased upon lying down, but,
rather, was directly associated with the inability to fully
inspire due to the abdominal pain. This episode was also
associated with profuse sweating, but she reported no fever.
.
Upon further follow-up with her rheumatologist, her prednisolone
dosage was increased and she did not have a full-blown attack of
her previously-stated symptoms.
.
During the night of [**2186-6-24**], her symptoms re-appeared,
prompting a visit to [**Hospital 189**] hospital emergency room. She was put
on a face mask and oxygen, and a chest x-ray and CT-angio of the
chest were performed, both of which were negative. She was told
that she was suffering from a lupus flare-up and could leave,
but within 10 minutes developed nausea and vomitting; the
vomitus was yellow in color and contained food. After resting in
the ED for two hours, she went home. During a visit to the
bathroom, she lost consciousness while urinating; her husband
told her she was shaking and her eyes were rolled upwards. She
was not biting her tongue or frothing at the mouth. She refused
going to a hospital. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then healthy until
[**2186-6-27**], when she visited her rheumatologist. Upon
examination, she was found to have bilateral lower limb edema
and so was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
.
Of note, she claims to have had hematuria with no dysuria, in
addition to arthalgia in the large and small joints of her upper
limbs. She did not have any history of chest pain, palpitations
or productive cough. Furthermore, she had no changes in weight,
no loss of appetite, or diarrhea.
.
Her workup in the ED, where she had vital signs of Temp: 96.8
HR: 85 BP: 115/70 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 99, and on the medical floor
included a RUQ u/s that showed gallstones but no cholecystitis,
as well as a HIDA scan that was similarly negative for
cholecystitis.  CT of her abdomen/pelvis showed possible
hepatitis, ascites, colitis, and pelvic fluid. She had LENI's
that were negative for DVT, and CTA that showed no pulmonary
embolism. Surgery was consulted in the ED for potential
cholecystitis. GI was consulted for her abdominal pain, which
was attributed to intermittent vasospasm from scleroderma.
Rheumatology was consulted, and recommended continuing with
increased dose steroids and hydroxychloroquine.
.
On [**2186-6-29**], the floor staff was unable to measure an oxygen
saturation, and a blood gas (likely venous) was obtained,
showing mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, with an
elevated lactate. CXR was unchanged from prior. She was
transferred to the ICU on a non-rebreather mask, and shortly
thereafter, she was able to maintain stable oxygen saturations
with moderate-flow nasal cannula (3-4 L/min). Her vital signs
upon arrival at the ICU were On the floor her vitals were: HR:
106, O2Sat: 95%, RR: 30, BP: 110/93. Lab results were WBC: 15.1,
RBC: 4.12, Hgb: 14.0, Hct: 42.8, MCV: 104, Plt: 358. Repeat labs
demonstrated new leukocytosis, a widening anion gap, and modest
elevations in her transaminases. Repeat blood gases (primarily
venous) revealed varying levels of metabolic acidosis. A sodium
bicarbonate infusion was started, and a CVL was placed.
.
