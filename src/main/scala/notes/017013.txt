Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2178-4-28**]  AVR ( 27 mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic porcine)/CABG x2 (LIMA to
LAD, SVG to PDA)


History of Present Illness:
68M w  h/o CAD and aortic stenosis.  He also has a history of
atrial fibrillation, and he is s/p PVI in [**2177-7-9**].  This was
complicated by pericarditis.  The patient states that he has not
been well since this time.  He has developed dyspnea on
exertion,
which has progressed over the previous 2-3 months.  He has
developed recurrent pleural effusions for which he has undergone
thoracentesis 3 times since [**Month (only) **].  He also reports a weight
loss of 25 pounds over 9 months.  Cytology is reportedly
negative
for malignancy.  He travels back and forth to [**State 108**].  He was
told in [**State 108**] that he has aortic stenosis and AVR was
recommended.  He has returned for further workup.  Cath today
reveals CAD including known TO of the RCA as well as 50% distal
left main stenosis.  Echo is pending at this time.  He is
referred for cardiac surgical evaluation.


Past Medical History:

PTCA
hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, aortic
stenosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, s/p pulmonary vein isolation [**2177-7-9**] (c/b

multiple thoracenteses, testicular carcinoma [**2141**], subdural

Pertinent Results:
Prebypass

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. There is a bidirectional shunt across the
interatrial septum at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect
is present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the apex as well as apical and mid portions of
the inferior wall. . Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2178-4-28**] at 1300 hours.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine,
epinephrine and milrinone. LV function is depressed. LVEF= 35%.
The septum and anterior septum are also hypokinetic.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets move
well and the valve appears well seated. There is no aortic
insufficiency. Peak gradient across the valve is 17 mm Hg. Mild
mitral regurgitation present. Aorta appears intact post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2178-4-28**] where the patient underwent aortic
valve replacement and coronary artery bypass.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic
prophylaxis.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable.Drips were weaned off.  Beta blocker
was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. He was noted to
have aleft bundle branch block alernanting with right bundle
branch. He was evaluated by electrophysiology and given his
history of afib he was started on coumadin for one month with a
goal INR of 2.0. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor was placed on day of
discharge home and to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD#6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions and VNA. Coumadin to be followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 34850**].
