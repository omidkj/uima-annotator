Micro data:
[**2194-2-1**]: UCx yeast 10,000-100,000 organisms/ml
[**2194-2-1**]: BlCx x3: Klebsiella oxytoca ([**2-27**]) R to piperacillin and
ceftazidime, otherwise sensitive
[**2194-2-3**]: BlCx x2 negative
[**2194-2-5**]: BLCx x2 negative
[**2-3**], [**2-4**], [**2-6**]: stool negative for C diff, Campylobacter,
Shigella, Salmonella, O&P
[**2-7**]: cath tip negative

CXR [**2194-2-1**]:
No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation identified. Diffuse

coarsening of the interstitial markings appears unchanged from
multiple
previous examinations, consistent with chronic interstitial
changes.

RUQ ultrasound [**2194-2-2**]:
Stable ultrasonographic appearance of the right upper quadrant
from [**2193-12-20**]. No gallstones or evidence of cholecystitis. A
small amount of ascites. Echogenic kidney consistent with
medical renal disease or HIV nephropathy.

CXR [**2194-2-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the chest with no acute
cardiopulmonary process. However, normal chest x-ray does not
exclude PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].

echo: [**2194-2-5**]:
The left atrium is elongated. LV systolic function appears
moderately
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is
mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2193-3-28**], left
ventricular systolic function is now slightly worse.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  bacteremia - Pt's blood cultures showed Klebsiella oxytoca,
which was not surprising given his recent Klebsiella oxytoca
bacteremia.  It was thought that the presence of pt's Portacath
was likely a colonizing factor and the urgency of its removal
was increased.  Pt was initially admitted to MICU as had septic
physiology.  MUST protocol initiated, pt fluid resuscitated with
6L of NS and transfused with 1U PRBC, broad spectrum antibiotics
given - initially levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime in the
ED, then levofloxacin, meropenem, and clindamycin.  He did not
require any pressors.  A cortisol stim test was performed, with
empiric steroids begun, but there was no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency, so this was discontinued.  Pt did not have signs
of a perirectal abscess or UTI, and CXR did not show pneumonia.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative, and on transfer to the
floor, pt remained afebrile and was hemodynamically stable.
Eventually, the portacath was removed by surgery, and the tip
was sent for culture.  It ultimately did not grow any organisms.
 After the Portacath was removed, the plan after discharge was
for him to return for surveillance cultures, and then to get a
tunneled catheter placed the following week.  He was given a
2-week course of levofloxacin for the Klebsiella oxytoca,
starting from the date of Portacath removal.

2.  acute renal failure - baseline creatinine from [**2193-3-28**]
was 1.4 - 1.6; of note, during his last hospitalization, Cr rose
into 2's, as it was during the initial stages of this
hospitalization.  At baseline, pt has echogenic kidney
consistent with HIV nephropathy vs medical renal disease;
however, clearly had an acute on chronic process, and his urine
lytes revealed a FENa of 1.3%, consistent with neither ATN nor
prerenal etiology.  Pt was treated with IVF while awai
