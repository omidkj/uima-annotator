History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old male was admitted to another institution on
[**11-26**]
with shortness of breath, chest discomfort and confusion.  He
was
seen the day prior to admission by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42394**] and had a
Holter monitor placed. He was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 150's when he presented to the
ED. He was brought to the cath lab [**11-26**] which showed EF 10-15%
as well as a
100% LAD and RCA and Cx lesions. He was ruled out for MI and
started
on Lovenox for the atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for revascularization.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 10 - 15 %), with septal, lateral and anterior
hypokinesis, and inferior akinesis. There is mild echo contrast
in all [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
There is mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
The tip of the SGC is at the PA bifurcation.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on infusions of epinephrine and
nitroglycerine.
RV systolic fxn is unchanged.
The LV is slightly improved, with all walls moving slightly
better than pre-bypass. EF is now 15 - 20%.
The PFO is unchanged.
MR is trace - 1+. No AI. Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2133-12-3**] where
he underwent Coronary Artery Bypass x 4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  He developed rapid atrial fibrillation
and was bolused with Amiodarone.  He did require epicardial
pacing and NeoSynephrine for blood pressure support.  He
converted to Sinus Rhythm.  The patient was neurologically
intact. Hemodynamics improved and he was weaned from inotropic
and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Lisinopril was started for further blood
pressure control in the setting of systolic heart failure with
an EF 10-15%.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.

As he had no benefits for rehabilitation admission he was kept
in house for further recovery prior to returning home with his
wife.  By the time of discharge on POD 13 the patient was
ambulating with his walker, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged  in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
