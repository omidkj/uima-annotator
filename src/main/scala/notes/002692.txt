Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status

History of Present Illness:
80 yo M tobacco smoker with severe COPD on continuous home
oxygen 2L NC (FEV1/FVC: 60%, FEV1: 17% and FVC: 28% in '[**82**]) and
lung CA on day 16 of cycle 2 of Navelbine, who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for CCOPD exacerbation and cellulitis/DVT
([**Date range (1) 32120**]). After his last admission, he was started on a
prednisone taper and continues to be on prednisone 15mg once
daily. He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility in [**Location (un) **] and
has been receiving chemotherapy as an out patient. This AM, the
pt was found covered in stool at the [**Hospital3 **] facility.
He was found by the staff to be weak and disoriented in addition
to incontinent of stool. As per the report sheet, he was
reported feeling "pretty good" with baseline sob/doe. However he
was found to be speaking in [**1-30**] word sentences and EMT found the
pt to be hypotensive with BP of 84/54. The pt reports he
normally is able to walk [**4-2**] steps prior to developing SOB even
with oxygen however in recent days he does not believe he can do
even that. He reports a possible fever several days previously
(measured by VNA but he was not how high), but without chills or
rigors. He denies any dysuria, urinary frequency, diarrhea, or
abdominal pain or n/v, head ache, neck stiffness or change in
vision including peripheral vision. The pt also denies any
significant back pain. He received tylenol for the fever and it
has since resolved. He denies any chest pain, palpitations, LE
edema. He denies any change in his appetite but reports he has
been eating a lot of sugar, he also denies any change in his
body weight or abdominal distension. He received a flu shot this
year and a pneumovax several years previously. The pt believes
he is here for his weekly chemotherapy tx and is unclear why he
was in the [**Name (NI) **] or the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

In the ED, the pt was found to be hypotensive to the 84/54 with
HR of 76 with oxygen saturation of 90% on RA. The pt was placed
on 4L NC with saturation in the mid 90s, however he was
desaturating to the 80s with movement. He was therefore started
on NRB in the ED. ABG at the time was the follow: 7.38/38/74. In
addition, he was found to have a WBC of 0.7, an ANC of < 500,
and lactate 2.1. The pt also had a proBNP of 1712. UA was
negative. CXR demonstrated a right para mediastinal mass which
measured 4.7 x 3.9 cm in size (unchanged from previous) and
vague nodular densities at lung bases with some pulmonary edema
but no focal infiltrates. A right IJ was placed. CVP was
initially measured between [**9-8**], and after fluid resuscitation
was found to be 20. He was given cefepime and vancomycin for
presumed febrile neutropenia as well as dexamethasone 10mg IV x1
as he is chronically on prednisone. In addition, the pt received
2unit of PRBC for Hct of 23.7 and 3L of NS and was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].


Past Medical History:
Oncology History: Mr. [**Known lastname 21781**] was initially found to have
multiple polyps on routine colonoscopy in [**2182-11-28**]. A repeat
colonoscopy on [**2183-9-2**] with bx showed high grade dysplasia and
CIS. Follow up PET scan demonstrated abnormal FDG activity in a
lung nodule and in the transverse colon. On [**2184-7-2**] a
biopsy of the right upper lobe nodule yielded an
undifferentiated carcinoma which was positive for CK 7, negative
for CK 20 and TTF-1 and LCA. Although this pattern is not
specific it is compatible with primary pulmonary carcinoma.
After much discussion, a medical regimen consisting of Nevelbine
wsa initiated as his significant COPD and other co-morbidities
precluded a surgical approach. He is now on cycle two of
Nevelbine which he has tolerated well as an outpt.
