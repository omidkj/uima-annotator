Neurology Consult:
Reason for Consult: Tremors, question of Parkinson's

HPI: The patient is a 80 year-old RH man who is POD3 from a AAA
repair and referred for tremors and question of Parkinson's
disease per family request.  With regard to present hospital
stay, he presented on [**5-30**] with L buttock pain and found to have
a 7.7 cm infrarenal AAA, which was repaired on [**6-3**].
Post-operative course is significant for O2 rqmt due to COPD and
leg weakness working with PT.  Plan for discharge to rehab for
further PT.

At baseline, the patient is high functioning, able to perform
ADL's with some assistance for fine motor tasks.  Daughter
reports he walks with occ use of cane but really should use a
walker due to leg weakness.  He reports a tremor in his R hand
only for past 2 years (daughter has observed in both hands).
The
tremor has become more "annoying," but he denies increased
frequency or significant interference with ADLs.  The tremor
does
not occur at rest and is only noticeable when he is using his
right hand, for example to pour water into a cup.  The tremor
does not involve upper arms, LE, or lips/jaw.  He denied any
difficulties with speech or swallowing, slowed motor activity,
visual or hearing changes (baseline glaucoma), focal weakness,
numbness, paraesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence.  He
denies
any falls.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented month - [**Month (only) **], date -
initially stated 19- something, self corrected [**2165**], hospital _
[**Hospital1 **].  Attention moderate with some distractibility, able to name
[**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards accurately in 3 m with some pausing.  Able to
relate history, though with some confusion (believed surgery on
13th and thought he had been in hospital for over 1 wk).  Encode
[**4-13**], Registration [**2-13**], Recall 0/3 - 0/3 w/ prompting.
Difficulty naming low frequency object (hammock).  + L/R
confusion - likely attention related.  Language is fluent with
intact repetition and comprehension.  Speech was not dysarthric.

[**Location (un) **] intact.  Writing illegible due to tremor.

-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested.  PERRL 4 to 3mm.  There
is
no ptosis bilaterally. EOMI without nystagmus.  Facial sensation
intact to pinprick. No facial droop, facial musculature
symmetric. Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.  Palate
elevates symmetrically.  5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM
bilaterally. Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Diffuse atrophy most prominent in L thigh. Paratonia UE,
normal tone LE.  No pronator drift bilaterally, UE and LE
postural tremor noted bilateral R>L , 5 Hz, low amplitude.

CXR [**6-3**]: Heart size and aortic calcification remain stable.
Hyperinflation of the lung fields consistent with emphysema is
again noted.  Irregular and indistinct contours of the lung
bases
and medial portions of the hemidiaphragms is noted, suggesting
new pleural effusions and adjacent opacities (atelectasis versus
infection).

Assessment and Plan: The pt is a 80 year-old man h/o HTN, COPD,
and recent AAA repair, with bilat extremity tremor and L leg
weakness.  His neuro exam was significant for mild postural and
moderate-severe intention tremor, L leg weakness, and mildly
decreased vibratory sensation in stocking distribution.
   In terms of his tremor, we would not classify it as
Parkinsonian as it does not occur at rest.  More likely, it is
an
essential tremor (positive family history, action/postural).
Albuterol may worsen his tremor due to sympathetic effect, and
therefore tremor may be exacerbated by worsened lung function.
Stress/anxiety of hospitalization may also contribute.
Treatment
for essential tremor would be beta-blocker, and he is already on
metoprolol for BP control.  However given acute medical issues,
we would consider treatment only after recovery from acute
illness.  Recommended the daughter plan follow-up with an
outpatient neurologist.
