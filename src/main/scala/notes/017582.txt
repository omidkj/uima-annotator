Chief Complaint:
Fever, lethargy, abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE


History of Present Illness:
84 yo female with COPD, dCHF, HTN, HL, colon cancer s/p
resection presents with fever, lethargy, and abdominal pain. She
was in her usual state of health until she went grocery shopping
with her neighbor and began falling asleep. Her neighbor decided
to bring her to the emergency department. She denied any cough
or any other associated symptoms. Of note, the patient had a
recent EGD 1 week ago. She is also on 2LNC at rest and 4LNC with
exertion at baseline.
.
In the ED, the patient had the following vital signs: 101 84
93/44 14 98% 10L Non-Rebreather. Her blood pressure dropped as
low as 64/30 and she was started on peripheral levophed until
CVL access was attained. Tmax was 102R. She was guiac negative.
CXR revealed LLL pneumonia. She underwent bilateral LE U/S for
her LE edema that was negative for DVT. CT abdomen/pelvis w/o
contrast confirmed LLL PNA. Labs were notable for a WBC of 14.4
with a left shift (87% N, 4% band). VBG revealed 7.35/73/61/42
with normal lactate. The patient was given ceftriaxone 1gm and
levoquin 1gm IV for CAP coverage. She was given vancomycin 1gm
for ?cellulitis. She was given acetaminophen for fever. Given
her persistent hypotension, she was started on a small dose of
norepinephrine gtt with good effect. She received 1L of NS and
made 500cc of urine. A subclavian line was misplaced initially,
and was repositioned prior to transfer. Last set of vitals prior
to transfer: 101  77  103/63  17  100%4LNC.
.
ROS:
(+)She reports constipation and poor adherance with her bipap.
(-)She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough,
sputum, fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea,
black, bloody stools, weakness on one side of the body or the
other, dysuria. No recent travel or sick contacts.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo female with COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
history of colon cancer s/p resection who presented with fever,
lethargy, and abdominal pain, and was transferred to the ICU for
hypotension and concern for sepsis with pulmonary source.
.
#. Severe sepsis: Patient presented with 2/4 SIRS criteria
positive, fever, white count, with presumed pulmonary source and
hypotension requiring pressors resulting in diagnosis of severe
sepsis. Possible concominant left lower extremity cellulitis was
considered as a source on admission as well. She was at risk for
health care associated organisms.  Also given recent EGD 1 week
