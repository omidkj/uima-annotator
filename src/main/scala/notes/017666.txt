Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1642**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Briefy, patient is an 80 yo male with Hx of IDDM, CAD s/p CABG,
PAF s/p pacer [**9-13**], CVA, initially transferred from [**Last Name (un) 883**] on
[**4-5**] with diagnosis of intracranial bleed secondary to
supratherapeutic INR and fall. On arrival to our E.D. the
patient was febrile, and initially treated with vanco,levoflox,
and flagyl empirically. He was also given 2 units of PRBCs for
Hct 23 of unclear etiology.
.
The patient was seen by Neurology and neurosurgery. The patient
was loaded on dilantin but felt not to be a surgical candidate
by NS. Patient was admitted to the MICU with complicated course
including MSSA bacteremia, ?GNR bacteremia, NSTEMI, meningitis,
multifocal PNA, and hydrocephalus.
.
The patient continued to have worsening mental status and had
repeat CT head w/o progression of bleed, stable hydrocephalus.
In the MICU the patient was treated with dexamethasone,
ampicillin, vanco, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir with some clinical
improvement. The patient never required pressors. He had a TTE
and TEE which showed 2+ MR and 1+AR but no vegetations. The
patient has been followed by neurology who would like a second
LP to be performed given negative cxs 1st time. However, given
hydrocephalus, an LP is thought to be currently high risk and
contraindicated. Neurosurgery was again consulted and reported
that the patient is not a candidate for other procedures to
assist diagnosis. Neurology continues to follow the patient
closely. On admission to the floor the patient is currently on a
medical regimen of Meropenem and Oxacillin which should provide
adequate coverage of the patient's known pathogens as well as
empiric coverage for meningitis.

Imaging:
[**2109-4-5**]: Portable Chest - IMPRESSION:  Interval development of
mild congestive heart failure.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
[**2110-4-5**]: CT Head - There is hydrocephalus, new since [**2110-3-19**]. In
addition to the small amount of subarachnoid blood noted above,
there is a significant amount of material dependent in both
latral ventricles. This material is largely isodense to brain,
but slightly hyperdense along the margins. It may represent
evolving intraventricular hemorrhage, or pus. Consulation with
neurosurgery may be helpful. Imaging could contribute to
distinguishing blood from pus with MR.
.
[**2110-4-6**]: CT A/P
1.  Bilateral lung base air space opacities, likely aspiration
versus
aspiration pneumonia.
2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions, left bigger than right.
3.  No fluid collection to explain hematocrit drop.
4.  Bladder wall lesion similar in appearance to previous study.

5.  Low-density renal lesions similar in appearance to previous
study.
6.  Sigmoid diverticulosis.
Preliminary findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at 1:30
a.m., [**2110-4-6**].
.
[**2110-4-6**]: Repeat CT Head - Hydrocephalus and intraventricular
material-
blood vs pus- are unchanged.
.
[**2110-4-6**]: Portable chest/line placement - There is a left-sided
pacemaker, which is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires
are seen.  There has been interval placement of a right
subclavian central line, which distal tip is not completely well
seen.  The tip is seen at least to the level of the cavoatrial
junction and may be within the right atrium. This could be
pulled back slightly and reimaged for more optimal assessment.
No pneumothoraces are seen.  There is again seen prominence of
the pulmonary vascular markings consistent with pulmonary edema.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are identified.  These are
unchanged.
.
[**2110-4-7**]: Echocardiogram -
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. A mass or
vegetation on the mitral valve is not seen but cannot be fully
excluded. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No valvular vegetation
seen. If
clinically indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small
valvular vegetation. Compared to the prior study repor
