History of Present Illness:
68M with h/o diastolic CHF, bradycardia p/w SOB since this
evening, which awoke him from sleep tonight. His symptoms feel
like his previous CHF, and he was last admitted ~1.5mos ago for
same and noted to be bradycardic at which time his BB was
stopped. Currently, he denies cp, fevers, light headedness or
leg swelling.
.
He was admitted for CHF exacerbation [**Date range (1) 34845**] and [**Date range (1) 22380**].
Lasix was increased on this last admission. He was also brady
that admission so they stopped his metoprolol. Saw cardiologist
two weeks ago who increased lasix from 40mg to 60mg. Tuesday
feeling more SOB than normal (even with rest). Last night
breathing heavier and brought in at 2am. He thought this was
similar to prior CHF exacerbations and therefore presented to
the ER.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 95.8 42 101/35 22 98%. A CXR revealed
mild pulmonary edema. He was noted to be in [**Last Name (un) **]. He received
atropine x 1. He was given 1 amp of calcium for concern for
prolonged QT secondary to hypocalcemia. His bradycardia
persisted to the 40s, it was thought to be junctional vs afib
per cardiology and he developed hypotension to the 80s, which
was asymptomatic. He was then given 1L of fluid with improvement
to the high 90s. He refused a rectal guiac.  Cr noted to be 2.7
from a baseline of 1.4-1.6. His BNP was 1594 (it was 1362 on
[**4-11**] and was 324 in [**2181-12-15**]). Blood cultures were drawn. CXR
showed mild congestion. EKG showed slow junctional rhythm. EKG
on [**4-12**] was NSR and showed LAD. Echo in [**2174-12-15**] showed EF > 60%
and LVH. On transfer to the floors, HR 60's, BP 121/39, Pox
95RA.

.
On the floor, he denies dizziness. He denies dietary
noncompliance and is not sure what his weight has been doing.

Brief Hospital Course:
68M with h/o diastolic CHF, CAD s/p RCA and LAD stents,
longstanding DM, and bradycardia p/w SOB since this evening who
now has diastolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury,
and bradycardia.
.
#) Bradycardia: Noted on last 2 hospital admissions but had been
attributed to beta-blocker, which was stopped in [**March 2182**]. On
presentation to the ED, HR in 30s-40s showing junctional rhythm
with occasional sinus beats. He was given 1 mg atropine in the
ED. The patient did complain of intermittent lightheadedness at
home. EP was consulted and elected to place a dual chamber
pacemaker on [**2182-5-18**]. He is to follow-up in device clinic in 1
week. He was started on Toprol 25 mg per day.
.
#) Diastolic CHF: Two recent admissions for decompensated CHF in
[**Month (only) **] and [**2182-3-15**]. Lasix had recently been increased by his
outpatient cardiologist to 60 mg per day. On admission, BNP was
elevated to 1594, CXR showed mild congestion, and [**Last Name (un) **] was
present. He was given IV Lasix 20 mg on HD#1. His discharge
lasix dose was 60 mg per day.
.
#) CAD: Last stent in [**2174**], currently on ASA 325 and plavix.
These were continued.  Once pacemaker was place, he was started
on metoprolol succinate at 25 mg qday.
.
#) [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine elevated to 2.7 from baseline 1.4-1.6. Likely
secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of bradycardia.
Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.6 by HD#1 with gentle
diuresis. Cr was 1.4 on discharge.
.
#) Glaucoma: continued eye drops
.
#) DM: continued novolog and SSI
.
#) HL: continued atorvastatin
.
DVT prophylaxis was with subQ heparin. He remained full code.
