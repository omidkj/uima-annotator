History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 y/o female with a PMH significant for Alzheimer's
dementia, CHF, HTN, AF on coumadin, who initially was admitted
to the Medicine service with increased cough and fevers x 1
week, thought to be from aspiration PNA on [**2124-3-9**]. She was
re-started on her home cardiac regimen in addition to
Levofloxacin for the PNA. On [**2124-3-11**], the patient had a HR of
40's to 50's with SBP's in the 110-130's and some degree of
mental status changes with lethargy. On the night of [**2124-3-11**], a
trigger was called for a HR of 30's with SBP in 100's. The
patient was found to be completely obtunded and unresponsive to
verbal and physical stimuli. She was given atropine 0.5 mg x 3,
glucagon 5 mg x 2, 3 mg x 1, and calcium 1 amp without effect.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] that night. The patient regained
some degree of MS during the transfer and her HR returned to the
40's to 50's. Cardiology was emergently consulted for possibly
placing a pacing wire; however, due to her improvement during
the transfer, they did not feel a temp pacing wire was indicated
at this time, especially given her overall prognosis. It was
recommended to discontinue the BB and avoid all nodal
suppressants. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her course was notable for a few
episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping and a
3-second pause on telemetry. She also had a S&S eval given the
asp PNA, which showed soft sx of aspiration with all PO intake.
It was recommended that the patient continue her current diet of
thin liquids and purees, as a PEG tube/NPO status will likely
not not decrease her aspiration risk given her advanced dementia
status.
.
Currently, the patient is with her family, who confirmed the
above history. The patient was able to answer very few question
and did report some pain in her extremities. Unable to obtain
other ROS [**3-16**] dementia and deafness.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
ECG [**2124-3-11**]: afib with slow ventricular response to 40. LAD,
wide QRS with down [**Hospital1 **] deflection in V1, V2, Q in III, F, poor
R wave progression.
.
Head CT [**2124-3-10**]:
"1. Areas of encephalomalacia due to prior infarction.
2. Areas of likely chronic small-vessel ischemic infarcts.
3. Atrophic changes.
4. Possible chronic small subdural collection along the right
anterior frontal convexity."
.
CXR [**2124-3-10**]:
"AP chest radiograph shows stable cardiac and mediastinal and
hilar contours. Again seen is slight upper zone redistribution
of the pulmonary vasculature. No focal consolidations are seen.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion, although the left
costophrenic angle is not imaged on this study."


Brief Hospital Course:
85yo F with CAD, PVD s/p CVA with dementia (vascular vs.
Alzheimer's) and DM who was found to be bradycardic to 30s and
obtunded on the floor. The pt was initially admitted to the
Medicine service with a chief complaint of fevers with cough
thought to be due to aspiration PNA on [**2124-3-9**]. At the time, she
was hypertensive to 193/125. She was started on her home cardiac
regimen of metoprolol XL 25mg once daily on [**2124-3-10**] AM.
Throughout the course of the day of [**2124-3-11**], the pt continued to
have a HR of 40s to 50s with systolic blood pressure of 110-130s
and some degree of mental status change with lethargy. On
[**2124-3-11**] at 22:23, a trigger was called for a heart rate of 30s
with SBP of 100s. The NF intern was called to assess the pt and
found the pt to be completely obtunded and unresponsive to
verbal or physical stimuli (sternal rub) with GCS score of [**6-17**].
The pt was given atropine 0.5mg x3 as well as glucagon 5mg x2,
3mg x1 and calcium 1 amp without effect. The son who was present
at the time confirmed, this was a far cry from her mother's
baseline mental status where she is normally communicative.

During transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and placement of foley catheter and
arterial line, the HR increased to 40s-50s with increase in
systolic blood pressure to 110-140s. In addition, the pt
regained some degree of mental status and was able to interact.
She remained with HR >30 in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], without further
obtundation.  All beta blockers were held.

1. Bradycardia - Likely due to conduction abnormality rather
than BB. Initially patient had HR in the 30's with MS changes
and low BP.  For remainder of the hospital course, HR in 50's
with few episodes in 30's. Her EKGs show afib with slow
ventricular response. Per cardiology consult, no need for
transcutaneous pacer was warranted given her poor prognosis.
Bradycardia may be secondary to intrinsic conduction disease vs.
vagal response. Likely not [**3-16**] to BB given that last dose was on
[**2124-3-10**].

2. Mental status changes - Initial obtundation likely [**3-16**] poor
perfusion from bradycardia. CT of head [**3-10**] was negative.
Infectious work-up was also negative from admission.  Considered
MRI/MRA to evaluate for further progression of vascular dementia
if mental status were to deteriorate; however, MS improved back
to baseline after bradycardia resolved.

3. CAD - Pt had no symptoms of CP, and helding BB in setting of
bradycardia, although this would be beneficial in CAD.  Per PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] held [**3-16**] h/o GI bleed while pt was on both [**Month/Day (2) **] and coumadin.
 Imdur was also changed to isosorbide dinitrate as imdur cannot
be crushed.

4. Afib - Held coumadin for supertherapeutic INR; restarted when
INR<2.

5. CHF - Pt has h/o CHF with unknown EF; baseline TTE during
this hospitalization showed EF >55%.  Continued lasix and
nitrate; recommended monitoring of daily weights.

6. Aspiration PNA - Pt had no signs of PNA on CXR, but pt was
admitted with fevers and productive cough concerning for URI.
Has a h/o aspiration PNA in the past. Pt was started on
levofloxacin on initial admission and completed a 7 day course.
She had a speech and swallow evaluation: they recommended thin
liquid and purees, with assistance while eating, crushed meds,
basic aspiration precautions.

7. NIDDM - Continued on lantus 32 units qAM and RISS

8. Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.

9. Decreased Hct - Baseline Hct is 28-31.  She had no evidence
of active bleeding.  She was given iron supplements.

10. Sacral decub - She had no evidence of wound infections;
continued ascorbic acid and zinc supplements.

11. F/E/N - thin liquids/pureed, replete lytes prn

12. PPx - PPI, bowel regimen, coumadin

13. Code - full (re-addressed with family)
