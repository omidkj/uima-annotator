History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4610**] is a 45 year-old male with IDDM complicated by
prior DKA/gastroparesis, history of UGIB (most recently
[**1-/2195**]), mild systolic dysfunction, as well as polysubstance
abuse with active cocaine and marijuana use prior to admission,
who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2-18**] after being
found unresponsive with BS13. He was given Glucagon, initial
vitals T92.9, HR91, BP150/90, RR24, 96%RA. His labs were
significant for leukocytosis with bandemia, BUN 62, creatinine
2.5, non-anion gap acidosis with bicarb 9, and elevated LFTs. He
was empirically given Ceftriaxone, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals T98.4, HR108, 166/104, RR16, Sat 90%RA.
The patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain. ABG with

Relevant studies:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-2-18**]):
No evidence of acute intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-
white matter differentiation appears preserved. There is no
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. There is
partial opacification of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and
nasopharynx in this intubated patient. No skull fractures are
identified. There is moderate scalp soft tissue swelling, which
has developed since the prior examination, and is most evident
over both temporalis muscles.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-2-18**]):
1. Diffuse abnormality of the entire length of small bowel with
fold and wall thickening and impressive wall edema. This is
concerning for ischemic bowel, although no assessment can be
made as to the patency of the mesenteric veins or arteries or
the enhancement characteristics of the bowel mucosa. Notably,
there is no pneumatosis, and no portal venous gas is identified.
2. Patchy opacities in both lower lobes.
3. 5 mm renal stone.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT ([**2195-2-18**]):
Normal compressibility, color flow, and Doppler waveforms are
seen in the deep venous system from the right common femoral
vein to the right popliteal. The left common femoral vein is
also normal.
.
ECHO ([**2195-2-20**]):
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
40-50 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. No vegetations seen on any valve. Compared
with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed) of [**2195-1-27**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
increased. The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS ([**2195-2-24**]):
Color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms are
demonstrated. Intramural thrombus is not identified.
.
ECHO ([**2195-2-25**]):
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is borderline normal. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-20**], biventricular
function has improved.
.
RENAL U.S. ([**2195-3-6**]):
The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney measures 11.1
cm. The kidneys are diffusely increased in echogenicity,
unchanged since the prior study. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. In the lower pole of the left
kidney is a 7-mm anechoic thin-walled cyst consistent with a
simple cyst. The previously identified 5 mm right renal stone
seen on a CT from [**2195-2-18**] is not id
