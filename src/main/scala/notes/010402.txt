Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**2102-1-19**]

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o Arabic speaking only male with history of CAD s/p prior
CABG in [**2079**] at [**Hospital 3340**] Clinic (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA,
radial to diag), who had a lengthy hospital course from [**2100-12-9**]
to [**2101-1-5**] on the surgery service for right below-knee
popliteal artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass with reversed
saphenous vein graft.
.
Above hospital course was complicated by post-operative MI.
Cardiac cath [**2101-12-18**] showed severe native coronary artery
disease, LMCA with severe diffuse disease, LAD was totally
occluded proximally, LCx had a total occlusion with long
diffusely narrowed OM or possibly ramus intermedius branch, RCA
had total occlusion proximally, patent LIMA-LAD with faint
collaterals to the PDA, atretic RIMA, radial to D1 had a 90%
proximal stenosis just after the ostium, and occluded SVG-PDA
graft. Overall, EKG showed inferior ST changes and cath noted an
ostial occlusion of the radial-Diag graft which, when injected
gave him chest pain. Stent was placed in radial to diag graft.
.
Stat echo showed new severe MR (likely ischemic from injection).
Subsequent formal TTE showed mild-moderate mitral regurgitation
most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction. He required
intubation, pressors, IABP for his cardiogenic shock and
pulmonary edema, but was able to be discharged to home on
[**2102-1-5**].
.
History is obtained from patient, translator, and family. Per
report, he was doing well after discharge and was in his USOH.
Today, he noted acute SOB with diaphoresis at 9 am. He denied
dietary indiscretion, high salt diet, increase in weight,
missing BP pills, changes in his BP regimen. He denied CP or
palpitations.
.
He presented with RR 50s, O2 sat 70s on NRB mask. His pressures
were noted to be high and SBP 190s. ED exam was notable for
diffuse rales and wheezing. On EKG, ? upsloping STE V1-V2 with
increased lateral TWI and depressions. CXR c/w severe CHF.
.
He was placed on Bipap, nitro gtt, given IV lasix with O2 sats
which rose to the 90s. SBP was 160s when going to cath. He was
taken to cardiac cath with heparin gtt. Grafts looked patent and
no interventions were performed. Intra-op echo performed as
well. A-line was kept in place. Heparin gtt was stopped.
.
Per d/w patient, ROS positive for cough since discharge. On
review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is positive for dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and ankle edema.
Notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

TTE [**1-19**]:
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Inferior and inferolateral akinesis with mild
hypokinesis of the other segments. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

CXR [**1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema with a pleural
effusion
suspected on the right.
2. Low lung volumes with left basilar opacity including air
bronchograms.
Although pneumonia is not excluded, atelectasis could provide an
alternative
explanation. Clinical correlation is recommended and
consideration of
followup radiographs, preferably with PA and lateral technique,
if needed
clinically.

LENI [**1-19**]:
IMPRESSION: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremities

TTE [**1-20**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
infer-spetal, inferior and infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Renal Ultrasound [**1-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Markedly diminished to no diastolic flow, right
worse than left, in the bilateral kidneys suggestive of an
extensive diffuse parenchymal process. No evidence of renal vein
thrombosis given the normal venous outflow bilaterally. This
study is not adequate to exclude renal artery stenosis due to
technical limitations.
