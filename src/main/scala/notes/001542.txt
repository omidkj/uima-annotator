Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33813**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2179-7-26**] and taken to the Operating Room for L4-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. However, she developed new onset of right
leg weakness and absent peripheral pulses. CTA showed likely
left posterior tibial artery occlusion for which she was started
on heparin; she had a spontaneous return of pulse and heparin
was stopped. Initial postop pain was controlled with a Dilaudid
PCA.
.
The pt was scheduled for the posterior surgery [**7-28**] but became
combative, confused and tried to pull out her lines in the
pre-op area. The pt started to desat to the 70s and the
anesthesia team decided to intubate. CT of the head was taken to
rule out hemmorhage given recent use of heparin. CTA of chest
was taken, given pts suspected DVT and recent surgery and wet
read was negative for PE. In the PACU she also required norepi
pressor support. Her abdomen was noted to be distended, and
there was difficultly placing an OGT. She was transferred to the
MICU. She was started on Vanc/Zosyn given hypoxia, hypotension,
and small pleural effusions on CT chest, although she was
afebrile. General surgery was consulted for distended abdomen
and elevated bladder pressures, who did not believe she had
abdominal compartment syndrome. KUB showed ileus and there was
no obstruction on CT. RP hematoma had been seen on L spine CT
[**2179-7-28**] (5.8 x 3.5 cm), and was stable on CT [**2179-7-29**] (5.3 x 3.6
cm). Hct was stable. The cause of her acute delerium was
uncertain, but felt to be multifactorial given the Dilaudid PCA
and pt's regular EtOH use.
.
On [**2179-7-30**], she went back to the OR for the posterior approach.
Please see the operative notes for further details.
Post-operatively she developed a pneumonia and was placed on
Cipro.  She continued to improve and was able to work with
physical therapy.  She was discharged to rehab in good condition
and tolerating a regular diet.
