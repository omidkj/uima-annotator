Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zofran

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Pelvic Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy via vertical midline incision, total
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
rectosigmoid resection with end colostomy,ileocecectomy with
primary side-to-side functional end-to-endanastomosis, pelvic
washout, placement of bilateral ureteral stents and closure of
post-operative wound


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo gravida 3 para 3 who initially presented
to [**Hospital1 **] ED on [**9-3**] with tachycardia.  She was given 3
units PRBCs for a HR in the
130s.  Her hematocrit was then stable and she was discharged
home on [**9-5**] with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].

As an out-patient she had a CT scan which revealed a pelvic mass
likely originating from her uterus and extending above her
umbilicus.  The scan also suggested fistula with the bowel,
right hydronephrosis, and question of invasion of the IVC.

On review of symptoms, she denies fevers, night sweats, chest
pain, palpitations, dysuria, hematuria, vaginal bleeding.  She
has lost 20 pounds over the last year which she states was
intentional.  She notes some shortness of breath with
ambulation.


Past Medical History:
POBHx:
SVD x 3 ([**2086**], [**2088**], [**2094**]) no complications

PGYNHx:  Menopause in her early 50s prior to which she had
regular periods.  No hormone therapy.  No history of abnormal
Paps, STIs.

PMH: Anemia, asthma as a child

Health maintainence:  Generally does not seek medical care.  Her
last Pap was 20+ years ago.  She has never had a mammogram or

[**10-28**] CXR:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with a similar
preceding
examination obtained the day before ([**2128-10-27**]). In
comparison with the previous study, the patient was now able to
perform a deeper inspiration.  The pulmonary vasculature is
better accessible and shows considerable perivascular haze most
marked in the lung bases. Complete obliteration of the left
diaphragmatic contour is suggestive of atelectasis in the
retrocardiac space. There is no evidence of new discrete
pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in comparison with the next
preceding study. Review is also extended to the portable chest
examination of [**2128-10-26**]. At that time, the congestive
pattern in the lungs was also present but less marked. Analysis
of the three examinations in sequence suggests further
deterioration of CHF between [**10-26**] and 29, but now some
improvement during the latest interval [**10-27**] through 30.
Observe that on today's examination, the ultimate left lateral
lower chest wall is not included in the image field.
This, however, does not affect the diagnostic statements
rendered here.

[**10-26**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle.
Basal segments contract well (LVEF = 35 %). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal mild
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-10-1**],
left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction are new
(?Takotsubo or multivessel CAD) and moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension are now seen.
.
Most recent CXR [**11-1**]:
HISTORY: PICC placement.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-29**], the tip of the right
subclavian PICC line is in the region of the cavoatrial
junction. Continued opacification at the left base is consistent
with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
There has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary vascular
congestion
described on the previous study. Mild enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette persists. \

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo G3P3 s/p cystoscopy with ureteral stenting (by urology),
TAH-BSO, sigmoid resection, ileal resection, ileocecal
reanastomosis, sigmoid colostomy and IUD removal for uterine
malignancy with fistula to sigmoid and possibly to ileum on
[**10-5**]. Intraoperatively the estimated blood loss was 3000cc's.
She received 7units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of
FFP. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
recovered in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] until [**10-12**] after which time she was
transferred to the postoperative floor. Her incision was closed
on [**10-21**]. She received first dose of chemotherapy (Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **])
on [**10-26**] hours post chemo had cardiac arrest, code called,
shocked and subsequently stable, transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
monitoring and evaluation. On [**10-29**] she was transferred out of
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medicine floor.
.
Brief course as follows:
70yo woman without PMH until she was found to have a pelvic mass
in [**Month (only) 216**], ultimately diagnosed with originally advanced uterine
malignancy with enterouterine and colouterine fistula, and fecal
pelvic abscess. She was admitted on [**10-5**] to the GYN-ONC service
for planned debulking. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with
total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
rectosigmoid resection with end colostomy, ileocecectomy with
primary side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis, pelvic
washout, and placement of bilateral ureteral stents. She was
managed in the SICU post-
