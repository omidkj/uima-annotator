Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gastrointestinal bleed and melena.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
Russian-speaking gentleman with terminal metastatic prostate
cancer, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), and inferior vena
cava syndrome who presented with one day of melanotic stool
at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility and a blood pressure of
68/40.

According to the patient's daughter, he has been in his usual
state of health over the past several days without any

Coumadin dose and did not know if there had been any recent
changes.  In the Emergency Department, the patient's INR was
found to be 14.  His hematocrit was 20.  A nasogastric lavage
was negative for blood or coffee-grounds material.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 95.3 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 113/59, his heart rate was
85, his respiratory rate was 17, and his oxygen saturation
was 98% on room air.  In general, the patient was a pale
Russian-speaking gentleman.  Alert and oriented times three.
In no acute distress.  Smelled melanotic.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The sclerae were anicteric.
The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were slightly
dry.  The neck was supple.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally but decreased inspiratory effort.
The abdomen revealed bilateral small masses in the lower
quadrants.  No tenderness on palpation.  No distention.
Rectal examination revealed guaiac-positive black stool.
Skin examination revealed a maculopapular erythematous rash
in the inguinal and pelvic regions.  Extremity
examination revealed 2 to 3+ bilateral lower extremity
pitting edema.  Neurologic examination revealed the patient
was alert and oriented.  Able to move all four extremities;
however, weak throughout slightly greater in the lower
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory
data revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 7.2,
his hematocrit was 20, and his platelets were 245.  INR was
13.9.  Sodium was 137, potassium was 4.9, blood urea nitrogen
was 51, and his creatinine was 1.4.  Urinalysis was cloudy
with moderate leukocyte esterase, large blood, positive
nitrites, and greater than 50 white blood cells.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 85, with left axis
deviation, and nonspecific lateral T wave changes.

A chest x-ray showed low lung volumes.  No definite
congestive heart failure.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
with atelectasis at the lung bases.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  In the Emergency
Department, the patient received 3 units of packed red blood
cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.  With the rapid
volume resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure improved
to 110/60.  He was also given 10 units of vitamin K
subcutaneously, and his Coumadin was discontinued.  The
patient's bleeding quickly receded, and his hematocrit
remained stable after correction of his INR.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for volume resuscitation and management of his upper
gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient was seen by the Gastroenterology Service and
underwent an urgent upper endoscopy which revealed
esophagitis and diffuse ulcerative gastritis which was felt
to be the likely cause of the patient's gastrointestinal
bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.  The patient
was placed on a twice per day proton pump inhibitor and was
started on sucralfate for treatment of his gastric
ulcerations.

The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on [**12-8**] after his hematocrit had been stable for
over 24 hours.  On transfer to the floor, the patient's
hematocrit was monitored twice per day and continued to
remain stable.  The patient was to be discharged on twice per
day proton pump inhibitor.  In addition, his prednisone will
be decreased to 15 mg to see if he tolerates it froma pain
standpoint/symptomatic relief for his prostate ca.  If he does
tolerate it then we can cont to taper very slowly over several
weeks as this may contribute to an increased risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding. If he does have increased symptoms it
shoudl be continued.   The
patient's Coumadin should not be restarted as he has had a
very high risk of recurrent bleeding.

2.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was initially extremely
hypotensive with a blood pressure of 68/40.  The patient
received rapid volume resuscitation.  His blood pressure
responded well throughout his hospital stay.  He had low
normal systolic and diastolic blood pressures without any
symptoms.  On the day of discharge, his blood pressure was in
the 90s systolic/40s diastolic.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted on
Coumadin.  His Coumadin was discontinued due to his
gastrointestinal bleed and increased risk for recurrent
bleeding.  His Coumadin should not be restarted as an
outpatient.

4.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient has terminal
metastatic prostate cancer.  He was most recently admitted to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center where he was found to have
mild hydronephrosis and a creatinine in the low 2 range.  His
urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**] knows the patient well and felt that
ureteral stents were not indicated in this patient until he
has complete obstruction or becomes septic.

During the last 24 hours of his hospital stay, the patient
was producing approximately 40 cc to 50 cc of urine per hour.
On the day of discharge, his creatinine was 1.3.

The patient also developed a urinary tract infection with
Pseudomonas which was resistant to fluoroquinolones and
aminoglycosides.  The patient was started on intravenous
Zosyn and was to complete a 14-day course of Zosyn therapy.
In addition, the patient had a peripherally inserted central
catheter placed for intravenous antibiotics.

5.  METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER ISSUES:  After a discussion
with the patient's primary urologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**], it was
discovered that the patient was in the terminal stage of the
prostate cancer.  There were no further treatments for his
prostate cancer.  The patient was placed on 20 mg of
prednisone daily by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**] for symptomatic relief in
end-stage prostate cancer.  If the patient tolerates it,the dose
will be tapered as it
was felt the patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleed is
increased by his continued use of steroids.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54118**] as an outpatient in one to two
weeks.

6.  ORAL THRUSH ISSUES:  The patient was found to have oral
thrush and was started on Nystatin swish-and-swallow.

7.  GROIN RASH ISSUES:  The patient was felt to have a
candidal in
