Brief Hospital Course:
#1 Atrial fibrillation
On [**2194-3-25**] successful PVI under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Immediate post procedure care required transfer to the CCU for
ongoing respiratory suppport in the setting of requiring high
dose propofol for intraop ventilation via high flow jet
ventillation and for IV diuresis in setting of periprocedure IVF
5L.

Post PVI telemetry monitoring showed NSR with A-V and BiV
pacing. On [**3-28**] interrogation of ICD/BiV pacemaker device
identified persistent atrial tacycardia. He remained
hemodynamically. He underwent cardioversion initially with 200J
external
biphasic energy without conversion, and shocked again with 300J
external biphasic energy with prompt return of sinus rhythm.

#2 Nonischemic cardiomyopathy
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure in the setting of 5L IVF
intraop PVI. He was diuresed by lasix drip, transitioned to [**Hospital1 **]
po lasix reaching his pre admission dose of 80 mg qAM and 40 mg
qPM by day of discharge.

#3 Anticoagulation
Coumadin dosing continued daily. INRs therapeutic at 3.0

#4 COPD
Clinically stable. At baseline he uses O2 prn dyspnea. Inhalers
continued.

#5 HTN
Lisinopril was held during this admission due to SBP 90-low 100s
during diuresis. At day of discharge SBP trending towards 110
but not consistent to alllow restarting lisinopril.
