Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated

History of Present Illness:
 41 yo female with childhood ALL, pulmonary fibrosis s/p left
lobe lung transplant, left mainstem bronchomalacia s/p stent
placement, sinus tachycardia, and previous intubation in setting
of aspiration pneumonia) who was transferred from an outside
hospital.  She reports 3-4 weeks of cough, and noted fatigue and
insomnia [**2-5**] cough. Family notes recent hospitalizations for PEG
tube change at OSH.  No recent travel.  She has been around kids
with colds recently.  Flu shot given in [**Month (only) 359**].  Also has had
pneumonia vaccine.  Flushes every month in pheresis unit.  Still
uses nutritional supplement drinks at home.  At baseline, she is
tachycardic to as high as 120, respiratory rate 40, Blood
pressure ~100 systolic.  EMS noted O2 sat of 83%.  She initially
presented to [**Hospital **] Hosp where she had blood cutlures and a
CXR done.  She was given 1500cc of NS, ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  She was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] on a nonrebreather.

.
In the ED, initial Vitals were HR 150, hypotensive (map mid
50s), and RR 40-60.  She was given NS, Tylenol, Vanco, and
zosyn.  CXR revealed increased consildation RUL persists with
decreased aeration and more opacifiction; vague patchy opacities
widespread each lung NEW.  She was started on neo gtt which was
chosen for hypotension and tachycardia.  This was uptitrated to
2.5, but then she was transitioned over to levophed.  She was
easily intubated with 6.5 ETT over Bougie, Grade 1 view given
micronathia.  Induction with etomidate and succinylcholine,
after pretreatment with push-dose phenylephrine.  They placed a
RIJ and pulled back ETT 1 cm.  CXR line in place, consolidations
similar, L infrahilar opacity, no ptx.  Sedation with fentanyl
and versed.  IP requested a CT w/o contrast of chest to looks at
patency of stent in LMSB, which will happen en route to the ICU
as ED feels she is stable enough for CT.  Prior to transfer:
37.2 107 91/48 CVP 11-12 100% on 300/16/80/5.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was able to attempt to open her eyes
but not able to nod yes or no to questions.
