Percutaneous biliary tube exchange with internal drainage
[**2148-10-30**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 51 yo man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who
presented to the ED today with fever. Patient was discharged
from the hospital on [**10-22**] and since been having low grade temps
around 99. This am temp was 100.8 and patient was noted to be
tacchycardic and tacchypneic by the VNA. Patient is not
neutropenic. He was noted to be tachypneic with sats as low as
90s on nasal cannula and was placed on nrb with good response in
the ED. He was also tacchy to the 130s and PE was considered
given his recent PE earlier this month for which he did not
receive coumadin given high bleeding risk with RCC and mets to
his pancreas. CTA done in ED was negative. CT did however show a
RLL consolidation. He was given vanco and ceftazidime in the ED.
He was also given dilaudid and tylenol as well as 2 liters of IV
NS. Surgery was consulted in ED and ext bag was placed for
further drainage of perc biliary tubes.

  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial VS were: T 100.7, P 120-130s, BP 94/59, R
24. Patient was sleepy but able to answer questions
appropriately. He reported some sob, no dizziness, chest pain,
abd pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, URI symptoms, muscle or
joint pain. Had bm yesterday and ate breakfast this am without
problem. [**Name (NI) **] wife, biliary tube was flusing fine but she noticed
more output this am.
.

   Of note, patient has had two previous admissions this past
months. the first admission was [**2148-9-19**]. He was admitted with
RCC with new pancreatic head mass. Underwent exploratoy lap and
gastroenterostomy and open cholecystectomy and ileocolic bypass
and appendectomy. During that admission he had a PE and as
heparanized but not given coumadin for risk of bleed. He was
admitted again on [**2148-10-15**] for worsening abdominal pain and ERCP
was done which showed large fungating mass in the duodenum. Next
day went for cholangiogram and showed complete obstruction of
CBD, intrahepatic ducts-->int/ext biliary drainage catheter and
ext bag drainage. Celiac plexus block was done on [**10-21**] for
chronic pain. Patient was discharged on [**2148-10-22**]. Patient was
intubated for procedures but then extubated. He did have foley
while in the hospital.


Past Medical History:
Onc Hx: diagnosed with rcc in [**5-/2147**] when he presented
with hematuria and abdominal pain. The CT showed a large right
renal mass and he underwent nephrectomy on [**2147-6-6**].
Nephrectomy showed an 11 cm tumor with invasion into the
perinephric tissues and major veins, with clear cell histology,
Furhman nuclear grade 2. His preoperative workup had revealed
pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation.  CT scans following
nephrectomy showed recurrence in the nephrectomy bed site as
well as increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He received HD
IL-2 treatment in [**2147-9-1**] without response. He was
enrolled in the phase I
avastin/sorafenib trial initiating treatment in [**11-5**].
Metastatic cancer to the pancreas. Last chemo was sutent stopped
early [**Month (only) 462**] before whipple.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Exploratory lap, cholecystectomy, appendectomy and an
antecolic retrogastric isoperistaltic gastroenterostomy and an
ileocolic bypass [**2148-9-19**]
2. Status post partial colectomy after perforated bowel
secondary to a motorcycle accident.
3. Status post right knee surgery.
4. Status post left knee arthroscopy.
5. History of pulmonary emboli on anticoagulation.

Imaging:

CTA [**10-25**]: .  Interval increase in size of the right lower lobe
consolidative process now encompassing the previously noted
ground-glass opacity.  Also interval development of air
bronchograms.  These findings raise the suspicion for right
lower lobe pneumonia.
2.  Interval development of loculated right-sided pleural
effusion.
3.  Right middle lobe and left lower lobe atelectasis.
4.  No definite evidence of residual PE.
5.  Differential enhancement of the right and left lobe of the
liver which is only partially visualized.  The vessels cannot be
evaluated on this study.  This is of uncertain etiology and
significance.
6.  Biliary drain with expected pneumobilia.
.
CXR [**10-25**]: Stable chest radiograph.
.
Biliary cath check: Persistently dilated common bile duct and
mildly dilated intrahepatic ducts due to known metastatic mass
of the duodenum. Internal- external drainage catheter in place,
without evidence of leakage. The tube was connected to the bag.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 51 yo man with met RCC to pancreas s/p biliary
stent who presented w/ fever, tacchycardia, tacchypnea and
possible RLL consolidation on chest CT.
.
# CAP: presented with sepsis requiring stay in intensive care
unit, with fluid resusitation, supplemental O2 and IV antibiotic
therapy. Pt with consolidation on CT chest consistent with
pneumonia. Transferred to OMED after stabilization. Pt remained
afebrile with improving leukocytosis - continued on vanc & zosyn
for 72h, then vanc discontinued. Pt to complete 2 week course of
antibiotic with augmentin at home.
.
# Respiratory Failure/pneumonia: Pt with hypoxia, tachypnea and
increasing O2 requirement as above. Pt with consolidation on CT
scan, CTA negative for PE. Provided nebulizers as needed, gentle
diuresis with furosemide as pt fluid overloaded. He was weaned
off O2 to room air without difficulty. He is to complete 2 week
course of augmentin for community acquired pna.
.
# Pancreatic mets s/p biliary stent with perc.drainage:
Cholangiogram done on admission, with external drainage bag
placed per surgery. Leakage noted around insertion site during
OMED stay, required IR to change perc. biliary drainage tube.
Now with internal drainage. Family was taught drain care by the
nurses. There was no evidence of abdominal infection during
stay.
.
# Metastatic RCC: s/p Whipple due to mets to head of pancreas.
Last chemotherapy, Sutent, stopped [**8-/2148**] prior to whipple
procedure. Palliative care involved. Possibility of further
treatment to be addressed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# Pain: Chronic pain r/t malignancy. Well controlled during
hospitalization. Palliative care with pain recommendations for
patient. Regimen included Methadone and Dilaudid.
.
# Anemia: Chronic since early [**Month (only) 462**] coinciding with Whipple
procedure. Nml folate & B-12, however with iron deficiency as
well as anemia of chronic disease. Initiated Ferrous sulfate for
iron replacement.
.
# Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine on home regimen
.
Pt reached maximal hospital benefit and was discharged home with
services. Pt is to follow
