Admission Date:  [**2136-1-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-1-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2090-8-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Progressive shortness of breath, fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 45-year-old male with a
history of asthma/COPD, last pulmonary function tests in
[**2135-10-7**] showing a FVC of 2.5 (63%), FEV equals 0.47
on [**2135-12-27**], and recently treated as an outpatient
for a congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
with a steroid taper until [**2136-1-7**], and Levaquin
until [**2136-1-5**], presented to the Emergency Department
with complaints of increased shortness of breath not relieved
by inhalers, as well as productive-yellow cough.  The patient
was awoken from sleep at 11:30 am with symptoms; he denies

In the Emergency Department, his initial vitals were a heart
rate of 120, blood pressure 100/palp, respiratory rate 32-36,
O2 saturation 79% on room air, increased to 93% on 100%
nonrebreather.  An electrocardiogram was a poor tracing, but
it was relatively unchanged from previous, with no ischemic
changes noted.  He was noted to have excessive accessory
muscle use, was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

The patient continued to have difficulty with saturation and
sputum control.  Blood cultures sent, chest x-ray was
obtained demonstrating an interval improvement/resolution of
a left upper lobe infiltrate, however, new infiltrates at the
bibasilar regions concerning for pneumonia.  Arterial blood
gas was done which revealed 7.23/75/55/33/0 on 100%
nonrebreather.  Patient was intubated for impending
hypercapnic respiratory failure.  He was transferred to the
MICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease; on home oxygen
six months ago.  In [**2135-10-7**], pulmonary function
tests (See history of present illness).
3. Status post left lower lobectomy; for a left lower lobe
nodule, pathology report was subsequently negative on [**2135-9-6**].
4. Question of pulmonary hypertension; echocardiogram in
[**2134-8-7**] was suboptimal for evaluating the pulmonary
arterial pressures.  On that echocardiogram, the patient had
mild RV dilatation, mild global RV free-wall hypokinesis,
mild left atrial enlargement, and a preserved ejection
fraction.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Albuterol two puffs qid.
2. Atrovent four puffs tid.
3. Bactrim double strength one tablet [**Hospital1 **].
4. Ensure three bottles tid.
5. Flovent 220 mcg six puffs [**Hospital1 **].
6. Prednisone taper.
7. Serevent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
8. Zyban 150 mg po bid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married with three kids, 60 pack year of
tobacco use, no drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had lung cancer at age 65, mother
died of a myocardial infarction at age 63, brother had a CABG
at age 43, sister has congestive obstructive pulmonary
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs as able.  In
general, intubated and sedated.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distention, no carotid bruits.  Chest:  Poor airway movement,
diffuse wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Normoactive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:  Intubated.

LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
30.3, hematocrit 49.3, platelets 277, MCV 88.  Differential
includes 89 neutrophils, 3 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes.  Sodium
134, potassium 4.1, chloride 90, bicarb 39, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 103.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus tachycardia at 119, right axis
deviation, right bundle branch block, right ventricular
hypertrophy.

CHEST X-RAY:  Interval improvement/resolution of left upper
lobe infiltrate, new infiltrates at bibasilar regions
concerning for pneumonia.

Sputum:  Gram stain oropharyngeal flora.  Blood cultures x2
were pending and sent off from the Emergency Department.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
MICU course:  Intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Found to have a new bibasilar pneumonia with ensuing sepsis.
Briefly supported with pressors requiring 10 liters of normal
saline and Neo-Synephrine and Levophed support.  Initial
respiratory acidosis trouble shot on assist-control
ventilation.  Maintained on steroids and IV levofloxacin 500
mg q day with improvement with respiratory status and
pneumonia.  Chest CT scan was obtained on [**1-11**] to
rule out pulmonary embolism.  The study were consistent with
no pulmonary embolisms, however, mass-like densities were
noted at the right lung base with inflammatory changes at the
left lower base.  There was suspicious nodular densities
adjacent to the heart on the right, as well as a more
spiculated-appearing nodule in the left lower zone.  These
are new findings compared with [**2135-11-6**] studies.
Likely infectious, however, nodular lesions suspicious for
malignancy versus post-obstructive changes.  Our
recommendation is to repeat CT scan in four-six weeks from
[**1-11**].

Echocardiogram was obtained on  [**1-12**], to look for
pulmonary hypertension.  The study demonstrated a preserved
ejection fraction of 60%, small pericardial effusions, RV
dilatation, decreased RV systolic function.  Pulmonary
arterial pressures, however, could not be determined given
technical limitations to this study.  There was no evidence
of tamponade.

MICU course included cycling of cardiac enzymes to rule out
demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and sepsis.
Cardiac serial enzymes were negative x3.  The patient had no
dynamic electrocardiogram changes throughout his course.
Also is noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia while asleep.
The patient continued to do well, and was extubated on
[**1-13**], and transferred to the floor with stable
respiratory status on 3 liters of supplemental nasal cannula
oxygen.

Medicine [**Hospital1 **] course by problems:
Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, bibasilar, continued to improve on po
levofloxacin.  Blood cultures remained no growth to date by
the time of discharge.  Sputum cultures were no growth to
date by day of discharge.  Regarding congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease flare, patient was initially treated with
standing albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, used subsequently
weaned to his usual outpatient MDI doses.  Continued a
prednisone taper that was started in the MICU.  Continued to
improve and required no supplemental oxygenation at rest by
date of discharge.  Ambulatory O2 sats remained greater than
90%.  Ambulation limited by deconditioning, and was evaluated
by Physical Therapy, who recommended rehabilitation.

Regarding the suspicious nodular densities demonstrated on
CTA of the chest, the recommendation will be for the patient
to followup with a repeat CT scan in four weeks.

Tobacco abuse:  The patient was continued on bupropion at 150
mg po q day.  Smoking cessation was discussed on various
occasions throughout this hospitalization.  The patient is
interested in quitting.  He should be discharged from
rehabilitation with a goal of using a nicotine patch in
addition to the bupropion.

Endocrine:  The patient received cyanocobalamin
supplementation throughout his course.  Patient was also
started on calcium carbonate at 1,000 mg po bid to prophylax
against bone loss given pernicity of steroid use.  Using
Fosamax as an outpatient was discussed with the patient's
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she will
consider this treatment option as an outpatient.

Cardiac:  Cardiac status remained stable throughout hospital
course.  Echocardiac findings as above.  There is no evidence
of congestive heart failure throughout his course.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone taper:  [**1-17**], the patient
is to receive 40 mg po q day of prednisone.  [**1-20**], the patient is to receive 20 mg po q day
of prednisone.  [**1-23**] and thereafter until the
patient sees his primary care, he should receive 20 mg po
qod.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, [**1-17**] is day #7 of a
14 day course.
3. Cyanocobalamin 250 mcg po q day.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg
