.
EKG:
[**2191-9-14**]: tracing # 1: Narrow complex tachycardia. It is unclear
whether this is sinus. Diffuse ST-T wave changes likely due to
repolarization abnormalities. Cannot exclude ischemia. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2190-11-13**] narrow complex tachycardia
is seen and there are ST-T wave changes.

[**2191-9-14**] Ectopic atrial rhythm with ventricular premature beats
and premature atrial contractions. Non-specific lateral T wave
changes. No diagnostic interim change.
.
IMAGING:
CTA [**2191-9-14**] IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental and subsegmental PE affecting the posterior basal
segments of
the left lower lobe. Probable additional subsegmental PE
involving the right upper lobe apical segment.
2. Stable pulmonary nodules, for which no additional followup is
needed.

Echo [**2191-9-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Portable CXR [**2191-9-15**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and moderate tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema.
Unremarkable hilar and mediastinal contours.

Liver/gallbladder US [**2191-9-15**]:
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is mildly distended but no gallstones
are
identified. There is no gallbladder wall edema and no
pericholecystic fluid
is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct
measures 0.5 cm. No focal hepatic abnormality is identified on
limited views of the liver. The spleen is unremarkable measuring
8.9 cm. No ascites is seen in the upper abdomen.
IMPRESSION: No gallstones and no biliary dilatation identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 year old woman with history of CAD, dCHF, last cath [**2185**] with
clean coronaries, Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior
PE recently completed 6 month course of anticoagulation
presented with new PE and atrial flutter, discharged in stable
condition on anticoagulation.
.
# PE: Recurrent. Unclear why she had her prior (second) PE for
which she received a course of 6 months coumadin. She was
stabilized in the ICU after her BP dropped s/p SL GTN in the ED
and transferred to the floor. She was started on heparin drip
upon presentation to the hospital which was then shifted to
lovenox injection 60 mg twice daily, first dose given the
evening of the
