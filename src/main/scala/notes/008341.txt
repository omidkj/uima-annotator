CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2126-10-11**] 1:24 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Hemorrhagic contusion in the left frontal lobe.
2. Small subdural hematoma along the falx cerebri and tentorium.
3. Probable chronic subdural hematoma along the left frontal
convexity, and possibly along the right as well. The latter
appearance of extraaxial widening is felt more likely due to
atrophy, however.
4. Sinus mucosal thickening with a small air-fluid level in the
sphenoid.
5. Nasal bone fractures.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree that the right frontal
extra axial fluid is most likely an enlarged subarachnoid space.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2126-10-11**] 1:24 AM
IMPRESSION:

2. Moderately severe emphysema.

sinus.
4. Cervical spondylosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-10-11**] after a fall in
his bathroom. He was evaluated and admitted to the trauma
service initially for neuro checks, a repeat CT head the
following morning and observation (especially given his history
of alcohol). Overnight, the patient was stable and he
neurlogically was intact. A repeat CT in the morning showed a
contusion which potentially was read as an underlying mass. The
patient was hence kept for furthur observation. As an MRI was
unable to be done, a repeat CT head with and without contrast
was done, which showed no underlying lesions. THe patient had no
other medical or surgical issues and was stable. Over the
weekend from [**10-11**] to [**10-13**], the patient remained in the trauma
ICU awaiting a bed on the floor. He remained stable and without
issues. He was put on a CIWA scale per his alcoholic history. He
was intermittently confused at some points overnight, likely due
to his pain medications and alcoholic history.
He was seen by physical therapy on [**2126-10-14**], who reccomended one
more session prior to discharge on [**2126-10-15**]. On [**10-15**] he was seen
and evaluated by physical therapy and cleared for discharge.  He
was seen by physical therapy on [**2126-10-15**], and then discharged in
a stable condition. He is due to follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
clinic in 4 weeks with another repeat head scan.
