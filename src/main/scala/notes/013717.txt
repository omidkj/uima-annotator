Imaging:
[**2139-3-14**] CTA Chest: 1. Cardiomegaly with CHF and interstitial
edema.
2. Right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. 3. No
evidence of PE or aortic dissection. 4. 5-mm right upper lobe
nodule; follow-up CT within 12 months recommended to assess for
stability. 5. Multiple ulcerated plaques within the descending
aorta. 6. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
However, the assessment of the gallbladder is extremely limited
given the absence of IV and oral contrast. 7. Diverticulosis,
without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
[**2139-3-14**] CXR: The patient is status post CABG. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. There are bilateral
interstitial opacities, worse compared to the previous exam.
There is no pleural effusion demonstrated on this frontal view.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is no focal airspace
consolidation.
.
[**2139-3-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2139-3-26**] CXR: No new acute parenchymal consolidations are
identified and there is improvement to interstitial pulmonary
edema and bilateral basilar atelectasis with remaining
subsegmental plate-like atelectasis identified within the bases
bilaterally. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
unchanged and the patient is again noted to be status post
median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery. A right-sided
central venous catheter has been removed and there is no
evidence of pneumothorax.
.
[**2139-3-27**] Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon. Polyps in the ascending colon, sigmoid colon,
rectum, and in the descending colon.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 F with CAD s/p CABG, COPD, OSA on CPAP 15 qhs, HTN, AFib on
coumadin who presented w/ SOB, anemia, and elevated INR.
.
#Respiratory Failure/SOB: On arrival to ED, she was dyspneic
with RR to 24. The patient had increased dyspnea. She was unable
to lie supine, so she was intubated for CT scan due to concern
for occult bleed as cause for Hct drop. MICU course was
complicated by repiratory distress on [**3-16**] due to flash
pulmonary edema which resolved with lasix, epinephrine, and
methylpredisone. She was extubated on [**3-17**]. [**3-18**] she was
reintubated due to hypoxemia believed to be due to upper airway
edema as seen on bronchoscopy which improved w/
methylprednisolone. Patient was extubated on [**2139-3-22**]. Patient was
stable on transfer to medicine floor and her respiratory status
was stable with O2 sat in the mid-90's on RA or on 2L NC. Her
respiratory failure was likely [**3-20**] her long standing diastolic
CHF, COPD exacerbation, and pneumonia. She should continue with
home O2 as needed.
.
#COPD: stable. O2 by NC was titrated to 92-94% given her COPD,
during daytime patient was at low 90's O2 sat on room air.
Patient was continued on nebulizer prn and montelukast 10 mg PO
daily.
.
#Pneumonia: Patient had a left lower lobe pneumnia diagnosed on
[**2139-3-18**], she was treated with vancomycin and meropenam x 7days.
Bronchoscopy was done on [**2139-3-18**] to evaluate the upper airway
edema s/p extubation and gram stain showed no microorganisms.
Patient completed  a course of vancomycin and meropenam on [**3-24**].
Due to leukocytosis, fever, and cough, the patient started on
cipro 500mg po q12hrs x7 days and flagyl 500mg po q8hrs 7 days
(day 4 of 7) for presumed aspiration pneumonia in setting of 2
intubations/extubations. She should continue this course of
antibiotics through [**2139-3-30**].
.
#Obstructive sleep apnea: Continue BiPAP at night.
.
#CHF: Secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy and s/p 3v CABG.
Diastolic heart failure with EF>55%. Patient was contined on
lisinopril 30 mg PO DAILY and lasix 20mg po daily.
.
Elevated INR: On presentation to ED, INR was 8.2. INR on [**2-23**] was
1.9 and INR was 6.2 on [**3-2**]. She was taking coumadin, but
coumadin was dc'd on [**3-2**]. However, daughter states that patient
was taking medications on her own at times, and there was a
possibility of accidentally taking extra doses of coumadin since
she was not supervised in taking her medications always. In
discussion with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 10245**] was made to d/c the coumadin and
start the patient on clopidogrel.
.
#Anemia: On presentation in the ED, her H
