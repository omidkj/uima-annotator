Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9035**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a right thoracotomy with
tracheoplasty and bronchoplasty.  He had an epidural catheter
placed for pain control.  Following surgery he was taken to the
SICU for further management.  He maintained stable hemodynamics
but had minimal pain relief from the epidural catheter.  It was
more effective when the solutions were split.  He underwent
vigorous chest PT and used his incentive spirometer effectively.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his chest tube was
removed as he had no air leak and minimal drainage.  He started
a liquid diet and tolerated it well.  His epidural was removed
and his pain was controlled with oral Dilaudid.  His thoracotomy
incision was healing well.

Once he was ambulating more frequently he had increased oral
secretions and although he felt his dyspnea was less than pre
op, he was still symptomatic.  The pulmonary service was
consulted to assist  in maximizing his medications to improve
his symptoms.  They felt that his secretions were due to
decreasing airway edema as opposed to an asthma flare.  His
oxygen was eventually weaned off and his room air saturations
were 96%.  He used his home CPAP at night and was reminded to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in the sleep lab.  Mucolytics were also
added.

He was walking independently and tolerating a regular diet.
After an uneventful recovery he was discharged to home on
[**2195-2-11**] and will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in a few
weeks.
