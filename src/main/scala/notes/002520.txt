Admission Date: [**2186-2-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-4-1**]

Date of Birth:  [**2128-4-19**]        Sex:  M

Service:  MED


DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2186-4-1**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
male with past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post 4-vessel CABG in [**5-4**], status post pacemaker
placement who was admitted for evaluation of elevated white
blood cell count.  In [**2-2**], he noticed fatigue, decreased
energy, diffuse body aches, swollen gums, and swollen glands.
He did not note any gum bleeding.  He experienced extreme
dyspnea on exertion, initially only while walking uphill or
exerting himself, but progressively increasing to the point
that he was having dyspnea with walking on level ground for
distances greater than [**9-20**] feet.  The fatigue came
gradually and unexpectedly and was progressing.  He went to
the outpatient primary care physician on the day prior to
admission for routine blood work.  CBC there showed white
blood cell count of approximately 128,000.  He was advised to
go to the hospital.  He first went to an outside hospital and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2186-2-25**] for full workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times 4 vessels in
[**5-4**].  No history of myocardial infarction.

Basal cell carcinoma, status post excision.

Nephrolithiasis, status post surgical removal.

Status post pacemaker placement in [**5-4**], recently
interrogated.

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT REPORTS ALLERGIES TO AMOXICILLIN
RESULTING IN SENSATION OF SWELLING WITHIN HIS MOUTH AND
FINGERS.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone.
2. Lisinopril.
3. Toprol XL.
4. Lipitor.
5. Aspirin.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works for an insurance company.
He denies any tobacco use, but reports occasional alcohol
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father was deceased from
[**Name (NI) 4278**] lymphoma and diabetes mellitus 2, mother deceased
from a colon cancer, and sister with cervical cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs -
temperature 101.3 degrees, heart rate 86, blood pressure
119/63, and respiratory rate 20.  Generally, this is a well-
developed, thin, chronically ill-appearing male, no acute
distress.  Head and neck exam had pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light.  No scleral injection or icterus.  There
was positive lymphadenopathy at the right and left
submandibular, soft, mobile lymph nodes approximately 1 cm in
diameter and matted lymph nodes in the anterior cervical neck
chain.  Cardiovascular exam, was regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and crescendo/decrescendo
murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.  There was a
surgical scar noted from his kidney surgery.  Extremities
were warm and well perfused without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times 3.
Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength 5/5
throughout and sensation grossly intact to light touch.

PERTINENT LABORATORY, X-RAY, OTHER STUDIES:  Complete blood
cell count on admission was 128,000 white blood cells, 32.8
hematocrit, platelets of 76.  Chemistry was remarkable for
sodium 138, potassium 2.7, BUN 20, creatinine 1.3, and
glucose 61.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Leukemia:  The patient
underwent bone marrow biopsy, result consistent with acute
myelogenous leukemia.  He started induction chemotherapy with
7 plus 3.  His post chemotherapy course was complicated by
multiple events.  Notably, on admission, he had febrile
neutropenia with an ANC less than 500.  For this, he was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Status post
subclavian line placement for chemotherapy, he had increased
bleeding and oozing from line site on [**2186-2-27**] and was found
on laboratories to be in acute DIC.  He had a prolonged
period of neutropenia from [**2186-3-2**] to [**2186-3-24**].  He was
supported with blood products including platelets and serial
blood transfusions to keep platelet count greater than 10 and
hematocrit greater than 25.  However, he had a transfusion-
dependent anemia and low platelets that was concerning for
antiplatelets antibodies.  Additionally, towards the end of
his hospital course, a peripheral smear started to reveal
presence of immature cells.  This was concerning for
recurrence of his disease.

Dyspnea/hypoxia:  Starting on [**2186-3-6**], the patient became
more dyspneic with increasing oxygen requirement.  CT scan of
the chest at that time demonstrated right upper lobe ground
glass opacities concerning for infection versus hemorrhage.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2186-3-7**] with grossly bloody
lavage fluid concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  For
this, he was treated with 1 g of IV Solu-Medrol times 3 days.
As part of the workup for his dyspnea, he also underwent
echocardiogram, which showed a depression of his ejection
fraction to 40 percent.  The patient's dyspnea remained with
very minimal improvement.  In light of this, repeat CT scan
was performed on [**2186-3-20**], which demonstrated persistent
bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities concerning for
atypical versus fungal infection versus cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia.  He underwent repeat bronchoscopy on
[**2186-3-21**] with cultures growing budding yeast, which was
speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.  He had already been on
prophylactic doses of ampicillin at that time, but ampicillin
was increased to treatment dose of 5 mg/kg.  During this
period of time, the patient was profoundly neutropenic.
However, as his counts came back up, he had an increasing
oxygen requirement concerning for engraftment syndrome.
Therefore, he was treated with Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV times 2
on [**2186-3-25**] and [**2186-3-26**] for engraftment.  He continued to be
treated on cefepime, ampicillin, and Flagyl.  There was a
concern whether he had some evidence of aspiration versus
hospital acquired pneumonia as serial chest x-rays
demonstrated left lower lobe and lingular opacities.  He
continued to have increasing oxygen requirement and had an
episode of acute respiratory distress on [**2186-3-28**],
necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
After transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he
underwent a CT angiogram of the chest.  This was felt to be a
limited study secondary to consolidation, atelectasis, and
due to patient movement.  It showed a slight decrease in
previously noted bilateral pleural effusions.  There was
patchy consolidation bilateral diffusely mostly in the
peripheral lung zones.  There was increasing atelectasis at
the right greater than the left bases.  There are bilateral
lower lobe opacities with question of airway collapse.  There
were no filling defects concerning for a pulmonary embolus
noted.  The patient's pre and subcarinal lymph nodes remained
prominent in spite of his recent courses of chemotherapy.
The patient continued to be in profound respiratory distress
and was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with noninvasive
ventilation mode.  There was some concern that perhaps some
of his respiratory compensation was due to amiodarone
toxicity, as he had been on amiodarone in the past.  He was
continued on oxygen, chest physical therapy, aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  He was also evaluated for a possible VATS
procedure.  He continued to have episodes of hypoxia and
desaturation, which responded to repositioning, anxiolytics,
and noninvasive ventilation.  VATS was planned for [**2186-3-31**].
The patient was intubated prior to the procedure.  However,
post intubation, he became unstable from the hemodynamic
standpoint.  Therefore, VATS was postponed.  His degree of
hypotension ultimately necessitated initiation of pressors.
On [**2186-3-31**], a discussion including the Medical Intensive
Care Unit team, the Oncology Service, and the patient's
family was held.  At this time, it was felt that the
patient's prognosis was very poor given his increased need
for hemodynamic support via pre
