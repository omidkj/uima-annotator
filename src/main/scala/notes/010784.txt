Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M h/o CHF, afib p/w progressive shortness of breath and
worsening lower extremity edema worse on left than right x 1
week. He states he was quite active with symptoms until he
climbed up Edinburgh castle in [**Country 18084**]. He admits to two
pillows when he sleeps, but has to increase it to three pillows
for the last few days, no PND.  He also complained of
substernal, dull, non-radiating chest discomfort that started
when he was in [**Country 18084**]. He states had this feeling since his
CABG many years ago. He has not taken NTG. Nothing makes the
pain better/worse. It is non-pleuritic.  He admits to one
tablespoon hemoptysis (dark brown chocolate color) daily for the
past two days. He flew back from [**Country 18084**] two days PTA.

In ED VS were HR: 118-129 in afib BP: 128/84 22 96% RA. Was
given 10 mg IV diltiazem x 3 and 30 mg po diltiazem. Given ASA
325. INR was 6.7 and given 10 mg IV vitamin K and 1 unit of FFP.
 Tmax: 100.8. CXR showed focal infiltrate in the left mid lung
zone as well as cardiomegaly. CT showed no PE, however did show
extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe which may
be concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage given the elevated INR.
He was also started on 750 mg levofloxacin for presumed PNA.
Labs also notable for elevated LFTs, which is new for the
patient. Also given 40 IV lasix.

Upon arrival to the unit, patient complained of chest
discomfort. EKG was afib at rates in 110s. N/S ST/T changes. He
was given sl NTG with complete relief of his chest pain. Admits
to chills, no fevers. Denies abdominal pain.

Images & Procedures:
[**2104-7-15**]
- EKG: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 116, with
ventricular premature depolarizations. Compared to the previous
tracing multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist
without major change.
	    Intervals	                Axes
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	   P	QRS	T
116	0	106	332/430	   0	119	-77
- CT chest/abd/pelvis: ... The heart is mildly enlarged with
mild reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins and IVC
suggestive of right heart strain... Multiple small mediastinal
lymph nodes seen in the prevascular region, hilar region, likely
reactive... The maximum diameter of the AAA is 63 x 62 mm, has
minimally decreased since the prior study where it measured 75 x
77 mm. The aortobiiliac stent is unchanged in position,
extending just below the origin of the superior mesenteric
artery into both common iliac arteries. There is no evidence of
endoleak at this time. Multiple tiny foci of hyperdensity within
the excluded aneurysm sac are unchanged in appearance since the
prior study (and precontrast series) and likely represent
calcifications. Aneurysmal dilation of both the right and left
common iliac arteries is unchanged.  Extensive diverticulosis of
the sigmoid and transverse colon are noted without evidence of
acute diverticulitis. Trace amount of pelvic free fluid is
present. No significant pelvic lymphadenopathy is detected.
Impressions:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic pathology is
detected.
2. Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe, could
represent infection. However, given the clinical history of
elevated INR, hemoptysis, and lack of symptoms of pneumonia,
this could represent pulmonary hemorrhage. Bilateral small
pleural effusions.
3. Extensive centrilobular emphysema and secondary evidence of
elevated right heart pressures.
4. Status post AAA repair with the excluded AAA slightly smaller
in size compared to the prior study. No evidence of endoleak.
5. No acute intra-abdominal pathology det
