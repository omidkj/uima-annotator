History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 95142**] is a very nice and sweet 64 YO woman with
multiple lymphomas s/p 2 autologus stem cell transplant (see
below for details) and transfusion-dependent MDS, CHF (EF 30%)
who came here initially for night sweats, low-grade fever,
abnormal CBC and SOB.  She had been having face pain with
greenish nasal discharge for the past 3-4 weeks. She saw an ENT
who recommended saline spray; there was no improvement. She
received Z-pack (unknown date) and then was started on
cefpodoxime 7 days ago with improvement of her upper airway
symtpoms. Patient states she has been having fever up to 100.8,
with chills, there has been production of greenish sputum with
cough associated, but has also improved since starting of
antibiotics. Patient started loosing 10 lbs within the last
couple of moths, but then has gained them back in the last two
weeks. She has been on and off her lasix with multiple doses and
she decided to stop it 7 days ago. There has been no swelling of
her legs. The SOB was getting worse during the 3 days prior to
admission.

<br>
She was first diagnosed in [**2144**] when she presented with a right
neck mass. She underwent radiation to her mantle and below the
diaphram. In [**2145**], more nodes wer found, and she underwent
chemotherapy at that time. In [**2147**], she underwent high dose
chemo with stem cell rescue, which was successful. Her post
transplant course was complicated by disseminated Zoster (had
for years--treated with acyclovir), encephalitis/ meningitis
(?on Bactrim). She also suffered from depression and was started

on Prozac during that time. She was doing well until [**2157**] when
she was admitted for work-up of a left lower lobe mass. LN
Biopsy revealed an anthracotic node and lung wedge bx showed
only patchy areas of scarring and bronchial metaplasia, with no
malignancy identified in either tissue.
.
Around [**2161-10-28**], she started to feel 'not right'. She
presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat. In mid [**Month (only) 404**], she had

a recurrence of her shingles (treated with Valtrex; recurred on
right chest, left neck). She also saw an ENT for her sore throat

who saw a mass on her tonsillar pillar. Biopsy revealed findings

c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features,
given the proliferation fraction of ~90%. The alternative
consideration of an atypical Burkitt was considered less likely
given the nuclear pleomorphism and reported bcl-2 positivity.
She followed-up with her Oncologist after the biopsy was done
and underwent BM bx revealing no marrow involvement.
She underwent cycle 1 of ESCHAP 2/17-22/05. Her course was c/b
fluid overload, profound nadir and mucositis. She had a PET scan

[**2-2**] showing marked interval decrease in FDG-avid disease within
the pulmonary parenchyma and interval resolution of FDG-avid
lymph-adenopathy within the neck, mediastinum, and hila. Pt was
admitted from [**Date range (1) 95143**] /05 when she received [**Hospital1 **]-R chemo,
which she tolerated well. [**Date range (3) 95144**] - she was admitted
for a 2nd autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM
chemotherapy.

Chest CT scan on [**2165-9-23**] (admission):
Bilateral dependent pleural effusions have increased in size,
now  moderate to large on the right and moderate on the left. No
enlarged  mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified. Heart
is normal in size. Exam was not tailored to evaluate the
subdiaphragmatic region, but no  substantial changes are
identified in the upper abdominal region on this  limited
assessment with persistent atrophy of the superior pole of the
left kidney. Within the lungs, bilateral paramediastinal areas
of radiation fibrosis with associated traction bronchiectasis
appear unchanged, as well as focal linear scarring adjacent to
an apparent wedge resection site in the superior segment of the
left lower lobe. Atelectatic changes are present at the lung
bases adjacent to the pleural ef
