CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Seventy-three-year-old male with
history of AFib, CHF with EF of 15%, chronic renal
insufficiency, and cecal AVMs, who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] with lower GI bleed secondary to the cecal
AVM.  The patient initially presented to the outside hospital
on [**4-20**] with bright red blood per rectum and a hematocrit of
24.

Over the past three days PTA, the patient had received 6
units of packed red blood cells with a hematocrit increasing
to 30 in the setting of intermittent persistent lower GI
bleed.  A bleeding scan revealed a cecal origin of bleeding,
but colonoscopy was unhelpful secondary to poor prep.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible embolization of
culprit arteries feeding the right colon/cecum incase of
persistent bleeding.  Currently on admission, the patient
complained of pain at the left hand IV site, and denied chest
pain, abdominal pain, headache, recent GI bleeding in the
last 12 hours.

Of note, patient had several episodes of monomorphic DT/NSVT
and was asymptomatic.  He was transferred to the ICU for
closer monitoring of lower GI bleed and abnormal cardiac
rhythm.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 8.9 with
differential of 84% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 6%
monocytes, hematocrit 27.7, platelets 131, MCV 101.
Chemistries remarkable for a sodium of 147, potassium 4.0,
bicarb 21, BUN 76, creatinine 2.0, glucose of 80. INR 2.5.

EKG showing atrial fibrillation at 57 beats per minute, left
bundle branch block, Q waves in III and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lower GI bleed:  The GI, Interventional Radiology, and
Surgery services were consulted.  GI performed a colonoscopy,
which showed oozing of blood on the left side of the colon
and no cecal AVMs, suggesting sigmoid diverticular bleed.  He
was currently not bleeding aggressively, and thus both
Surgery and Interventional Radiology were not required.
However, the thought was to send patient for angio if the
patient began to bleed again.

Given that he had a coagulopathy, focus was placed on
correcting this with vitamin K.  He was transfused an
additional 2 units of packed red cells in the unit as well as
an additional 2 units again after transfer to the floor after
stabilization.  His hematocrits were followed serially, and
he never had a significant bleed requiring intervention.

2. Acute renal failure:  Patient had a jump in his creatinine
from 2 to 2.8 up to 3.5 along with decreasing urine output
and eventual anuria.  He was bolused with a total of 3.5
liters of normal saline over 24 hours with very little change
in urine output.  He was thought to have likely ATN, which
was thought to be secondary to poor cardiac perfusion of end
organs due to his low EF and component of cardiogenic shock.
The precipitant of ATN was also thought to be mediated by
aggressively limiting the patient's fluid intake during the
MICU stay.

3. Rising bilirubin:  Patient had an increase in his total
bilirubin up to a maximum of 6.3 without concomitant increase
in his ALT and AST as well as alkaline phosphatase.  His
pancreatic enzymes also remained normal.  The etiology for
the rise in bilirubin was not known, but GI had hypothesized
that it may be due to poor blood flow forward as well, with
cirrhotic liver, unable to amount increase in transaminases.
However, he had a normal right upper quadrant ultrasound.

4. CHF:  The patient had an echocardiogram showing a very
depressed ejection fraction with 2-3+ MR as well as severe
TR.  He also had ruptured chordae seen.  His likely volume
depletion along with poor cardiac output contributed to
multiorgan system dysfunction.  He did not respond to fluid
boluses.

5. NSVT:  Patient was followed by EP during this admission,
who suggested possibly starting amiodarone with pacing as
this would cause bradycardia.  However, in light of patient's
multiorgan system dysfunction, it was felt that he had too
many comorbidities to survive any intervention.  He was
initially monitored on telemetry showing up to 30 beats of
NSVT, which was asymptomatic.  This was never intervened
upon.

6. Bony pain:  The patient reported after transfer to the
floor that he had fallen at the outside hospital on [**4-22**].
Ortho was consulted, and he had imaging of his right shoulder
as well as left wrist and left hand.  These showed no
evidence of fracture and he received Occupational/Physical
Therapy.  Ortho believed that he may have had a left
ligamentous injury accounting for this pain and recommended
followup as an outpatient.

However, in light of his declining medical condition, he will
not be following up with Orthopedics.

7. Left upper extremity swelling:  He began to develop
swelling of the left upper arm several days into admission,
the etiology of which is unclear.  The arm was treated by
elevating and ultrasound showed no DVT.

8. Pain control:  Patient was maintained on adequate pain
control with OxyContin and oxycodone.  He will be discharged
on these medications as well as Morphine prn.

9. Type 2 diabetes:  He continued on fingerstick blood
glucose checks q.i.d. and RISS with good glycemic control.

10. FEN:  Because he was bolused 3.5 liters of normal saline
over 24 hours with no increase in urine output, Cardiology
suggested no further boluses.  He was allowed to take p.o.
liberally.

11. Code status/disposition:  Patient stated that he wished
to remain DNR/DNI during his admission.  He was not
interested in having a pacemaker placed by EP.  We had
extensive family meetings with the patient and his healthcare
proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as other friends to discuss the
future of his care.  It was finally decided that he would be
discharged home with hospice as he wanted no large measures
made given his multiorgan system dysfunction/failure and
decline.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Terminal.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with hospice.
