History of Present Illness:
67 year old female with past medical history of metastatic lung
cancer with spinal metastases had L1 anterior resection on [**8-24**]
and then posterior fusion on [**8-28**] transferred to medicine for
management of elevated INR and pain.  The patient was diagnosed
with lung cancer in [**2113-11-18**] on work-up for back pain.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had wedge resection [**2114-1-18**] foloowed by
XRT/chemo, which ended [**2114-6-8**].  Patient presented to
[**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital with worsening back pain in [**Month (only) 205**] and
underwent hyphoplasty on [**2114-8-7**].  Biopsy was negative at that
time for metastatic disease.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
worsening pain and recieved anterior approach resection/cage on
[**8-24**] with posterior fusion of L1 on [**8-28**].  Imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] is
suspicious for metastatic disease to T10, T11 and L1 on MRI.
Throughout her hospital course here at [**Hospital1 18**], patient has had
pain on her right hip/thigh that has been constant.  She states
no aggravating/relieving factors.  She has been on Dilaudid PCA,
standing MS Contin with dilaudid for breathrough.  The pain has
been treated as neuropathic.  Of note, she has had nausea for
the past 3-4 days limiting her ability to tolerate PO intake.

- s/p hysterectomy, appendectomy, cholecystectomy
- s/p kyphoplasty of L1  ([**2114-7-18**])
- s/p RUL/RML Lobectomies ([**2113-12-18**])


Social History:

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old female with PMhx of Lung Cancer, (s/p right upper
lobectomy, middle lobe wedge resection, 4 cycles chemo +
adjuvent radiation) with lower back and right hip pain since
[**6-26**] (s/p kyphoplasty) transferred from OSH for evaluation and
management of lower back pain and possible metastases to the
spinal column at L1.
.
# Lower Back Pain - Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from
[**Hospital **] hospital for evaluation by Ortho Spine for possible
intervention for her new L1 compression fracture.  Noted on
MRI's in early [**Month (only) 205**], the marrow signal from L1 and possibly from
T11 were suspicious for metastasis, however biopsy in [**Month (only) 205**] at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was negative.  Pateint was initially treated for
her pain with Dilaudid PCA while undergoing evaluation.  MRI and
CT spine at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed L1 and T11 lesions.  Due to concern
that this was metastatic lung cancer, Heme/Onc and Rad-onc were
consulted, as was palliative care.  Rad-Onc decided that
radiation was not indicated at the time of consult and
recommended following orthopedic's recommendations for extension
brace and further management of pain.  Palliative care was
instrumental in detailing an effective pain management plan.  On
[**8-24**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken for an anterior L1
corpectomy, anterior arthrodesis T12-L2, application of
interbody cage T12-L2, application of lateral anterior hardware
T12-L2 with a screw rod construct, and application of autograft
rib. Approach for this procedure was through Left thora
