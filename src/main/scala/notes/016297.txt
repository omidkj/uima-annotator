History of Present Illness:
76-year-old gentleman is known to  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**], who
performed a distal pancreatectomy on him 2-1/2 years ago for an
early stage pancreatic cancer. Mr. [**Known lastname **] has subsequently
developed myeloproliferative disease and has had
numerous upper gastrointestinal ulcer events over this 2-year
period; however, he has remained cancer-free. He was just
admitted with upper GI bleed which was fairly mild. He received
2 units of packed red blood cells initially to recover his
already low hematocrit. Upper GI endoscopy was futile on the
first night of admission given a large amount of blood in the
stomach. He was washed out over the next day, when he remained
stable. He then had a follow-up endoscopy which revealed a
bleeding ulcer in the antrum of the stomach just in a prepyloric
position. This was coagulated and cauterized and epinephrine
was administered to it. It appeared to be under control at this
point in time.  However, about 6 hours after, he burst forth
with a massive and sudden upper gastrointestinal bleed.

EGD [**2155-9-25**]: Large 1 cm gastric ulcer with recent stigmata of
bleeding. Successfully treated with epinephrine and cautery.
Multiple patchy areas of ulceration in gastric body.  Otherwise
normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for hemoptysis, received 2 units pRBC in ED and
admitted to MICU for treatment and evaluation of UGI bleed.
Endoscopy attempted [**9-25**] but could not adequate assess due to
excessive blood and clot in stomach.  Pt. received additional 3U
pRBC. O/N on [**9-25**] massive hemoptysis, received 10U pRBC,
emergently intubated by anesthesia.  On pressors, lactate 12.8,
emergently brought to OR for antrectomy, repair of arteriotomy
with bovine pericardial patch for upper gastrointestinal
hemorrhage and boring ulcer of the posterior gastric wall
directly into the celiac access.  Intraoperatively the patient
received 11 units of FFP, 11 packed red blood cells and 3
platelets.  The abdomen was left open with [**Location (un) 5701**] bag in place,
and returned to the ICU in critical condition.  The patient had
a brief post-operative course, experiencing multi organ system
failure requiring pressors and ventilatory support in the
setting of increasing lactic acidosis.  A discussion with the
family regarding the patient's poor prognosis led to making the
patient CMO.  Pressors were discontinued and the patient was
extubated, expiring shortly thereafter.
