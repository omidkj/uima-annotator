History of Present Illness:
81 year-old female with DM, HTN, HLD, who presents with chest
pain that began the night prior to admission [**8-4**]. She states
that she has been having a cough that began the day before she
was discharged from her last hospitalization on [**7-13**], that has
lingered since that time.  In the interim she has been using her
albuterol and flovent inhalers, was prescribed a prednisone
taper about 2 weeks ago from her pulmonologist and was tried on
both azithromycin and levaquin, both of which upset her stomach,
she took 2 days of azithromycin and 4 of 5 days of levaquin.
During this time she says that she had an increase in the
frequency of her sputum and the sputum that had previously been
white changed to yellow.  Denies any fever/chills, shortness of
breath, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, associated.

The night prior to admission, she was sleeping, woke up coughing
and then experienced a sharp chest pain that radiated to her
back, and worsened with deep inspiration.  She has never had
pain like this before and she pressed her life line, the
ambulance came and there was initial concern for an STEMI.  In
the ambulance she received ASA and oxygen with resolution of her
chest pain.

On arrival to the ER it was felt that she was not having an
STEMI, she had a CTA that showed no PE or dissection.  She was
found to have an elevated WBC, and consolidations seen on CT so
she was given a dose of levaquin.

[**8-7**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
single
vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.  The
LAD and LCX had no areas of stenosis.  The RCA had a complex 90%

stenosis in the mid-portion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild systolic hypertension with
SBP 148
mmHg, and a widened pulse pressure with a DBP of 60 mmHg.



Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old female presented on [**8-5**] with chest pain and PNA.
She was started on levaquin for her PNA and she underwent
cardiology evaluation for elevated troponins and EKG changes.
She was diagnosed with NSTEMI.  Therefore, she underwent cardiac
catheterization and balloon angioplasty of her RCA on [**2130-8-7**].
Patient's post-cath course includes being placed on a heparin
gtt for atrial fibrillation and stable conservative management
of a right groin hematoma.

On post-catheterization day #5, the patient went into rapid
atrial fibrillation in the early AM.  Her HR was in the 150s and
SBP in low 80s.  Her heart rate was converted back to sinus with
Digoxin and her SBP was now in 100s.  However, 30 minutes after
the patient went into Afib, she complained of severe abdominal
pain in her right lower quadrant. General surgery consult was
called a little later that morning, as there was concern that
the patient displayed peritoneal signs.  The general surgery
team evaluated the patient 20 minutes after administration of
prochlorperazine for nausea, and thus she was slightly sedated.
However, she did complain of abdominal pain in mid-abdomen. She
had not been passing flatus for the previous 36 hours, and she
had one episode of vomiting earlier in the AM.   A CT scan of
the abdomen/pelvis was ordered on the patient and showed right
[**Date Range 499**] and cecum with pneumatosis, areas of portal venous gas
seen in liver, and air in veins running through iliac fossa that
were likely branches of the portal vein.  The patient and her
family members were immediately contact[**Name (NI) **] with the gravity of
the diagnosis - the patient likely had ischemic injury to her
[**Name (NI) 499**] either from a thrombus to a branch of the SMA or she had
ischemic [**Name (NI) 499**] from a low flow state that was a consequence of
her atrial fibrillation.  After thorough discussion between Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 468**], the patient, and her family members reviewing all the
risks and benefits of surgery, the patient was taken emergently
to the operating room.

Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy on [**2130-8-12**].  Findings
included toxic megacolon and ischemic injury extending from the
right [**Date Range 499**] through the transverse [**Date Range 499**].  The patient underwent
a subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy.  Because the patient's
case occurred late in the evening on [**8-12**], she was kept
intubated postoperatively.

The patient's early postoperative course was marked by rapid
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  During the first 24 hours
postoperative, she dropped her pressures to systolic of 50 and
required cardioversion and adenosine injections.  She was
started on an esmolol gtt to control her atrial fibrillation,
and this was then changed over to an amiodarone gtt.  The
patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells and
was temporarily placed on a dobutamine gtt.  The patient was
evaluated by cardiology, who recommended that she placed back
onto an amiodarone gtt.

The patient underwent an ECHO cardiogram on POD 2 that revealed
normal LV and RV function and an EF of 55-60%.    The patient
also had a leukocytosis and an elevation of her LFTs from POD4
through POD7.  Concern was raised as to whether the patient
could have acute cholecystitis.  However, she underwent a right
upper quadrant ultrasound on POD5 that showed patient had no
evidence of acute cholecystitis, and rather she may have an
element of shock liver.  The patient's LFTs and WBC eventually
normalized.  The patient was on and off neosynephrine gtt during
this time period, however this was thought to be due to her
slightly lower blood pressure as a consequence of propofol - the
patient was intubated during this time period and remained on
propofol.  She was started on tube feeds and this was tolerated
to goal.

Once the patient's leukocytosis and LFTs improved, the patient
was extubated on POD 10.  She had slight tachypnea.  She was
given lasix to remove excess fluid.   However, the patient tired
out on POD11 and she was re-intubated. CXR post-intubated showed
a large right pleural effusion.  The patient underwent
thoracentesis by the SICU service and 900 cc of transudative
pleural fluid was removed.  However, post-thoracentesis CXR
showed a right basilar pneumothora
