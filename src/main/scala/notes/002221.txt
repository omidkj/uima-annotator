ADDENDUM FOR THE REST OF THE ADMISSION HISTORY.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman
with diabetes mellitus, history of prior myocardial
infarction, numerous syncopal episodes in past of unknown
etiology, who noticed increased fatigue and decreased PO
intake over the past two to three weeks.  The patient fell
two times today on a carpeted floor, but the patient did not
hit her head.  She did lose consciousness for a short period.
The patient believes she hit her right hip and lip.  There
was no history of chest pain or shortness of breath,
dizziness, vertigo, or palpitations.  The patient attends a
physical therapy program every week, where she does note
bilateral dull shoulder pain, which was different from her
anginal pain, previously, which she experienced with mild
physical activity.  Per the patient, she does not note any
decreased exercise tolerance or any episodes of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea in the recent week.  The patient does not
have any baseline orthopnea.  The patient has not noticed any
increase in peripheral edema or weight gain over the past few
days.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was born in [**Hospital1 8**] and
assisted by home health aid.  The patient is able to do most
of the activities of daily living without difficulty at
baseline.  No alcohol, smoking, or drug use in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of prostate cancer.  No family
history of premature coronary artery disease or temporal
arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination, upon presentation,
revealed the vital signs of 112/44, heart rate 53,
respirations 99% on two liters.  Respirations 22.  GENERAL:
The patient is a pleasant female with no apparent disease.
HEENT:  Bruise on upper lip, no JVD, mucous membranes moist.
Pallor under eye lids.  CARDIAC:  Normal S1 and S2.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  HEART:  Heart sounds were
distant.  LUNGS:  Lungs revealed crackles [**2-16**] of the way up.
There was good air movement.  ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or
guarding.  EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs upon admission revealed the following:
White blood cell count 6.7, hematocrit 27.2, platelet count
230,000, PT 13.3, PTT 22.6, INR 1.2, sodium 134, potassium
6.2, which was hemolyzed.  Repeat potassium was 5.8.
Chloride 100, bicarbonate 20, BUN 37, creatinine 1.8, glucose
175, urinalysis negative.  CK 215, MB 12, troponin 47.7.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure, left
ventricular enlargement.  CT of the head revealed no
hemorrhage, no mass effect, no infarct.  EKG revealed old
left bundle branch block, ST segment elevation only about
1  mm elevations in V2 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name **]
Service, where she ruled in for myocardial infarction by CKs
and troponins.  The patient was held off the carvedilol
secondary to active congestive heart failure.  The patient
received one unit of packed red blood cells due to anemia.
Unfortunately, this worsened the congestive heart failure
with crackles remaining 2/3rds of the way up, even after IV
Lasix dose.  The patient was also held on her ACE inhibitor
since the creatinine was high and potassium was high.  Renal
consultation was curbsided and it turns out that the patient
had hypoaldosteronism in the past, which explains her
chronically elevated levels of potassium and three times a
week of Kayexalate.  The patient was monitored on telemetry
and did quite well.  The patient continued to remain on
heparin drip, and the patient was scheduled for
catheterization after the weekend.  Unfortunately, the
patient acutely decompensated.  On [**2121-9-30**], the patient had
an episode of atrial fibrillation, which is new.  The atrial
fibrillation was accompanied by systolic blood pressure
dropping into the 70s and heart rate jumping into the 120s.
The patient also noted an episode of right shoulder pain at
that time and EKG revealing atrial fibrillation and
rate-related ST segment changes.  The patient could not be
given beta blocker or Cardizem due to decreased blood
pressure.  The patient was given two fluid boluses of 250
normal saline, which resulted in systolic blood pressure
coming up to 85 and decreased heart rate to 95.  The
patient's pain resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  It
was decided that the patient should go to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory for elective cardioversion due to
atrial fibrillation resulting in cardiovascular compromise.
The patient was transferred up to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory for cardioversion at this time.  While in the
cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient underwent
cardioversion, which resulted in temporary normal sinus
rhythm.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization,
during which time RCA stent was placed.  The patient, during
the cardiac catheterization, had runs of V tachycardia, which
converted by defibrillation.  The patient was intubated.  The
patient had a balloon pump placed.  The patient was placed on
Amiodarone, Lidocaine, as well as pressors.  The patient was
transferred to the coronary care unit for further management.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] [**Name (NI) 653**] the family at that time to discuss
further management options and interventions.

The patient remained in the coronary care unit for three
days, where she was given stress dose steroids, secondary to
PMR.  She was continued on heparin since she had ruled in for
a second MI due to that brief episode of chest pain.  The
patient was also noted ....................and was placed on
insulin drip with glucoses running greater than 400,
accompanied by anion gap.  The patient's hematocrit was low,
and the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood
cells.  Urine culture at that time was also found be positive
as was the chest x-ray with a question of left lobe
infiltrate.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl for a ten-da
