Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
Scheduled surgery for fistula takedown

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ex-lap, fistula takedown, resection of anastamosis


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a man who had a
total gastrectomy in the past for gastric cancer.
Approximately 1 year ago he had a right colectomy through a
subcostal [**Doctor Last Name **] incision. Radiation and chemo were
recommended postop. He was treated with chemotherapy for
approximately 9 months as he required dose de-escalation.
After the completion of the chemotherapy, radiation therapy
was initiated. In [**2175-6-18**], the patient developed intra-
abdominal abscesses which were drained percutaneously. He
subsequently did well and was discharged to home but then had
repeated episodes of new fistulae opening on the abdominal
wall at the site of his previous incision. A fistulogram
documented communication with his previous anastomosis.
Surgical excision was recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34128**] operative course was uncomplicated. He was
routinely observed in the PACU, and transferred to Stone 5.
.
POD1- Triggered in early AM for low urine output, and low BP.
Managed with IV fluid bolus, and IV albumin with adequate
response. Pain poorly controlled. Pain service consulted. Blood
pressure decreased once again. Transferred to ICU for closer
observation. Managed with IV pressors & IV fluid boluses.
.
POD2- Stable in ICU. Blood pressure and urine output adequate.
Pressors weaned as tolerated. Pain better controlled with PCA.
Continued with IV antibiotics due to elevated WBC-13.1 with left
shift. Blood cultures collected. Remained in ICU for another 24
hours observation. CXR revealed atelectasis.
.
POD3- Blood presssures and urine output stable for 24 hours off
of pressors. Transferred back to Stone 5. Transfused for HCT
26.4. Repeat CXR revealed fluid overload. Plan for diuresis.
.
POD4- Diuresis continued with Lasix. Adequate response with
increased urine output, and cleared breath sounds. Neb inhalers
ordered. Physical therpay consulted due to deconditioned status.
Ostomy with sweat & minimal stool. Awaiting increased bowel
function. Otherwise vitals stable. Ostomy RN consulted, teaching
initiated. Patient sustained 67 beat of VTACH. Remained alert,
and asympotmatic. HR elevated to 138, BP stable. Patient
converted to NSR independently. Trigger called per nursing.
Labwork, EKG, and Lopressor IV started for rate control.
Continued with telemetry.
.
POD5- Cardiology consulted. Lopressor switched to PO, continued
with Lasix for diuresis, Labwork collected & K,MG, CA repleted
as needed. Echo ordered, EF-35%. Considering AICD placement.
Patient remained stable with occasional PVC's. Started on
clears. Tolerated well. Increased serous ostomy output.
BNP>4000. CXR improved.
.
POD6- Lopressor increased to 25mg every 8 hours to maintain
HR<90. Tolerating well. Blood pressure stable. Labwork stable,
repleted as needed. Corrected calcium-9.2 in setting of albumin
of 2.2. Increased ostomy output and flatus. Diet advanced to
regular food. Tolerating well. Occasional runs of VTACH. HR up
to 117 w/ activity. Lopressor increased to 37.5mg every 8 hours
per Cardiology rec. Hold off of AICD for now. Allow for full
recovery post-op, and have formal cardiac evaluation with
patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to determine if
candidate for AICD in future.
.
POD7- Follow-up with Primary Cardiologist on Wed arranged. Home
labwork to be faxed to Cardiologist, and repletions for KCL,
Mag, & Calcium will be ordered as needed per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Visiting
nurse, and Home Physical therapy have been arranged.
