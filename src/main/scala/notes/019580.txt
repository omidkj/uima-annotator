CXR [**2121-11-29**] No evidence for pneumonia or CHF.

Echo [**2121-11-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

L knee xray [**2121-11-28**]: There is likely a small joint effusion. No
acute fracture or dislocation identified. There are mild
degenerative changes consisting of spurring of the tibial
spines.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. ID: (reiteration of course until transfer to floor): Pt was
admitted, cultures taken and pt put on vancomycin, levaquin, and
flagyl. He had a CT scan of his lower extremity, which revealed
subcutaneous collections with enhancing rims involving the
dorsum of the foot, and the medial and lateral ankles which are
quite extensive in length. He was taken to the OR on [**11-14**] where
his wound was again debrided. They also placed VAC dressing at
this time. Podiatry performed a split thickness skin graft on
[**2121-11-24**] (R thigh to R foot).
On [**2121-11-24**] he was transferred to the MICU for hypotension
(80's/40's) and fevers up to 105 after his split thickness skin
graft procedure. His lactate was 3.1 and he was tachycardic so
he was placed on the sepsis protocol. He was fluid rescusitated
and his BP quickly improved to 110-120/40-50. He developed
diarrhea on [**2121-11-25**]. Given that he had been on clindamycin for
treatment of his foot infection, it was felt that he likely had
C Diff and was begun on po flagyl.  He was also empirically
placed back on vancomycin and levaquin, as his only culture that
was positive was a wound swab from admission that grew coag
negative staph (rare; no sensitivities performed.)
On 11/31 he was transferred to the floor.  His [**Last Name **] problem on
the floor was persistent hypotension in the 80s-90s.  He was
asymptomatic throughout.  His blood pressure would bump
occasionally with IV fluid boluses, but eventually these were
stopped because his hypotension was asymptomatic and he would
just diurese all of the fluid on his own.  He initially was
febrile and tachycardic with these low blood pressures, but both
of those resolved and his BP remained low.  He had numerous
studies in terms of an infectious workup, including numerous
negative CXR's, blood cultures, stools cultures (including CDiff
neg x2, 3rd pending to date), and negative urine cultures -
although he did have one urine cx with E.coli that was felt by
ID to not be the source of his fevers, as on repeat UA it was
negative.  He did receive a couple doses of Macrobid for this
UTI.  At one point his left knee was mildly swollen, and a tap
of this effusion revealed normal joint fluid with no evidence of
infection.  He was discharged home to finish one more week of
vancomycin and on d/c he had been afebrile x 3 days.  His
levaquin
