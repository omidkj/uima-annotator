Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vidaza / vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38616**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted electively for chemotherapy for MDS in transformation
to AML

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath
thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is admitted for Cycle 2 of Decitabine. He has been doing
relatively well at home since his most recent two hospital
admissions: [**Date range (1) 73068**] admitted with progressive weakness due
to pneumonia and UTI and [**Date range (1) 73067**] with fever and found to have
a pansensitive E. coli bacteremia, Vancomycin sensitive
enterococcal bacteremia, and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] blood stream
infection. That hospitalization included marked LFT
abnormalities, and a question of a cholecystitis versus possible
drug reaction. Last had chemotherapy with Cycle 1 Decitabine on
[**2135-6-6**] after a drug challenge with lower doses which he
tolerated well. The drug challenge was performed because he had
a severe reaction to Azacitadine with multiple skin
complications including neutrophilic dermatoses and ischemic
bowel.

He was transferred to the CCU after developing CP while on the
oncology service on the evening of [**9-5**]. He developed sudden
onset SSCP which then radiated to the back, described as a
throbbing sensation, not similar to chronic back pain. He
received 0.4 SL Nitro x 3 and 10 mg IV morphine with some
resolution. There was a thought there may be some ST depressions
in V4-V5, which resolved after the above. BP was symmetric in
BUE at that time. A bedside echo was performed by the cardiology
fellow with new inferolateral hypokinesis so he was transferred
urgently for cath, lab was activated overnight.

Cath revealed single vessel right dominant disease with 70%
stenosis of the RCA. No stent was placed in order to minimize
the risk of interruption of chemotherapy. His CP was attributed
to demand ischemia and troponin peaked at 0.07 before trending
down.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, pt. was noted to have temp of 104
without localizing symptoms for infection. He was already on
Vancomycin, Cefepime, Fluconazole and Acyclovir at time of
transfer to the CCU (Vanc and Cefepime added just prior to
cath). Vancomycin was changed to Daptomycin today given concern
for allergy. UA showed trace leuks, few bacteria and CXR showed
no evidence of pneumonia. Blood and urine cultures show NGTD. He
also developed asymptomatic hypotension in the CCU with
systolics in the 80s, responsive to fluid. He was afebrile
otherwise throughout CCU stay. He was given 1L NS total with
improvement to the 90s systolic. He had a few hours of [**Last Name (un) **],
transient hypoxia with SaO2 88 on RA which resolved with 2L
nasal O2.  He was transferred to the floor on [**9-7**] without any
complications.

On ROS he reports that he is still fatigued, ambulating with a
walker, and has a poor appetite. He denies fevers, rigors,
chills, new pain, cough, dysuria or focal symptoms of infection.
He also denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of
breath.  All other ROS are negative.
.

Past Medical History:
MDS RAEB type 1, 7% blasts with extensive myelofibrosis, 7q-,
transfusion dependent, s/p azacitadine complicated by ischemic
bowel perforation and multiple ulcers (pyoderma gangrenosum).
Right colectomy [**9-/2134**], for ischemic bowel with slow healing
midline abdominal wound.
Decubitus ulcers.
Neutrophilic dermatosis (pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweets
syndrome).
Carpal tunnel syndrome.
COPD.
Left knee surgery.
Back surgery.
Demand ischemia with 70% stenosis of RCA on cath [**9-5**], elected
to treat with medical therapy alone


Social History:
Retired, used to work for a chemical company. History of
asbestos and other chemical exposure. He has a history of
significant alcohol use, which he stopped approximately seven
years ago. 60 pack year history of tobacco use.
