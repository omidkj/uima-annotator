Admission Date:  [**2172-2-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-2-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2104-12-24**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
emphysema (forced expiratory volume 0.59) on home oxygen 2
liters nasal cannula and smokes two packs per day who
infection symptoms for three days including a cough at
baseline and sputum eight days prior Emergency Room admission
on [**2172-2-6**] PEEP.  The patient was lethargic,
somnolent, and had increased work of breathing with an oxygen
saturation in the 60s and wheezing bilaterally.  Her arterial
blood gas demonstrated a respiratory acidosis and hypocarbia.
She was placed on nasal BiPAP, albuterol and Atrovent
Emergency Room, and her oxygen saturation increased to 90% to
91%, and her arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.42, PCO2
of 74, and PO2 of 120.  She also complained of
nonexertional/nonradiating chest pain with no ischemic
changes on electrocardiogram.  Additionally, her code status
was discussed in the Emergency Room, and the patient was made
do not intubate, but she still desired to defibrillated.

She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where
she was febrile with a temperature of 102.5, and 85% on
BiPAP.  Her chest x-ray was clear, hyperinflated lungs, no
signs of congestive heart failure but a nasal swab that was
positive for influenza.  She was treated with amantadine and
levofloxacin.  She was weaned from BiPAP to 2 liters nasal
cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90% to 91% at rest, but
had decreasing oxygen saturations to 70% with activity.  She
was continued on her Flomax, albuterol, and Atrovent
nebulizers, and prednisone 20 mg q.d. to improve her
respiratory condition.  She ruled out for myocardial
infarction with negative creatine kinases, CK/MB, and C
troponin.

On admission, her hematocrit was 55.4 and was 55.4 secondary
to her history of polycythemia, and was due for a blood
removal the day after admission.  Due to various blood draws,
her hematocrit decreased to 44.1 by the time the patient was
transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
floor.  When the patient was transferred to the floor, the
patient continued to have shortness of breath but was
improving and became less dyspneic with activity such as
moving in the bed and having bowel movements.  Her cough had
decreased, but she was having difficulty coughing up her
sputum.  When able to expectorate her sputum, it was tan in
color without bright red blood.  The night before transfer to
the floor, she had nonexertional chest pain for a couple of
hours located to the right of the midline and also in the
midline of her back.  The pain did not radiate, was constant,
was relieved by Zantac.  Serax helped alleviate some of the
pain.  Additionally, she reported abdominal pain the night
before admission that was relieved by having a bowel
movement, and she currently has a baseline intermittent
constipation and diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome.
She was nauseated and wanted to vomit but has been unable to
do so since her hernia repair.  Her strength is slowing
progressing.  There was a re-discussion of her code status,
and the patient desired to be do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

no visual changes, no headaches.  Denies tingling and
numbness.
