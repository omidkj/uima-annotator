Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Xanax / Vicodin / darvocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical intubation and ventilation.


History of Present Illness:
87 yof with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin with
recent total shoulder arthroplasty secondary to OA, who presents
in respiratory failure. History is obtained from the son who
reports that he was with her until 8pm tonight at which point
she felt well without complaint. Around 11pm, he received a call
from her complaining of SOB. He notes that she has had a
non-productive cough for the past few days but no shortness of
breath until tonight. She was not complaining of chest pain or
any other symptoms. He arrived at her house and reports hearing
a gugurling sound while she breathed. EMS was called, and pt's
respiratory distress progressed requiring intubation in the
field.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, CXR was obtained consistent with
pulmonary edema. EKG was vpaced and unable to be interpreted for
ischemia. She was sedated with fent/versed/propofol and vent
setting on transfer to the MICU were AC TV: 450 P: 18 peep 13
100% fiO2. Her tox screen positive for benzos and tylenol. INR
was elevated at 5.2. Hct was 33.6 down from 36.8 on [**2104-12-22**]. Pt
triggered for hypotension and propfol drip was held and she
received 2L of NS. This was followed by a dose of 40mg IV lasix

.
On arrival to the MICU, VS were: T 97.8 BP 175/75 HR 65 O2 100%
on the above settings.
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain as she is intubated.

III) Imaging:

STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2105-2-27**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: 87-year-old woman recently admitted for CHF
exacerbation,
now with cough.

FINDINGS: The pacemaker is unchanged. There is again seen a
hardware within
the upper lumbar spine as well as a right reverse total shoulder
arthroplasty.
There has been removal of the feeding tube and the endotracheal
tube. The
heart size is upper limits of normal. There is some mild
tortuosity and
calcifications of the thoracic aorta. There is no pulmonary
edema, pleural
effusions, or focal consolidation.

Chest xray [**2105-2-25**]
FINDINGS: A single portable supine chest radiograph was
obtained.
Interstitial and alveolar opacities, and hilar indistinctness
are new since
[**2102-4-17**]. Pacemaker leads project over the expected location of
the right
atrium and right ventricle. Endotracheal tube ends in the mid
trachea. The
aortic arch is calcified. Lower lumbar pedicle screws are
intact. Right
humeral hardware is partially visualized.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema is new since [**2102-4-17**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IV) Studies:

TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Mild to moderate ([**11-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-9-5**],
the estimated pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. The other
findings are similar.
