Admission Date:  [**2180-10-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2106-12-15**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
male with moderate severe aortic stenosis and severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease admitted three times in the
past six months for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation, most recently last week.  The patient had
arranged a visiting nurse.  The patient met compliance to
assure he is on his proper medications at home.  Per the
daughter, the patient is unable to keep his medications
straight and he sometimes misses doses.  The patient is here
with similar symptoms to prior admissions and states he feels
better off his medications.  The patient was administered
intravenous steroids and oxygen by face mask in the Emergency
Department, and he was transferred to the floor where he
became more short of breath.  He has had some fevers at home
reportedly and intermittent atypical chest pain episode on
the day prior to the day of admission, left-sided pleuritic
pain and general discomfort with dyspnea.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was negative for
headache, vision changes, change in appetite and positive for
chest pain with shortness of breath, negative for orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, diaphoresis.  Occasional
constipation, no bright red blood per rectum.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d., Afrin 81 q.d.,
Atrovent 4 puffs b.i.d., calcium carbonate 500 t.i.d.,
Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d., Lac-Hydrin prn, Levofloxacin finished
this course on [**9-23**], Prednisone taper ended on [**10-24**], Protonix 40, Serevent discus, Vitamin D.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
with an FEV1 of 0.98, aortic stenosis, critical valve area of
0.8 cm on an echocardiogram in [**2180-3-14**].  Osteoarthritis.
Dyspepsia status post treatment for Helicobacter pylori in
[**2174**].  Hyperlipidemia.  Peripheral vascular disease.
Ichthyosis.  History of herpes zoster.  Degenerative joint
disease and cervical spondylitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is Somalian, a retired engineer,
lives with his wife and three children.  He quit tobacco six
years ago, no alcohol, no other medications or illegal drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.2 axillary, heartrate
107, blood pressure 148/76, respiratory rate 29, 100% on
facemask.  The patient is an elderly Somalian male lying in
bed in moderate severe respiratory distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Nasal flaring, pupils equally round,
and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, dentures
are in place.  Neck supple, notable for accessory muscle use.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, distant S1 and S2.  Pulmonary,
poor air movement, tachypnea, diffuse wheezes.  Abdominal
examination:  Normal bowel sounds, soft, mild left lower
quadrant tenderness.  Extremities:  No edema.  Neurological:
alert and oriented.  Per family moves all extremities grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission notable for
lactate of 4.4 and blood gases which initially were 7.34, 47,
228 and progressed to 7.21, 60, 159.  White count 11.4,
hematocrit 34.2, creatinine 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 73 year old male with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with multiple
recent admissions, readmitted for shortness of breath,
stabilized in the Emergency [**Hospital 13064**] transferred to the
floor and developed worsening respiratory failure.

Respiratory failure - The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit where he was placed on BiPAP in light of
his respiratory fatigue and increased secretions with
worsening hypoxia.  He was started on Azithromycin 500 mg
times one and then 250 mg times four days.  The patient was
weaned off of biPAP and had improving respiratory status.
Chest x-ray showed heart and mediastinal contours stable.
Aorta, slightly avulsed, lungs clear without effusion,
consolidations or pneumothorax.  Shortness of breath improved
and the patient was transferred back to the floor on [**2180-10-25**] and was continued on steroids and was changed to
p.o. Prednisone 60 to begin a long taper.  Continued on
nebulizers, chest physical therapy, Azithromycin, incentive
spirometry.  The patient improved on this course.  At the
time of discharge it was thought the patient would be a good
candidate for outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.

Congestive heart failure/volume overload - In the Emergency
Department the patient had good diuresis with Lasix 20 mg
intravenously.  Continued diuresis while in the Emergency
Room noted creatinine up to 1.3.  In the Medicine Intensive
Care Unit the patient continued his diuresis, BUN and
creatinine were heavily followed.  The patient had an
echocardiogram to assess cardiac function which revealed an
ejection fraction of 50% with mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1+ aortic regurgitation, aortic valves are
severely thickened and deformed.  Mitral valve with 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation
when compared with prior studies.  In [**2180-3-14**], the left
ventricle was less hyperdynamic and the aortic valve orifice
area is now further reduced to 0.7 cm squared.  The patient's
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted who felt that this
could be managed as an outpatient and cardiac function was
not the cause of his admission or repeated admissions which
are likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He
recommended further outpatient treatment for his cardiac
problems.

Chest/epigastric pain - Per primary care notes, this is a
chronic non-cardiac pain.  The patient had ruled out and did
have a small increase in troponins, maximum of 0.02 probably
due to demand in the setting of tachycardia and tachypnea.
The patient's pain appeared worse postprandially while the
patient is on Protonix.  He has had a history of gastritis in
the past.  Gastrointestinal was consulted as he has had
Helicobacter pylori in the past, they recommend an outpatient
workup of the questionable gastritis.  They recommend a ten
day period off Protonix prior to a Helicobacter pylori breast
test.  This will be followed up with his outpatient provider.

Acute renal failure - The patient's increase in BUN and
creatinine in the setting of diuresis returned to baseline
prior to his discharge.

Elevated blood glucose levels - Most likely secondary to
steroid use.  The patient was covered with an insulin drip in
the Intensive Care Unit and then transitioned to an insulin
sliding scale and q.i.d. fingersticks.  Hemoglobin A1c was
measured and found to be 6.9.  The patient's lowest blood
glucose even on the sliding scale were in the 150 range.
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes was consulted and recommended starting
Glucotrol XL 5 p.o. q.d. as well as increasing the patient's
Humalog sliding scale.  They recommend a trial of Metformin
500 mg q.d. as the patient's creatinine returned to a
baseline of 1.0 and we were no longer concerned about
congestive heart failure as this medication may precipitate
congestive heart failure.  The patient had a nutrition
evaluation and teaching on diabetic diet and follow up was
arranged at [**Hospital **] Clinic.  The patient was assessed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy.
