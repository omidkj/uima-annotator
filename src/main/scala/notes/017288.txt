Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for MICU admission: respiratory distress s/p intubation
in ED

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
RIJ central line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year old man with PMH significant for HTN, CHF,
chronic kidney disease who presents with repiratory distress. He
had been hospitalized multiple times recently at [**Hospital1 18**],
beginning in [**11-24**] with a mechanical fall then re-presented that
month with pneumonia. In [**2-25**] he returned with a DVT in the
right common and deep common femoral veins and CHF exacerbation,
as well as troponin elevations and a bibasilar pneumonia.
.
He now presents following a fall at home. Per his wife and
notes, he was at home for the last three days following
discharge from rehab. He was reportedly sitting in a chair at
home, then fell off the chair. His wife found him on the ground,
awake and talking, and called EMS to get him to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation. He did not have any obvioud trauma. His wife says he
noted chest heaviness and heart racing earlier in the day, and
had seemed short of breath since discharge from rehab.
.
In the ED, he was noted to be in respiratory distress, tachypnic
to 35, and O2 sat was 80%. His extremities were cool. He denied
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, incontinence, fevers, chills,
palpitations. Due to his respiratory distress, code status was
confirmed and the patient was intubated. Antibiotics were
started with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl, then blood
cultures were sent. CXR was felt to not have a striking
pneumonia. CT angiogram was considered but not done due to
elevated creatinine, and VQ scan was also considered. He got 1.8
liters of fluid and was empirically started on heparin because
his INR was 1.8, then transferred to the MICU.


Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. CKD: baseline around 2.3
3. bipolar disorder - on lithium previously
4. hyperlipidemia
5. prostate surgery many years ago - indication not specified
6. Patient reports hospitalization in [**2111**]'s for MI but does not
know details.
7. Urinary incontinence
8. MI ([**2111**]) and a recent NSTEMI in [**Month (only) **]/06
9. DVT
10. CHF with EF [**2-25**] 30-40% with multiple hypokinetic walls
11. UTI's
12. Anemia
13. Possible reactive airway disease with response to prednisone
[**2-25**]
14. Hematuria
15. Pneumonia [**2-25**]


Social History:
Patient lives with his wife of > 60 years in an [**Hospital3 **]
senior facility in [**Location (un) **]. Has 2 grown children, one is
[**State **] and one in [**State 760**]. Remote history of tobacco. No
alcohol.

HEENT: pupils small, reactive
Neck: JVP elevated at 30 degrees
Resp: lungs with crackles diffusely bilaterally
CV: irreg irreg, normal S1s2 no murmurs

V6, likely J point elevation in V2/V3. LVH. Wide QRS -
interventricular conduction abnormality.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

Reason: SWOLLEN LEGS AND HYPOXIA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with swollen LEs and hypoxia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?DVT
DOPPLER ULTRASOUND STUDY OF BOTH LOWER LIMB VEINS

CLINICAL DETAILS: Evaluate for deep venous thrombosis.

FINDINGS:

Right and left lower limb veins are patent and compressible with
phasic venous flow and increased venous return with augmentation
demonstrated on Doppler.

CONCLUSION:

1. No right or left lower limb deep venous thrombosis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Severe global LV
[**Name (STitle) 39407**]. Severely depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No LV
mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Normal RV
systolic function. [Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more
depressed given
the severity of TR].

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Borderline PA systolic
hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is severe global left ventricular
[**Month/Day (2) 39407**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Intrinsic LV function
likely more
depressed given the mitral and aortic regurgitation.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
4. Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2137-3-7**],
the MR is now worse and the anterior, inferior and inferolateral
walls are
more hypokinetic with a marked decrease in overall LV function.
