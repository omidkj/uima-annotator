Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course, briefly, by system:

1.  DM/Chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] failure:
Pt was admitted in DKA to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Her DKA was managed with
insulin and IVF.  Her [**Hospital Unit Name **] function was noted to be declining
so she underwent AV fistula formation and received a central
line to begin dialysis during this admission rather than later
next month as was originally planned.

The patient's anion gap closed with insulin and IVF and she was
called out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on HD#3.  The patient underwent three
successful rounds of hemodialysis during this admission, and was
set up to undergo outpatient hemodialysis on a
Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule at the dialysis unit in
[**Location (un) 1468**].  Once the patient was transferred to the floor, she
continued to have elevated blood sugars >400 in the evening, so
her basal glargine was increased to 10 units at bedtime.  [**Last Name (un) **]
followed the patient while she was inhouse.

2.  CAD
Pt's EKG upon presentation demonstrated chronic t-wave inversion
and her cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule her out for MI.  Of
note, the patient did report one episode of chest pain during
admission that resolved promptly with nitroglycerin sl.  Her EKG
demonstrated no changes during this episode.  The patient was
continued on a beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, and ACE inhibitor in
house.

3.  UTI
UA was suggestive of a UTI so the patient was given a 3-day
course of levofloxacin.

4.  HTN
Pt was continued on amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol for
control of her blood pressure.  Upon discharge, the patient's
blood pressure ranged from 110-160/40-80s.

5.  Hypercholesterolemia
The patient was continued on atorvastatin 10 mg qday for
cholesterol management.

On hospital day #8, the patient was cleared by PT and discharged
to home in stable condition.
