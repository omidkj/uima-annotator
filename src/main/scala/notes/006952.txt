Admission Date:  [**2195-10-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-11-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2122-7-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Status post transfer from [**Hospital3 1280**] for possible cardiac
catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
white male with a past medical history significant for
previous myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass
grafting in [**2182**], who awoke on the day of admission with
chest pressure and shortness of breath at 4:30 a.m., which
was better with sitting up.

Review of systems at that time was negative for nausea,
vomiting and positive for lightheadedness and palpitations
which had been present at baseline.  Symptoms improved with
getting up but returned after the patient went back to bed.
At that time, 911 was activated and the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital for further evaluation.  At that time,
arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.15, pCO2 68, pO2 68
with a CPK of 45 and troponin less than 0.3.

At that time, the patient's blood pressure was noted to be
209/129.  He was acutely dyspneic and thus intubated, given
nitroglycerin paste, intravenous Lasix 200 mg, intravenous
morphine 2 mg and Versed.  Post intubated arterial blood
gases showed a pH of 7.31, pCO2 45 and pO2 106.  At that
point, he developed a mottled allergic rash and hypotension
to 57/36.  It was thought to be an allergic reaction to
morphine.  He was started on a Dopamine for maintenance of
his blood pressure.  The maximum Dopamine dose was 4
mcg/kg/minute and he was weaned off gradually.  Prior to
transfer, the patient experienced a one time ICD shock,
presumably because of atrial fibrillation.

Of note, urine output was 1,300 cc from the intravenous
Lasix.  The patient was started on intravenous nitroglycerin
and transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for
further evaluation.  Ventilator settings on transfer were an
assist control of 700 by 14 with a PEEP of 5.  Outside
laboratory data were significant for an AST of 39, ALT 53,
alkaline phosphatase 217, total bilirubin 0.9, white blood
cell count 11.1, hematocrit 45, platelet count 283,000,
sodium 146, potassium 3.6, bicarbonate 23, chloride 105, BUN
24, creatinine 1.7 and blood sugar 251.

In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room,
nitroglycerin was continued.  The patient was awake and
alert, and was gradually extubated.  His Emergency Room stay
was notable for a urine output of 800 cc.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction at age 50, again
in [**2195-5-22**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2182**] with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
one, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery; most
recent cardiac catheterization in [**2195-5-22**] showed 100%
proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, 50% mid-
left anterior descending artery lesion, 70% first marginal
lesion, 100% proximal right coronary artery lesion with
collaterals coming from the circumflex to the right coronary
artery, left ventricular ejection fraction 25% with mild
mitral regurgitation; right heart catheterization showed
elevated right sided pressures including a right atrial
pressure of 24, right ventricular pressure 50, pulmonary
artery pressure 52/20 and wedge of 33, cardiac output 6.05
and cardiac index 2.79.  2.  Hypertension.  3.  Dyslipidemia.
 4.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral to
anterior tibial bypass in [**2194-2-19**] with jump graft in [**2195-5-22**] and status post TPA several months later.  5.  Deep vein
thrombosis.  6.  Status post AICD placement on [**2195-5-27**];
patient had been transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] to [**Hospital6 8866**] after developing chest pain and shortness of
breath; he was found hypotensive and in respiratory failure,
requiring intubation; he became tachycardiac and went into
pulseless ventricular tachycardia and required shock; he
ruled in at [**Hospital3 1280**] with a high CK and, at [**Hospital6 8866**] workup included cardiac catheterization,
echocardiogram and exercise tolerance test; ICD placement was
also at that time; the device is known to be a Guident
device, the details of which will be included in a discharge
addendum.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] quit
tobacco approximately 30 years ago.  He has one to two drinks
per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40
mg p.o.q.d., Zestril 20 mg p.o.q.d., Norvasc 5 mg p.o.q.d.,
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d., atenolol 50
mg p.o.q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a pulse of 75, blood pressure 133/87,
respiratory rate 13 and oxygen saturation 93% on two liters
oxygen and 88% in room air.  General:  Intubated, awake, nods
to questions, resting right hand tremor and head bobbing.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation, oropharynx unable to be
examined secondary to intubation, extraocular movements
intact.  Neck:  No bruits, 10 cm jugular venous distention.
Chest:  Midline coronary artery bypass grafting scar,
otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Clean, dry and intact, good dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis pulses, trace edema in bilateral lower
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 12.3 with a
differential of 85.7% neutrophils, 8.7% lymphocytes, 4%
monocytes, 1.3% eosinophils and 0.3% basophils, hematocrit
36.6, platelet count 202,000, prothrombin time 19.7, partial
thromboplastin time 31.3, INR 2.7, sodium 141, potassium 5.7,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, BUN 24, creatinine 1.4, blood
sugar 96, and first CK with a troponin of 1.6.  Urinalysis
showed large blood, 1,120 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white
blood cells, occasional bacterial and 0 to 2 epithelial
cells.

Electrocardiogram from [**2195-5-22**] showed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate between 100 to 120, ST
elevations and inverted T waves and Q waves present in leads
II and AVF, ST depressions and inversions of T wave present
in leads V4 through V6, inverted T wave also present in V1;
this was compared with the most recent electrocardiogram from
[**2195-10-31**], showing sinus rhythm with minimal ST
elevations and inverted T waves in leads III and AVF, Q waves
still present in leads II, III and AVF, right sided leads
showed no ST elevation in lead V4R, there were occasional Q
waves in leads V4 through V6.

Chest x-ray showed improvement in congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram from outside hospital showed severely reduced
left ventricular systolic function with a ejection fraction
of 25% to 30%, akinesis of the posterior wall, basal and
mid-portions of the septum and inferior wall, hypokinesis in
the rest of the ventricles, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged left atrium.  Adenosine
Cestimibi in [**2195-5-22**] showed a fixed inferolateral defect
with a systolic ejection fraction of 26%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for further evaluation and observation.  He had
been previously extubated in the Emergency Room and was
stable upon entry to the Coronary Care Unit.  The rest of the
hospital course will be broken down in systems.

1.  Cardiovascular/coronary artery disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
continued on aspirin, nitroglycerin drip and heparin as per
myocardial infarction protocol.  Three serial CKs were done
showing values of 83 with troponin of 1.6, 244 with troponin
of 1.5, and 336.  The troponin-I levels were not suggestive
of an acute myocardial infarction per laboratory standards.
Thus, it was c
