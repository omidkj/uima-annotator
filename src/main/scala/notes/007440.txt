Date of Birth:   [**2093-9-6**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is a 62 year old male
with a history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with a
chief complaint of shortness of breath.  The patient
described two weeks of feeling uncomfortable, with an acute
the day of admission, the patient awoke feeling like he could
not walk or talk.  He did not have any chest pain.  The
patient also denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers,
or chills.  He does not have any leg pain or swelling.  He
has had no recent travel and no recent long trips.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed 15
cell cancer to the lungs diagnosed two years ago, on
chemotherapy.  3.  Prostate cancer.  4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypertension.  6.  Gout.

ALLERGIES:  1.  Tetracycline; 2.  Tape.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Allopurinol; 2.  Metoprolol;
3.  Insulin, NPH; 4.  Avandia; 5.  Chemotherapy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired priest, denies
tobacco or alcohol usage and lives in an [**Hospital3 **]
facility.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with a
temperature of 98.1, heartrate 105, blood pressure 110/76,
respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air,
increasing to 93% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient is in mild respiratory stress and tachypneic.
Head and neck examination reveals pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, moist mucous membranes, mildly elevated
jugulovenous distension.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart examination revealed
tachycardia with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel
sounds, no distention or tenderness and no guarding.  No
costovertebral angle tenderness was noted.  Extremities had
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The calf denied calf pain.
Neurologically, the examination was nonfocal and cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count was within normal
limits.  Panel 7 was significant for BUN of 16, creatinine
1.0, and a glucose of 309.  Liver function tests were within
normal limits.  A chest x-ray revealed no evidence of
pneumonia, subsegmental atelectasis at the left costophrenic
angle, and a mass in the left lower lobe, unchanged from
prior examinations.  A computerized tomography scan of the
chest revealed the development of an extensive bilateral
pulmonary embolus involving the superior and inferior left
pulmonary arteries as well as the inferior right pulmonary
artery.  No pericardial effusion was noted.  There was a
small left pleural effusion.  No interval change in the left
lower lobe mass was noted.  The head computerized tomography
scan was performed and showed no evidence of any intra-axial
or extra-axial hemorrhages or mass lesions.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram showed a markedly dilated
right ventricular cavity, with preserved left ventricular
systolic function.  Severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis was noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary - The patient was
anticoagulated with heparin for his pulmonary embolus.  He
remained hemodynamically stable for several days with little
improvement in his oxygen requirement.  He was very dyspneic with
exertion. The decision was made to pursue pulmonary embolectomy
by Interventional Radiology. This was performed on [**2155-10-15**], after which the patient remained intubated in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  He developed acute onset hypertension,
followed by hypotension and tachycardia requiring pressors and
fluids. The course was complicated by pleural effusions and a
pneumonia, which made extubation difficult.  Thoracentesis of
the pleural effusion revealed an exudate consistent with a
parapneumonic effusion.  The patient was aggressively
diuresed, and the pneumonia treated with antibiotics.  On
[**2155-10-26**] the patient self-extubated and was able to
maintain oxygen saturations greater than 93% on a 100%
nonrebreather mask.  Following transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], the
patient continued to improve his oxygen saturations and
required 3 liters at the time of this dictation.  Serial
chest x-rays revealed improvement in the congestive heart
failure as well as the left lower lobe pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular - Initially the patient was
rate-controlled with a beta blocker.  Status post intubation,
the patient required intravenous pressors to maintain blood
pressures as previously noted.  The patient was quickly
weaned off of pressors in several days and maintained
hemodynamic stability throughout his hospitalization at the
time of this dictation.

3.  Hematology - Anticoagulation was maintained with heparin,
and the patient was switched to oral Coumadin with
therapeutic INR maintained for three days prior to
discontinuation of heparin.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient's pneumonia was treated
with a variety of antibiotics, including Augmentin,
Levofloxacin, Zosyn and Vancomycin.  Culture data showed
Escherichia coli that was pansensitive to antibiotics, and
the patient improved while on Ceftriaxone.  The patient was
switched from Ceftriaxone to Levofloxacin as he was
transitioned to oral medications and he continued to improve.

5.  Renal - As the patient was aggressively diuresed, an
increase in BUN to creatinine ratio developed.  Lasix was
used to continue diuresis and his creatinine did not increase
above 1.0 at any time.

6.  Mental status - Following extubation, the patient had
episodes of confusion which were thought to be related to
medications.  His narcotic and sedative medications were
restricted, and psychiatric evaluation found the patient to
be incompetent to make medical decisions.  At the time of
this dictation, the patient still had episodes of delirium
and confusion requiring a 1:1 sitter for safety.

A discharge summary addendum will be dictated at a later
date.
