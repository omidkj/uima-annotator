HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 37 year old male with past
medical history significant for insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, increased cholesterol and Hodgkin's
lymphoma, status post ABVD chemotherapy and radiation therapy ten
years ago, who presented with fever, hypotension and hypoglycemia
on [**2108-4-2**].  He ruled in for a myocardial infarction secondary
to stress ischemia and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
There he was worked up for fever that was culture negative and
followed by infectious disease in consultation.  He had a
transesophageal echocardiogram that was negative for vegetation
but positive for 4+ mitral regurgitation.  He had a CT of the
chest which showed bilateral pneumonia and 2.0 by 4.6 centimeter
mass in the superior mediastinum associated with calcified lymph
nodes.  He also had scattered prominent mesenteric and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes, although none were pathogenic in
size on the CT scan.  During his time in Intensive Care Unit,
he had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on [**2108-4-4**], which
resolved with Lasix and Morphine.  He continued to spike a
temperature, the last to 103 on [**2108-4-5**], prior to transfer to
the floor.  He had blood sugar which was difficult to control
requiring an insulin drip until [**2108-4-5**], and also had a mild
hematocrit drop to 27.7 on [**2108-4-5**].  He was transfused two units
and his hematocrit increased to 32.9. At this point, he was
transferred to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus since age nine.
2.  Stage II-A Hodgkin's, status post radiation therapy to
the chest and chemotherapy in [**2098**].

4.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Insulin.
2.  Lisinopril.
3.  Lescol.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:
1.  Levofloxacin, day number five.
2.  Heparin.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Protonix.
5.  Vancomycin, day number five.
6.  Metoprolol.
7.  Insulin 48 units of NPH in the a.m. and 24 units Humalog
in the a.m, 44 units of Humalog with dinner, and 48 units of
NPH at bed time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his girlfriend in
[**Name (NI) 49019**], [**State 350**].  He does not smoke or drink alcohol.
He does not use elicit drugs.  He does desk work as job coach
previously.  He has two dogs and two cats.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the floor, physical
examination revealed a temperature of 101, pulse 94 to 103,
respiratory rate 20 to 24, oxygen saturation 93 to 97% on two
liters, blood pressure 140/80.  Generally, he was flushed,
slightly dyspneic on conversation, pleasant, in no apparent
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is
normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  The oropharynx was slightly dry with a
questionable patchy exudate in the posterior oropharynx.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm,
soft systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
radiating to the axilla.  On pulmonary examination, he had
crackles throughout the lung fields bilaterally.  On
abdominal examination, his abdomen was soft, but tense,
nontender, normoactive bowel sounds.  On extremity
examination, he had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 1+
dorsalis pedis bilaterally, onychomycosis.  Sensation was
intact to light touch bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  His white blood cell count on transfer to
the floor was 11.6, hematocrit 32.9, platelet count 264,000.
Prothrombin 13.1, partial thromboplastin time 26.9, INR 1.1.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 101, bicarbonate 30,
blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 0.9, glucose 80, CK 1324.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious disease - He was followed by infectious disease
consultation which suggested discontinuing Vancomycin and
continuing Levofloxacin for a total of ten days as empiric
therapy for culture negative fever, with a possible pneumonia.
His transesophageal echocardiogram was without lesions.

2.  Cardiovascular - He was continued on Aspirin, Lopressor and
Lisinopril.  His ejection fraction was approximately 60% on that
transesophageal echocardiogram with 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**2108-4-9**], that showed a 100%
left circumflex lesion that was stented.  He was placed on Plavix
for nine months and will continue on that in addition to his
other medications as mentioned.

3.  Endocrine - We adjusted his doses of insulin to better
regulate his fingerstick blood glucose.  He was continued on
regular insulin sliding scale throughout his hospital stay and
agreed to follow-up with Endocrine as an outpatient for a
cortisol stimulation test given that he had a low a.m. cortisol
while in the Intensive Care Unit.

4.  Hematology - He was slightly anemic with a hematocrit greater
than 30.0.  He should follow-up with his primary care physician
on this as an outpatient.

5.  Oncology - He had a gallium scan that was negative for
increased uptake and will have bone marrow biopsy as an
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19151**] of oncology.
