[**12-2**]: pericardial fluid:    AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2101-12-6**]):
STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES
.
Blood and urine cultures negative
[**12-11**]: Sputum culture: MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS.
.
Imaging:
[**12-2**]: CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence of aortic dissection
or aneurysm.
2. Large pericardial effusion.
3. Multiple bilateral large mediastinal, axillary,
retroperitoneal, and mesenteric lymph nodes of unclear etiology.
This is concerning for lymphoma and correlation with hematologic
profile or biopsy is recommended.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis with a small right pleural effusion.
5. Multiple diverticuli throughout the colon without evidence
for diverticulitis.
.
[**12-2**]: CXR: 1. Large pericardial effusion.
2. Small right pleural effusion. No evidence for infiltrate.
.
[**12-2**]: ECHO: Inferior infarct with RV dysfunction. Moderate to
large
circumfirential pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
.
[**12-2**]: ECHO (post procedure): The left atrium is elongated. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated.
There is a small pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is significant
(30%) respiratory variation
of mitral inflow.  Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2101-12-2**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and
RA collapse is no longer seenh. Regional LV and RV systolic
dysfunction persist.
.
[**12-3**]: CXR: 1. Decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette since
the previous study.  2. Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
.
[**12-5**]: ECHO: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2101-12-2**], the pericardial effusion appears
slightly smaller than immediately post-tap.
.
[**12-9**]: CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis
.
[**12-9**]: CXR post-thoracentesis: Previous moderate-sized left
pleural effusion is now much smaller. There is no pneumothorax.
Moderate right pleural effusion, enlargement of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette, and bibasilar atelectasis are
unchanged. Tip of the left PIC catheter can be traced as far as
the right atrium but the tip is indistinct.
.
[**12-9**]: ECHO: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed with inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
[**12-10**]: CT Chest with contrast: 1. Increasing, large right and
small left pleural effusions.  2. Increasing lingular and left
lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.  3. Enlarging
mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, consistent with
patient's history of lymphoma. Stable, less pronounced
lymphadenopathy in both axillae and imaged portions of the
abdomen.  4. Subcentimeter lung nodules, two stable, one new,
presumably infectious.  5. Indeterminate lesion in liver, too
small to characterize.
.
[**12-15**]: ECHO: Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Small pericardial effusion.  Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-12-12**], the
findings are similar.
.
Pathology:
Pericardial fluid: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with
involvement by a small population (2% of total events) of
monotypic kappa light chain restricted B-cells.  These findings
