HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old white
male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal
insufficiency, creatinine of 6.3 on [**6-17**],
hypercholesterolemia, questionable diabetes with a hemoglobin
A1C of 6.6, peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral
renal artery stent placement in [**Month (only) 547**] and bilateral iliac
stent placement in [**Month (only) 116**] who has been admitted with progressive
renal failure since the placement of bilateral iliac stent,
chest pain, shortness of breath, left arm numbness and
lateral ST depressions on his electrocardiogram.  The patient
has had increasing renal insufficiency over the past few
months since [**Month (only) 116**] with creatinine going from up to 6.3 on
[**2176-6-17**].  The patient has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**].  The
patient does not have a history of coronary artery disease.
In the Emergency Department the patient was given Lopressor
and was started on nitro drip with resolution of symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral renal
artery stent placement on [**2176-3-22**], status post bilateral iliac
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting
on [**2176-4-18**].  At that time renal artery stent was visualized
and were widely patent.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  The patient does not have a history of coronary artery
disease.  The patient had a stress echocardiogram [**2174-10-10**]
that showed an ejection fraction of 65 to 70%, trace mitral
regurgitation and no evidence of ischemia.
5.  Questionable diabetes, hemoglobin A1C of 6.6 in the past.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin products.
2.  Lopressor.
3.  Wellbutrin.
4.  Protonix.
5.  Norvasc 10.
6.  Atenolol is 12.5.
7.  Lasix 40 mg.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 97.0,
blood pressure 202/97, pulse 91, respirations 16, O2 sat 98%
on room air.  The patient was sitting up and in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
There was normal oropharyngeal mucosa.  Neck there s 10 cm
jugulovenous distention with hepatojugular reflux.
Respiratory the patient was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular system regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities there was no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular system:  The patient was
admitted with hypertensive urgency as evidenced by mild
troponin leak secondary to hypertension due to worsening
renal function.  Originally the patient was upon transfer to
the Intensive Care Unit the patient was found in pulmonary
edema as evidenced by jugulovenous distention on physical
examination and pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.  The patient
was started on Nesiritide .2 and Lasix as well as Metoprolol
and Isordil.  The patient has done well with blood pressure
progressively decreasing over the first twelve hours.  The
patient has been asymptomatic since his blood pressure was
stabilized and the patient's CK and CKMB fractions were
negative.  The patient has remained on Nesiritide and Lasix
for diuresis for several days.  The patient's pulmonary
status has improved as pulmonary edema has resolved.  The
patient was subsequently discharged to the general nursing
floor on Nesiritide, Isordil and Lasix and subsequently
Nesiritide was weaned off.  The patient has done well for
several days, but the blood pressure was difficult to
control, therefore the patient was switched to a more
aggressive medical management including Clonidine, Bumex and
Labetalol also since the patient was shown to have a
significant degree of diastolic dysfunction, Amlodipine 5 mg
then changed to 10 mg po q.d. was added to cardiac
performance.  With the above regimen the patient's systolic
blood pressure was controlled in the range of 120s to 130s.
The patient during his hospital stay had an echocardiogram,
which showed an ejection fraction of more then 60%, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate
pulmonary hypertension and the patient has maintained good
systolic function and will be monitored to maintain good
blood pressure in order to maintain normal ejection fraction.

2.  Renal:  The patient has presented with worsening acute on
chronic renal failure.  During the hospital stay the
patient's creatinine has been progressively increasing daily.
 The patient has exhibited no signs of uremia, but the
patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control.  The
Renal Service has been following the patient during hospital
stay.  The patient was also visited frequently by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**]
the patient's nephrologist.  The patient is aware of the fact
that he will need hemodialysis soon, however, since there
were no electrolyte abnormalities and no uremic symptoms,
hemodialysis was not thought to be urgent during this
admission.  The patient will have a close follow up in the
nephrology clinic after discharged from the hospital.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has had reported coffee
ground emesis in the Emergency Department, but had a negative
lavage.  The patient was followed with serial hematocrits,
which remained stable and the patient has been receiving
proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis.

4.  Peripheral vascular disease:  In order to rule out renal
artery in stent restenosis the patient has underwent renal
artery ultrasound with doppler, which showed patent flow to
bilateral stents.  The differential diagnosis for worsening
renal function was said to be idle contrast induced
nephropathy or embolization from the renal artery stent of
the kidneys.  It was unclear which of the etiologies.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypertensive urgency.
2.  Acute and chronic renal failure.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.

FOLLOW UP:
1.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] [**7-9**].
2.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**7-2**].
3.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**] [**7-4**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvastatin 40 mg po q.d.
2.  Nitroglycerin .3 mg sublingual prn.
3.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
5.  Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg po q.d.
6.  Amlodipine 10 mg po q.d.
7.  Labetalol 400 mg po q.d.
8.  Bumex 2 mg po b.i.d.
9.  Clonidine patch q weekly.  The patient was instructed to
take Clonidine .05 mg po t.i.d. to overlap this regimen with
a Clonidine patch and then not to take additional Clonidine
the following day.
10.  Calcium acetate.
