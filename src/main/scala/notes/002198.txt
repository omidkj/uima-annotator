Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ([**2185-11-7**])
PICC line placement ([**2185-11-10**])

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6357**] is a 71F with stage 4 pancreatic head cancer s/p
biliary stenting [**10/2185**] presenting with fevers at home. She
reports that otherwise she felt OK, her ROS is only notable for
one episode of vomiting yesterday. She denies any chills, night
sweats, abdominal pain, increase in frequency of stools, change
in skin color, confusion, or increased pruritis. She also denies
any new cough, dysuria, frequency or polyuria.
.
In the ED presenting vitals were T=98.8-102.5, BP=130/57, HR=83,
RR=20, 96% on room air. Notably, she had some episodes of SVT in
the ED to 150s, with associated hypotension to the 70s/50s.
These episodes reverted spontaneously within ~30seconds before
any treatments or EKGs could be initiated Her exam was notable
for RUQ tenderness. Laboratory data was notable for an increase
in her transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Her Tbili was at
baseline, her lactate was 1.7, and she did not have a
leukocytosis. Urinalysis was negative, blood and urine cultures
were sent. A RUQ ultrasound showed expected pneumobilia with
pancreatic ductal dilation. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed
proper stent placement with biliarly ductal dilation, and
incidental cecal thickening. ERCP fellow was made aware of the
admission and recommended an ERCP tomorrow. Renal and cardiology
were asked to see the patient first thing in the AM prior to
this for HD and evaluation. She was given 4.5g of unasyn and 1g
of tylenol.

Past Medical History:
1. Stage four pancreatic cancer: Newly diagnosed in 10/[**2184**]. S/p
biliarly stent on [**2185-10-5**]. Oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Not a
surgical candidate, and may have liver metastases. Has seen [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4149**] in palliative care, however, no decisions have been made
yet with regard to hospice care. Per [**2185-11-3**] note from Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient has decided to not proceed with
chemotherapy and concentrate on quality of life.
2. AVNRT: Managed with beta blocker therapy only per cardiology
consultation given poor prognosis of other co-morbidities. Has
syncopized in the past secondary to this.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH, AP ([**2185-11-6**]): Low lung volumes are present.
The heart is mildly enlarged, unchanged. The aorta is unfolded
with aortic knob calcifications again demonstrated. There is
accentuation of the pulmonary vascular markings with crowding of
vascular structures, likely due to low lung volumes. Lungs are
grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or
pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable. Chronic
thickening of the left pleura is again noted.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2185-11-6**]): 1. Known mass in
the head of the pancreas is suboptimally evaluated in the
absence of IV contrast. Stent in expected location of the distal
common bile duct is probably patent, given presence of
pneumobilia. Mild biliary ductal dilatation. Adjacent duodenal
wall thickening may be due to underdistention, however,
inflammatory changes and/or tumor involvement is not excluded.
2. Cecal wall thickening is nonspecific and could be due to
inflammatory or infectious reasons. 3. Unchanged splenic
lesions. Stable appearance of the prominent left adrenal gland.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**2185-11-6**]): 1. Redemonstration of a known
pancreatic head mass with distal pancreatic atrophy and
pancreatic duct dilatation. 2. CBD stent not visualized,
however, presence of pneumobilia suggests patency of the stent.
3. Mild biliary ductal dilatation. Left lobe hepatic hyperechoic
lesion measures slightly larger today, and may be due the
technical reasons; this probably represents hemangioma, however,
a metastatic lesion not excluded in the setting of malignancy.

ERCP ([**2185-11-7**]): Eight intraprocedural spot radiographs of the
right upper quadrant from an ERCP show a pre-existing metallic
stent in the common bile duct. Subsequent images show
cannulation and opacification of the common bile duct with a
mild diffuse dilatation. Irregular filling defects are seen in
the common bile duct during its course through the metallic
stent. There are no other filling defects and there are no
strictures. Further details can be found in the ERCP report in
the patient's online medical record.

TTE ([**2185-11-10**]): The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
mid inferior and inferolateral segments. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitati
