Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
RUL nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R. VATS, RUL lobectomy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a delightful 57 F, with a heavy smoking history,
who has the
incidental finding of a right upper lobe 1.1 cm spiculated
nodule. The appearance was highly suspicious for primary lung
cancer, metastatic workup including MRI and a PET there is no
evidence of metastasis. There was FDG avidity within the
right-sided nodule but no FDG avidity within the lymph nodes.
Pulmonary function tests suggest she would tolerate a lobectomy.
She underwent her cardiac surgery and then underwent a follow-up
chest CT scan to ensure continued presence of the lesion. CT
scan confirmed the presence of an unchanged spiculated right
upper lobe nodule. There was mild increase in the pretracheal
and left #4 lymph nodes, but she was in the process of
recovering from a bronchitis and left lower lobe pneumonic
process and had recently undergone cardiac surgery. Therefore,
we elected to skip the mediastinoscopy and go straight to
thoracoscopy with resection and nodal dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2153-12-10**] Ms. [**Known lastname 68603**] was admitted to the thoracic surgery
service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]. She underwent a R. VATS,
RUL lobectomy. For details of the operation, please see Dr. [**Name (NI) 33599**] operative report. Postoperatively she did well. She did
go into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD 1. She initially was
rate controlled with IV lopressor, however she again developed a
rapid ventricular response. She was bolused with amiodarone, and
started on a drip. She eventually converted to sinus rhythm and
was transitioned to po amiodarone. Her diet was advanced and
physical therapy was initiated. She was weaned off oxygen, her
chest tubes were removed on POD 4 and 5, and her INR was
titrated back to a theraputic range. She was discharged home on
POD 6 with instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(her cardiologist) who will monitor her INR.
