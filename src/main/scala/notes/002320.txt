Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain/NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with [**Last Name (un) 2435**] placement
Swan ganz catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85 yo M with h/o CAD s/p MI and 3 vessel CABG in
[**3-10**] (LIMA ->LAD, SVG -> LAD; D1, SVG -> RCA 40% stenosis per
cath in [**2198**]), CKD, bladder cancer with recent transurethral
resection of tumor on [**6-9**], complicated by SOB, chest pain, now
found to have NSTEMI who presents to the CCU for further
management of his ACS. For full details of prior hospital course
please refer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] notes. In brief, pt underwent successful
transurethral resection of his bladder tumor on [**6-9**]. However,
due to persistent bleeding he was put on CBI. The patient
subsequently suffered a vasovagal episode with SOB, increased 02
requirement, nausea/vomitting, and hypotension. Pt was treated
with nebs, steroids, vanco/zosyn for asthma/aspiration. His BP
improved with fluid boluses but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further observation.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's BP and and respiratory status
improved with the above interventions. He was also transfused 2
units PRBCs given his urinary clotting. However, prior to being
transferred to the floor the patient developed SSCP, SOB, and
bilateral arm pain. EKG demonstrated RBBB, inferior STT changes.
CK, MB, and troponin trended upwards. The patient was given
ASA/Plavix, heparin gtt, nitro gtt, metoprolol, and morphine.
Cardoiology was consulted who felt the patient was undergoing an
NSTEMI. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the CCU for
further care.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient feels well and was chest pain
free. He denied HA, dizziness/lightheadedness, diplopia, CP,
SOB, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nausea,
diaphoresis, leg pain.
.
On further review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. In the past he had episode of CP on exertion
with dyspnea. He can climb one flight of stairs.

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-6-9**] Bladder, biopsy:
A.  Papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade, with lamina
propria invasion.  Muscularis propria is present and is free of
tumor.
B.  Urothelial carcinoma in situ.
C.  Squamous metaplasia, keratinized.

[**2200-6-12**]. Cardiac cath.
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated a three vessel native CAD.  The LMCA had mild
disease with
moderate calcification.  The LAD was occluded proximally.  The
LCx was a
non-dominant vessel with a moderate diffuse disease.  The RCA
was a
dominant vessle with a proximal 90% stenosis at the bifurcation
with the
AM.
2. Vein graft angiography revealed a patent SVG to the RCA.
There was
mild disease just distal to the touch down site.  SVG to the D1
was
patent as well.  Arterial conduit angiography initially could
not be
performed due to a tight left subclavian occlusion that was
likley
thrombotic in nature.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 21 mmHg and a PAD pressure of 26 mm
Hg.  The
cardiac index was depressed at 1.86 l/min/m2.  There was a
moderate
systemic arterila hypertension with an SBP of 150 mmHg.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated creatinine.

5. Successful PCI/stent to proximal left subclavian thrombosis
with a
7.0x39mm Genesis stent deployed at 18atms and postdilated with a
9.0mm
balloon. Normal flow down vessel with no gradient across stent
at end of
procedure.  There was a hazy 70% distal LAD lesion at the end of
the
case.

Echo.  [**2200-6-12**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.  There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis,
apical akinesis/dyskinesis and mid to distal anterior
hypokinesis. No definite LV thrombus seen (but cannot
definitively exclude). Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Renal u/s [**2200-6-16**].
IMPRESSION:  Thick-walled bladder with vascular flow.  This most
likely
represents residual bladder tumor.  No hydronephrosis.

[**6-17**]. Echo.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate
regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
dyskinesis of the apex and  hypokinesis of the distal left
ventricle. The other segments contract well. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic  dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There are mobile filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with possible Lambl's excresences (normal
variant) although an aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be
definitively excluded. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-6-12**], the
left
ventricular function has slightly improved. No apical thrombus
is visualized.  A small filamentous mobile lesion on the aortic
valve is present (seen on prior study but not mentioned) which
is consistent with probable Lambl's excrescence.
