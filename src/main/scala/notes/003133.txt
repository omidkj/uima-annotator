CXR [**2180-4-28**]:
1. Confluent left lower lobe opacity, potentially due to
pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting. Lupus pneumonitis is an additional
consideration, as well as atelectasis.

2. Interstitial edema.

3. Massive enlargement of central pulmonary arteries consistent
with
pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Plain film L shoulder [**2180-4-29**]:

FINDINGS: The alignment is normal without fracture or
dislocation. Please
note that these films were taken to assess the shoulder. The
lung visualized in the image demonstrates increased lung
markings and hazy vasculature that has probably increased
compared to the study from the prior day.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist

MRI L Shoulder [**2180-5-3**]:
1. Tendinopathy of supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons
without tear.

2. Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint degenerative
change.

3. Slightly limited by patient motion.

Portable AP chest [**2180-5-7**]:
Single view of the chest demonstrates enlargement of the heart,
prominent
mediastinum, patchy multifocal airspace disease with underlying
interstitial changes. There is a probable small left-sided
pleural effusion. Right-sided [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] catheter is present.
Interval worsening of the appearance of the chest since prior
study from [**2180-4-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Arthralgias/joint pain/left shoulder immobility: Initially
there was concern that this pain may represent a lupus flare,
versus continuing chronic pain. Serum C3, and C4 were low and
rheumatology was consulted. Plaquenil was stopped, and she was
treated with three days of prednisone 20mg PO daily.  She did
not have significant improvement with this regimen and she was
put back on her home dose of 5mg PO daily.  She had difficulty
moving her left shoulder, but could mover her fingers and hand,
and sensation and pulses remained intact. An MRI was performed
of her left shoulder, which showed supraspinatus tendonitis.
Her dose of dilaudid was decreased from 1mg IV q 2 hrs, to 8 mg
PO q 4 hr over several days.  She gradually complained of less
pain and reported improved mobility of her shoulder.
.
#. Opacities on CXR. Patient presented with a complaint of
shortness of breath and had a temperature of 100.3 on the day of
admission.  Chest x-ray showed new RLL opacity suggestive on
PNA.  She was treated with one day of vancomycin and meropenem
for HCAP.  She clinically improved and antibiotics were stopped.
 Repeat CXR showed improvement.  However she began spiking
fevers, a repeat CXR and CT scan were concerning for HAP, and
the patient defervesed on broad spectrum abx.
- complete 8 day course of Vancomycin and Ceftaz.
.
#. Face/neck swelling. Patient had notable facial and neck
swelling, slightly more prominent on the left. Per prior notes,
this appeared stable from prior admissions.  Transplant surgery
was consulted and recommended no further intervention.
.
#. ESRD - Transplant nephrology was consulted, and patient
received hemodialysis on M/W/F. She was also treated wth epogen
twice weekly, nephrocaps and calcium acetate.  She was noted to
have low serum calcium, and her calcinet was stopped.  A
[**Year (4 digits) 2286**] session was stopped early on [**2180-5-5**], due to seizures
and hypotension.  She received and extra [**Date Range 2286**] session on
[**2180-5-6**].  She tolerated [**Date Range 2286**] well thereafter with BP support
from midodrine.
.
# Seizure disorder - Patient was continued on her current doses
of topamax 100mg PO every day, with the dose given after
[**Date Range 2286**] on [**Date Range 2286**] days, and keppra 500mg PO bid on non
[**Date Range 2286**] days, and 1000mg PO daily on [**Date Range 2286**] days given AFTER
[**Date Range 2286**].  Patient was noted to have short
