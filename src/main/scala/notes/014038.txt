Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3552**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia/respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 yo F with Type 2 DM, diastolic CHF, mild COPD, and recurrent
left lower extremity cellulits, s/p recent admission ([**2123-4-23**] to
[**2123-4-25**]) for ?Left metatarsal osteomyelitis and cellulitis
treated with a two week course of Daptomycin who presents with
hypoxia and cough productive of white sputum.

She was restarted on Dapto on [**2123-6-23**] by her PCP for cellulitis.
 Plan was to treat for a 2 week course.  On day of admission she
developed weakness and a mildly productive cough.   She was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia (sats dropped to the 80s on room
air) and fevers to 101.2.

Initial VS in the ED were T 98.6, HR 94, BP 94/54, RR24, O2 sat
84%RA
Given Levaquin and Gent; ID curbsided who felt combo of these
agents plus Dapto should be adequate coverage for CAP.  She was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and placed on droplet precautions for
possible adenovirus (recent outbreak at HRC).

CTA [**2123-6-27**]:
1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. Enlarged main
pulmonary artery. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism,
however, peripheral arteries cannot be assessed due to breathing
artifact.
2. Compression fracture of the mid thoracic spine
3. Extensive centrilobular emphysema, with increased opacity in
left upper lobe, as well as dependent atelectatic opacity in
lower lobe. Opacity in the left upper lobe may represent
pneumonia.
4. 1.2-m prevascular nodes.

LENI [**2123-6-28**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left
lower extremity.

CXR [**2123-6-29**]:  Superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis is mild acute
pulmonary edema, seen in the right lower lung. Pneumonia could
also be present, particularly in the left lung obscured by
cardiac silhouette. There is no appreciable pleural effusion.

ECG: ST at 104, NL axis/intervals, ?[**Last Name (un) **], TWI I/L (old), Qs in
V1/V2 (old), TWI V4-V6 (old in V4-V5; V6 slightly more
prominent)

[**Last Name (un) 16057**] [**7-1**]:  Seven radiographs of the abdomen demonstrate air and
stool throughout the colon to the level of the rectum. There are
no dilated loops of large or small bowel. No air-fluid levels or
free intraperitoneal air identified on the upright view. No
abnormal soft tissue calcifications are present. There are
degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with mild COPD, HTN, Type 2 DM, diastolic CHF, IPF,
recurrent left LE cellulitis, ?metatarsal osteomyelitis
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypoxia and PNA.

#  Viral PNA.  Likely etiology of initial hypoxia.  Initial
concern for andenovirus as there is an outbreak at HRC, however,
rapid viral screen returned negative.  Her droplet precautions
were discontinued.  She was initially treated with Cipro for
concern for CAP, however, this was dicontinued on [**6-30**] as it did
not appear she had a bacterial infection.  Sputum culture
revealed OP flora.

# Cellulitis/?Osteomyelitis.  Pt with screw in foot for charcot
joint.  Left lower extremity U/S negative for DVT.  She was
started on Dapto on [**6-23**] by her PCP for left LE cellulitis.
Plan was to complete a 2 week course.   [**Month/Year (2) **] was consulted
and initially suggested started flagyl.  A wound culture was
obtained which revealed CORYNEBACTERIUM, PSEUDOMONAS, and STAPH
AUREUS COAG +.  ID was consulted to help determine if
pseudomonas should be covered, however, they agreed with a 2
week course of daptomycin only.  She needs to f/u with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 543**]) in [**1-4**] wks.  She had wet to dry
dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].

# OSA.  She is no longer on CPAP.  Her sleep apnea may be
contributing to her hypoxia.  She would likely benefit from
