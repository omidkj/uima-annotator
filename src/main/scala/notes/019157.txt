CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy and increasing dyspnea on
exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with
history of hairy cell leukemia in remission and recent
resection of an invasive malignant thymoma with left phrenic
nerve resection complicated by new oxygen requirement and
left pleural effusion who presented to the emergency
department with lethargy and dyspnea on exertion.  The
patient had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and
also has had increasing oxygen requirements from 2 to 3
liters nasal cannula.  Also complains of poor appetite with
decreased p.o. intake and increased sputum production.
According to his wife and [**Name (NI) 269**] the patient has had three to
four days of lethargy without getting up.  Has not been doing
his breathing exercises for greater than one week.  Positive
cough with productive sputum.

In the emergency department the patient's temperature is
100.4 with blood pressure of 132/50, pulse 89, sating 78% on
room air.  With 100% non-rebreather the oxygen saturation
became 95%.  The patient noted using his accessory muscles to
breath.  He subsequently was intubated with Succinyl Choline
and Etomidate for respiratory distress and increased work of
breathing.  He had a chest x-ray which showed right
multi-lobular consolidations as well as a CTA which was
negative for pulmonary embolism.  The patient received
Levofloxacin times one, Clindamycin 600 mg times one,
Vancomycin 1 gram times 1.  He was also given one liter of
normal saline as well as Ativan 2 mg times three doses as
well as Famotidine.

4.  Albuterol MDI.
5.  Glipizide 15 mg.
6.  Neurontin (recently discontinued).

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis.
Cephalosporin, question reaction.  Ampicillin which causes a
rash.  Prozac causes nausea and vomiting.  Ancef question
reaction.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for glaucoma and diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired travel [**Doctor Last Name 360**], lives with
wife and has multiple children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.1, heart rate 90
(paced), blood pressure 107/56, respiratory rate 23 sating
99% on ventilator with a tidal volume of 700 and respiratory
rate of 12, PEEP of 8 and FIO2 of 100%  The patient is ill
and pale appearing and sedated.  Mucous membranes are dry
with pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Chest has rhonchi anteriorly with decreased
breath sounds at right base, crackles on the left side.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs audible.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities are warm with 1+ distal pulses.  Neurologically
the patient is sedated.

His electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm at 90 with no
significant morphologic changes.  On chest x-ray with diffuse
infiltrates and consolidation on the right with right sided
patches especially at the right base.  Chest CT with no
pulmonary embolism, right greater than left sided infiltrates
with alveolar opacity of the entire right lower and upper
lobes with mild involvement of right middle lobe.  Extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with maximum size up to 1.5 cm
which is increased prior (compared to [**7-17**].)

LABORATORY:  His white blood count is 2.3 with 77
neutrophils, 20 lymphocytes, hematocrit 27.6, platelets 150,
sodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 97, bicarbonate 24, BUN
35, creatinine 1.2.  Glucose 316.  Ionized calcium is 1.14,
magnesium is 1.9, phosphate 3.0.  Urinalysis is negative.
Arterial blood gases on vent settings are 7.43, 38, 209.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient became hypotensive upon arrival
to the Intensive Care Unit but responded to fluid.  An
attempt to readjust his Endotracheal tube resulted in
extubation and the patient was re-intubated with decreased O2
sats immediately following intubation to 60% and subsequent
hypertension.  His O2 sat was recovered but then decreased
again with hypotension, requiring Dopamine for blood pressure
support and oxygenation were improved with her Coumadin.  The
remainder of his hospital course is as follows.

1.  Pneumonia.  The patient had a bronchoscopy with lavage on
[**2200-10-9**] which did not isolate an infectious organism.  The
patient was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics with
Levofloxacin, Clindamycin and Vancomycin.  He had multiple
issues with ventilation.  Chest x-ray on [**10-15**] showed improved
infiltrates, bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient
required palization in order to obtain better synchrony with
the ventilator, also was placed in a prone position with
somewhat improved oxygen saturation.  He was not able to
tolerate being taken off the paralytics.  There was attempted
thoracentesis on [**10-17**] with no recovery of fluid.

2.  Hypotension.  This was felt to be likely secondary to
sepsis as well as intravascular depletion.  Cardiac echo was
obtained which showed a depressed ejection fraction from 20
to 30%  The patient was intermittently placed on pressors but
then became hypotensive despite maximal dose of Levothroid,
Dopamine and fluid resuscitation on [**2200-10-19**].

3.  Fever. The patient continued to spike fevers despite over
a week of therapy on Levofloxacin, Clindamycin, Vancomycin.
The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound given
elevated liver function tests which was negative and a chest
CT showed no evidence of abscess.  ID was consulted after the
development of gram positive cocci and blood cultures on [**10-15**]
which ended up being coag negative staph.  The patient then
developed gram negative rods in his blood cultures.  He was
changed to Levofloxacin and Aztreonam.

4.  Acute renal failure.  The patient had an elevated
creatinine with electrolyte abnormalities which was evaluated
by renal consult team and felt to be secondary to a
combination of ATN as well as pre-renal.  Renal ultrasound
was negative for any stones or significant hydronephrosis.
The patient was placed on a phosphagen binder and his meds
were renally dosed.

5.  Pancytopenia.  The patient was placed on Neupogen as per
recommendation of his hematologist.  Because of his worsened
white blood count hematology was consulted and the patient
had a bone marrow biopsy on [**2200-10-17**].  Results are still
pending.

6.  Change in mental status.  The patient was maintained on
sedatives, when these were attempted to be weaned the patient
still had no improvement in his mental status beyond grimace
to pain.  He had a head CT which was negative.  The patient
then re-required re-sedation given necessity of paralysis for
ventilation.

7.  Cardiomyopathy and pacemaker.  The patient had an echo
which showed a depressed ejection fraction, study was
obtained which was negative.

8.  Ileus.  The patient had decreased bowel sound sand had a
post pyloric nasogastric tube placed.  He was maintained on
tube feeds for nutrition.

9.  Carcinoma status post resection.  The patient was
followed by CT surgery during his Intensive Care Unit stay.
A CT of the chest did not show any fluid collection
underneath the suture sites.

On [**2200-10-19**] a meeting was held with
