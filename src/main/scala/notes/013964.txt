Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with progressive end stage multiple
sclerosis with chronic pain, central sleep apnea, recurrent
UTIs, history of seizures in the setting of hyponatremia,
admitted for AMS, increased sputum production following witness
aspiration episode. Hospitalized a week ago for seizures with
hyponatremia neurology had changed his medication from Keppra to
Lamictal. On a Keppra wean. Per wife pt this morning was
producing a lot of sputum which he appeared to be aspirating.
Wife called [**Name2 (NI) 269**] to evaluate his lungs as he produced even more
sputum following this witnessed aspiration episode. [**Name2 (NI) 269**]
reportedly told wife that he seemed "crackly" and recommended
they go to the ED at [**Location (un) 620**]. As the day progressed pt's wife
noted that was becoming more and more lethargic. A CXR at
[**Location (un) 620**] showed a LLL infiltrate, ?pleural effusion. A WBC of
20.9 was also noted with 16 bands. Pt was transferred from
[**Location (un) 620**] to [**Location (un) 86**] [**Hospital1 18**] where he received Clindamycin,
Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin in the ED. Was noted to have numerous
thick secretions, altered (fatigued). Received ABG based on
somnelence 7.41/51/82 on 2l nasal canula, lactate 1.1. VS 97.9,
P 78, BP 130s/50s, RR 22, Sat 94% 2l n.c. Neuro exam diffusely
weak.
Of note pt also has a history of multiple UTIs, his last
treatment was Ciprofloxacin which ended [**12-13**]. Pt was recently
seen by Neurology in an effort to wean off Keppra as it had been
though responsible for his increase in somnelence following his
last discharge. He was discharged last week after being admitted
to  Neuro for seizures in the setting of hyponatremia.

Neuro not consulted but outpt Neuro note on OMR discusses Keppra
taper. Has history of labile BP, 20g IV x 1 for access.

IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral consolidation of the bilateral
basilar lower lobes compatible with provided history of
aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Slight improvement in aeration
at the left lung base.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old Male with end stage [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for
LLL PNA, general weakness. Admitted to the ICU for concern
regarding general weakness, increased secretions.

# Aspiration pneumonia-  Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] was admitted with
leukocytosis of 18.3 which is lower than his WBC of 20 at
[**Location (un) 620**] after an aspiration event with his BIPAP.  Pt had a
witnessed aspiration which is highly suspicious for the cause of
his PNA. He was for initially started on azithromycin,
clindamycin and levofloxacin, which was changed to
flagyl/levofloxacin.  He produced significant sputum, and was
hypoxic.  This was consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Speech and swallow was consulted, patient being placed on a diet
previously recommended by speech and swallow during his last
admission.  Given the nature of the event, while he was on
BIPAP, the sleep service was consulted and recommended nasal
bipap at night.  He was trialed on that while in the hospital,
but needs a mask refitted which will be performed by his
respiratory care company.  He was sent home on just nocturnal
oxygen to be provided via his BIPAP machine, until his nasal
mask is refitted.  By the time of discharge, he was off oxygen,
and clinically improved.  He was set up with suction at home to
help with his secretions.  He did not have a formal video
swallow study as he is unwilling to have a feeding tube placed.
He was placed on aspiration precautions and an aspiration diet.
He remains at high risk for recurrent events given his advanced
MS, and he may have to ultimately be discontinued off of BIPAP,
and have further changes to his diet.

.
# Funguria:  His initial UA was positive for yeast.  He has an
indwelling suprapubic catheter.   He was seen by Dr.[**Name (NI) 10529**]
service, who recommended treatment with 10 days of fluconazole,
and then reassessing for clearance of the yeast.  He has a
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3 weeks.
.
# Encephalopathy:  He had worsening of his mental status in the
setting of acute illness, but returned to his baseline with
treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
.
# [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Pt was recently admitted last week for [**Last Name (STitle) 862**]
activity in the setting of hyponatremia. Per family hyponatremia
was thought to be due to Tegretola dn pt was switched to Keppra
whilst on the Neurology service. Unfortunately Keppra made him
too sleepy, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 25950**] note a day prior to admission, Mr.
[**Known lastname 25925**] was pleced on a wean to start him on Lamotrigine.  He was
continued to be weaned off Keppra to Lamotrigine per Neuro recs.
