Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath, Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PEG replacement


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 82 yo M with a past medical history of vascular
dementia, s/p CVA with aphasia and dysphagia requiring G-tube
[**12-26**] chronic aspiration, recurrent aspiration pneumonias, and h/o
hemoptysis, was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] after having worsened shortness
of breath and hypoxia at his NH. Apparently there is some
concern he was hypoxic for a while until his NH brought him in.
On the day of admission, he was noted at the NH to be short of
breath with sats in the 70's on room air. He was started on O2,
and was watched during the morning, but his status continued to
worsen and was transferred to our ED for further work up.
.
In the ED, he was placed on a NRB and sats came up to 98% but
respiratory rates continued in the 30's. He was noted to have
abdominal distention as well, and an NGT was placed with a lot
of air output. His breathing seemed to improve after
decompression. He was taken for chest and abdominal films which
seemed to be concerning for a right lower lobe infiltrate, and
he was given doses of cefepime, flagyl and levofloxacin. His
labs were significant for a normal wbc with 4 bands on diff
without a left shift, and a lactate of 1.6. His vitals before
transfer were temp of 101.6, RR 32, sats high 90's on NRB.
Without ABG's, the decision was made to intubate the patient
prior to transfer, out of concern that he was tiring out. Post
intubation he had a transient episode of bradycardia to the
40's. He was hemodynamically stable throughout. No
post-intubation ABG performed.
.

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS CHEST [**2144-12-2**]
.
CT OF THE CHEST: There is an endotracheal tube in place with its
tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is
seen with its tip in the stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted. Evaluation of the
pulmonary arteries demonstrates several filling defects within
the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left upper lobe
pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary emboli. There is also
increase in caliber in the main left pulmonary artery that
measures approximately 3.1 cm. Pulmonary arteries, branches of
the right pulmonary artery and left lower lobe pulmonary artery
are unremarkable.

The tracheobronchial tree is patent. There is a mildly prominent
right hilar lymph node that measures 1.3 x 1.6 cm.

There is an aneurysm with an extensive partially calcified
thrombus involving the descending thoracic aorta that measures
approximately 4.7 x 3.5 cm. This is stable when compared with
the prior examination of [**2142-2-5**].

Evaluation of lung windows demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis.
There is diffuse mild emphysema. There is no pneumothorax and no
pleural effusions.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver is unremarkable. There is no
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Multiple
calcified gallstones are seen within the gallbladder. There is
no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The
pancreas demonstrates normal diffuse homogeneous enhancement. A
3-mm fat-containing lesion is seen in the tail of the pancreas
that is unchanged since the prior CT of the abdomen from [**2140**]
and likely represents a small lipoma. The spleen is normal in
size and contour. The left adrenal gland is unremarkable in size
and demonstrates several calcifications that are stable since
the prior study. There is diffuse enlargement of both medial and
lateral limbs of the right adrenal gland _____ have a lobular
appearance. This is also stable when compared with the prior CT
of the abdomen from [**2140**].

The kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. A
very small subcapsular fluid collection is seen along the
posterior cortex of the right kidney likely reflecting residual
fluid from the previous hematoma that was seen on the prior
study. Multiple renal cysts are present. There is also an
indeterminate lesion measuring approximately 1.1 cm in the
medial aspect of the left kidney (hypo
