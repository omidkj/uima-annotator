Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: Pt is a 56 yo man with hx of Hodgkins, colon
ca, sarcoma, who p/w LLE cellulitis.
.
# Cellulitis: Patient presents with signs/sx suggestive of
serious cellulitis. Given bandemia and extremely elevated
leukocytosis, there is additional concern for a more serious
infection and possibly bacteremia. This is his second episode of
cellulitis in this leg in several months. Wound bx revealed
MSSA, and he was started on IV nafcillin.  Wound nursing
continued debridement with wet to dry dressing changes daily.
Given hx of soft-tissue sarcoma and hx of HD, dermatology
evaluated patient and felt biospy was of low utility.  He will
be treated with 7 more days of IV nafcillin 2grams q6hour then
switch to oral dicloxacillin 500mg q6 hour for 7 more days.
.
# ARF: baseline 1.0, now 1.7. Most likely [**2-9**] prerenal azotemia.
ATN also possible. Improved with hydration.

# Pneumonia:  AM [**12-24**] patient was noted to have worsening
hypoxia requiring nonrebreather on the floor.  He also was in a.
fib with HR in the 100-110s since admission on the floor, and he
was transferred to the MICU.  In the MICu patient continued to
be hypoxic with a-a gradient and high O2 requirement.  Patient's
oxygen requirement was new this admission, ddx included
bilateral PNA as seen on chest ct, ARDS due to p/f ratio,
pcwp<12, underlying infection, heartfailure (although no
evidence on cxr or ct), PE (less likely as patient is
therapeutic on coumadin), Cardiac etiology and MI less likely as
pt without any chest pain. He was maintained on supplemental O2.
 Echo with bubble study was done to evaluate for shunt and was
negative for PFO.  He was treated with vanc/zosyn/clinda for PNA
and was monitored with serial ABGs, was given CPAP briefly. He
was treated with 10 total days antibiotics, 9 of which w/
meropenem.  He was discharged on room air, no  consolidations on
CXR and breathing comfortably.
.
# Sarcoma: Currently no active issues following wide resection.
He received radiation to upper arm only at the time.
.
# Malignancies: Currently no active issues. He is follow-up
regularly. It is curious why he has had so many malignancies.
?Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which may predispose him to sarcomas and
colon cancer.  No active issues, but may be interesting to
pursue w/u as outpatient for genetic testing purposes
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: chronic on coumadin.  He had rapid
ventricular response in house presumed to be [**2-9**] his infections.
 He will be discharged on incresaed doses of nodal blockers
including dilt XR 360 daily and metoprolol 100mg TID.
