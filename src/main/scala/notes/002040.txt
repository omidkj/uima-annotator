mechanical compression of spinal cord s/p emobilization of met
lesion ([**6-20**]) and s/p T3-6 laminectomy, T1-8 posterior fusion,
T3-5 interbody fusion ([**6-21**]), PEG placement ([**6-28**]) presenting
with acute dyspnea requiring ET intubation.

Up until few days prior to admission, was walking around house
with walker, teaching son to drive. Last 24 hrs, feeling more

no nausea, no vomiting, loose stool potentially [**12-29**] lactulose,
not requiring additional pain meds.

In the ED, initial VS were:
99 125 115/72 20 100% (intubated with 500 x 20 5 peep 50%)

Pt arrived via EMS from home with wife. Did not tolerate CPAP.
Nasaltracheal intubation by EMS. Unsure of location. Hypoxic to

change.

Vanco/cefepime dosed.  Examination notable for cachexia,
diminished breath sounds on left, sunken left chest, power port
(per wife) on left chest, and gtube site intact.  There was no
edema and cardiac exam simply sinus tach.  CXR performed with
whiteout on left (known).  CT head and CTA chest ordered, and
patient to complete before transfer to MICU.

On transfer to MICU, patient's VS.
99 110 100/65 20 100%

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.
97.2 108 116/63 17 100% (500 x20 Peep 5 FiO2 100%)

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Further ROS not conducted as patient intubated, sedated.

[**2130-7-23**] CT Head
IMPRESSION: Multiple metastatic lesions scattered throughout the
brain.
.
[**2130-7-23**] CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Some pulmonary arterial
branches are slightly narrowed due to encasement by tumor.
2. Diffuse mediastinal and hilar confluent soft tissue density
consistent with neoplastic infiltration. Accompanying complete
left-sided lung collapse along with moderate size complex
pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
3. Innumerable nodular pulmonary metastases on the right with
superimposed ground glass opacities that could represent
atypical infection or additional areas of lymphangitic spread


Brief Hospital Course:
48M w/ PMHx of extensive metastatic NSCLC (stage IV) s/p
thoracotomy ([**2126**]), chemoRT ([**2127**]), hx of post obstructive pna &
left lung collapse with left mainstem endobronchial tumor
([**2128**]), met embolization and mechanical decompression of spinal
cord due to cord compression ([**2129**]) presenting with acute
dyspnea, found to be in respiratory distress requiring
intubation. Patient had short stay in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] briefly and after
extubation, was transferred to oncology [**Hospital1 **] for further
management. Has had episodes of desaturation possibly related to
accident removal of oxygen nasal cannula and anxiety. Started on
XRT on [**2130-7-27**], 5 fractions planned, but since goals of care
changed to comfort oriented, long term prognosis poor,
completion of XRT deferred. DNR/DNI status discussed on
[**2130-7-27**].On the night of [**2130-7-28**] pt became very dyspneac and
agitated. He was given morphine and alprazolam for dyspnea with
minimal relief and then thorazine, which did help patient. On
[**2130-7-29**] pt was transitioned to CMO. He was treated with scheduled
thorazine, morphine and alprazolam. He was non-arousable but
remained comfortable. On [**2130-7-30**] at 20:50 patient expired.
