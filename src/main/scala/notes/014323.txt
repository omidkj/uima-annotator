Images:
CT Head [**7-7**] - Ill defined R frontal lobe mass with
calcifications and surrounding vasogenic edema. Mass effect on
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of lateral ventricle and 1cm leftward shift of
normally midline structures has increased since most recent MRI,
[**2167-6-5**].

CXR [**7-7**] - IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities may
relate to atelectasis and low lung volumes with underlying
aspiration or infection could be present. Slight blunting of the
left costophrenic angle could be due to a trace effusion, no
large pleural effusion seen

EKG:  NSR 86, NA/NI, poor r-wave progression, no st or twave
inversions

Brief Hospital Course:
54F with history of GBM and shcizoaffective/bipolar found with
AMS, intubated in ED, and subsequently admitted to the ICU.

#Altered mental status: Most likely attributable to 1 cm midline
shift and cerebral edema from her GBM, though there was a
concern for pneumonia. Mrs. [**Known lastname 79533**] was intubated in the ER
for airway protection, started on antibiotics for pneumonia and
admitted to the ICU.  In the ICU, she was continued on
mechanical ventilation and antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
She passed her RSBI on hospital day 2, however, did have
significant secretions. Per Neurosurgery and Neuro-oncology,
there is no further treatment for her GBM and recommend
continued hospice care.  After discussion with HCPs [**Name (NI) 30143**]
[**Name (NI) 79533**] [**Name (NI) 4048**] (sister, over phone) and [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (friend,
