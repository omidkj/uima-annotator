History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 90223**] is a 85-year-old male with CAD s/p PTCA LCx
([**2092**]), HLD, AAA, PE, PAD, COPD that was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for c. cath with complicated OSH course consisting of anemia
secondary to GIB, bilateral PE not on anticoagulation, and
NSTEMI with reduction of EF, and acute systolic heart failure.
Pt is transferred to the CCU prior to cardiac cath for ASA
desensitization protocol.
.
He was admitted on [**2109-1-10**] for SOB at [**Hospital3 1443**]
Hospital (contact number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90224**]). [**Name2 (NI) **] oximetry was in
the low 80s at home responsive to home O2 via NC. He endorses
feeling cold type symptoms with coughing for quite a few weeks
but became more dyspneic with increasing cough and clear sputum
production. Chest CT showed new bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Venous US was negative for DVT. An IVF filter was placed on
[**1-10**] in setting of inability to anti-coagulate with anemia.
Admission labs were also notable for Hgb/Hct of 6.6/24.2 and
guaiac positive stool. He was treated for a presumed GIB. He was
transfused 3 units of pRBC. Endoscopy performed on [**1-11**] was
unremarkable. Colonoscopy was attempted on [**1-10**] but unable to
be performed secondary to stool in bowel. Colonoscopy
subsequently performed on [**1-17**] showed diverticulosis and
diminutive polyp x 1, which showed fragments of adenoma.
Labs were also significant for 3 sets of elevated troponins and
CPKs. ECHO on [**1-15**] showed EF 35 % (last EF on [**2108-3-6**] showed
EF 60 %). Stress test showed large area of ischemia extending
from the anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall. There
was evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction with
significantly depressed LVEF. His latest CXR showed mild CHF.
Additional studies included abdominal US showing AAA that is
stable compared to prior exam on [**2108-10-4**].
Hospital course also complicated by flash pulmonary edema on
[**2109-1-12**].
The patient was also treated for pneumonia although viral URI
was favored with fever 100.2 in setting of chronic prednisone
therapy although no infiltrate noted. He was treated with
moxifloxacin 400 mg PO qD for a 10-day course. CXR did not
suggest pneumonia.
.
Pt describes an ASA allergy consisting of redness on his face,
and rash diffusely many years ago.
.
On arrival to CCU, he was afebrile, with VS HR 76, BP 106/70, RR
20, 93% 3LNC, repeated at 98%. Pt denies chest pain, chest
pressure, or SOB. He says that he has felt overall weak since he
was admitted to the OSH, but that this has gotten better.
.
On review of systems, he endorses overall weakness as above. He
says that he has had black stools for the past year, but that
the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'t been able to figure out why. He states that
he went to the OSH because he knew that his [**Name5 (PTitle) **] counts were
low. He denies fever or chills, but continues mild cough with
yellow sputum.
He also endorses previous leg cramping.
He denies any prior history of stroke, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, or red stools. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He is able to
walk 3 blocks with having to stop 2-3 times, which is unchanged
in the past year. He performs all of his ADL's and lives on his
own.
