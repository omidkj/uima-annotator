.
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Over the interval there are some
placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous
catheter with tip in the cavoatrial junction. There has also
been increasing perihilar haziness consistent with devloping
pulmonary edema. The left costophrenic angle and portions of the
left hemithorax are incompletely evaluated. There is increasing
right basilar opacity.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary edema which is new compared to prior study.
2. Right lower lobe pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 88 yo man with CHF (EF 35%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2136**], AFib on
coumadin admitted with weakness and chills, found to have right
sided pneumonia with relative hypotension and elevated lactate.

.
# Hypotension. Baseline sbp 90's. In the setting of fever and
elevated lactate this was believed to be SIRS/sepsis physiology
from pneumonia.  He required pressors briefly in the ICU and was
able to be weaned after fluid resuscitation.  Antihypertensives
and diuretics were initially held and then slowly added back.
At time of discharge enalapril had not been restarted; can
restart in the next few days at rehab if BP allows.
.
# Community acquired Pneumonia. Patient intially given IV
levofloxacin and then transitioned to po.  His leukocytosis
resolved.  He spiked a temperature to 101 and was broadened to
vanc and zosyn briefly.  Blood cultures remained no growth and
cxr unchanged.  Changed back to just levofloxacin with continued
improvement.  Plan 14 days total antibiotics.  Please continue
to monitor temperature.  No other localizing symptoms.
Saturating well on room air at discharge.  Cont nebs prn.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure. Baseline Cr approximately
1.4-2.0; on admission was elevated but resolved with holding
diuretics and gentle volume resuscitation. Likely in part due to
hypovolemia, improved with re-hydration.
.
# Normocytic Anemia. Admission Hct of 36 near baseline (34-40).
Decline in Hct likely in part dilution due to IVF. Patient has a
history of lower GI bleed, though no signs of active hemorrhage
during this admission. Patient thought to be stable on home
anticoagulation, though supratherapeutic on admission. Also
element of AOCD with renal failure.  Anticoagulation held for
elevated INR on admission and then restarted.
.
# CV. History of CAD, CHF and hyperlipidemia.  Continued on
aspirin, statin.  As noted above antihypertensives initially
held and all restarted before discharge except enalapril.  This
should be restarted as outpatient.  Patient with increased edema
in lower extremities at time of discharge from diuretics being
held; no evidence acute coronary event.  Recent EF 35%.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Supratherapeutic INR at 3.7.
Coumadin held and then became subtherapeutic.  INR 1.8 on day of
discharge; repeat in 3 days and adjust coumadin prn.
.
# Hematuria: Patient noted to have hematuria on UA then had
traumatic incident with foley being pulled.  Urine now clear but
should get repeat UA for signs of microscopic hematuria in [**4-15**]
weeks as outpatient to further follow up.
.
# Right carotid stenosis. Outpatient follow-up.
.
# Glucose intolerance. Last Hgb A1c 6.5 in [**2145-1-10**].
- Fingersticks were normal this admission without requirement
for insulin.  Continued on diabetic, heart healthy diet.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI per discussion with patient.
