Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cricothyroidotomy
Tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
Unable to obtain HPI from patient.  Per ED records, patient
is a 27M who presented with a seizure. He subsequently had a
second seizure while in the ED.  During this event he was noted
to have bitten his tongue and would not release resulting in
significant bleeding into his oropharynx.  After multiple
attempts at intubation failed, a secure airway could not be
established.  Therefore, surgery was emergently called to the ED
in order to establish a surgical airway.

Past Medical History:
- Mild asthma, rare albuterol use
- EtOH abuse. No h/o of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Drinks up to
a bottle of rum daily as above.


Social History:
Lives with "cousin". Undocumented/illegal immigrant. Exposure
history uncertain. Said one beer per day, but friends said more

Studies:
.
CXR ([**11-14**]):
IMPRESSION: 1. Tracheostomy tube remains in place in
satisfactory position. Interval placement of a feeding tube with
its tip coiled in the expected location of the stomach. The
lungs volumes remain slightly diminished. There is some crowding
of the vasculature. No focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary
edema, pleural effusions are appreciated. Overall, the cardiac
and mediastinal contours are stable, although the heart is
borderline enlarged given portable technique.
.
CT spine (admission):  IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or
malalignment.
.
CT head: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial
processes, particularly no evidence of hydrocephalus.  2.
Interval fluid opacification of the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses
could indicate acute sinusitis. Clinical correlation
recommended. 3. Stable left parietal subgaleal hematoma with no
underlying fracture.
.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This is a limited routine EEG in the awake and
drowsy
states given that the patient is on propofol and fentanyl.
Telemetry
background is notable for suppressed background and generalized
slowing
consistent with sedation. No focal lateralizing or epileptiform
features are noted. Repeat study may be warranted when off
sedation to
better gauge any interictal abnormalites.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 27 year-old man who presented w/ EtOH withdrawal
seizures requiring emergent airway and ICU stay.
.
#. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient presented to the ED
after a reported tonic/clonic seizure at work. The patient
stopped drinking 2 days before presentation after a close friend
staged an intervention to stop his alcoholism. He previously
drank a bottle of [**Known lastname 91320**] rum daily. In the ED the patient
underwent a head CT that was unremarkable. Prior to leaving the
ED, the patient suffered a witnessed seizure during which he
lacerated his tongue. Lost ~2L of blood. Attempted intubation in
the ED was unsuccessful due to heavy bleeding and an emergency
cricothyroidotomy was performed. Transferred to the TICU.
.
On HOD #1 the patient was brought to the OR where the
cricothyroidotomy was revised to a tracheostomy. Returned to the
ICU where he was placed on a CIWA scale (requiring benzos less
than every 2 hours for CIWA>10) and a banana bag. The patient's
sedation was lightened however he quickly became agitated
requiring a propofol drip.  An LP was performed and was
unremarkable. Started on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
Since that time the patient's sedation was able to be weaned and
his mental status improved with an agressive CIWA scale. The
patient was transferred to the medicine floor where he continued
to improve. Was able to tolerate PO feeding on [**2160-11-20**] and
his trach was capped that night. The trach was removed on
[**2160-11-21**] and he was discharged to home.
.
#. Tongue laceration: The patient lacerated his tongue during
the seizure with a large volume of acute blood loss. Received 1
unit of PRBCs in the ED. Hct nadir of 21.0. Per ENT recs, he was
started on a 10-day course of Unasyn.  When the patient was able
to tolerate POs the Unasyn was changed to Augmentin. He was
discharged with plans to complete 2 additional days of
antibiotics. Should continue mechanical soft diet until seen by
ENT in follow-up.

#. Acute kidney injury: The patient's Cr rose to a peak of 1.9
in the setting of acute illness and blood loss. Recovered
rapidly with volume resucitation.
.
#. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR to 1.3.
Presumed to be due to alcoholism.
.
#. Transitional Issues:
1) Will need additional counseling on alcohol abstinence. Seen
by social work in-house although could not agree to stopping
EtOH abuse.
2) Complete 10-day course of Augmentin on [**2160-11-23**] and
follow-up with ENT for tongue laceration.
3) Stop Keppra 2 weeks after discharge.
4) Continue mechanical soft diet until seen by ENT in follow-up
