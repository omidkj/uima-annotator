Admission Date:  [**2201-1-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2201-2-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2141-9-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old
female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and mental retardation
who was admitted on [**2201-1-24**] to the [**Hospital6 10353**] for
an episode of retrosternal chest pain that was poorly
described due to the patient's baseline verbal communication
ability. While at [**Hospital6 10353**] she was ruled out by
enzymes for an acute coronary syndrome (troponin I less then
.15 three times, CK 103, 92, 80).

Electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation with first
degree AV block.  No ischemic changes were noted.  Nuclear
stress test was performed, which showed a moderate to large
fixed defect with a smaller reversible effect in the
inferolateral and inferoapical walls.  Echocardiogram done at
that time noted a normal ejection fraction of 54%.  The
patient was then referred for catheterization to [**Hospital1 346**].

On presentation at [**Hospital1 69**] the
patient denied any chest pain and did not recall the details
of her episode of chest pain.  She does note that she had
some chest pain after vomiting.

regular insulin sliding scale, nitropaste prn, Kayexalate

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in a group home where she is
visited by visiting nurses at least twice a day for insulin
injection and finger stick blood glucose.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.9.  Blood pressure
120/70.  Heart rate 84.  Respiratory rate 12.  Sating 94% on
room air.  General, thin small woman lying in bed.  HEENT
oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  JVD
approximately 7 cm above the angle of the sternum.  Lungs had
fine crackles approximately two thirds of the way up
posteriorly as well as coarse rhonchi throughout both lung
fields.  Cardiovascular heart sounds were distant.  There
were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender and mildly distended with no rebound or guarding.
Extremities smooth shiny skin especially over the digits, no
peripheral edema in the lower extremities.  Neurological
examination she was slightly confused and perseverating, she
is able to follow commands bilaterally, ambulate with
assistance and move all four extremities symmetrically.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray showed bilateral small
pleural effusions, potassium 5.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially hydrated and
treated with Mucomyst in anticipation of cardiac
catheterization.  In the meantime the reports were obtained
from [**Hospital6 10353**] of the nuclear stress test.  The
patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale for
blood sugars that were greater then 300.  It was noted on the
first night of admission the patient's blood sugar fell to
19.  At this point one amp of glucose was given and the
patient's mental status improved from somnolent to arousable
and oriented.  She was able to move all four extremities and
follow commands at that time.  Electrocardiogram was
unchanged at the time.

Following that an endocrine consult was obtained, and a more
gentle insulin sliding scale was devised to take into account
the patient's renal failure as well as her extreme
sensitivity to regular insulin.  At that point it was noted
that she could be treated with NPH insulin once a day in the
morning of approximately 16 units.

The patient remained chest pain free while she was in the
hospital and after discussions with her family in particular
her brother, it was decided that catheterization along with
its risks in a perpetually moving and somewhat physically
uncooperative patient outweigh the potential benefits.  It
was decided that medical management would be pursued until
such time as her cardiac symtpoms presented themselves in a
more easily identifiable manner.

She was kept on beta blocker, heparin and aspirin as well as
a statin and ace inhibitor.  She continued to have problems
with sleep apnea while she was in the hospital.

On [**2201-1-30**] she had an acute desaturation during the night to
52%, which was presumed to be an episode of obstructive sleep
apnea.  The patient was initially found to be tachycardic in
the low 120s and hypotensive.  Her hypotension was treated
quickly and her clinical picture rapidly began to suggest she
had an element of pulmonary edema.  She was treated with
intravenous Lasix and a nitroglycerin drip with improvement
of her saturations.

After this the patient was noted to be more in congestive
heart failure and was placed in a Nesiritide drip as well as
daily Bumex.  This resulted in some diuresis and by the end
of her stay she had oxygen saturations in the 90s on room air
while ambulating.  Her rales had improved and her JVD had
improved somewhat.

While she was in the hospital she had a brief trial of CPAP
for her obstructive sleep apnea at the suggestion of a
pulmonary consult.  She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit
for this trial.  She did not tolerate the mask at all and it
was obvious that she had failed CPAP as a therapy for her
obstructive sleep apnea.  Her oxygens saturations, though
with her diuresis improved significantly and she seemed to be
sleeping better and more comfortable.

After her episode of pulmonary edema it was noted that her
creatinine had increased from 2.0 to 2.8.  This decreased to
2.6 with Nesiritide and it was felt that her kidney function
was improving with diuresis.  Her finger stick blood glucoses
remained under better control with a daily regimen of 16
units of NPH with a very light regular insulin sliding scale
to cover her between doses of NPH.  She was seen by physical
therapy who felt that she could safely be discharged home to
her group home with visiting nursing for both physical
therapy, range of motion, independence and ambulation as well
as for diabetic care.

On [**2201-2-2**] it was noted that her potassium was 5.8.  This was
the second time that her potassium had been elevated during
her hospital stay and she was given Kayexalate 30 grams po.
She responded well to this and her potassium decreased to 5.4
within two hours.  The patient also had a repeat x-ray, which
showed slight improvement in her bilateral pleural effusion.
She had no evidence of focal infiltrate visible.

On [**2-2**] she was discharged to her group home with visiting
nursing services to arrange blood draws as well as to perform
physical therapy.  She was given follow up clinic
appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**], her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **], in the heart failure clinic and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
