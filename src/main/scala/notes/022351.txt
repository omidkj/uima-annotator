Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Univasc / Hydrochlorothiazide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
expired

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 year old female with a history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with
chest pain and shortness of breath x 2 days.  The patient says
that she was in her usual state of health prior to two days ago.
 She went to bed on Saturday night and one hour after she went
to sleep she was woken up by pain in her chest and difficulty
breathing.  She describes the pain as being a crushing pain
across across her chest.  It radiated to her shoulder blades and
down her arms.  The pain was associated with shortness of
breath.  It was not associated with nausea, vomiting or
diaphoresis.  The pain lasted for the entire night and finally
went away in the morning.  She felt fine during the day on
Sunday.  She went to bed again Sunday night and experienced the
pain again in the morning.  It again lasted for approximately an
hour and at that time she decided to call an ambulance.  Of note
the patient also notes worsening lower extremity edema over the
past two days.  The patient reports that she has never had chest
pain in the past.  She does get short of breath with exertion
but feels that this is partially secondary to deconditioning.
She can walk around her apartment without getting short of
breath but cannot climb stairs secondary to feeling fatigued.
Her family does say that she has dyspnea on exertion.
.
The patient's initial vitals at [**Hospital3 4107**] were T: 97.8 P:
74 RR: 18 BP: 108/74 O2: 99% on 2L.  She received aspirin 325 mg
x 1 by EMS. On arival to the hospital she was pain free.  EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST
segment changes.  She received lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and as placed
on a heparin drip without a bolus.  She received atorvastatin 80
mg and plavix 300 mg.  Her labs were notable for a WBC of 9.2,
Hct of 34.7 and Plts 212.  BUN 25 and Creatinine 1.5.  Her BNP
was measured at 901.  INR of 3.7.  Troponin 1.0.  The heparin
drip was stopped because it was felt that her troponin elevation
might be secondary to her renal insufficiency. She as
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] her vials were T: 96.2 HF: 64 BP: 136/64 RR:
16 O2: 97% on RA.   EKG from [**Hospital1 18**] showed normal sinus rhythm,
normal axis, normal intervals, TWI in V1 and flat in V2, V3.
Otherwise no acute ST setgment changes.  She had a CXR which
showed no acute cardiopulmonary process and no significant
evidence of edema.  She was transferred to the floor for further
management.
.
On review of systems she denies lightheadedness, dizziness,
chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria. leg
pain. She does report leg swelling over the past two days.  She
denies orthopnea or PND.

Echocardiogram
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall,
anterior septum, and the all of the distal LV segments/apex. The
inferior/inferolateral segments contract normally. Quantitative
(biplane) LVEF = 32%. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. . Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-11-16**],
extensive regional wall motion abnormalities are new and
pulmonary pressure is higher. The other findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87 year old female with a history of atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with
chest pain and shortness of breath x 2 days.
.
Chest Pain/Coronary Artery Disease: On presentation the patient
described atypical chest pain.  It was diffuse in nature and
prolonged in its time course.  It was assocatiated with
shortness of breath.  It was worst in her scapular region
bilaterally and down her arms.  Her arms were significantly
painful to the touch, particularly when using a blood pressure
cuff.  On admission her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated and
this was of u
