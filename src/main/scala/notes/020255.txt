HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year-old female
with a history of Alzheimer's dementia end stage at baseline
and is noninteractive, asthma, hypertension, congestive heart
failure presenting with dehydration, acute hypoxia and
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient additionally
presented with hypernatremia with a sodium of 165 and in
acute renal failure.  Upon transfer from outside hospital the
patient's arterial blood gas was noted to be 7.35/50/78 on
100% nonrebreather.  Per report the patient presented with
three days of increasing wheezing and decrease in mental
status.  At baseline she is not interactive, but prior to
admission she was tracking.  Additionally the patient was
noted to be taking less and less nutrition via po intake,
however, was persistently getting Lasix for baseline
congestive heart failure.  The patient was initially seen in
the Emergency Department, however, transfer to the Intensive
Care Unit for noninvasive ventilation.  She was approximately
92% on 100% nonrebreather.  Her chest x-ray demonstrated low
lung volume suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia.  Her
white blood cell count was 19.3 upon admission.  Her sodium
was 165.  She was transferred to the unit where she received
fluid, nebulizer treatments, intravenous steroids, which were
quickly tapered, antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia as well
as a urinary tract infection.  Her cardiac enzymes were
notable for a troponin leak of .1.  She was started on
nasogastric tube feeds with improvement in her clinical
picture and transferred back to the floor on the [**10-16**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End stage dementia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Depression.
7.  Asthma.  No prior history of intubations.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
2.  Multivitamin.
3.  Singular 10 mg po q.p.m.
4.  Tylenol 650 q 6 prn.
5.  Duo nebs q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is DNR/DNI per primary care
physician and per discussion with health care proxy who is
her sister.  The patient currently resides at a nursing home.
 At baseline is able to take po with much assistance,
however, is not very interactive and is in end stage
dementia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature
max 101.  Blood pressure 132/74.  Heart rate 101.
Respiratory rate 32.  95% on 100% nonrebreather.  Generally
the patient is nonresponsive, however, opens eyes to stimuli.
She is able to move extremities voluntarily.  HEENT mucous
membranes are dry.  Cardiac heart sounds distant.  Lung
examination clear anteriorly with scattered wheezes.
Abdominal examination mild grimacing with deep palpation,
however, soft, active bowel sounds.  No rebound or guarding.
Extremities no edema or clubbing.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
19.3, 69% neutrophils, 19% bands, 8% lymphocytes, 4%
monocytes, hematocrit 50.8, platelets 394.  Urinalysis
notable for rare leukocyte esterase, 6 to 10 white blood
cells, many bacteria, 3 to 5 epithelials, 0 to 2 red blood
cells.  Chemistry profile notable for a BUN of 59, creatinine
3.4, troponin of 0.10.  CK 26.  Arterial blood gas from
admission pH 7.38, PCO2 50, PO2 78, lactate 3.2.  Blood
cultures were negative.  Chest x-ray notable for right lower
lobe atelectasis and possible infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory:  The patient has a
baseline history of asthma.  She is presenting with
aspiration pneumonia.  She was initially in respiratory
failure upon transfer, however, when put on nonrebreather and
with frequent suctioning as well as steroid treatment and
antibiotic treatment the patient's respiratory status
improved dramatically to where she was able to be weaned down
to nasal cannula varying between 2 to 3 liters a minute.  The
patient's nebulizer treatments were continued.  Steroids were
tapered and should be tapered as an outpatient upon
discharge.  The patient did require aggressive suctioning
throughout the day.

2.  Hypernatremia:  This was thought to be secondary to the
patient's aggressive diuresis as an outpatient with
relatively low po intake.  The patient's sodium began to
improve with hydration upon transfer to the MICU.  The
patient received approximately 6 liters during her hospital
stay with decrease in her creatinine nearing her baseline,
which is 1.7.  At baseline the patient did get Lasix,
however, during this hospitalization this medication was held
in the setting of her hypernatremia and renal failure.

3.  Cardiac:  The patient ahs a history of congestive heart
failure, however, no recent echocardiogram on file.  Her
chest x-ray was unrevealing for volume overload, however, did
reveal possible infiltrate.  Cardiac enzymes were mildly
elevated during this hospitalization with the troponin
peaking at 0.10, however, there was no electrocardiogram
changes and no evidence of acute ischemic insult based on CK
with MB fractions.

4.  Acute renal failure:  The patient at baseline has a
creatinine of 1.7.  Urine output was adequate during this
hospitalization.  She was given aggressive intravenous fluid
hydration in the setting of dehydrated prerenal azotemia.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had an nasogastric tube
placed during this hospitalization to provide nutrition given
her relative risk for aspiration as well as her decreased
mental status.  The patient will be transferred back to the
nursing home without an nasogastric tube to pursue speech and
swallow study at the nursing home and address nutrition as an
outpatient.  However, given the patient's propensity to
become dehydrated she will need to be closely monitored.  In
addition, the patient may need Lasix on a prn basis.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient had Pneumoboots as well as a
PPI during this hospitalization.

7.  Code status:  The patient was DNR/DNI, which was
confirmed through family members as well as primary care
physician.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Tylenol prn.
2.  Albuterol nebulizers prn.
3.  Atrovent nebulizers prn.
4.  Lansoprazole oral suspension q.d.
5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q 48 hours.  This dose
will need to be adjusted based on the patient's creatinine
clearance.  The patient is to complete seven more days upon
discharge.
6.  Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously q 8 hours for seven
more days.
7.  Prednisone taper of 20 mg po q.d. for two days followed
by Prednisone 10 mg po q.d. for two more days and then no
further need for Prednisone.
8.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
9.  Dulcolax 10 mg pr q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute renal failure.
2.  Hypernatremia.
3.  Aspiration pneumonia.
4.  Asthma exacerbation.
5.  Urinary tract infection.
6.  End stage dementia.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is instructed to follow
up with her primary care physician as an outpatient.
Additionally the patient will need a speech and swallow
evaluation upon discharge as her nasogastric tube will be
discontinued.  Additionally Lasix will need to be considered
as an outpatient upon resolution of the patient's acute renal
failure.  The patient should have electrolytes checked
frequently until resolution of her acute renal failure.
