COMMENTS:
1. Limited angiography of the left carotid artery demonstrated
99%
stenosis of the left ICA with fillign of the MCA only.
Angiography of
the right brachiocephalic trunk demonstrated 50% right
subclavian artery
stenosis, patent vertebral artery and 95% long ulcerated,
dissected
stenosis of the right ICA.
2. Successful angioplasty and stenting of the right ICA with a
8.0x40mm
Protege stent and a 6.0x20mm Acculink stent that were
postdilated to
4.5mm. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and good flow.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 99% left ICA stenosis, 95% right ICA stenosis, and 50% right
subclavian stenosis.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the right ICA.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67yo man with a history of O2-dependent COPD,
hypertension, DMII, and syncopal history who presented for
carotid angiography on [**9-29**].

# PVD/CAD - The patient was admitted for carotid stenting.
Angiography revealed a left ICA with 99% stenosis and a 95% long
ulcerated, dissected stenosis of the right ICA. The patient
underwent angioplasty and stenting of the right ICA with a
8.0x40mm
Protege stent and a 6.0x20mm Acculink stent.  There was no
residual stenosis and no
angiographically apparent dissection.  The patient was monitored
in the ICU for blood pressure control and neurologic evaluation.
 He was felt to be stable and at his neurologic baseline.  He
was continued on aspirin, Plavix, statin was discharged with
instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

# Rhythm - The patient had a history of Afib s/p cardioversion.
EKG's were difficult to interpret in the setting of baseline
artifact, however it was felt that the patient may benefit from
further anticoagulation.  He was discharged on Coumadin and
instructed to follow up with his primary care physician for INR
monitoring.

# DM - The patient was discharged on his home regimen of
Glyburide and Avandia

# Hypertension - The patient was continued on his home regimen
of metoprolol, lisinopril and amlodipine.

# Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on ezetemibe
and atorvastatin.

# COPD/OSA - The patient was continued on Advair, albuterol nebs
prn and CPAP overnight.

# Tobacco Abuse - The importance of smoking cessation was
stressed and the patient was given information on tobacco
cessation resources.
