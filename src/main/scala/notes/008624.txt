Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening language difficulties

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed woman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on warfarin in the setting of myocardial
infarction in [**2099-11-17**], also on ASA and Plaxix, with
hypertension, and breast cancer was transferred from [**Hospital **]
Hospital for an atraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
left parietal region, after ~48 hours of worsening language
difficulties noted by friends and family.

Her son, who is bedside, notes that she has had some difficulty
with naming (particularly proper names of people) since [**2100-4-18**].  However, on visiting his mother two days ago, he noted
that she was having troble naming common things like "car."  Her
speech was not slurred.  Yesterday, she was noted to have some
difficulty with memory according to another family member.
[**Name (NI) **]
in the day, her son noted that she signed a check without her
last name, then wrote a message in a card that made "no sense."
She made dinner for her family last evening, but her son became
increasingly concerned and brought her to [**Hospital **] Hospital this
morning at 6 am.

[**Hospital **] Hospital ER staff records additionally indicate that
there was some concern about "slurred speech" and "agnosia."
Her
blood pressure on arrival there was noted at 128/80.  She
received a CT scan of the head that revealed a 2.7 x 3.7 cm left
parietal hemorrhage with some mild surrounding edema.
Her INR was 3.5.  She received Vitamin K, 10 units SQ and 10
units IV.  She received FFP x 2 and Zofran.  Sodium was 133 and
creatinine 1.2; EKG revealed atrial fibrillation.  She was
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for for further evaluation.

Review of Systems:
Denies headache, fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, vision
change or loss, weakness, numbness, tingling, incoordination,
bumping into walls, weight loss, night sweats, cough, trauma.

CT CNS: 08/ 29/ 08: Left parietotemporal parenchymal hemorrhage
is unchanged since 4 hours prior (at [**Hospital **] hospital).

MRI w/o contrast: 08/ 29/ 08:  While degraded by patient motion,
the FLAIR images are of  sufficient quality to re-demonstrate
the large hemorrhage within the left  posterior temporal lobe,
with extensive surrounding edema. There is  associated
effacement of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
There is extensive high T2 signal within the periventricular
white matter of both  cerebral hemispheres, which presumably
represents chronic small vessel infarction, given the patient's
very advanced age. There is at least one  probable chronic
lacunar infarct within the inferolateral aspect of the right
cerebellar hemisphere. There is no shift of normally midline
structures.
Given patient age, there are the expected diffuse involutional
changes of the  brain parenchyma.

MRA: 08/ 31/ 08: Redemonstration of left temporal lobe
hemorrhage, without
definite signs of underlying pathological enhancement or
abnormal vascularity.

Ct scan: 09/ 02/ 08: Multifocal pneumonia within the dependent
portions of the lung involving  the posterior right upper lobe
and lower lobes bilaterally is most suggestive  of aspiration
induced pneumonia. No reactive effusions or pericardial
effusions.

2. No focal mass lesions. Moderate centrilobular emphysema with
some
peripheral interstitial thickening and peripheral
bronchiolectasis, which
could relate to an underlying interstitial lung disease, NSIP
distribution.

3. Large type 3 hiatal hernia with no CT findings to suggest
gastric
volvulus.

4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the coronary tree
and
intrathoracic aorta which contains regions of ulcerating plaque.
Questionable thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Can
correlate with echo.


ECHO: 09/ 04/ 08 The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of
mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global biventricular systolic function. Mild
to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No large left atrial thrombu
