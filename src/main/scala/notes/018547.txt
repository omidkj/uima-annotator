Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:


History of Present Illness:
62M with PMHx of CAD s/p MI x 5, CHF w/EF 20-25% w/AICD,
uncontrolled DM2, and afib & h/o DVT on coumadin who presented
to [**Hospital3 **] with crushing substernal chest pain and acute
dyspnea associated with feeling clammy. He reports that he has
been having chest pain (somewhat relieved by SL NTG) and black
stools since 2 days prior to admission. On the night prior to
admission, he was having ongoing chest pain, not relieved by 5
SL NTG and decided to go to [**Hospital3 **]. Patient states that
prior to leaving for the hospital, he has 2 episodes of acute
dyspnea during which he was gasping for breath. His family took
him to [**Hospital3 **] where he was found to have deep ST
depressions in V3-V6 on EKG, a hemoglobin/hematocrit of
5.4/16.3, INR 5.9 and blood glucose in the 500s with anion gap
19 on initial labs. He was started on an insulin drip and
heparin drip for presumed ACS. He was given 3 SL NTG with BP
drop to 80/60; got 500cc NS bolus The results of the troponin T
(0.02) did not come back until the patient had already been
transferred. He received a total of 2L IVF and 1u PRBC.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T 97.6, HR 101, RR 30, BP
142/72, SpO2 100% NRB. Labs were significant for Hgb/Hct
5.8/19.6, lactate 4.5, INR 7.7, K 4.2, WBC 17.2, trop 0.04 (2nd
set, 1st negative at OSH). EKG sinus @ 99, NA, QTc 456, ST
depressions V3-6, similar to OSH. Guaiac positive brown stool.
UA negative except glucose 1000, ketones 10. He became
tachypenic to 30s after receiving more IVF, likely related to
pulmonary edema in the setting of CHF. O2 sat 100% on
non-rebreather, 88-90% 4L NC. CXR revealed mild pulmonary edema
and cardiomegaly. He was placed on BiPAP and lasix 40mg IV and
appeared more comfortable. He also received doses of vanc/zosyn
to cover for infection. He was ordered for 1u PRBC and
cardiology was consulted. Heparin was stopped and they
recommeded rule-out MI, TTE to evaluate EF, and stress test when
clinically improved. In the context of coagulopathy, CT abdomen
and pelvis was ordered to rule out retroperitoneal bleed; there
was no evidence of hemorrhage to explain anemia.

Of note, the patient has a history of a GI bleed with similar
presentation in [**2119**]. On arrival to the ICU, the patient appears
comfortable and states that his pain has improved to [**12-19**] out of
10.

RADIOLOGY:

CXR [**2122-2-18**]
There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. There is no
pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal lung consolidation.
ICD lead
ends in the right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.

CT TORSO [**2122-2-18**]
CT OF THE TORSO WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector
scanning is
performed from the thoracic inlet through the symphysis without
intravenous
contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy.
Small lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum measuring up to
0.8 cm in short
axis. These are not pathologically enlarged. There is no hilar
lymphadenopathy. There is a 4.1 x 4.3 cm rounded mass in the
azygoesophageal
recess. This measures fluid density and is consistent with a
pericardial
cyst. A single-lead pacemaker is identified. There are no
pleural effusions.
There is a 6-mm non-calcified nodule in the right middle lobe
(series 2, [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
42). There is atelectasis in the dependent portions of both
lungs. There is
a somewhat oblong opacity is identified in the right upper lobe
(series 2, [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
32). There is subpleural emphysema in the upper lobes. There is
a 3-mm
nodule in the right middle lobe (series 2, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] 14).

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver is without
focal lesions.
The spleen is normal in size. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.
The pancreas is unremarkable. There is no dilatation of the
pancreatic duct.
The adrenal glands are normal. There are extensive vascular
calcifications of
the kidneys bilaterally. There is a 2-mm calcification in the
left lower pole
that potentially could represent a small non-obstructing stone.
There is no
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is mild dilatation of the
infrarenal
aorta to 2.9 cm compared to a normal caliber of the remainder of
the aorta of
2.4 cm.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The right common iliac
artery is
dilated to 2.3 cm immediately below the bifurcation. Immediately
above the
bifurcation in the external and internal iliac artery, the
vessel is dilated
to 3.0 cm. Both external iliac arteries are extensively
calcified. There is
a surgical clip in the right groin and a rim calcified tubular
structure
lateral to the common femoral artery which may represent a
bypass graft.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis. No pelvic lymphadenopathy
is
identified. The small and large bowel are normal.

On bone windows, there are no consistent osteolytic or
osteosclerotic lesions.
