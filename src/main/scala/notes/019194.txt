HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old male with
a past medical history of migraine headaches,
hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease who
presented to the Emergency Room as a transfer from [**Hospital 4068**]
Hospital with complaints of left-sided weakness.  The patient
was found to have a large right parietal occipital
inter-parenchymal hemorrhage.  He was found on the floor by
his family, unable to get up prior to his presentation at
[**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.  He had been prior independent, alert, and
communicating clearly.

Neurologically, the patient was alert and oriented times
three.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Extraocular
movements were full.  His face was symmetrical.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient did exhibit left hemiparesis
and left-sided hemineglect.  The patient was placed on a
Nipride drip in the Emergency Room for blood pressure of 200
systolic.  The patient was started on Dilantin and was given
1 unit of fresh frozen plasma for INR of 1.5.  The patient
was placed on fluid restriction, 1 liter once daily and
placed on a Nipride drip to keep the systolic blood pressure
less than 140.  The patient received 50 grams of Mannitol
times one dose in the Emergency Room and was eventually
placed on Mannitol 15 mg q6 hours.  The patient was placed on
Levaquin for pneumonia and eventually received 4 units of
fresh frozen plasma total.

On [**2171-6-19**], left external ventricular drain was placed at 7
cm without complications for increased intracranial pressure
of 20.  Repeat head CT on [**2171-6-19**] at 10:00 p.m. revealed no
change.

On [**2171-6-25**], the patient's creatinine began to rise to 3.9.
The patient was started on gentle hydration and Mannitol was
held.  The patient neurologically opened eyes and moved right
side briskly, but did not follow any commands on [**2171-6-25**].

Two feeds were started at [**2171-6-20**].  Intracranial pressures
remained 16 to 18 on [**2171-6-20**].   The patient was started on
Labetalol drip to keep blood pressure less than 140.

The patient was placed back on a fluid restriction of 1.5
liters once daily on [**2171-6-22**].  Creatinine dropped backed to
2.  Subsequent head CT's revealed persistent
inter-parenchymal hemorrhage with some subarachnoid
hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, and interventricular
extensions.  The patient's prognosis was discussed with
family and the patient was made "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do
Not Intubate" by son who is the healthcare proxy.

The patient spiked a temperature on [**2171-6-26**] and was pan
cultured.  Cerebrospinal fluid was sent which was negative
for organisms.  The patient was started on a Morphine drip on
[**2171-6-26**].

On [**2171-6-27**], the patient's family decided the patient should
have comfort measures only.  On [**2171-6-27**], at 5:10 p.m. team
was called to evaluate the patient for respiratory arrest.
The patient is a "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do Not Intubate"
and had been on a Morphine drip for comfort measures since
[**2171-6-26**].  The patient had no pulse, no respiratory effort, no
corneal reflexes, and was unresponsive to noxious stimuli.

At that time, he was pronounced dead at 17:10 on [**2171-6-27**].

The patient's family was notified.
