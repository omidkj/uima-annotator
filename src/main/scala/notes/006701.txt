HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male who
was transferred from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  He has a past
medical history of advancing Alzheimer's.  His baseline
mental status is that he is confused and not conversational.
He also has a past medical history of coronary artery
disease, who was in his usual state of health until [**7-30**]
when his daughter tried to help him out of a chair, and he
could not get up.  Normally he is able to ambulate without
assistance.

The patient's daughter called 911, and the patient was
brought to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Emergency Room.  The patient
was admitted, and later CAT scan of the head showed acute
frontal parietal hemorrhage with extension to the ventricles.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further management.

The patient was confused but alert and talkative, moving all
extremities on arrival.  Pupils were reactive and equal
bilaterally.  Horizontal gaze was intact bilaterally.
Corneal reflexes were intact bilaterally.  Face was
symmetric.  The patient had increased tone in the lower
extremities bilaterally, which was greater than upper
extremities, but he was able to move all extremities well.
He localized to pain.

Head CT showed right frontal parietal lobe hemorrhage with
extension into the right lateral ventricle.  The patient was
admitted to the Trauma SICU for blood pressure monitoring.
The patient's Aspirin was discontinued.  The patient was
placed on a 1 L fluid restriction.  An NG tube was placed for
medication and nutrition.

Bedside swallow done on [**2141-8-1**], revealed the
patient not able to tolerate p.o.  Tube feeds were started.
The patient's neurological status improved slightly, although
the patient remained disoriented, confused, was easily
agitated.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2141-8-3**].  On [**2141-8-4**], the patient became more
lethargic and was not following commands.  He had decreased
verbal output.  Head CT was repeated with small increase in
the size of intracerebral hemorrhage.  There was no
significant change in ventricle size.

Fever work-up was sent.  Chest x-ray was negative.  Arterial
blood gas was within normal limits.  Cultures were negative.
The patient's vital signs remained stable.  The patient
remained afebrile.

The patient's prognosis and current condition were discussed
at length with the family, who decided to make the patient
DNR status.  GI consult was called for PEG placement.
