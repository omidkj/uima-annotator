Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with IPF, COPD on 4L O2 on chronic prednisone, CHF,
mechanical mitral valve, s/p pacemaker placement, known high
grade colonic adenoma with GIB (not resected), gastric varix (no
history of liver disease) recently admitted with nocardia
pneuomina, now presented with AMS.  Patient is transferred to
the MICU given + melena and likely need for endoscopy which may
need intubation for airway protection.

Of note, per EMS, she was at baseline EMS on their arrival to
the rehab.  She was hypoxic to the high 80s on RA.

In the ED inital vitals signs were 80 106/65 26 100% 12L
Non-Rebreather. Pt denies any confusion and is A&O to self,
place.  Patient denies any complaints other than shortness of
breath, which is typical for her. Pt declined NG lavage. Rectal
with heme postive dark stool. Labs notable for WBC count 15, Hct
18, creatinine 2.9 from baseline 2.0, metabolic alkylosis on VBG
(chronic).  She was crossed for four units. 97.4, 80 (AV-paced),
100/56, 18, 100%

On arrival to the floor she had a small melanotic BM visualized,
also with dried blood in the right nare.  Her repeat Hct prior
to transfusion was 26.  Given melena, patient completed 1 uit of
pRBC and is getting her 2nd FFP prior to transfer.  She is also
getting 1x dose of Bumex given she triggerred and required NRB
with O2Sat in the mid 80s, which was weaned to 4L at low 90%.

ROS: She reported wanting to sleep. Increased frequency of BMs
recently which she describes a dark, but not bloody. Cannot
recall if they are sticky. Denies fevers, chills, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or
anything else.

Studies:
[**2137-11-24**] CXR:
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
patient is rotated to the left. The patient's chin partially
obscures the left lung apex. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is
again seen, unchanged in position. Again, the pacer wires are
seen to traverse a stent, presumably in the SVC. The patient is
status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.
Abandoned epicardial leads are again noted on the left lower
hemithorax/left upper quadrant, stable. Surgical chain sutures
are again seen at the right lung apex. Evidence of basilar
fibrosis is again seen. There is persistent blunting of the
costophrenic angles and trace effusions would be difficult to
exclude. No new focal consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax
is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
76yo female with extensive medical including gastric varix and
colonoic adenoma with Hct drop and small melena, s/p
transfusions with appropriate Hct bump, likely [**2-27**] to chronic
bleeding from colonic adenoma.
.
# Goals of care: patient has been made DNR/DNI, confirmed with
daughter/HCP after multiple family meetings. Patient not to have
escalation of care, will only treat with acute blood loss
through transfusion and supportive care. Overall plan is to
eventually move towards comfort, but patient and family would
still like time to deliberate. Patient is eating a regular diet
and knows that this may increase her risk of bleeding. Also, lab
draws will be limited to daily, even in setting of transfusion
for decreased Hematocrit. Also, after lengthy discussion about
risks and benefits of taking anti-coagulation (given mechanical
mitral valve), patient and family have decided to stop
anticoagulation. They are willing to accept the risks of stroke.
We are currently continuing to offer transfusions as well as
antibiotics as below.
.
# Melena/Dysplastic Adenoma: In ED, initial hct 18, which rose
to 26 with 1 unit PRBC. Started on pantoprazole and an
octreotide gtt. Given therapeutic INR, patient was also given 2
units of FFP. Slightly hypotensive on arrival with SBP mid 80s
after having received her Bumex. Her daughter and HCP, [**Name (NI) **]
