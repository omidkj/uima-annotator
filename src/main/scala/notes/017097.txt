Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV function depressed. Paradoxic septal motion
consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: No AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with basal
inferior and basal septal hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricle appears hypokinetic (mild to
mdoerate free wall hypokinesis). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-2-18**] 4:44 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.

INDICATION: Status post bypass surgery. Evaluate for remaining
effusion.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with
patient in standing upright position. Status post sternotomy is
noted and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the
anterior left side of mediastinum is compatible with preceding
bypass surgery. Thoracic aorta unremarkable and only the most
lower portion of the descending aorta is mildly obliterated by a
small area of left lower lobe atelectasis. No acute parenchymal
infiltrates are identified, nor is there evidence of pulmonary
vascular congestion. Very mild blunting of the right-sided
lateral pleural sinuses observed and the lateral view confirms
this mild blunting to exist on the right side and to a slightly
more prominent degree on the left side adjacent to the posterior
segment atelectasis. Bony structures of the thorax grossly
within normal limits and there is no evidence of pneumothorax on
the frontal view in the apical area. Review of the previous
chest examinations is performed and it is noted that the
preoperative examination of [**2121-2-10**] was performed with
the patient in supine position. Thus, heart size is difficult to
compare. The pulmonary vasculature has not changed, but
comparison confirms that there remain minor pleural densities
and a moderately-sized posterior segment atelectasis on the left
side. Consequently, an additional chest followup examination
after a longer interval is recommended to document full
clearance.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery after catheterization at OSH
revealed 3VD with preserved EF. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he continued
to have chest pain and stated it had been continuous since
catheterization despite the addition of nitroglycerine SL and
Morphine IV. He was taken emergently to the operating room where
he underwent a CABG x 4 and IABP insertion, please se OR report
for details. In summary he had CABGx4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-AM-RCA, his bypass time was 103 minutes with a crossclamp of
85 minutes. He remained unstable following surgery and was kept
sedated, the night of surgery he had a VT arrest and returned to
NSR after defibrillation. He was started on an amiodarone gtt.
TEE the following day showed global LV hypokinesis and RV
systolic dysfunction. He remained intubated with IABP in place,
and he was started on milrinone. His echo the following day was
improved and his IABP was weaned and removed. Additionally he
was seen by vascular for decreased pulses in right foot while
the IABP was in place, his exam improved once the IABP was
removed. Chest tubes were removed on POD # 2 and pacing wires on
POD #3.  He had atrial fibrillation for which he was rebolused
with amiodarone, and started on lopressor.  He was extubated on
POD #4. He was transferred to the floor on POD #6.  His activity
level was advanced and medica
