History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of CHF, CRI, AS presenting from Marine
Bay NH with diffuse weakness. Private aid came in this evening
to give her a bath and the aide noted that she was particularly
weak. Daughter was away for the weekend last saw her mid-week
after work and she appeared fine. According to notes from the
nursing home she had sudden onset this evening of profound
weakness. She was found to have a RR in the 30s, HR 130-140s.
She denied chest pain or cough. O2 sats at the NH were in the
low 80s. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED here her vitals were initially temp 99.6 (spike to
102), HR 96, BP 112/60, RR 16, 98% on 2L. There she was found to
have a lactate of 5 and a RLL pneumonia on CXR. She was
initiated on the Sepsis protocol. In the ED she was given
Ceftazidime and Vancomycin. An US guided RIJ was attempted and
there were 3 flashes but they were unable to advance the wire. A
right SC line was attempted with arterial puncture x 2. They
were eventually able to place a right SC line.
.
Of note she had a similar presentation to [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**Month (only) 404**] that
was initially felt to be pneumonia but eventually turned out to
be CHF.
.
At baseline she is oriented to person only according to nursing
home and daughter. On admission to the ICU she denied any chest
pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.

ekg [**2189-6-28**]:
Probable atrial flutter with variable conduction. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**2189-6-28**] A single portable upright chest radiograph is
reviewed and compared to [**2188-4-8**].  There is a new opacity in the
right lower lung which obscures the right hemidiaphragm, and
appears largely due to new right pleural effusion, although
underlying consolidation or pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
Heart is prominent, and there is mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and upper lobe redistribution suggestive of mild
underlying pulmonary edema.  The left lung is clear, and there
is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Old
right rib fracture is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  New right lower lung air opacity appears largely
due to right pleural effusion, although underlying consolidation
or pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
.
CHEST CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2189-6-30**]:  There is a moderate-to-large
right pleural effusion, most of which layers posteriorly,
although it does extend to the lateral aspect of the right
pleural space.  A small left pleural effusion is present as
well.  Patchy consolidation is present in the right lower lobe.
A smaller zone consolidation is present in the left lower lobe.
Scattered atherosclerotic calcification is present.  The mitral
annulus is calcified.  There are prominent mediastinal lymph
nodes which are within normal limits by size criteria.
Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable.  The chest
wall is intact.  Degenerative arthritic changes are present in
the spine.  A
central venous catheter is in place ending in the right atrium.

IMPRESSION:  Patchy bilateral lower lobe consolidation, greater
on the right, consistent with pneumonia.  Moderate right pleural
effusion which may be partially loculated laterally.  Small left
pleural effusion.  Bilateral lower lobe consolidation, greater
on the right, consistent with pneumonia.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND [**2189-6-29**]:  The right kidney is not definitely
visualized, and may be atrophic or congenitally absent.  The
left kidney measures 8.8 cm in length. There is no
hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, renal mass, or perirenal fluid
collection.  A Doppler exam was attempted but had to be aborted
due to the inability of the patient to tolerate the exam.
The bladder contains a Foley catheter and is collapsed.  There
is a moderate amount of free pelvic
