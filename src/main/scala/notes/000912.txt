Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Enlarging AAA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-6**]:
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm
with modular endograft, angioplasty and stenting of the right
renal artery, right common femoral endarterectomy and
saphenous vein patch angioplasty.


History of Present Illness:
This 81-year-old lady with severe COPD on
steroids has an abdominal aortic aneurysm which has been
enlarging slowly, now about 4.8 cm in maximum diameter. CT
angiography showed a somewhat marginal situation for
endovascular repair due to small caliber iliac arteries
mostly but we decided to proceed since she was a high risk
for open surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to pre-op holding in anticipation of an EVAR for
an enlarging AAA. She underwent endovascular repair of abdominal
aortic aneurysm with modular endograft, but her operative course
was complicated by partial covering of the origin of the right
renal artery requiring renal angioplasty and stenting,
dissection of the right common femoral artery with occlusionas a
result of percutaneous access requiring groin exploration,
endarterectomy and vein patch repair. She tolerated the
procedure well, though given her complicated operative course,
she remained intubated overnight in the CVICU. She was extubated
without difficulty the following morning, and transferred to the
VICU later that day. On POD 2, her hct had dropped to 24, and
she was given 1u PRBCs. Her hct responded nicely to above 30.
Her A-line was removed and she was getting out of bed. The
remainder of her post-operative course of unremarkable, and she
was deemed ready for discharge on POD 3. She will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks, with a CTA to be done beforehand.
