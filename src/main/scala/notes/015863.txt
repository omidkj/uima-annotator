Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Per the son, when he was getting ready for work in the morning,
she came into his room and was complaining of trouble breathing.
 He says that she sounded very congested, tried to cough but
continued to have difficulty breathing.  She then started
gasping/gurgling and lips started turning blue, then she
collapsed in front of him and he called 911.  EMS was dispatched
at 7:29am, which was 5 minutes after she collapsed, they arrived
at 7:34 and immediately started CPR.  The initial rhythm was
PEA, she received 2 rounds of epi with ROSC at 7:44am, at that
time her rhythm was sinus tachycardia to the 150's.  She was
intubated on scene. When she began moving her extremities after
ROSC, she was apparently moving only the right side of her body.
She was initiated on cooling by EMS, and they gave her a dose of
vecuronium.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, EKG was sinus 94, NANI, twi inf, 1/2mm
std laterally.  Bedside ultrasound showed no pc effusion, full
IVC, RV wnl, global mild LV hypokinesis, nl aorta, fast neg.
Chem 10 was moderately hemolyzed but significant for K 5.4
bicarb 12, AG 29.  CT head was negative for bleed.  CT torso
showed no PE but intramural hematoma beginning at aortic arch
immediately distal to origin of
left subclavian artery and ending just above the diaphragm with
active extravasation.  Also with assymetric eccentric
hypodensity in the wall of the brachiocephalic artery with
concern for intramural hematoma and bilateral dependent
consolidations and diffuse ground glass opacities suuggesing
aspiration or pneumonia with likely fluid overload.  Also noted
to have minimally displaced anterior rib fractures, 4-8th ribs
on the right and 5-9th ribs on the left.   Vascular was
consulted and recommended head/neck CTA to assess for extent of
dissection as well as TEE and tight BP control.  C-[**Doctor First Name **] was also
consulted.  Troponin was negative x1.  Initial ABG was
7.03/58/131 and improved to 7.24/42/96.  Bcx was sent and she
was given vanc/levo/flagyl given concern for aspiration. VS on
transfer were T 35  HR 68   BP 105/55  on AC vent
.
On arrival to the MICU, her initial VS were: 92.3, 58, 122/66,
100% on AC 400x24, FiO2 of 100%, PEEP of 5.

Reports:
[**3-29**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis/near-akinesis of the basal and mid inferior and
inferolateral segments. Due to suboptimal image quality,
additional wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and wall thickness with moderate to severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and hypokinesis/near-akinesis
of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
Depressed right ventricular function. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
.
[**3-29**] CTA:
1. No evidence of type A aortic dissection. A short proximal
segment of the innominate artery appears to be involved with an
intramural hematoma, within which a tiny streak of hyperdensity
may represent contrast. Known descending aortic intramural
hematoma is incompletely imaged on this study.
2. Mild narrowing of left vertebral artery origin and left ICA
origin.
Intracranial and neck vessels are otherwise patent without
evidence of occlusion or focal aneurysm.
3. No acute intracranial process.
4. Incompletely imaged bilateral pulmonary consolidations with
air bronchograms, better evaluated on same-day dedicated chest
CTA
.
[**4-4**] MRI head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, masses or mass effect. No diffusion-weighted
abnormalities are detected to suggest acute infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are mildly enlarged, consistent with mild
involutional changes. No extra-axial fluid collection is
detected. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the right sphenoid
and bilateral ethmoid air cells. The major vascular flow voids
are intact. No abnormal enhancement is detected in the
post-contrast images. The post-contrast images are somewhat
limited by motion artifacts. Small right temporal/occipital
scalp hematoma is seen.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study due to patient motion. Within
this
limitation, no acute intracranial abnormality, especially no
e
