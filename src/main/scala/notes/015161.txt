History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111544**] is a 67yo male with PMH significant for CAD s/p 5V
CABG, CHF (EF 20%) s/p ICD placement, mild AS, mod MR, severe
TR, HTN, DM2, PVD, hyperlipidemia, thrombocytopenia, pulm [**Hospital **]
transferred from outside hospital with 3 episodes of
lightheadedness on [**10-27**]. He got up to urinate at 7am on [**10-27**] and
on walking back to his room he felt lightheaded and dizzy. He
went back to bed and woke up several hours later, this time
feeling dizzy with standing. He caught himself on his bedside
table and did not fall, hit his head or lose consciousness. He
subsequently developed substernal to right sided chest pain,
nonradiating while sitting at the edge of his bed. He took 2 SL
NTG with relief of the pain. No associated symptoms at that time
aside from the presyncope, ie no SOB, nausea, diaphoresis. Of
note, he worked with PT at home the day PTA and felt well with
no worsening of sx. He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**10-27**].
Labs there were notable for a BNP of 2429, creatinine 1.6, trop
0.01 and dig level 0.6. CXR showed pulmonary venous hypertension
and pulmonary edema c/w CHF, small layering effusion. O2 sat 78%
on RA. He was given 80mg IV lasix with UOP of 2300cc. Patient
requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as he is well known here. Upon
arrival to the ED, his vital signs were T100, BP 124/60, HR 68,
RR 20, O2sat94%on 2L. CXR showed effusions which were improved
from prior. EKG showed ?deeper TWI laterally. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 111545**]
(elevated from prior).
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 111544**] had been previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 111546**] after being found down. He was intubated for
respiratory distress and briefly on pressors for hypotension,
however he was easily extubated. ICD was interrogated at that
time and no arrhythmias were noted. His syncope remained
unexplained. BP meds were down titrated. Since that admission he
was also seen in the ED on [**Location (un) **] for mild congestive heart
failure. His lasix dose was increased at that time.
.
At baseline he is on 3L oxygen and is short of breath with
minimal exertion. Baseline weight is 161lbs. He has three pillow
orthopnea, chronic fatigue and mild nonpitting leg edema.
.
On arrival to the floor, he was comfortable with no complaints.
No shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness or
dizziness. He was weaned to his baseline O2 of 3L. He denies any
recent dietary indiscretions.
.
On AM evaluation, patient short of breath, CP relieved with 2 sl
ntg, ECG with increasing depressions laterally. CHF consulted
given IV lasix 60 mg IV with good response ~700 cc output. No
further CP. Initially desated to 89% on 5L now stable O2 sats
>90% on 4L (baseline 3L)
