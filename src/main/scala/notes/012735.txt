Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 25 year-old female with type 1 diabetes who
presented [**2167-11-29**] with DKA. Left AMA.

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has a h/o DMI and multiple
admissions for DKA. On this admission, the patient arrived
complaining of abdominal pain and N/V.  In the ED, her initial
VS were stable.  She received 30 mg of compazine and benadryl
25mg IV.  Initial glucose was in the 70s; however repeat was
>300. AG was 23. The patient refused insulin initially but
eventually accepted a drip. Received IV fluids (2L), diazepam
10mg, ativan 2mg, haldol 10mg IM and diluadid 2mg. She refused a
CXR or urinalysis. Transferred to the MICU where the patient
repeatedly requested IV medications for pain control. Refused
further insulin and asked to leave AMA. The patient's AG had
closed by this time. She stated that she would check her own
glucose levels and self-administer insulin. She demonstrated
that she was capable of doing this. Given 15 units of longer
acting insulin and allowed to leave AMA as it was felt physical
restraint would be more harmful to the patient.
