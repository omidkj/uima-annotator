Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-8-25**] 5:58 AM
IMPRESSION: 2.8-mm right temporoparietal mass without shift of
normally midline structures. Differential includes both primary
and metastatic malignancy as well as focal infection and
clinical correlation is recommended. Overall, there is limited
evaluation without contrast and MRI is recommended for further
characterization.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-8-26**] 7:32 PM
IMPRESSION: Right parietal lobe mass with vasogenic edema. In
absence of slow diffusion within the central portion of the
lesion, this most likely represents a neoplastic lesion and
locations are suggestive of metastatic disease.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. A fetal right posterior
cerebral artery is incidentally noted. There is no vascular
occlusion or high-grade stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
[**2192-8-27**] 12:17 AM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 3 cm lobulated right upper lobe mass with
indentation and spiculation, with continuous extensive
mediastinal and hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy
representing primary lung cancer with lymph node metastasis. The
mediastinal mass invades into the lower SVC, and compresses
right main pulmonary artery.
2. Centrilobular emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusion
with atelectasis.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of active inflammation.
4. Left renal cyst.
5. Degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine. No suspicious
lytic or blastic lesion is noted, however, bone scan can be
performed for staging.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2192-8-28**]
 GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - patient unable to cooperate.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small (0.5 cm) circumferential
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Suboptimal
image quality -
patient unable to cooperate.
IMPRESSION: Small, echo dense pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild
diastolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2192-9-5**] 3:36 PM
IMPRESSION: Since [**2192-8-31**], resolution of intracranial air. No
significant change in the 2.7-cm right parietal mass with large
area of surrounding edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17226**] was admitted [**2192-8-25**] after a witnessed sz and fall
at home. A head CT showed a 2.8cm R parietotemporal mass with
edema, no midline shift. This patient presented with a single
seizure and CAT scan and MRI scan revealed an irregularly
contrasting enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe. The
patient was
also demented since several years and the torso CT showed
multiple lung lesions. The situation was discussed in detail
with the family and once due to the dementia of the patient, a
first line resection was denied.  After extensive discussions of
the pros and cons, the family wished a serial stereotactic
biopsy to be done so that a definitive histological diagnosis
could be obtained and any further measures could be decided upon
on the basis of a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and the
pertinent prognostic outlook. During his pre-operative course
the pt was intubated and sedated during imaging.  The pt was
extubated on the morning of [**2192-8-27**].  The stereotactic brain
biopsy was conducted on [**2192-8-31**]. Preoperatively, Dilantin was
started for seizure prophylaxis as well as decadron.
Post-operatively PO intake was decreased and a 3 day calorie
count was done and PO intake was encouraged.  At time of
discharge, pt was taking adequate PO intake.
