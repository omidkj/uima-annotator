Ampicillin / Cephalexin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F Russian speaking (poor historian) who went to bed at 10pm
yesterday with nausea and chills. No diarrhea/vomitting. She
awoke with cough, fever, and nausea was found soaked in urine
and feces. Son in [**Name2 (NI) 7349**] who is HCP but the pt lives alone here but
has vna 3 hrs/day. She was presumably sent to ED by her home
aids where she was found to have BP in 180s-190s, VS  158/72,
65, 24, 99%3L, CXR with retrocardiac density concerning for PNA.
She received [**Last Name (LF) 14990**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], BB and 750cc IVF. She had a new R
bundle and TW inversions on her EKG, cards was consulted and not
concerned, her 1st set CEs were negative. She was admitted to
medicine for further workup.
.
On the floor for 3 days, the pt was treated with antibiotics but
then developed AF with [**First Name3 (LF) 5509**] x2 (the first time converting back to
sinus rhythm after lopressor and dilt boluses). During the
second major [**First Name3 (LF) 5509**] episode the pt received dilt 10 IV x2, HR was
in fib in 90-100s, BPs went from 130 to 100-110 and pt required
face mask oxygenation (up from 4L NC). MICU was called given the
pt's full code status and her worsening oxygen requirement. CXR
at the time was at baseline, ABG showed pO2 64, CO2 35, pH 7.43.
She was transferred to the ICU where she was placed on metop 50
TID and converted spontaneously to sinus. She was diuresed with
20 and 10 IV lasix and put out net -1.2L. Now pt is doing well
on the floor on 2L NC and ready for transfer back to the floor.
Pt is reported to not have BM for last 5 days.

[**2139-3-8**] CXR: Interval worsening of right perihilar opacification
since [**2138-10-31**] that is worrisome for pneumonia. CT can help in
further delineating this region though given stated demographic,
alternatively, repeat radiograph status post appropriate
treatment can be obtained to evaluate for resolution and help
exclude an underlying mass.
.
[**2139-3-10**] CXR: Slight improvement in right perihilar opacity.
Recommend CT to rule out underlying mass/obstruction.
.
[**2139-3-15**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Persistent right lower lobe
consolidation suggestive of pneumonia with accompanying pleural
effusion. New left lower lobe opacity favoring atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F Russian speaking (poor historian) who p/w nausea and chills
and resp distress with infiltrate concern for PNA.
.
# PNA: on admission had new O2 req of 3L, retrocardiac opacity
on CXR, concerning for community acquired PNA. WBC slightly
elevated with 90% PMNs. UCx neg. sputum cannot be produced. The
pt was treated with [**Age over 90 14990**] renally dosed and
tylenol/guaifenesin/tessylon as needed for cough. She was also
given nebs prn shortness of breath. Her breathing slowly
improved but her lung sounds continued to be rhonchorous. She
likely also has some component of upper airway obstruction and
perhaps OSA. She was discharged on [**Age over 90 14990**] to be completed for
a total of 10 days. Of note, the original CXR for the pt
suggested that rpt imaging after resolution might be useful to
r/o possible malignancy but this was not seen in rpt CXR. In the
past, she has refused w/u of breast mass and other outpt
findings. If pt fails to improve in future, rpt imaging or
consultation with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to talk about rpt imaging
could be considered.
.
# Afib: Per report the pt has a h/o PAfib but on admission she
was in NSR on 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] of metoprolol. During her stay she
triggered three times for AF with [**Hospital1 5509**] up to 140s which responded
to boluses of IV dilt 10mg. She was also increased to 50 TID
metoprolol and spontaneously converted back to sinus with HR in
60s. Due to one of her episodes of [**Hospital1 5509**] she went into flash
pulmonary edema and required transfer to the ICU for diuresis
and potential cardioversion (although pt converted spontaneously
to sinus). She was called out of the ICU after one day when she
was breathing on 2L. She is discharged to a facility for tele
monitoring. She was kept on her home aspirin 325. If the pt has
an episode of [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her cardiologist it was recommended to
not start amiodarone or dronedarone due to its high risks. She
may start PO dilt on top of her metoprolol if needed but it
would be most ideal to simply titrate up her metoprolol (at
37.5mg TID on dicharge).
.
# CAD/CHF: Pt not on lasix at home. EF 40-45. Pt did not have
any CP and there was low concern for ACS although new RBBB and
TWIs. She ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x3. As noted
above, if the pt g
