CXRs:
([**2131-9-28**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
([**2131-9-30**]) - IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of active disease
in the lungs or heart. No significant changes since the prior
study.
([**2131-10-1**]) - IMPRESSION: Improving left heart failure.

Sputum Culture ([**2131-9-30**]): GRAM STAIN - <10 PMNs and >10
epithelial cells/100X field. 2+ (1-5 per 1000X FIELD): MULTIPLE
ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.

CXR:
[**10-3**] Bilateral lungs are clear.  No evidence of active lung
disease. There is minimal plate-like atelectasis in the left
lower lobe (prelim report)
[**10-1**] Cephalization of pulmonary vasculature persists, although
improved since the last exam.
[**9-30**] No cardiomegaly.  The lungs are clear of an active
congestion or infiltration.  No evidence of pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

Abdominal Skin Biopsy ([**2131-9-30**]): The presence of acanthosis and
subepidermal fibrin is most consistentwith irritation or trauma
to the site (as would be seen with excoriations). The typical
histologic findings of dermatitis herpetiformis or pemphigus
foliaceous are not seen.

Axillary biopsy ([**2131-10-6**]): Right upper arm.  Dermal
hypersensitivity reaction
Note: Sections show an unremarkable epidermis.  The dermis
demonstrates a superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate with eosinophils. The findings are consistent with a
dermal hypersensitivity reaction, such as to an arthropod
assault.

Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old obese woman with history of asthma, 20 pack year
smoking, bronchitis with multiple admissions since [**9-21**] for
asthma flares requiring hospitalization and steroids. Her
hospital course is discussed by problem.

1) Asthma-
On transfer to the medical floor, she was placed on q3:prn nebs
with albuterol and ipratropium. She also received combivent q4
standing, prednisone 60 mg PO, serevent, flovent and singulair.
During her hospital course, she tolerated the weaning frequency
of neb treatment to q3-q4:prn, as well as a decrease in her O2
requirement from an initial 5 L/ min to room air. During this
transition from O2 via nasal cannula to room air, her O2
saturation was between 92-97%. Also, her daily peak flows
gradually increased to 250-300, which is at the patient's
baseline.  Notably, the patient's O2 on ambulation was 97% on
her discharge date. Smoking cessation was encouraged during her
hospital stay. She was sent home on Wellbutrin and a nicotine
patch.

2) Rash	- Patient reported rash on torso, upper thigh and arms
was pruritic and developed when she moved into her apartment,
which is adjacent to a pet store. She was given clobetasol,
benadryl and hydroxyzine with some relief. Initial biopsy
demonstrated nonspecific inflammation (see results sections).
After her discharge, it was noted that the rebiopsy of new
axillary lesion demonstrated many eosinophil consistent with
arthropod infestation.

3) Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
Patient complained of difficulty sleep and apneic episodes. She
noted a decreased in her symptomatology once she started using
CPAP. Patient's obesity, reported symptoms and improvement on
empiric CPAP was thought to be suggestive of OSA. Patient will
follow up with sleep lab for a sleep study.

4) Bronchitis
Patient completed 5 day course on empiric Levaquin for atypical
coverage and a cough characterized by scant white/yellow sputum.

5)Metabolic alkalosis-
Patient's HCO3 was persistently 34 fro a few days, and then
decreased to 29 on her discharge date.  This elevated HCO3 was
thought to be due to large consumption of Diet Pepsi (>6 jugs 24
oz/day).

6) Leukocytosis
WBC count between 19 and 25. This was thought to be due to
steroids(chronically on prednisone 20 for over a year, and now
on prednisone 60 mg PO). However, because patient was on
steroids, it was not felt that she would mount  a febrile
response if infected, thus, to rule out an infection cultures
were sent. Urine cultures and analysis were negative.  Blood
cultures pending upon discharge.

7) Diabetes mellitus
Patient was managed on insulin sliding scale and glucose was
checked qid.

8) Anxiety
Celexa and Klonopin were continued, per outpatient regimen.

9) GERD-
Patient complained of emesis while asleep. CT scan demonstrated
a large hiatal hernia, which was thought to contribute to her
symptoms of GERD and worsening asthma from aspiration. She was
started on a proton pump inhibitor. Also, an appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57300**] from General Surgery was scheduled for the
patient.

Patient was stable upon discharge to home. She has transferred
all of her medical care to the [**Hospital1 18**].
