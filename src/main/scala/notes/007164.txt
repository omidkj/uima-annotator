Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
LAD Perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
73 yr old male w/ COPD, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, h/o silent [**Hospital **]
 transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after LAD perforation.  The patient
had one month of intermittent left sided chest pain, right arm
pain and SOB. He underwent a persantine thallium stress test
that was abnormal showing large anteroseptal, apical, and
inferoseptal, inferoapical and anteroapical partially reversible
defects (EF 45%). He was scheduled for outpatient cath at
[**Hospital1 **] on [**1-11**] (Wednesday), but presented Monday ([**1-9**]) with
chest pain to the [**Hospital1 **] ED. He did not have any acute ECG
changes and CE were negative x1. The patient underwent cath
today that showed 100% occulsion of the LAD.  He received 325mg
ASA, 600mg plavix in the cath lab. A stent was deployed and
resulted in perforation of the mid LAD.  The stent balloon was
inflated in LAD and was transferred for coated stent placment.
The bivalirudin was turned off after his perforation.  He
remained hemodynamically stable with BP 160/70, sinus 70s, sat
92-96% 2L NC.
.
On arrive here to the cath lab the balloon was deflated.  There
was severe dissection of mid LAD after the first diag and just
proximal to mid LAD stent with reduced flow in the mid LAD stent
and a possible dissection distal to the stent edge with a
significant step down from the LAD stent into the LAD with
reduced outflow.  There was no evidence of continued
perforation. During the case the LAD stent thrombosed, but chest
pain improved.  The distal LAD filled with collaterals. There
was also a small pericardial effusion seen and ECHO was
performed that did not show RV collapse. A pericardiocentesis
was attempted, but no fluid was able to be drained.  The LAD
remained completely occluded and it was decided to manage him
medical overnight.
.
On arrive the patient had complaints of sharp pain across his
chest that was not similar to his anginal pain.  He rated the
pain [**2169-3-15**].  He otherwise had no other complaints.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

ECG:
sinus rhythm at 75. normal axis. PR prolongated (234).  1mm ST
elevations in V2-V4.  T wave inversions V1-V4.

ECHO [**1-10**]:
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade but views are limited and
technically suboptimal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears globally preserved. Left ventricular systolic function
appears impaired but is not fully visualized.

ECHO [**1-11**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal
hypokinesis/akinesis, mid to distal anterior hypokinesis and
apical akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with overall preserved free wall motion (cannot exclude
apical free wall hypokinesis). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yr old male w/ COPD, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, h/o silent [**Hospital **]
 transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after LAD perforation found to have
dissection of the mid LAD, thrombosis of his stent and small
pericardial effusion.
.
# NSTEMI/LAD perforation/dissection/ pericardial effusion: Pt
with 100% occlusion of his LAD. Attempted intervention was
complicated by mid LAD dissection at OSH.  Upon transfer for
covered stent placement he subsequently thrombosed his stent. No
further attempts at PCI were made given the perforation.  Given
that pt noted that his CP is not similar to his angina, and more
consistent with pericardial irritation.  Small effusion was
noted on ECHO w/o tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was attempted,
but no fluid was removed. Pt was hemodynamically stable and CP.
Repeat ECHO was performed the following day with no worsening of
his pericardial effusion.  Cardiac enzymes were trended, with
peak CK 292 and CKMB of 25, felt to be a mild NSTEMI.  He was
monitored further with no change in his status and discharged
home.  Given the thrombosis of his LAD did not appear to be new,
with sufficient collateral development, supported by low cardiac
enzymes, no further acute intervention seemed appropriate.  CABG
was considered due to the pericardial effusion, but as the
effusion was stable, it was not pursued.

Statin was increased to Crestor 40mg. ACEI, and ASA were held
initially given concern for possible effusion/tamponade. Pt was
not on a beta blocker on admission because of his poorly
controlled COPD, this was also not started at discharge for the
same reason.  Telemetry was unremarkable.

# COPD: Pt breathing comfortably. Reports home O2 use only at
night.  He was maintained on his home medications and nebulizers
and was able to ambulate comfortably without oxygen.

# Atrial fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: Noted in CCU
