Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25457**] is a 49 year old female with history of coronary
artery disease s/p NSTEMI [**2120**] with DES to the RCA and PDA, DES
to RCA x2 in [**7-11**], moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, T1DM
s/p kidney transplant x 2 and pancreas transplant, peripheral
vascular disease, currently undergoing an evaluation for kidney
retransplantation and possible mitral valve repair, transferred
from OSH with chest pain.
.
Pt states that 3 weeks ago she had a high fever, with myalgias,
and improved after a few days. Then starting 5 days ago on
Monday, she developed fever, and again myalgias. She has been
having chest pain for several months now, but it got worse this
week. Her chest pain is normally in the epigastrium and center
of her chest, lasting for 10mins at a time, "coming and going,"
sometimes associated with activity. This week it became worse up
to [**11-15**] pain, worse with lying down and relieved by leaning
forward. The pain is different from her NSTEMI in [**2120**], which
back then was radiating to her left arm. The pain is also worse
with coughing and laughing. She has also been having to use
additional pillows to sleep this past week: she normally sleeps
on 2 pillows and has now been using 2 additional pillows. She
has also had fever to 101 earlier this week, with dry cough,
non-productive. She had one episode of emesis earlier this week,
bringing up food, no blood or bile. She spoke with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
gave her two doses of Levaquin and referred her to the ED after
CXR demonstrated bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.
.
She was sent to the ED at [**Hospital 10315**] Hospital where she received 1
dose of 100mg of Doxycycline, ASA 162 mg, Nitro SL, morphine,
heparin gtt, and lopressor 5mg IV x3. ECG demonstrated new ST
depressions in I, aVL, V4-V6, and TWI in III and aVF. Given
concern for NSTEMI, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the CCU, her VS were afebrile, HR 94, BP 163/89,
RR 18,  90% on 4L NC. When she arrived, she was having continued
chest pain and SOB. She was started on nitro gtt for chest pain
control and BP management, which brought her CP down to zero.
She continues to feel very SOB and is having chills.
.
Pt recently discharged for elective right and left heart
catheterization in [**Month (only) 404**]. However, at that time, decision was
made to not proceed given renal failure and concern for needing
to initiate dialysis if proceded with cath.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
