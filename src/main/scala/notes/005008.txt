RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-5-26**] 7:09 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: SOB

INDICATION: Shortness of breath.

FINDINGS: Compared with [**2150-4-26**], the heart and lungs appear
normal.

No acute process is identified.
*

T-SPINE  [**2150-5-27**] 4:00 PM

L-SPINE (AP & LAT); T-SPINE

Reason: r/o compression fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman with h/o osteoporosis with back pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o compression fracture
INDICATIONS: History of osteoporosis. Back pain.

AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE THORACIC SPINE: Comparison is made
to the lateral chest radiograph from [**2149-12-19**]. Again seen are
2 compression deformities in mid thoracic spine, which
demonstrates equivocal progression from [**12-19**]. (suboptimal
assessment due to positioning difficulty). There is diffuse
prominent demineralization.

AP AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: Vertebral bodies
are normal in height and alignment. There is diffuse
demineralization. Hip and SI joints are unremarkable. No prior
study is available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 y.o. female with h/o asthma/severe COPD with FEV1 = 0.24 who
p/w increasing shortness of breath in  the setting of poor
compliance with her antibiotic colisitin.
A/p
1) Respiratory- COPD/Asthma flare
Concerning for a pneumonia especially in light of recent sputum
culture which grew multi-drug resistant actinobacter and pt's
non-compliance with this regimen. We were reassured by her clear
chest X ray on admission. Her ABG on admission in the ED was
7.16/106/18 which improved with CPAP 14/5 to 7.22/84/217. She
also received 125 mg IV solumedrol along with continuous
neubulizers with some effect. Upon arrival to the MICU she was
transitioned to 40 mg prednisone, her nebulizers were continued
and treatment with aerosolized colistin was initiated. The
patient improved on CPAP and was eventually weaned to 4L NC with
an ABG of 7.39/54/89. She is on 2L NC at home per the patient.
She was also continued on her inhalers per her home regimen. She
is also to continue a slow taper of her prednisone with 40 mg po
qd x1, 30 mg x 2 days, 20 mg x 2 days, 10 mg x 2 days and then
back to 7.5 mg qd which is her baseline.
*

2) ID/Pneumonia:
The infectious disease team was consulted with regards to her
multi-drug resistant positive sputum culture. They felt that
this sputum culture reflected colonization and not a true
pneumonia and adviced repeat sputum culture, d/c colistin and
and treat with a 10 day course of doxycycline c/w treatment of a
COPD exacerbation.
*
3) Back Pain/Osteopenia:
The patient underwent X rays of her spine which demonstrated 2
compression deformities in the mid thoracic spine, which
demonstrates ?equivocal progression from [**12-19**]. There was also
diffuse prominent demineralization. In light of this the patient
was started started on aledendronate and continued on vit D and
calcium.
*
4) HTN-
She was continued on verapamil per outpatient regimen.  In the
ED she was markedly hypertensive but this resolved with an
improvement in her breathing. She was thus continued on her
single drug o/p regimen.
*
5) Psych/Anxiety
--She was continued on effexor, remeron, seroquel and ativan prn
. She is very anxious thus when she becomes short of breath she
gets very anxious which makes her breathing worse- a vicious
cycle. It is thus imperative that her anxioyltic regimen be
continued as this appears to ameliorate her pulmonary function.
*
Code: Full
*
Tobacco use: Pt was counselled on the importance of tobacco
cessation and demonstrates an understanding that her tobacco use
significantly contributes to her poor pulmonary funciton.
*
Eventual Disposition:
The patient has severe COPD and thus her pulmonary status is
tenous at best. We think that the patient should be considered
for long term placement in order to improve her pulmonary
toilette and overall medical compliance. Also when she is not at
home she is better able to abstain from nicotine.
