left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 16.

Head CT was negative for CVA.  Carotids showed no
hemodynamically significant stenosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient was
in no acute distress.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a CABG times four,
LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the OM and diagonal segments and to
the PDA without complication.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
number two.  On the morning of postoperative day number
three, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation
which was relatively rate-controlled with Lopressor.  The
patient was somewhat hypotensive and was transferred back to
the CSRU.  The patient was also noted to have some sternal
wound drainage.

On postoperative day number six, the patient underwent an EP
study and had an ICD placed and subsequently had an
uncomplicated hospital course up until discharge on
