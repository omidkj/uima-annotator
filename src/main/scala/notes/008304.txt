Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and epigastric burning

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the right
coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 y/o F with h/o HTN and carotid disease s/p R CEA
(in [**2155**]) who initially presented to OSH with shortness of
breath and epigastric burning. This started while patient was
vomiting (non-bilious/non-bloody) and worsened when she walked
around home. Stated that nausea/vomiting/epigastric pain had
been presented with "few days" prior to admission. On day of
presentation, pain was worsening, so she decided to come into
hosptial.
.
At OSH, patient was given "GI cocktail," aspirin 162mg, zofran,
protonix, and morphine 2mg with adequate relief of pain. Per
report from OSH, EKG had Q waves in inferior leads and ST
depressions in V3-V6. Trop were noted be 5.89 followed by 13.47.
Was then started on heparin gtt. Patient continued to have chest
discomfort and was started on nitro paste. Of note patient also
received plavix 300mg x 1. Given that patient ruled in, patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and for
cardiac catheterization.
.
Of note patient also had mechanical fall down 4 stairs and had
struck head. Denied any LOC. Head CT at OSH was negative for
head bleed.
.
Prior to transfer, patient's SBPs ranged from 80s-100s. Patient
was given approximately 1.5L NS while at OSH. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], patient was taken directly to cath lab where an echo was
performed showing hypokinesis of inferolateral wall with LVEF
50-55%. Cath showed RCA proximal thrombotic occlusion. PCI was
completed with 2.0x12mm BMS via radial approach.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

.
ECG: [**2158-12-11**]: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior leads with mild ST
segment elevation. There is mild ST segment depression in leads
I and aVL as well as in the precordial leads. An RSR' pattern is
present in leads V1-V2. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.

ECG: [**2158-12-11**]: Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing ST-T
wave abnormalities may be less prominent. Precordial voltage is
somewhat diminished. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
ECG: [**2158-12-11**]: Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of
[**2158-12-11**] no significant change in previously noted findings
.
ECG: [**2158-12-12**] Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of
[**2158-12-11**] inferior ST segment elevation is less prominent. ST
segment depression in leads I and aVL is less prominent.
Otherwise, no change.
.
Echo [**2158-12-11**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and
inferolateral walls and mid inferior wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with hypokinesis of the basal free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction and basal right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis c/w CAD (proximal RCA distribution). Moderate mitral
regugitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2154**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
Chest PA and Lateral [**2158-12-12**]
IMPRESSION: Absence of marked cardiac enlargement but upper zone

redistribution, interstitial basal emphysema and moderate amount
of bilateral pleural effusion consistent with CHF of moderate
duration. Nonsignificant enlargement of the heart silhouette is
not unusual in acute MIs. On the obtained AP and lateral view,
no significant intracardiac calcifications can be identified. No
previous chest examination exists in our records.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year lady with history of HTN, carotid disease
status post right CEA initially presenting with dypsnea and
epigastric pain and was found to have an NSTEMI and is status
post cathtereization and placement of a bare metal stent to the
right coronary artery.
