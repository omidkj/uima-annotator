Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis, fever, inability to ventilate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy revision
Arterial line
Central venous line
Peripherally inserted central catheter

History of Present Illness:
73F h/o DM, multiple CVAs, disseminated TB on tx since [**12-28**],
trached for resp failure with prolonged intubation/failure to
wean living at MACU/[**Hospital **] rehab, developed resp distress at
0530 on [**2147-5-30**], RR-36-40; HR 136, T noted to be 99.8, BP noted
to be 125/68.  Pt apparently was already on vanc and imipenem
starting [**2147-5-29**] for presumed VAP pna.  MRSA apparently growing
out of the sputum.  per EMS report 500ccs of blood suctioned
this AM from airway was noted to be difficult to ventillate.
Suctioned, with trach changes without succes, still difficulty
with diminished R sided lung sounds.  Difficulty with bag valve
mask as well.  Staff at HebReb denies trauma.
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP 88/38, RR 29, 96% satting.
Levophed started when SPB transiently to the 50s.  IVF given, BP
with pressors rebounded to 110s-120s.  In ED, hypotensive
transiently, started on pressors.  IP notified and tried to
repositioned the trach.  The patient was bronched and 80%
occlusion of trach tube with granulation tissue was noted distal
to the end of trach.  IP unable to pass scope.  Pt was intubated
from above.  ETT initally placed into the R mainstem bronchus
with collapse of L lung noted.  The tube was then pulled back
with successful re-inflation of the L lung. Pt given vanc,
ceftax, flagl and was placed on levphed gtt to maps>60.  Fent
and versed gtt were started as well.
.
Pt previously admitted on [**2146-12-4**] for ataxia, was dx'd with
acute stroke, disseminated TB, seizurers, was trached due to
prolonged intubation/failure to wean, then xferred on [**1-31**] to
[**Hospital1 112**] for further care.  From there, the pat was reportedly
xferred to MACU at heb reb where she has been residing then
(apparently off precautions).
.
ID history:
She was found to have pan-sensitive TB on 3 drug regimen
(INH/ETH/PZA). Her course has been complicated by worsening CVAs
(now bilateral), hypoxic respiratory failure, continued fevers.

She has had an extensive ID work-up and all studies negative to
date except for TB. Bone Marrow (aspirate only) [**12-9**] - with few
blasts Repeat BM [**12-14**] - 10-20% blasts, core biopsy MDS. Liver
biopsy [**12-9**] - necrotic with few granulomas (no micro sent). All
micro stains on pathology negative Only positive tests: ACE
level and HIT antibody B-glucan positive on [**12-13**], negative on
repeat.  [**12-16**] had right VATS, right supraclavic LN, and liver
biopsy done Biopsy shows granuloma suspicious for infectious
process.  Tissue from lung growing AFB.  Sputum cx also with AFB
when grew. TB is pan-sensitive.  Repeat CT chest/abd/pelvis did
not show marked improvement but did not show worsening either.
TB meds switched at beginning of [**Month (only) 956**] - no response to
holding rifampin.  Then tried changing to STM/Levaquin to see if
was one of the other drugs; no effect.  Trial of ambisome; no
effect. Has had loculated effusions but now no fluid; tapping
them the first time showed no growth on cx; the second time
there was no fluids.
.
She had [**12-25**] Bcx with coag neg staph seen on [**1-17**] with no
subsequent growth to date. Rec'd empiric Vanco tx with f/up TEE
(TTE from [**12-31**] was without vegetations)
.
ROS was unobtainable due to mental status.

Social History:
Has been living in [**Hospital **] rehab MACU since [**2147-1-19**] getting

glasses of alcohol per week. Retired, used to work in a post
office.
