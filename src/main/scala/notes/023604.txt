History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname 26442**] is a 81 year-old woman admitted to [**Hospital 88567**]Hospital with anemia, melanotic stool on [**2151-6-23**].  She
was found to have a bleeding marginal ulcer and underwent UGIE
and was transfused 4 units of blood.  EGD visualized a
nonbleeding visible vessel which was appropriately clipped.  She
was doing well and was expected to be discharged today when at
11:45 she was found to be slumped over in her chair.  She was
flaccid and when placed in bed she laid with her eyes open,
taking deep breaths and pursing her lips.  There was no
spontaneous movement except that she would occasionally become
flaccid.  Her vitals remained stable with a blood pressure in
the
140s-150s/70-80 range.  Pulse was regular in the 80s.  Initially
her eyes were deviated to the right then shortly after to the
left.  She had no response to light stimuli or to verbal
response.   Her exam was variable with neurological testing.
She underwent a CT of the head which showed just atrophy. 30
minutes later she seemed to talk normally but then began to
suddenly began repeating the same words over and over.  She had
a
"pill rolling tremor" on the left and her toes were up.
Neurology was consulted and the patient was felt to have a
brainstem stroke.  On neurologic exam at that time her pupils
were in the midline position.  Minimal movement of her right
upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities.  She was given
an aspirin suppository.  MRI capability was not possible and so
the patient was felt to need a tertiary care center for further
work-up of stroke.  Prior to discharge, the patient was
described
as  "moaning, groaning with no purposeful movements".

Imaging:
IMPRESSION:
1. Head CT shows diffuse changes of small vessel disease, but no
loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is noted, nor is there
evidence of
hemorrhage.
2. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates small vertebral
artery secondary to persistent trigeminal artery, but no
evidence of occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
Carotid calcifications seen.
3. Extensive parenchymal disease with bullous changes seen at
the visualized both upper lungs. Chest CT can help for further
assessment. These findings indicate chronic interstitial
disease. There is subcutaneous emphysema in the right upper
thorax, which could be related to rupture of a bullous or
secondary to a procedure.
4. CT angiography of the head demonstrates persistent
right-sided trigeminal artery, but no vascular occlusion is
seen.
.
.
EEG
These findings are indicative of severe independent
[**Hospital1 **]-hemispheric
cerebral dysfunction likely an acute large focal structural
lesion in
the left hemisphere involving cortical and subcortical
structures.
Large vessel territorial infarct and cortical spreading
depression can
give similar EEG patterns. Alternatively, the left hemisphere
focal
slowing could be related to postictal dysfunction, but the
degree of
slowing would be unusual given that no seizures were seen from
the left
hemisphere during this recording. There is also independent
severe
dysfunction over the right hemisphere with an epileptogenic
focus in the
right posterior quadrant giving rise to two right occipital
subclinical
seizures. No definite seizures were seen after 8 p.m. on [**6-28**].
Suggest
continuous EEG monitoring to monitor for recurrence of
electrographic
seizures.

CT-HEAD
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain without evidence of
an acute major vascular territorial infarction. Please note that
MRI would be more sensitive for detecting an acute infarction
and evaluating seizures, if clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU for rhythmic jerking
and intermittent unresponsiveness. She was continued on long
term EEG monitoring and continued on fosphenytoin and
levetiacetam. She remained unresponsive to stimuli. Repeat
imaging showed a likely stroke in the left precentral area. EEG
was suggestive of a large area of ischemia. Unfortunately her
hospital course was complicated by worsening respiratory status.
A family meeting was held at which point the husband decided
that his wife would not want heroic measures or to pursue
aggressive measures given that she would likely have significant
disability. The patient was made CMO with continuation of the
current antiepileptics for comfort.


She was subsequently transferred to the floor at which time she
lost venous access. She was given sublingual Ativan for seizure
prophylaxis. She was to be  transferred to a palliative care
institution but expired prior to transfer.
