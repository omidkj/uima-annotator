Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
male with a known history of valvular disease, mitral
regurgitation with a recent admission at [**Hospital3 3583**] for
chest pain and positive stress test.  Catheterization after
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
revealed a 50% left main lesion and three vessel coronary
artery disease with a normal ejection fraction and 2+ mitral
regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history was
significant for dyspnea on exertion, fatigue times six
months, glaucoma, benign prostatic hypertrophy, bladder polyp
resection, hernia repair, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
repair, transurethral resection of prostate and a remote head
injury.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin one tablet each day.
2.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg a day.
3.  Nitroglycerin 0.4 mcg once daily.
4.  Flomax 0.4 mg q.h.s.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Zoloft 50 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Eye drops, name unknown.

LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories on admission were white
blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit 37.0, and platelet count
120,000.  Chem7 revealed sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride
102, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 13 and creatinine
0.9.  Normal coagulation studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2108-1-4**], for a coronary artery bypass graft times two,
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to OM with a mitral valve repair.  The
patient did well with the procedure and an EVH was performed
on the right thigh.  Postoperatively, the patient was
transferred to the CSRU, weaned off drips and was extubated.
On postoperative day number one, he was doing well, requiring
only a small amount of tone with  Neo-Synephrine and insulin
drip.  Plan was made to discontinue Swan on day one and
discontinue his chest tube.  His hematocrit had drifted down
to 23.0 on postoperative day one for which he got two units
of red blood cells which brought his hematocrit back up to
28.0 appropriately.  His blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
on postoperative day two were 15 and 0.8 and he was in no
distress whatsoever and was doing well.  The Foley was
discontinued on day two as well as central line and he was
transferred to the floor.  Cartia Intensive Care Unit.  On
[**2108-1-7**], it was noted that the patient had thick sputum and
vomiting.  Heart rate was in the 120s, pale color, blood
pressure as high as 200/90.  The patient was in respiratory
distress and was transferred back to the CSRU.  On that
night, he was intubated and A line and central line were
placed to help monitor him.  Chest tube was inserted to help
drain an effusion on the left side.  He had some atrial
fibrillation and an Amiodarone drip was started.  Tube feeds
were begun.  He spiked and cultures were performed  which
revealed negative growth.  On postoperative day number five,
at this point we had started the patient on broad spectrum
antibiotics, given chest x-ray showing a likely picture of
possible aspiration, some Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  He was aggressively cultured.  He was back on
Neo-Synephrine, Amiodarone and Propofol and was tolerating
tube feeds.  No major changes were made.  The patient
remained in CSRU without any acute issues.  Postoperative day
six, antibiotics were continued.  We weaned off the
Neo-Synephrine.  Cultures were still negative and decision
was made to keep him intubated, p.r.n. pain control, stable
with Amiodarone and pulmonary we tried to wean him.  He was
on Aspirin and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
Postoperative day Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl day
six.  His atrial fibrillation, the Amiodarone was rebolused.
A new central line was placed.  Hematocrit was 28.0, blood
urea nitrogen and creatinine normal.  Cultures from when he
was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit came back
negative blood, negative sputum, negative stool.  He had
Amiodarone continuing and continuous Lopressor p.o. and he
was weaned, pressors weaned and tube feeds were a go.  On
postoperative day ten, the patient remained in a lot of
atrial fibrillation and was weaned off Neo-Synephrine and
Heparin drip was started.  The patient was doing well.
Insulin was started for high sugars.  On postoperative day
eleven, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl day number nine.
The Amiodarone was changed back to intravenous from p.o.
which had been performed after his atrial fibrillation.  He
had some abdominal distention, tenderness, and general
surgery was consulted and ultrasound revealed no evidence of
cholecystitis or gallstone disease.  Liver function tests
correlated this as well as ultrasound and CAT scan.  White
blood cell count at this point was 14.7, hematocrit 26.7,
platelet count 255,000 and blood urea nitrogen was 33 and
creatinine 0.6.   The patient was doing well.  On
postoperative day twelve, the patient continued on Heparin
drip.  No acute moves were made.  Physical therapy was
consulted.  The patient was doing well.  On [**2108-1-17**], the
patient was extubated and was doing well.  He received
aggressive chest physical therapy and tolerated it well.  His
saturation still remained 70 pO2 and his saturations were 95
to 100%.  He showed no evidence of respiratory distress.  His
arterial blood gases were drawn in follow-up as well as
physical therapy being called who agreed with the plan
disposition for rehabilitation.  On [**2108-1-18**], the patient was
doing well and it was noted that he had some left upper
extremity swelling.  Ultrasound was done to rule out deep
vein thrombosis which it did.  The patient on [**2108-1-19**], has a
bed at rehabilitation and is going to be scheduled to go
there.

counting the two week course.

Neurologically, the patient is intact at this point.  He was
sedated while he was intubated and postoperatively he was
moving all four extremities without evidence of any ischemia
in the brain or any neurologic damage.

Cardiac - The patient had bouts of atrial fibrillation while
in the hospital.  He was started on Amiodarone and blockaded
with Lopressor which he tolerated well and he was transferred
to the floor out of the Intensive Care Unit with that.

Respiratory - The patient's chest tubes have been
discontinued and the chest tubes were then replaced during
the second admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  Otherwise,
at baseline he does not have a very good respiratory status
and around the clock inhalers of both Albuterol and
Ipratropium are being used on him in order to maximize his
respiratory st
