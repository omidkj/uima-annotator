[**2166-4-3**] CT Head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute
major vascular territorial infarction. If there is further
clinical concern MRI is suggested.
.
[**2166-4-3**] CXR: Markedly limited study. No definite consolidation or
other acute process.
.
[**2166-4-4**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
80F with a history of resected breast cancer, COPD, diabetes,
and hypertension with mental retardation who presented with MS
changes, UTI, electrolyte derangements including hypernatremia,
hyperglycemia.  Initially admitted to the MICU.
.
#. Hyperglycemia: Diabetic, likely the result of steroids and
infection. Initial glucose >700 with anion gap 19 and trace
ketones. Treated with insulin gtt in ICU initially; now much
improved and back on SC insulin (glargine and sliding scale).
[**Last Name (un) **] consult obtained for recommendations.
.
#. Hypernatremia: Likely the result of poor access to free water
due to mental status with component of osmotic diuresis from
hyperglycemia. Initially given normal saline, then half normal.
Improved steadily and now within normal range.  Lasix held.
.
#. UTI: Initially treated broadly with vanc/zosyn; now on Cipro
(start abx [**2166-4-4**])
She will continue on cipro for 2 more doses following discharge.

.
# Leukocytosis. Known UTI would likely explain. Negative for
C.diff x 2.  Improved to 11K by discharge.  Intermittently with
low fevers (<101) during admission without evidence of
additional infection.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Not documented any on past history and
ECG tracings are poor quality. In ICU was as fast as 130s though
there are no tracings avaiable. Now back in sinus.  Aspirin had
been started given initial concern for ACS (see below); she can
continue this for now and risks/benefits of anticoagulation can
be discussed in the future with her primary care team.
Diltiazem continued.
.
#. Hypoxia: Inially hypoxic on room air at nursing home to 80's,
briefly requring NRB in ED. CXR in ED without evidence of
infiltrate. No ABG. Now stable on home O2 regimen. Episode
likely due to profound lethargy with electrolyte abnormalities.
Also with persistently high respiratory rate since admission
though does not appear particularly distressed.  Her home COPD
meds were continued, as well as oxygen at 2L, which she should
continue once back at her nursing home.
.
# ECG changes.  On presentation had lateral ST depressions and
troponin elevation (though <0.1) which was flat (also in setting
of renal failure).  Aspirin started.  On heparin gtt in the unit
until MI ruled out enzymatically.  No chest pain.
.
#. Bells Palsy: In the setting of DKA/HHS heldsteroids. Did not
restart given lack of strong evidence for use of prednsione
alone in Bells Palsy.
.
#. COPD: Continued fluticasone, albuterol and iptratropium.
.
#. CHF: Echo with normal EF; not overloaded one exam. Held
lasix.  Edema particularly involving upper extremities.  Had
discussion with family and guardian re: further workup, after
talking with them held off on further testing (?upper extremity
venous drainage problem).
.
#. Dementia/?bipolar: Stable; on depakote and abilify
#. Hypertension: Continued diltiazem. Well controlled.
#. H/O breast cancer: on Femara.
#. Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine.
.
# FEN: Speech and swallow recommending nectar thickened liquids
and puree; encouraged PO.
