HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old female
with a complex past medical history notable for renal
transplant x3 following development of end stage renal
disease secondary to glomerulonephritis, hepatitis C,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%,
status post gastric bypass and cholecystectomy in [**2133-8-2**] who was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**] in Plastic
Surgery clinic for management of excessive skin in the arms
bilaterally secondary to significant weight loss.  The
patient was subsequently scheduled for an elective
brachioplasty bilaterally to take place on [**2134-11-4**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hepatitis C
2.  Status post diabetes mellitus secondary to medications
which the patient reports resolved spontaneously in [**2132-11-2**].
3.  Status post bypass and cholecystectomy in [**2133-7-3**]
which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome
and bacteremia.
4.  Obesity
5.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%
6.  Status post Perm-A-Cath placement x10 years
7.  Hypertension

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 10 mg qd
2.  Prilosec 20 mg qd
3.  Multivitamin qd
4.  Neurontin 300 mg [**Hospital1 **]
5.  Prograf 2 mg [**Hospital1 **]
6.  Hydroxyzine 25 mg q hs
7.  B12 1000 mg qd
8.  Diltiazem SR 120 mg [**Hospital1 **]

ALLERGIES:  SULFONAMIDES, VANCOMYCIN AND DERIVATIVES,
GENTAMICIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, CEFAZOLIN, BENADRYL

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2134-11-4**], the patient underwent
an elective bilateral brachioplasty.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well with an estimated 250 cc of blood loss
intraoperatively; 1400 cc of crystalloid given
intraoperatively.  In the Recovery Room, the patient was
noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs but demonstrated
decreased urine output on the order of 10 to 15 cc per hour
for seven to eight hours.  The patient was subsequently
administered one 500 cc normal saline bolus and two 250 cc
one half normal saline boluses with little effect on urine
output.

A renal consult obtained in the recovery area recommended
continued fluid boluses on the order of 250 cc per time
titrated to effect.  A renal transplant consult obtained in
the Recovery Room recommended restarting the patient's
prednisone dose as scheduled and concurred with renal
recommendations, titrate fluid boluses to good effect.  Of
note, the patient was also noted in the Recovery Area to be
in sinus bradycardia consistent with past electrocardiograms
with an average heart rate ranging in the low 40s.  Also of
note, renal function studies obtained in the Recovery Area
demonstrated no evidence of renal failure, but did suggest a
prerenal picture consistent with diminished renal perfusion.
Renal study results were as follows - sodium 138, potassium
4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 23, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1,
glucose 132.  Cardiac enzyme studies were negative for
evidence for myocardial ischemia and electrocardiogram
studies were negative for any signs of acute ischemic
changes, but were notable for sinus bradycardia.

Postoperatively, the patient received pain coverage via
morphine sulfate prn and Vicodin prn.  The patient remained
in the Recovery Room until [**11-6**], at which point she
was transferred to the floor for further care.  The patient
was subsequently admitted to the plastic surgery service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**].  While on the
floor, the patient remained independently productive of
adequate amounts of urine with no further need for additional
fluid boluses and was able to have her Foley catheter
discontinued on postoperative day #3 without complication.
She remained bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40s to 50s
the duration of her stay.

On postoperative day #4, [**2134-11-8**], the patient was
noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs.  Her right and
left upper extremity dressing was noted to be clean, dry and
intact.  Her incisions were noted to be clear of erythema or
drainage with intact sutures.  The patient continued,
however, to complain of pain not well controlled via Vicodin.
An acute pain service consult was therefore obtained given
the patient's reported history of severe itching in response
to opioid medications.  The acute pain service recommended
pain control via Ultram 50 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn in
conjunction with acetaminophen 500 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn.
The patient's Vicodin was subsequently discontinued.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient also received consult via
occupational therapy who deemed the patient unfit for
discharge to home and recommended further care in a monitored
setting.  The patient was therefore deemed ready for
discharge to an extended care facility for further care and
instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is to be discharged to an
extended care facility with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Gabapentin 300 mg po bid
2.  Tacrolimus 2 mg po bid
3.  Morphine sulfate 2 mg IV q4h prn
4.  Diltiazem ER 120 mg po bid
5.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po q 24 hours
6.  Prednisone 10 mg po qd
7.  Hydroxyzine 50 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn
8.  Tramadol 50 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn
9.  Acetaminophen 500 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn

FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to maintain her arm
dressings clean and dry with regular Xeroform and dry sterile
gauze dressing changes per day.  The patient may shower, but
should pat dry all incisions.  Activity as tolerated.  Ultram
and Tylenol for pain as needed.  The patient is to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**] in Plastic Surgery clinic next week
following discharge.  The patient is to call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 102612**] to
schedule an appointment.
