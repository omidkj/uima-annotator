History of Present Illness:
37 yo M with PMH of DM ([**Last Name (un) 5487**] insulin dosing) who presented to
the ED after reportedly being found injecting heroin in the
bathroom at [**University/College 5130**]. Brought in by EMS, initial FS 300s. In
the ED, initial vs were Temp:98.8 HR:106 BP:88/72 Resp:12
O(2)Sat:92. Physical exam with somnolence awakening to voice and
diffuse ronchi throughout. Labs concerning for renal failure
with Cr 2.4 and WBC 12.7 with 19 bands. CXR with diffuse right
sided process. Patient was given Naloxone, Ondansetron,
Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Vancomycin 1g, Haldol 5 mg IV, Lorazepam
2 mg IV x 4. Blood cultures were obtained prior to antibiotics.
Patient then became more combative and was refusing antibiotics
or further lab draws when awake, but quickly become more
somnolent with decreased respiratory rate. Given concern for
poor respiratory status with risk of the patient not protecting
his airway, he was intubated. Right external jugular line was
then placed. Repeat CXR revealed worsening of the process
involving his right lung. Given 5 L (6th hanging) with SBP 95 so
femoral line was placed to start vasopressors. On Propofol gtt
on transfer (initially given Midazolam 5mg / Fentanyl 200 mg but
patient still agitated, not sedated).
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

Pertinent Results:
TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-1-31**] at 1:58:07 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate sized (0.8cm2) mass
in the left ventricular tract (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]), which is a possible
vegetation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal biventricular systolic function. A possible vegetation is
present in the left ventricular outflow tract, recommend
transesophageal echocardiography to further assess

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT	Study Date of
[**2138-2-3**] 10:46 AM
FINDINGS: No previous images. The acromioclavicular and
glenohumeral joints are well maintained. No evidence of acute
bone or joint space abnormality.  Visualized portion of the left
lung is clear.

TEE (Complete) Done [**2138-2-4**] at 2:52:14 PM
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular masses or vegetations identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
37 yo M with PMH of polysubstance abuse and diabetes, presenting
with heroin overdose and decreased respiratory rate, intubated
in the ED for continued poor respiratory effort combined with
combativeness and inability to protect airway.

# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in the emergency
department for inability to protect airway and combativeness and
transferred to the ICU.  Patient was found to have a pneumonia
most likely from aspiration on Chest X-ray.  He was initially
started on vancomycin and unasyn for concerns of aspiration and
MRSA.  He was extubated without incident on [**2138-1-31**], was found to
be stable on room air, and transferred to the general medicine
floor for further managment.  CXR repeated on the floor
