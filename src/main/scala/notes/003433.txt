Mr. [**Known lastname 68921**] is a 76-year-old gentleman who had a syncopal
episode and was found to have ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm at [**Hospital3 **] where he was brought to while
being extremely hypotensive. He was intubated while at [**Hospital3 21232**] and medflighted to the [**Hospital1 188**] for emergent care. He was immediately taken to the
operating room upon arrival for open abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair and the aneurysm was repaired with a 16 mm
Dacron tube graft but the abdomen was left open secondary to
significant edema. The patient had a prolonged postoperative
course in the intensive care unit which is summarized as
follows: Neurologically, the patient remained sedated with
periods of pharmacologic paralysis throughout his
postoperative ICU course for mechanical ventilatory support.
In terms of his respiratory status, the patient developed
ARDS and subsequent prolonged respiratory failure precluding
any weaning from the ventilator. His course was also
complicated by postoperative atrial fibrillation for which
the cardiology service was consulted and followed. On
postoperative day 2, the patient was taken to the operating
room for an abdominal exploration and was also noted to have
acalculous cholecystitis for which he underwent a
cholecystectomy. Given the significant amount of intra-
abdominal edema, there was concern that abdominal compartment
syndrome would develop so the abdomen was left open. The
general surgical service was consulted and subsequently
performed an abdominal washout and component separation with
hernia repair with mesh in order to attempt to get his
abdomen closed. This was not successful. At the time, his
abdomen remained open throughout his hospitalization. Mr.
[**Known lastname 68922**] renal function deteriorated to the point of acute
renal failure. The nephrology service was consulted but,
given his multiorgan system failure, it was felt that the
patient should be made comfort measures only after discussion
with the family. Therefore, hemodialysis was not instituted.
The patient was made comfort measures only and, on [**2158-10-7**], he expired at 10:13 a.m. with the family present.
Causes of death were essentially multiorgan system failure
and shock secondary to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
with progressive respiratory  and renal failure.
