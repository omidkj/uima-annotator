Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
status-post fall
Reason for MICU admission: anemia, hyperkalemia, acute renal
failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74 yo male from nursing facility with a h/o
schizoaffective disorder, HTN, DM II, CRF, anemia, and prior CVA
in [**2109**] who was brought to the ED s/p an unwitnessed fall today
with laceration on his left forehead. Pt reports fall
precipitated by vertigo, which he has had episodically for
several years. These are often associated with tinnitis and last
for minutes, up to a half hour; not positional. Poor historian
but denies any chest pain preceding this episode. Does describe
urinary incontinence after fall. Unclear whether he had any loss
of consciousness or confusion. Denies any tonic clonic
movements. Review of records shows prior admission in [**2-1**] for
dizziness more suggestive of lightheadedness. On Neuro f/u, EEG
at that time not notable for seizure activity, consistent with a
remote history of occipital stroke.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.7, P 41, BP 88/40, RR 16, O2sat
97RA. Pt was given atropine 0.5mg IV on arrival with improvement
to SBP 100 and HR 50s. On exam, he was initially oriented only
to self, hospital, and year but improved to [**Hospital1 18**] and month when
higher BP. Exam notable for slightly larger left pupil; neuro
exam otherwise intact. Guaiac negative. Labs notable for Hct 23
from baseline 27 in [**7-4**], Na 133, K 8.3, FSG 468. No anion gap
but lactate 3.3. No ketonia. EKG without signs of hyperkalemia.
CT head and c-spine unremarkable. CT abdomen/pelvis without
evidence of bleed. Pt received a total of 3L IV fluids with
improvement in Na to 136. Also given calcium gluconate and
kayexalate 60mg for hyperkalemia with improvement to K 6.9.
Given 10 units of regular insulin and started on insulin gtt at
5 units/hr with improvement to FSG 243. One unit of pRBC hung
prior to transfer to MICU. VS on transfer: T 98, HR 56, BP
135/52, RR 17, O2sat 100.
.
On the floor, pt currently complaining of pain at site of
laceration as well as mild vertigo.
.

CXR [**2119-8-13**]: No acute intrathoracic process. Limited study.
.
CXR [**2119-8-14**]: There is interval development of right lung
consolidation, mostly involving the right lower lobe, but also
affecting the right upper lobe, extensive and given its rapid
development might be consistent with interval aspiration. The
left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable.
.
CXR [**2119-8-16**]: There is interval improvement in the right basilar
opacity which currently right perihilar lower lung abnormality
demonstrated that might be consistent with resolution of massive
aspiration giving complete absence of the abnormalities on [**8-13**], [**2119**], radiograph and its rapid development on [**2119-8-14**]
radiograph. The left lung is clear as well as the right upper
lung.  Healed fractures of the left ribs are unchanged in
appearance. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2119-8-20**]: There is improved aeration bilaterally. There is no
focal
infiltrate. There is a small right effusion.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2119-8-13**]: 1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.  2. Trace
free pelvic fluid, of uncertain etiology.  3. Vascular
atherosclerotic calcifications.  4. Fatty infiltration of the
liver.
.
CT head [**2119-8-13**]: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No
fracture.
2. Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and partial
opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
.
CT cervical spine [**2119-8-13**]: 1. No fracture or malalignment of the
cervical spine. Multilevel degenerative changes. 2. Subcutaneous
cystic lesion of the posterior left neck - ? sebacious cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Syncope s/p fall:  The patient presented to the hospital
after syncopizing, falling, and hitting his head.  Non-contrast
head CT showed no evidence of bleed.  CT C-spine showed no
fracture or malalignment.  The patient's syncopal episode
occurred in the setting of dizziness/vertigo.  Given the
patient's known vertebrobasilar disease and the left carotid
bruit observed on exam, the question of vertebrobasilar
insufficiency was raised.  Differential diagnosis included
Meniere's disease, vasovagal, orthostasis (in the setting of
dehydration), or arrhythmia (in the setting of hyperkalemia).
The patient was monitored on telemetry, which initially showed
bradycardia to 30s.  Followed correction of hyperkalemia,
telemetry showed normal sinus rhythm with frequent premature
ventricular
