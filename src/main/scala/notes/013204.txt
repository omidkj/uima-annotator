Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

[**2162-9-6**] Four Vessel CABG(left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending, vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse marginal
and posterior descending artery)
Superficial sharp debridement of distal portion of sternal wound
([**9-21**])


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31394**] is a 68 year old female with worsening shortness
of breath, and abnormal stress test. She underwent cardiac
catheterization in [**2162-7-18**] which revealed severe three vessel
coronary artery disease. LV gram was notable for for an ejection
fraction of 45-50% with trivial mitral regurgitation. Abdominal
aortography showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm which involved
the renal arteries. Based upon the above, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
-Coronary Artery Disease
-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
-Hypertension
-Peripheral Vascular Disease - prior stenting Left Lower
Extremity
-Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
-Hysterectomy


Social History:
Heavy smoker, over 2 packs per day for 50 years, quit
approximately 3 months prior to admission. She denies ETOH. She
is retired and lives with her daughter.

Family History:
Brother with MI at age 72

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 144/69, 96 beats per min, resp 14, sat 97% RA
General: WDWN female in NAD
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits noted
Lungs: CTA bilaterally, occasional wheezing noted
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur or rub
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema
Pulses: 1+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2162-9-6**] ECHO
Pre bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left
ventricle is not well seen. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF 45%. MR
remains mild.
Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**2162-9-10**] CT Scan
IMPRESSION: Small quantity of retrosternal fluid; amount is
within the range that can be seen in the early postoperative
stage; however, if there is high suspicious of infection, direct
sampling of fluid may be helpful.
Multifocal ground glass opacities likely due to mild fluid
overload.
Localized dehiscence of the sternum at the most distal fragment
with separation of 1 cm. Incompletely imaged aneurysmal
dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Patient is
post-CABG. Native coronary arteries are heavily calcified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31394**] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, she
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. On
postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. She weaned from inotropic support
without difficulty. Low dose beta blockade was initiated while
Aspirin and Plavix therapy were resumed. She was transfused with
PRBC to maintain hematocrit near 30%. Her CSRU course was
otherwise uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day three. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 31394**] developed a sternal click following several days
of coughing. A CT scan was obtained which showed a mild
localized dehiscence of the sternum at the most distal fragment
with separation of 1 cm. The remainder of her sternum was intact
and stable. Strict sternal precautions were implemented and
zosyn was started for antibiotic coverage. This was
discontinued, and PO Levofloxacin was started.  She has remained
afebrile.  The distal portion of her sternal wound was
superficially debrided at the bedside on [**2162-9-21**].  Mrs. [**Known lastname 31394**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
[**2162-9-21**]. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.
