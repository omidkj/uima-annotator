Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for respiratory distress, concern for ARDS.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
47 year-old woman with past medical history of tobacco abuse,
hemochromatosis transferred from OSH with respiratory distress.
The patient had abdominoplasty and liposuction of waist and neck
at [**Hospital3 **] on the [**2184-9-7**] (1L removed). Procedure was
reportedly uncomplicated but pt was slow to awake from sedation.
 She was successfully extubated later that day and admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] for observation.  The patient was cleared for
discharge [**2184-9-8**] but the patient opted to stay for improved
pain control.  Her oxygen saturations unexpectedly dropped the
next day the 80s on room air and she required admission to MICU.
 Chest x-ray and CTA showed bilateral pneumonitis and RLL
pneumonia but was negative for pulmonary embolus or evidence of
CHF.  The patient was treated with solumedrol, bronchodilators,
and zosyn.   The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
The patient states the SOB developed gradually during her
hospitalization.  The patient complains of cough productive of
small amounts of white sputum.  Denies fevers, chills, chest
pain, calf pain.  Home in [**Doctor Last Name 6641**] with exposure to ticks but does
not recall tick bite.  The patient states she had a stress test
within the year that was negative for reversible ischemia.  The
patient may have had pulmonary function testing within the year
but is unaware of the results.
.
ROS: As above. Otherwise negative for abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, melena, BRBPR, dysuria, hematuria.


Past Medical History:
Hemochromatosis; phlebotomy at least twice annually
Hyperlipidemia
GERD

34 years but quit one week prior.  Rare alcohol use, 3 drinks
per month.

Family History:

disease due to smoking," DVT.  Father with hemochromatosis,
gout.

Physical Exam:
VS: T: 98.8 BP: 137/29 HR: 97 RR: 25 Sat: 96% on NRB FiO2 1
(although mask does not form seal secondary to bandaging)
Gen: Comfortable appearing woman in mild respiratory distress
but speaking comfortably
HEENT: NC/AT, sclera anicteric, conjunctiva pink, PERRL, OP
clear
Neck: Supple, no LAD, no JVD
CV: RRR, no m/r/g
Resp: Good air flow, crackles bilateral bases, scattered
expiratory wheezes throughout, increased expiratory phase
Abdomen: Bandaging in place, NT, ND, +BS
Ext: No c/c/e. DP pulses/radial 2+ bilaterally
Neuro: A + O x3, CN II-XII grossly intact
Skin: No rashes, lesions.

Pertinent Results:
OSH chest x-ray [**2184-9-11**]: Diffuse bilateral airspace disease.
No cardiac enlargement to suggest CHF.  Severe bilateral
pneumonitis versus ARDS
.
OSH CTA [**2184-9-9**]: Severe bilateral alveolar lung disease.
Significant consolidation RLL with air bronchograms.  Moderate
consolidation LLL with air bronchograms.  No pleural effusions.
.
ECG: NSR.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 year-old woman with past medical history of tobacco abuse,
hemochromatosis transferred from OSH with acute respiratory
distress, hypoxia s/p post-abdominoplasty and liposuction.
.
1) Hypoxia/respiratory distress: exact etiology unclear.  CXR
notable for bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
Differential included pneumonia (aspiration, less likely
community acquired), ARDS (?secondary to infection, fat
embolus).  Outside hospital had already ruled out PE.  Though
she does not have known COPD, she is a smoker so COPD could also
have played a component but unlikely to be the precipitant for
these findings.

She was treated for presumed pneumonia and covered with
levofloxacin/flagyl, treated with nebs. She improved overnight
[**9-11**] and was able to wean off high flow oxygen. CXR much
improved [**9-12**], likely due to diuresis of negative 1 liter.  She
had no signs or symptoms for infection/sepsis from other source.
 No history of blood transfusion.  Given her clinical
improvement, steroids (started at OSH) were discontinued.

She was transferred to the floor without event and gradually
weaned off oxygen successfully.  She is now able to maintain her
sats on RA though she does get mildly dyspneic with ambulation.
She will complete a 10 day course of antibiotics as outpatient.

2) s/p liposuction, abdominoplasty and chin tuck
Her incisions appeared clean and healing well.  Two abdominal JP
drains still remain, draining very minimal serosanguinous fluid.
 She will f/u tomorrow with her plastic surgeon and anticipate
that the drains can be removed.

3) Mild transaminitis: her LFTs were notable for mild AST/ALT
elevation in the 100s.   Unlikely due to sepsis as her levels
did not change with resolution of her acute respiratory distress
and clinicaly recovery.  Unclear if she has had LFT
abnormalities in the past.  She does have a hx of
hemochromatosis but she believes her labs have been normal
previously.  She had no physical exam findings to suggest
chronic liver disease.  She was instructed to f/u with her PCP
regarding this at her next appointment.

4) Depression: continue zoloft

5) Hemochromatosis: Patient is phlebotomized twice yearly and
will follow-up with her PCP
