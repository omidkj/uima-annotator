History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with a history of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma diagnosed on [**6-/2126**] on day 15 of cycle [**5-24**] of
MR-CHOP. He was recently admitted between [**2126-10-25**] and [**2126-11-3**]
for febrile neutropenia. During that admission he underwent
chest CT which showed a left lung nodular interstial pattern
predominantly in the left upper lobe and persistent, but
improved opacity of the right lung compared to [**Month (only) 359**]. He
underwent bronchoscopy on [**10-29**] which demonstrated normal
appearing airways and cultures including AFB, fungal and viral
cultures have been negative to date. He was treated empirically
with vancomycin, cefepime, levfoloxacin and voriconazole for
febrile neutropenia until his counts returned and was discharged
on levofloxacin and voriconazole which were discontinued on
[**11-8**] and he was started on fluconazole and bactrim. He was
admitted again from [**2126-11-15**] to [**2126-11-19**] for his final cycle of
chemotherapy which he tolerated well. His counts nadired on
[**2126-11-19**] and returned by [**2126-11-22**].

The patient reports that he was feeling well at home until
[**2126-11-22**] when he developed fevers to 101.8 at home with
worsening fatigue. The fever was not associated with any
localizing symptoms at that time. He was not experiencing nasal
congestion, rhinorrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
swelling. He was initially admitted to the [**Month/Day/Year 3242**] service for his
fevers on [**2126-11-23**]. Chest CT performed on the day of admission
showed a new interstitial infiltrate in the right upper lobe on
a background of predominantly upper lobe emphysematous change
compared to the CT of one month prior which was felt to be
concerning for atypical infection. He was started on
levofloxacin. At 1:15 AM on [**2126-11-25**] the oncology moonlighter
was called for 20 minutes of right sided sqeezing chest pain
while in bed. It was not exertional but did worsen with deep
inspiration. Not associated with nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath. He was tachycardic at the time to 120 and was satting
93% on RA. EKG was without ischemic changes. Cardiac enzymes
were negative x two sets. Repeat CXR showed right sided opacity
which was new compared to [**2126-11-15**]. He subsequently triggered on
the floor at 4AM for decreased oxygen saturations to 87% on RA
and persistent fevers. Oxygen saturations improved to 97% with
2L. His antibiotics were broadened at that time to vancomycin
and cefepime. He triggered again at 5 PM for hypotension to the
90s systolic with persistent fevers. Pressures improved to
baseline of 100s without fluid bolus. The decision was made to
transfer him to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and possible
bronchoscopy.

On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he reports that he continues to have
fevers and right sided chest pain which is worse with
inspiration. He has a mild dry cough but no sputum production.
No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
dysuria, hematuria or leg pain. All other review of systems
negative in detail. No known sick contacts although he was
exposed to two young children on the day of presentation.


Past Medical History:
1. Stage 4b diffuse large B-cell lymphoma diagnosed in [**7-/2126**]
after he was admitted to the ICU with pericardial effusion s/p
pericardial window for tamponade physiology. He is now s/p [**5-24**]
cycles of MR-CHOP.
2. Strep viridans bacteremia
- 1 bottle; PICC-associated?
- ceftriaxone/PCN/ceftriaxone x4 weeks total
3. DVTs, on lovenox
4. Erythema nodosum, right forearm ([**8-/2126**])
5. Nephrolithiasis s/p cystoscopy 7-8 years ago
6. s/p amputation of right 2nd digit after electrical accident
45 years ago
The patient presented to an outside hospital in [**6-25**] with a
30-pound weight loss over the prior 6months. He was found to
have a soft tissue mass in the cardiac ventricles involving the
myocardium and extending into the interatrial septum. In
addition, he was noted to have multiple pulmonary nodules,
bilateral pleural effusions, a pericardial effusion, large
bilateral adrenal masses, and diffuse soft tissue masses
involving both kidneys. Due to development of tamponade
physiology, a pericardial window was placed. A renal biopsy
revealed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The
proliferation fraction was 90-95%. He was diffusely
immunoreactive for CD20 and co-expressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-6. CD43,
CD5, TdT, Bcl-1, S100 were negative. LMP for EBV was negative.
CD10 and CD30 were weekly expressed. In addition, a bone marrow
biopsy demonstrated bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. CHOP
chemotherapy was initiated on [**2126-7-26**] followed high-dose
methotrexate on [**2126-8-9**]. He has recently completed [**5-24**] cycles
of MR-CHOP.

Social History:
The patient is married and has one son. [**Name (NI) **] is a former engineer
who recently worked as a night custodian. He has a history of
smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years
until just prior to his diagnosis of lymphoma in [**2126-6-18**], when
he quit due to symptoms of profound weakness. He drinks two
alcoholic drinks per month. He enjoys playing golf. HE has 1
son, who is healthy (and [**Name8 (MD) **] MD).


Family History:
The patient's father died as a young man from a gunshot wound.
His mother died in her 70s from diabetes and heart disease. He
has two brothers one had prostate cancer.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2126-12-18**] EEG - IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal routine portable EEG
in the awake and sleeping states due to the modest slowing of
the background
and infrequent bursts of generalized theta slowing. These
findings
suggest excessive drowsiness or a mild encephalopathy due to
metabolic
abnormalities, medications or infection. There are no clear
lateralizeded or epileptiform features.
.
[**2126-12-15**] Immunophenotyping of CSF - RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. Due to paucicellular nature of the
specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine B-cell
clonality. CD19-positive B-cells are extremely scant in number
precluding evaluation of clonality.
INTERPRETATION
Non-diagnostic study.  Cell marker analysis was attempted, but
was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of
lymphoid cells for analysis.  Correlation with clinical findings
and morphology is recommended.
.
[**2126-12-13**]
MRI/MRA head and neck
IMPRESSION: No significant change or new findings compared with
[**2126-7-18**]. Specifically no acute infarct is seen or enhancing
brain lesion identified.
.
MRA NECK: The 2D time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels
demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in
the carotid or vertebral arteries. The examination is slightly
limited by motion
