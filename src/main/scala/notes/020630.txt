Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64yo man with HIV, Hepatitis C, DM2, ESRD on HD who
presents with fever, rigors, purulent drainage from HD cath,
tachycardia and growing staph aureus from his original catheter
site.

1.  Bacteremia--Patient was pan cultured, given empiric
vancomycin and gent sent to the ICU for further monitoring.
Given that he had frank purulent discharge at his HD access site
this was thought to be the most likely source inducing sepsis
and IR was able to remove the catheter and culture the tip.
This catheter tip and his first set of blood cultures grew out
MRSA.  Serial cultures were obtained on [**7-26**] and 24 and
have been negative or NGTD as of this dictation.  A TTE was
obtained which showed no signs of valvular vegetations and he
had no peripheral stigmata suggestive of endocarditis.  The
patient defervesced on hospital day #3 and remained afebrile for
the rest of the hospitalization.  His gentamycin was stopped
after two doses and he has remained on vancomycin for a 14 day
course (last dose would be on [**8-6**]).  The vancomycin dose has
been titrated by level given his ESRD and his most recent dose
was 1.5gm given after HD on [**8-1**].  His next dose is due on [**8-3**].


2. ESRD on HD--patient had his prior R femoral line removed by
IR and a subsequent Left groin temporary HD cath was placed for
interim.  The patient remained afebrile on vancomycin with
subsequent negative blood cultures and a tunneled catheter was
placed on [**7-31**] without complications.

3. HTN:  The pt's BP was initially low on admission secondary to
sepsis and his toprol was held and then added back at a lower
dose.  He is to resume his outpatient

4. DM: continue sliding scale insulin as that is what he is on
at home.

5. Hyperlipidemia: Continued on atorvastatin.

6. HIV: last CD4 614 [**4-14**], likely not at risk for opportunistic
infection but appears was inadvertently d/c'd on 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
indinavir (rather than usual dose of 800mg [**Hospital1 **]) since mid [**Month (only) **].
He was continued on his prior regimen ofindinavir, stavudine,
lamivudine. Consider rechecking CD4 when acute illness improved.


7. History of thrombosis--patient was previously on coumadin
prior to arrival however this was held on admission for line
placement and he was bridged with heparin IV by sliding scale.
Coumadin was restarted
