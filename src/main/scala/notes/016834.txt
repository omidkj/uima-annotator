ASSESSMENT:  This is a woman who was found to have rectal
cancer and incidentally found to have lung cancer.  She
underwent treatment for her lung cancer and is now back for
resection of her rectal cancer.

PREOPERATIVE EXAMINATION:  She appeared well and had recently
lost approximately 40 pounds, though is still quite
overweight.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat were
normal.  Her neck was supple without masses, nodes or
thyromegaly.  Her chest is clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Her heart sounds revealed no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft without tenderness, mass or
organomegaly.  She had midline scars as well as an old
colostomy scar, however, there is no obvious hernia though a
very thin abdominal wall.  Her extremities showed trace
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was brought into the hospital on
[**2128-11-4**] and underwent a low anterior resection with
take down of the splenic flexure and omental flap to the
pelvis, a diverting ileostomy, repair of incisional hernia
and lysis of adhesions.  Intraoperatively she received 10
liters of intravenous Crystalloids, 2 units of packed red
blood cells, and had an estimated blood loss of 1 liter.  Her
urine output initially in the Operating Room was adequate,
however, postoperatively drifted off without response to
fluid resuscitation.  Her vital signs and CVP remained [**Doctor Last Name **]
solid, therefore after being kept intubated in an Intensive
Care Unit setting on postoperative day one she was started on
renal dosed Dopamine in an attempt to increase urine output.
This, however, was not successful and from that point on she
was diuresed with good results.  Her diuresis continued
throughout her hospital stay.  By postoperative day four she
was ready for _______________ and on postoperative day five
with her ostomy being viable and some gas in stool from the
stoma she was started on clears.  Her diet was advanced and
by postoperative day seven she was tolerating a regular diet.
She had some tachycardia throughout her hospital stay,
however, by postoperative day eight her heart rate instead of
being in the 90s was in the one teens.  Cardiology was
consulted and she underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram.
The echocardiogram revealed a good ejection fraction with no
wall motion abnormalities.  She did have a calcified mitral
valve.  Cariology had no further recommendations other then
the Lopressor she was already receiving.  Other issues during
this period of time were pulmonary toilet.  She had very
coarse breath sounds, but was diligent with her incentive
spirometry and ambulation and her oxygen saturations slowly
climbed.

Her final issues is some serous fluid discharge from her
wound site.  This appears to be from a seroma collection and
is currently being followed with dressing changes.  At the
time of discharge she is tolerating a regular diet.  She is
ambulating well, however, needs some further care for
pulmonary toilet, physical therapy and general medical care,
therefore she will be discharged to rehabilitation.
