Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to left anterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
80-year-old male with history of hypertension, TIA, EtOH abuse
presents from orthopedics preop for hip surgery with EKG changes
concerning STEMI.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until a couple
weeks prior to presentation. At that time he had intermittent
"fleeting" upper chest burning, which radiation to the jaw,
worse with exertion and quickly improved with rest. Over the
last 2 days the patient states the burning discofort has gotten
worse. He attributed the pain to "heartburn" although denies
prior symptoms of GERD and there was no relationship to eating.
He took prilosec without relief. He also notes fatigue and
insomnia. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or SOB. He
also notes some left scapular pain "twinges" associated with
movement during these episodes.
.
In the ED a code STEMI was called. The patient was given 600mg
PO plavix, heparin bolus and gtt, aspirin and atorvastatin. In
the cath lab they found a chronically occluded RCA, mid-LAD
lesion treated with BMS, LCx with moderate disease. The patient
was admitted to the CCU.

Pertinent Results:
[**2143-2-4**] cardiac catherization:

1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LAD was
diffusely disease proximally wiht a 40% stenosis.  The mid LAD
was 100%
occluded just following a large first diagonal branch.  The LCx
had a
60% mid vessel and an 80% distal vessel stenosis.  The RCA had a
100%
proximal stenosis and filled distally via left to right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
sided
filling pressure wiht PCWP 21 mmHg and mild pulmonary systolic
arterial
hypertension PASP 38 mmHg.  The cardiac index was mildly
depressed at
2.0 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
4.  Successful PCI of the mid-LAD with a 2.5x18mm Vision bare
metal
stent.
5.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a
Perclose device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful PCI of the LAD with BMS.

[**2143-2-5**] Echo:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal septum,
anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
LAD myocardial infarction. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-7-5**],
regional ventricular dysfunction is new. Estimated pulmonary
artery pressures are lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
80-year-old male with history of hypertension, TIA, EtOH abuse
presents with STEMI s/p BMS to mid-LAD.
.
# STEMI: The patient presented with diffuse coronary artery
disease including a total occlusion of RCA, which appeared
chronic in nature, mid-LAD lesion and diffuse LCx disease. The
patient had a BMS placed in mid-LAD lesion without
complications. CE were elevated with a CK 629, MB 44, TropT
2.40. Peak CK was 629, peak troponin was 4.47.  New wall motion
abnormality consistent with LAD disease, EF [**Month (only) **] to 35%. A1C was
normal. Lipid panel with LDL 91. The patient was started on
plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril.  Due
to apical akinesis found on the echo, the patient was also
started on coumadin with a lovenox bridge.
.
# Hypertension: The patient's norvasc and doxazosin were
discontinued.
.
# Xanax abuse/distant EtOH abuse: The patient was placed on a
CIWA scale with valium as needed.  He did not require any
benzodiazepine coverage while in house.
.
# Osteoarthritis: The patient had joint pain from
osteoarthritis. He is being evaluated by orthopedics for surgery
as outpatient. He was given morphine on arrival to the floor for
pain control.  This was changed to oxycodone as per his home
regimen.
