History of Present Illness:
This is 73-year-old white woman with a past medical history for
at least 30 pack years of smoking who originally presented to
[**Hospital3 **] Emergency department, on [**2157-6-9**], for worsening
dyspnea that occurred over the course of one month. The patient
is a poor historian, but her son reports that she started to
cough up blood 24 hours prior to being admitted to the OSH. At
the OSH, a chest CT showed a distal tracheal mass with lumen
narrowed to 4 mm, bilateral lung nodules and hilar
lymphadenopathy. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work up. Following a transbronchial biopsy on [**2157-6-11**],
pathology preliminary report suspects small cell lung cancer.
.
The Oncology service was consulted to make a recommendation on
the management, further work up, and treatment of her disease.
The patient??????s son says that his mother was progressively
struggling to ambulate over the last month. She uses a cane to
walk at baseline; however, over the past month she has moved
slower than usual with her cane. She has [**Last Name **] problem standing up
from a seated position. Prior to the 24 hours preceding her
admission the patient had not experienced any cough, hemoptysis,
dysphagia, or heavy wheezing. She also had not experienced any
gradual symptoms suggestive of SVC syndrome (i.e. facial
swelling, venous distension in the neck, distended veins in the
upper chest and arm, upper limb swelling, lightheadedness, or
cough.). She also endorses RLE weakness and difficulty
ambulating over the past month without any pain in her back or
incontinence like sx.
.
Before transfer to OMED, the patient underwent: Rigid
bronchoscopy, Flexible bronchoscopy, Endobronchial biopsy,
Transbronchial needle aspiration, Balloon dilation, Ultraflex
stent placement, Y-stent placement on [**2157-6-11**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Path
revealed LCA negative, TTF-1 positive, further stainings are
pending, morphologically c/wh small cell lung cancer. A flexible
bronchoscopy was done on [**2157-6-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to assess the
patency of airway stents and for therapeutic suctioning of
secretions. The proximal airway appeared patent. Both silicone
Y-stent as well as the left mainstem metallic stent appeared
patent as well as patency of distal airways in both right and
the left bronchial trees.
.
The patient is currently feeling less short of breath than on
admission, but not at her baseline. Her O2Sats are 90% on RA,
97% on 3LNC while resting in bed. She has not been ambulatory
yet.
