PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical, mid-inferior,
infero-lateral, infero-septal hypokinesis.. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25-30%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including milrinone and
norepinephrine and is being AV paced.
1. Initially RV function and inferior wall severly hypokinetic,
large air pocket in LV. After venting and infusion of inotropes,
function significantly improved.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 79424**]
Reason: assess left effusion



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   70 year old man s/p cabg/pec flap closure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   assess left effusion

Final Report
HISTORY: Status post CABG with pectoral flap closure, to assess
left
effusion.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-1**], there is little
overall change
in the degree of left pleural effusion. Underlying atelectasis
is also seen.
The Dobbhoff tube is coiled within the upper stomach. The
nasogastric tube
appears to extend at least to the second portion of the
duodenum. The right
lung is clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-9**] and completed preop workup which revealed a 70-70%
left carotid stenosis. Underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**7-11**]. Transferred to the CVICU in fair condition. Extubated the
following afternoon. Drips weaned over the course of the next
several days. Went into Afib on POD #3 and amiodarone started,
in addition to beta blockade titration. Had some lingering
confusion/agitation and this was treated with haldol and then
zyprexa. Mild aspiration lead to a bedside swallowing eval.
Ultimately, he was treated for PNA with AV abx. Left pleural
effusion tapped on POD #3. Coumadin started for Afib/ flutter.
PICC line placed POD #7. Tube feeds started.

Developed an unstable sternum on POD #9. Coumadin held and Vit.
K given. Went to OR on POD #10 for sternal debridement, washout
and VAC placement. ID and clinical nutrtion consulted. Evaluated
by plastic surgery and returned to the OR on POD #13 with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 23606**] for debridement/ bilat. pec flap closure of chest.
Extubated again on POD # 18. Repeat swallowing eval done [**7-31**] for
aspiration risk. Dobhoff tube placed [**8-1**] for tube feeds and two
more swallowing evals done prior to being cleared for discharge
to rehab on POD # 26. Pt. continued to improve slowly. Pt. is to
make all followup appts as per discharge instructions.
