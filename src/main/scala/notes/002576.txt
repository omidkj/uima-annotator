very little. She denies weight loss.

    She presented to [**Hospital6 33**] yesterday where labs
were

2.6
from baseline 1.5, uric acid 16.7. LD 1600. Pt received
allopurinol and cefepime. Vital signs were stable apart from
transient desaturation to 80's on RA with rapid improvement to
97% on 2L.  BNP was 5085, she was started on heparin gtt given
concern for
PE. She was transferred to our ICU given concern for leukostasis
with consideration for pheresis.

Past Medical History:

Peripheral smear:
numerous large immature white blood cells with
large nucleoli, some with indented/folded nuclei, few granules
in
cytoplasm, no auer rods seen. Few lymphocytes, eosinophils. RBC
with few burr cells, tear drops. Platelets decreased in number.

IMMAGING:

CXR [**2186-7-20**]:
There is moderate cardiomegaly. Pacemaker leads are in the
standard position in the right atrium and right ventricle. The
lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumonia, pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. There is mild vascular congestion.

TTE [**2186-7-20**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation
around a pacer wire. Normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

CXR [**7-21**]:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-20**], there is little
change.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette persists, though there is no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.

CT Chest w/o contrast
1.  Endotracheal tube tip at the carina coursing towards the
orifice of the
right main stem bronchus.  Retraction is recommended.

2.  Multifocal diffusely distributed bilateral pulmonary nodular
and
ground-glass opacities, consistent with infection.

3.  Coronary artery calcifications.

4.  Catheter in the inferior vena cava, incompletely imaged.
