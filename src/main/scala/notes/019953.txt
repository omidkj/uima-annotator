History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71 y/o female with COPD, DM type II, PUD s/p
Gastro-jejunostomy, mild dementia, and schizophrenia who was
admitted to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital on [**1-22**] with fever to 101 at her
nursing home, decompensated heart failure with hypoxia to 85% on
RA, and MAT. She was complaining of SOB, dysuria, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, weakness, and fatigue. In the ED, she was
bolused and started on diltiazem gtt for MAT and diuresed with
IV Lasix for her CHF. She was started on levaquin for +U/A. Upon
admission, she then became hypotensive to systolic of 70s, so
her dilt gtt was d/c'ed and she was bolused with saline. She was
on neo and vasopressin gtts until [**2189-1-25**] AM. Her abx were
expanded to Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin and hydrocortisone, currently
weaned to 50 q8 (despite [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim of 50.7->73->67.3). She was
subsequently found to have GNRs in her blood and urine cultures,
as well as group B strep in urine. Her course was complicated by
demand ischemia with Trop I peak of 0.85 and ARF with creatinine
peak of 2.08.
.
She was doing well until 48 hours ago. She was found to have
increasing LFTs with TB of 2.6, DB 2.1, alk phos 600 though no
abdominal pain. INR went from 2.1 to 6.5 on [**1-25**], which is now
down to 1.35 after vitamin K. She had a RUQ ultrasound that
showed gallbladder and CBD sludge v. stone v. mass and
associated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.
"This has worsened significantly since [**2188-2-15**]." Pt was
transferred here for GI evaluation and possible ERCP given
complicated anatomy.

----------------
[**1-28**]: RUQ ultrasound
IMPRESSION:
1. Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with common duct
measuring up to 2.8 cm.
2. Pneumobilia, compatible with recent history of ERCP.
3. Multiple stones, air and gallbladder wall thickening, with
pericholecystic fluid. Changes may be secondary to ERCP,
however, CT is recommended for further assessment.
4. Marked splenomegaly.
5. Moderate ascites.
.
[**1-29**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly dilated biliary tree, with the CBD measuring up to
2.2 cm, with a large impacted stone. An underlying infectious
process such as cholangitis cannot be excluded, and is the most
likely septic source.
2. The biliary stent has migrated into the duodenum or proximal
jejunum.
3. Moderate ascites.
4. Nondilated gallbladder with air and sludge and/or old
contrast.
5. No evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Right inferior and superior minimally-displaced rami
fractures of unknown chronicity, with evidence of healing.
.
[**2-2**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate
([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen (cannot exclude). Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. A focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be excluded. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, trace
aortic regurgitation.

[**2-8**], CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Improved biliary dilatation with residual hyupodense areas in
the left lobe which are not well defined or delineated. If
clinically indicated, ultrasound could be considered since these
could represent small fluid collections in the left lobe.
2. Focal pulmonary opacities suggesting multifocal pneumonia.
3. Increased ascites.
4. Prior pelvic fractures.

Abdominal ultrasound, [**2-12**]:
1. No evidence of hepatic abscess.
2. Gallbladder stones and sludge with CBD stent and mild
extrahepatic biliary dilatation; no intrahepatic biliary
dilatation.
3. Ascites.
