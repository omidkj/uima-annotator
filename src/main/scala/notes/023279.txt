the past 4 days. This began on friday and he describes some
difficulty swallowing both solid and liquid foods at that time.
He notes he had a recent URI of nasal congestion and sore throat
last week but this has mostly resolved. His symptoms worsened
friday and into saturday prompting him to go to the ED yesterday
in [**Doctor Last Name **]. There he underwent a CT scan which showed a
large 3x4cm isodense lesion in his hypopharynx, obscuring his
post-cricoid region and situated directly over his posterior
glottis. For this reason he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further workup and care.

Brief Hospital Course:
After transport to [**Hospital1 18**] the Pt was seen by Thoracic surgery in
the ED and was admitted to the SICU for further monitoring. ENT
was consulted to evaluate his airway and upper aerodigestive
tract. At the time of evaluation he complained of dysphagia but
no difficulty breathing. He stated he had not had recent fevers
and
had no neck pain. Endoscopic exam showed a 3x3cm posterior
pharyngeal mass nearly occluding the airway, and the Pt was
therefore taken to the operating room to safely secure his
airway. He underwent awake fiberoptic intubation, direct
laryngoscopy with biopsy, and drainage of the retropharyngeal
cyst on [**2190-7-11**]. The cyst contained dark brown fluid consistent
with hematoma. Please see the operative report for further
details. The Pt was transferred to the PACU in stable condition
and then returned to the SICU for further monitoring. He was
subsequently extubated without difficulty, and reported that the
dysphagia was gone. A follow-up CT of the neck showed resolution
of the retropharngeal cyst. The Pt was eating and drinking
normally and desired discharge. He had no complaints of
dysphagia, respiratory distress, or any other concerns from a
cardiac, pulmonary, GI, or GU standpoint. He was discharged home
on augmentin 875mg [**Hospital1 **] x 10 days.

Imaging:
CT Neck ([**Hospital 794**] Hospital) - 24 x 31 x 18 mm subglottic cystic
mass, above the level of the cords, resulting in narrowing of
the
airway. Possible etiologies include a mass, infection, or
postsurgical seroma/cyst (s/p anterior spinal fusion). No
neighboring lymphadenopathy seen. Direct visualization
recommended for further evaluation.

CT Neck [**7-11**] - The previously described cystic lesion in the
hypopharynx has now
resolved after incision and drainage; only a few locules of gas
are seen
within the evacuated pocket
