Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2185-12-13**] Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to posterior lateral branch

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 y/o man with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD (BMS
to RCA in [**2173**] with in-stent occlusion in [**2184**]), recent GI bleed
likely from ulcer in stomach, and atrial fibrillation, who
presented for EGD prior to CABG.  The patient was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] in [**2185-9-28**] for STEMI in the setting of a GI bleed.
He had a cardiac cath where he was found to have an in-stent
stenosis of his RCA and diffuse 3VD.  The patient also had an
EGD performed prior to his admission in [**Month (only) 359**], which
demonstrated a sliding type hiatal hernia, mild gastritis and an
antral ulcer which had a white, healing base with no active
clots or active bleeding.  It was decided at the time of
discharge that the patient would have an ECG performed before
elective CABG.  The patient states that he has not experienced
any recent chest pain, and he is no longer having melena.  He
has been off Plavix and Coumadin since Monday before this
admission date.
.
On ROS, the patient denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2185-12-9**] BLOOD %HbA1c-6.2*
[**2185-12-9**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. LV systolic function
appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30
percent) secondary to a large posterobasal aneurysm, severe
hypokinesis of the inferior septum, akinesis of the inferior
free wall, and hypokinesis of the lateral wall. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2185-12-9**] Carotid Ultrasound: Right ICA 1-39% stenosis. Tortuous
left ICA with a low end, 40-59% stenosis. Normal vertebral flow.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service. Prior to surgical
revascularization and given his history of GI bleed, he
underwent EGD which found 8mm ulcer in the antrum and only mild
gastritis. EGD was otherwise normal. He remained stable on
medical therapy, and was maintained on Lovenox bridge.
Preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and he was cleared
for surgery.

On [**12-13**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. For surgical details, please see operative note.
Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He initially experienced some hypotension but
gradually weaned from Neo-Synephrine over several days. He
remained in atrial fibrillation. His preoperative medications
were resumed and was eventually restarted on Warfarin.
Antibiotics(Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin) were initiated for
positive H. pylori antibodies on serology. On postoperative day
four, he transferred to the SDU. Cardiology service was
consulted given poorly controlled atrial fibrillation.
Recommendations were to increase beta blockade as tolerated as
Verapamil in contraindicated in the setting of Dofetilide. Over
several days medical therapy was optimized. He continued to make
clinical improvements and was eventually cleared for discharge
to rehab on postoperative day six. Warfarin should be dosed for
goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
