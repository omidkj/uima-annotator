Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/ h/o diastolic CHF, COPD w/ CO2
retention (baseline bicarb approx 35, CO2 approx 60), OSA
(non-compliant with bipap, only on O2 at night) who presented
with dyspnea. She developed DOE approx 4 days pta. She had
increasing somnolence during the day for the prior 2 weeks. She
also reports orthopnea, some peripheral edema, no PND. In the
ED, her vitals were notable for RR 16 and satting 57% on RA,
which increased to 92% on Venturi mask. Subsequent resp rates
noted to be 22, and 30. She received combivent x3, prednisone
60mg, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
.
Patient was admitted to the floor where she was continued on
treatment for PNA/COPD exacerbation and continued on her home
dose of diuresis for a presumed CHF exacerbation. However, she
became increasingly hypoxic, desatting to 82% no 8L, which
improved to 93% following nebs. Her ABG at that time was
7.47/58/41. She then received Lasix and nebs and was transferred
to the ICU for further monitoring.
.
In the MICU, she was treated with steroids and antibiotics for
COPD exacerbation and diuretics (Bumex up to 4). She had BiPAP
but was not intubated. She improved, with O2 sats now at 88% on
1L. She is now transferred back to the floor.
.
ROS: She denies cough, fever/chills, n/v/d, dysuria.

Studies:
 - EKG: Sinus rhythm at 75 bpm with atrial premature beats.
Since the previous tracing of [**2114-2-2**] there is a more dominant P
wave, probably sinus with left atrial abnormality. Since tracing
#1, the rhythm is more regular. Otherwise, features are as
previously noted.
 - CXR [**2114-2-2**]: New small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary congestion.
 - CXR [**2114-2-9**]: Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2-7**], [**2114**].  The heart size is moderately enlarged but stable.
The aorta is calcified.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 The small bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left,
grossly unchanged on the left and slightly increased on the
right being partially loculated. Atelectasis of right middle
opacified lower lobe is
demonstrated, new.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] is a very pleasant [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, and Congestive
Heart Failure who presented with dyspnea on exertion. Her brief
hospital course by problem is as follows:
.
1. COPD. Although she was admitted to the floor, she was quickly
transferred to the MICU as she became increasingly hypoxic on
nasal cannula, and even non-invasive respiratory support did not
normalize her blood gases. She refused BiPAP, but fortunately
improved on nasal cannula. This acute decompensation was thought
secondary to a combination of CHF and COPD (see below for CHF
treatment). Her COPD was treated with methylprednisolone and
then a prednisone taper over two weeks and given standing
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments. Because she is a
chronic CO2 retained, her O2 sats were maintained carefully
between 88 and 91%; above this, she began to become somnolent.
She was also given a course of azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
vancomycin.
.
2. CHF, diastolic. She was fluid overloaded on her admission
exam and her chest film showed pulmonary edema. This
exacerbation was thought to be triggered by a tracheobronchitis.
She was diuresed with Lasix and Bumex initially; just Bumex
after the first 6 days; and then with ethacrynic acid when Bumex
was implicated in her thrombocytopenia. Her volume status
improved and she was continued on Na and fluid restrictions. She
was continued on diltiazem for HR control given her diastolic
dysfunction; lisinopril was deferred. Cardiac enzymes ruled out
an MI.
.
3. Pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired. Her CXR showed a
questionable opacity at the right base. Given her poor
oxygenation, she was treated for pneumonia on this basis.
Ceftriaxone and vancomycin were used given her frequent
hospitalizations. She improved.
.
4. Thrombocytopenia. Hematology was consulted for this problem
and felt it was likely induced by either her Lasix or her Bumex.
Initially, the decline coincided with Lasix, but when she failed
to improve after several days without Lasix, Bumex was thought
to be the problem. She was therefore diuresed with ethacrynic
acid.
.
5. Atrial fibrillation. She was effectively rate controlled with
diltiazem. Her anticoagulation was held given her dramatic
thrombocytopenia.
.
6. Hypertension. Her BP was well controlled with diltiazem and
nifedipine. Her Isordil was discontinued to maximize her
pulmonary perfusion.
.
7. Acute Renal Failure. This was thought secondary to her poor
effective circulating volume. Her elevated creatinine resolved
with diuresis.
.
8. [**Doctor Last Name 933**] s/p thyroid ablation. She was continued on Synthroid.
