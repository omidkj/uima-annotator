abdominal pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87 year old Russian-speaking female with history of
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, blindness, history of
CVA with residual right-sided weakness presenting from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with nausea abdominal pain on the morning of admission,
s/p emesis x 2 of undigested food and question of aspiration.
Portable chest X-ray at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab showed bilateral effusions
R>L and labs were notable for elevated WBC of 12K.  KUB was
performed and was unremarkable.  She was given tylenol 1 gram
for noted temperature of 102.  O2Sats were noted to be 90% on 2L
NC for EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.2F  HR 101  BP 100/56
RR 20 O2sat 100% 15L NRB.  On initial evaluation by ED resident,
vitals were as follows: Tm 102.8 PR 95 89/50 24 92%RA.  She was
answering questions appropriately, noted to have tenderness to
palpation in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic area.  UA
was grossly positive.  Portable CXR showed fluffy bilateral
infiltrate and mild cephalization.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed no
intra-abdominal pathology but confirmed RLL pneumonia ?secondary
to aspiration, for which she was given a dose of IV vancomycin,
Zosyn, and levofloxacin. [**Hospital **] pressure dropped as low as
70s/50s for which she was given 500cc IVFs x2 to which her [**Hospital **]
pressure responded well.  She has also received an extra 500cc
IVFs with antibiotics.  EKG showed NSR at rate 90, LAD, normal
intervals, TWI III, TWF avF V3.  Vitals in ED prior to transfer:
HR 102 128/57 RR 20 100% on 15L face mask.  Prior to transfer pt
began to feel increased rattling in back of throat and increased
shortness of breath; she was placed on BiPap prior to transfer
due to concern for flash pulmonary edema from fluid
administration.
.
On the floor, patient presents on non-rebreather mask.  She
reports having no pain.

IMAGING:

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-5-10**] 5:27 PM

CT ABDOMEN: The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without
discrete masses or lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, and
spleen are unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal glands have
normal limb thickness without convex margin to suggest mass. The
kidneys are not enlarged and excrete contrast
symmetrically. There is no hydroureter. The stomach, small
bowel, and large bowel are not distended and demonstrate normal
wall thickness. Diverticula are noted throughout the descending
colon, though there is no associated inflammation. No free fluid
or air identified within the pelvis. No mesenteric,
retroperitoneal, or portacaval lymphadenopathy. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are identified throughout the abdominal aorta
without associated aneurysmal change. The aorta, inferior vena
cava, and main portal vein and their major branches are patent.

CT PELVIS: Diverticula are noted throughout the sigmoid colon
without
associated inflammation. Moderate amount of stool is noted
within the rectal vault. The bladder is collapsed around a Foley
catheter. There is no free fluid within the pelvis. No pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Minimal degenerative change is seen in the
lower lumbar spine. No lytic or blastic lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous consolidation within the right lower lobe along
with dense material in the right lower lobe bronchioles in
highly suggestive of
aspiration pneumonia.
2. Diverticula without associated inflammation identified. No
acute process seen within abdomen.


CXR:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-5-10**] 4:22 PM
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with
overlying atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities may represent
combination of
effusion, atelectasis, and some pulmonary vascular congestion,
although
infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-5-10**] 7:32 PM
(PRELIM READ)
right effusion with dense right basilar consolidation, as seen
on concurrent a/p CT, consistent with pneumonia. mild vascular
congestion. equivocal additional opacity at the left CP angle.
no definite left effusion. no ptx.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old Russian-speaking woman with history of hypertension,
DM2, fatty liver disease, hypothyroidism, presenting with
abdominal pain and emesis, found to have RLL pneumonia,
presumably secondary to aspiration.

# Aspiration Pneumonia:
Patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn to be continued for
total 8 day course (last day = [**5-17**]) for healthcare associated
pneumonia coverage.  Vanc trough should be drawn [**5-12**] in the AM.

# Urinary tract infection:
