Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
instent thrombosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
55yo male with a history of coronary artery disease and
rheumatoid arthritis was admitted from the cath lab s/p STEMI
with instent thrombosis.
.
Patient initially presented to the Emergency Department on
[**2176-3-4**] with left knee pain. He was treated with pain medication
and sent home with percocet for pain control. His pain improved
for the first 24 hours after discharge from the ED. However over
the next 3-4 days, his knee pain again worsened and on the
morning of admission, he developed bilateral knee pain
necessitating an ED visit. He then presented to the ED for
evaluation of knee pain. He describes his knee pain as localized
in the bottom of his knees and behind his kenes with associated
swelling. His initial vital signs upon arrival to the ED was
temp 97.9, BP 143/74, HR 128, RR 20, and O2 sat 98% on room air.
However, while in the waiting room of the Emergency Department,
he developed left-sided chest pressure radiating to his left
arm. He had an ECG performed which demonstrated STE in II, III,
and avF with STD in 1, avL, V1-V3, suggesting posterior-inferior
infarction. He was taken immediately to the cath lab where he
had 100% proximal stent thrombosis in the RCA. He had
thrombectomy performed wtih export of the thrombus, followed by
IVUS and POBA to RCA. His catheterization was complicated by
brief episodes of afib with RVR. He was then sent to the CCU for
further monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, he reports feeling generally well. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, light-headedness,
dizziness, lower extremity swelling, nausea, or vomiting. His
bilateral knee pain is somewhat improved with the fentanyl and
versed he received during his cardiac catheterization and he is
pain free currently. He reports taking his medications
regularly, including his aspirin and plavix, and does not
remember missing any doses. Medication changes include the
following:
- lipitor: discontinuing his statin approximately 2 weeks ago as
they were thought to be contributing to his joint pain
- methotrexate: he was recently restarted on his methotrexate
20mg on [**2176-3-1**] to better control his rheumatoid arthritis
.
Of note, he was admitted to a hospital in [**State 108**] in [**12-22**] for a
heart attack at which time he had two stents placed. His
hospital course was complicated by development of a staph
infection for which he received 8 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy
that he completed roughly two weeks ago.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
STUDIES:
TTE [**2176-3-11**]:
The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferior and inferolateral segments. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction and right
ventricular dilatation and dysfunction consistent with RCA
ischemia/infarction. No significant valvular abnormality seen.
There is a small secundum ASD seen at rest (image #86). Agitated
saline is seen to cross the inter-atrial septum on release of
the Valsalva maneuver (image #89).

1. Coronary Artery Disease
Patient developed chest pain in the ED waiting room with ECG
changes suggestive of a STEMI in the posterior-inferior
distribution. He was found to have an instent thrombosis of
stent in the RCA. Patient has remained hemodynamically stable
with this event and is currently chest pain free. Unclear what
may have precipitated this event given that the patient reports
taking his plavix a
