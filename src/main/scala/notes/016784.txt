[**2131-9-25**]: CT Chest:
1. Large anterior chest wall mass encasing the manubrium with
evidence of manubrial erosion.
2. Mediastinal and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Small
left paraaortic lymph nodes.
3. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
4. Probable splenomegaly.
5. Findings consistent with metastatic disease or lymphoma
.
CT Head:
1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic infarctions in the left middle cerebral artery
territory distribution
.
[**2131-9-26**]: Chest wall mass, fine needle aspiration: Diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma.  CD 20, 79 +, CD10, BCL2 -
.
[**2131-9-30**]: CT abd/pelvis:
1. Interval increase in size and number of bilateral lower lobe
pulmonary nodules.
2. Enlarged left periaortic lymph nodes.
3. Atrophic kidneys with mild prominence of the collecting
systems bilaterally. The fullness of the collecting systems may
be secondary to marked bladder distention.
4. Possible soft tissue density mass within the left renal
pelvis, however, this is not clearly delineated on this
non-contrast examination. Further evaluation with ultrasound or
contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
6. Multiple ill-defined low density lesions within the posterior
subcutaneous tissues of the back and buttock which may represent
lymphomatous masses.
.
[**2131-10-2**]: TTE:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is probably normal
(LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2131-10-24**]: Pleural Fluid:
Non-specific reactive T cell dominant profile; no phenotypic
evidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in specimen
.
[**2131-10-25**]: CT chest:
1. New patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation within the
left lower lobe, concerning for acute infection.
2. New moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
3. Interval decreased size of anterior chest wall mass,
mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy, and multiple pulmonary
nodules.
4. High attenuation soft tissue thickening of the inferior
aspect of the posterior right diaphragm and upper abdominal
wall/peritoneal fascia. Given the rapid appearance since
[**2131-9-25**], most likely consideration is retroperitoneal
hemorrhage, perhaps tracking from a lower source. Has there been
any recent intervention on the right side to explain these
findings?
5. Findings suggestive of bronchomalacia. A dedicated CT trachea
study could be performed when the patient is stable, if
clinically warranted, for confirmation.
.

[**2131-10-31**]: CT trachea:
Moderate-to-severe tracheo-bronchomalacia.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
#Diffuse Large Bcell Lymphoma - On admission, coumadin was held
and the patient was placed on lovenox.  A biopsy of the anterior
chest mass was performed on [**2131-9-26**] with orthopedics and
thoracics following. A staging Abd/Pelvic CT and echo was
performed.  Abd/Pelvic CT showed pulm nodules increased in size
from [**9-25**] and multiple SC masses in back and buttocks. The
biopsy returned consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
She was started on allopurinol for TLS ppx as her uric acid was
elevated. She was then transferred to the OMED service for
further therapy. She was started on Prednisone. She then
received rituxan [**10-4**] and cytoxan [**10-5**]. She became transiently
neutropenic after the chemotherapy but this resolved with
neupogen.  Repeat CT torso was notable for decrease in tumor
burden. She received no more chemotherapy [**2-28**] declining
respiratory status.
.
#Tachypnea/Hypoxia - The patient required 2L O2 to maintain
oxygen sats >95% while on the medicine service. She was on lasix
as an outpatient so this was continued with minimal improvement
in her oxygen saturations despite increasing doses. On the day
of transfer on [**2131-10-1**], she had increased tachypnea and shortness
of breath. She had bibasilar crackles on exam but her CXR was
not consistent with failure.  A foley was placed and IV lasix
were given with improvement on clinical exam. A TTE was done
notable for normal EF, mild pulmonary systolic hypertension, and
[**1-28**]+AR. She was also treated for her COPD with nebulizer
therapy. She remained stable from a respiratory standpoint until
she received Rituxan. After that time she became more tachypneic
and hypoxic. A chest CT and CXR were not notable for pneumonia
but notalb for bilateral effusions and evidence of volume
overload. Cardiology was consulted and they recommended
aggressive diuresis. Diuresis was limited by worsening
creatinine and increasing HCO3. On [**10-23**], she was sent to the
MICU for respiratory distress and hypercarbia. Her ABG was
7.31/86/123 on 4L. Pulmonary mechanics were completed and
notable for a NIF of -38cmH2O and VC of 450 CC. Since she was
DNR/DNI, Bipap was attempted. Her
