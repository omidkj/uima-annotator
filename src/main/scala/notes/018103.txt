abd/pelvis which showed diffuse colitis (unchanged from previous
exam.  C. Diff cultures came back positive today and Medical tem

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU service.  General
Surgery consulted for C.Diff colitis.  She was treated
conservatively.  However, over the next 48 hours her abdominal
become worrisome and she developed ARF and essentially became
anuric. A KUB at this time demonstrated free air.  The patient
was then taken to the operating room where she underwent a total
abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy.  She was noted to have
2.5 Liters of purulent material in the abdomen in the OR.

POST-OP:
The patient was transferred to the SICU for further
resuscitation.
Neuro: pain was controlled and sedation minimized
.
CV: At this point her hemodynamics had begun to improve.  She
was quickly weaned off of pressors and required minimal fluid
resuscitation.
.
Pulm: She was eventually able to wean to minimal vent settings,
but only tolerated trach collar for a few hours at a time.  This
is likely due to her pre-existing condition as well as severe
illness she was recovering from.
.
GI/FEN: She was placed on trophic tube feeds and advanced to
goal which she tolerated.  Her stoma was functioning well at the
time of discharge.
.
Renal: Renal was consulted for her ARF.  She began CVVHD after a
HD line was placed.  This was continued for about a week until
enought volume had been taken off to adequately wean her vent
settings.  The CVVHD was stopped and she began making more
urine, about 50-100cc per hour.  Her electrolytes and Creatinine
remained stable.  Renal recommended holding off on further
dialysis for now. She did receive a few doses of lasix and seems
to respond well to this.
.
Heme: her Hct was stable but slowly drifted down to 22 by
discharge, she received one unit of PRBC for this.
.
ID: she was initially treated with Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco.  The IV
vanco was for a coag neg blood Cx.  The flagyl was for the
C.Diff, and the cipro was continued for 7 days for coverage due
to gross abdominal contamination.
.
Endo: blood sugars controlled with sliding scale insulin.
