History of Present Illness:
70yo M with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-vesicular fistula s/p hemicolectomy
complicated by wound dehiscence admitted to OSH with AMS and ARF
and transferred tonight to [**Hospital1 18**] per family's request. His OSH
course over the last few months has been collected through the
OSH records and is as follows: In [**Month (only) 956**] he had a
[**Last Name (un) **]-vesicular fistula which was treated with hemicolectomy. He
was discharged but came back [**2140-3-7**] with wound dehiscence which
was repaired on [**2140-3-7**]. Then he was readmitted on [**2140-3-19**] with
respiratory distress and was treated with COPD flare/acute on
chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was then transferred
to the floor where he evolved ARF (thought [**2-2**] prerenal) and got
IVF which allowed his creatinine to improve to baseline(from 3).
He was then receiving indomethacin, lisinopril, HCTZ and over
the next few days he was then having slow elevation of his
creatinine with decreasing UOP accompanied by abdominal
discomfort and watery, non-bloody diarrhea (although dtr reports
only one episode of diarrhea). Because of hypotension with BP
80s/60s he was transferred back to the CCU. There he was
hypotensive (BP 80s-90s/50s) with low urine output and no
response to multiple IVF boluses. He underwent CVL placement and
then, because of abdominal distension on exam he underwent CT
scan showed no free air but dilated large and small bowel (not
surgical) and looked like ileus. He was started on IV flagyl
empirically for C Diff. The toxin is pending. Creatinine now
back up to 4.5. K 5.5. At 4pm he was started empirically on Vanc
IV, Zosyn IV, levoquin IV. At this point family requested
transfer [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On the floor, patient was complaining of feeling uncomfortable
and thirsty. His daughter reports that his MS is not at baseline
however much improved from prior. He is still hallucinating,
however, thinking rabbits are in the room, etc. She also notes
he is complaining of pain and that the percocet they gave him at
the OSH were helping.

FINDINGS: No previous comparison ultrasound examinations. The
right kidney
is slightly small in size measuring 8 cm in its long axis. The
left kidney
measures 10.3 cm in its long axis. No renal calculi,
hydronephrosis or mass
lesions seen on either side. Ascites is noted.

CONCLUSION: No hydronephrosis or renal calculi. Right kidney
slightly
smaller than the left. Findings are similar to the outside
reference CT scan
done on [**2140-3-23**] at Health Alliance.


Brief Hospital Course:
70yo M with severe COPD, recent abdominal surgery c/by wound
dehiscence admitted with likely CDiff colitis and ARF.
.
# C Diff Colitis: Patient was started on PO vancomycin and IV
flagyl.  Abdomen was grossly distended, with a bladder pressure
of 40.  General surgery was consulted for concern for toxic
megacolon, and did not recommend surgical intervention.  He
became intermittently hypotensive responsive to fluid boluses.
His leukocytosis increased to 44.  On discussion with the family
it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures
only, and supportive care would be withdrawn.  He was treated
with morphine IV drip for comfort and passed away several hours
later.
.
# Acute Renal Failure/Anuria. Patient's creatinine at baseline
per OSH was noted to be 1.2 [**Last Name (un) **] now 5.0. It was thought that
this most likely represented ATN from hypotension, secondary to
septic shock, possibly complicated by nephrotoxic medications
(HCTZ/Lisinopril/indomethacin), or possibllt from post renal
obstruction from abdominal compartment syndrome (initial bladder
pressure was 40). Urology consulted regarding anuria, and
believed it was likely fluid retention due to bladder spasm.
Renal was consulted regarding the need for emergent dialysis.
On discussion with the family it was decided that the patient
would be made comfort measures only, and supportive care would
be withdrawn.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from sepsis/lactic
acidosis vs uremia.  Serum electrolytes were followed throughout
this hospitalization.
.
# Abdominal Wound: Per surgical consult from OSH there is no
need for further surgery, however, wound may be site of
infection based on exam and patient with considerable pain.  On
discussion with family regarding goals of care, he was treated
for pain with morphine gtt.
.
# COPD Exacerbation: Patient was initially treated with steroids
and nebulizer treatements, but these were stopped with change in
code status.
.
# Anemia: Unclear if patient received a blood transfusion at OSH
but hct increased over the last 4 days by ten points so this is
likely.  Hematocrit was monitored.
