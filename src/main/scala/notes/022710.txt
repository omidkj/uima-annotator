Imaging:
CTPA [**2130-8-27**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Massive PE involving all pulmonary lobes, with evidence of
right heart
strain.

2. Scattered pulmonary ground-glass opacities could represent
developing
infarcts, less likely infection/inflammation or atelectasis.

3. Multinodular thyroid can be further evaluated by ultrasound
on a
nonemergent basis, if clinically indicated.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-8-29**]):    NO GROWTH.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. PEs: Pt with massive bilateral PEs involving all lobes and R
heart strain. She was initially started on Heparin gtt. This was
held in the ED and TPA was given. Hypotension and hypoxia now
improved - pt is hemodynamically stable. Etiology unclear - may
be because pt sedentary [**2-21**] to MS or the ESTRING which was
recently started (vaginally). No known malignancies. Active T&S
was maintained prior to transfer to floor as were two peripheral
large bore IVs. Started on coumadin [**8-28**] and will likely need
life time anticoagulation as she sedentary due to MS.  She
improved quickly with normal hemodynamics.  On [**2130-8-30**] INR =
3.2.  IV Heparin was discontinued and Warfarin was moved to 4mg
qhs to start evening of [**2130-8-30**].  PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 12872**] and pt's N{
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4643**] were informed (phone/email) about current treatment
plan. They will take over INR monitoring and make sure that
ESTRING is removed upon arrival to [**Hospital1 1501**].  (Pt preferred ESTRING
removal to be done there).
.
#. MS: Pt with MS c/b fatigue, urge incontinence, has suprapubic
catheter in place. The patient's outpatient medications were
continued, including baclofen, oxybutinin, neurontin, and
provigil prn. Urinalysis showed no pyuria, no leukocyte
esterace, no nitrite but urine cultures were sent and returned
>100K Stenotophomonas Maltophilia.  Pt was afebrile and without
any new symptoms. I assume this is contamination vs.
colonization.  Repeat UCx showed no growth.
.
#. Osteoporosis: Stable on outpatient fosamax and vitamin D.
.
#. Psych: Stable on outpatient Buspar, and Zoloft.
