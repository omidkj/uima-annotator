CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right groin pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
female who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 15083**]
after being treated for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle
crash back on [**2144-1-2**].  Discharge from [**Hospital1 498**]
included the following diagnoses: (1) traumatic diaphragmatic
rupture status post exploratory laparotomy; (2) 15 cm scalp
laceration; (3) right open tib/fib fractures status post
plating; (4) ORIF of left radius and ulna fractures; (5) L-1
through L-4 transverse processes fractures; (6) left ribs 10
through 12 fractures; (7) left SFA DVT.  Patient was
discharged on [**1-13**] to rehab.  On [**1-26**] patient
complained of right groin pain and had several hours of
"purple emesis."  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital and had a cardiac arrest in the emergency room.  She
was intubated, given chest compression and started on
dopamine.  Hematocrit was found to be 19 and she was
transfused 2 units of packed red cells.  She was Med-Flighted
to [**Hospital1 18**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, breast
cancer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right mastectomy.  Status post ex-lap
and reduction of gastric hernia and repair of diaphragmatic
rupture.  Status post ORIF of left wrist.  Status post ORIF
of right tib/fib fractures.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox 100 mg subcu b.i.d., Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. day two of seven.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Keflex.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vitals on admission to E.R.
were heart rate of 113, blood pressure 80/palp.  Patient was
intubated, following commands.  Coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  She was tachycardiac, but regular.  Abdomen was
obese, nontender, soft.  She had a right groin hematoma to
the mid-thigh.  She was heme negative on rectal.  She had no
distal edema.  Right upper extremity was in a brace, was
warm, was neurovascularly intact.  Left lower extremity was
without edema and warm.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 18.1,
hematocrit 9.2, platelets 662.  PT 25.3, PTT 45.8, INR 4.2.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 97, bicarb 28, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 170.  Arterial blood gas on admission
was 6.95, 117, 54, 28, -10.  Fibrinogen was 374, amylase 128,
lactate 15.2.  Radiographic studies included chest x-ray
which showed left pleural effusion.  Chest CT corroborated
the x-ray.  Abdominal CT showed no free fluid, normal aorta,
right retroperitoneal hematoma from the iliacus to right
groin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the emergency room patient was
aggressively resuscitated, receiving 8 units of packed red
cells, 8 units of FFP and multiple liters of crystalloid.
Repeat hematocrit in the trauma SICU was 41.7.  Gas improved
to 7.26, 38, 127, 18, -9.  In the trauma bay she had a left
chest tube placed for the left pleural effusion.  She had
multiple lines placed including a right groin line which was
subsequently removed.  It is unclear whether patient had
sustained a spontaneous bleed in the right retroperitoneum
versus an iatrogenic hematoma secondary to the right line.
After the line placement, it was found the line had been
placed in the femoral artery.  She was transferred to the
trauma SICU where resuscitation continued.  There was a
question of a GI bleed as the source of the dramatic fall in
hematocrit an upper endoscopy was performed by the
gastroenterology service which was normal.

Vascular surgery was consulted regarding the right thigh
hematoma and they opted for aggressive correction of her
coagulopathy and close examination.  Over the next ensuing
days patient's coagulopathy was corrected and hematocrit
remained stable.  She was weaned off ventilatory support
while undergoing diuresis secondary to the large fluid
resuscitation which occurred earlier in her hospital course.
By hospital day five she was extubated.  Her chest tube was
discontinued.  She had completed a course of IV steroids and
remained stable.  She had an IVC filter placed on hospital
day eight due to her history of DVT and an antibody positive
test result.

On hospital day nine she was transferred to the floor in
stable condition.  She had been receiving tube feeds and a
swallow study was performed.  Video swallow study
demonstrated patient tolerating a pureed and ground diet with
thin liquids.  Her diet was advanced and the Dobbhoff was
removed.  On the floor she also was found to have a rising
white count to a high of 19.3.  She remained afebrile.  Blood
cultures were sent which demonstrated gram positive cocci in
one out of four bottles and gram positive rods in two out of
four bottles.  She had a central venous line which had been
discontinued.  All peripheral access was discontinued.
Subsequent white count was 9.3.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy.  Based on the
notes from [**State 1558**], patient is nonweight
bearing on the right lower extremity and nonweight bearing on
the right upper extremity.  She is able to ambulate with a
Cam walker.  Patient is otherwise stable and ready for
discharge to rehab.
