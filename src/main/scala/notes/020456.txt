.
[**10-31**] CXR: Right upper lobe consolidation consistent with
pneumonia.
Follow-up radiographs are recommended to ensure clearance
approximately six weeks after treatment.
.
CXR [**11-4**]: Extent of pneumonia in the right upper lobe has not
changed appreciably since [**11-3**], but may have improved
slightly since [**10-31**]. Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular
congestion persists although there is no pulmonary edema. Heart
size is top normal. Tip of the right PIC catheter is barely
visible, and may still terminate in the right atrium as it did
on [**11-3**]. Routine
radiographs recommended when feasible.
.
Echo [**2189-11-2**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal study. Preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. No pericardial effusion.  If
the clinical suspicion for pericarditis is moderate/high, a
cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) may be able to detect inflammed
pericardium


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 20 yo MICU callout, previously healthy male
initially admitted with sepsis and hypoxia in setting of lobar
pneumonia.
.
1. Sepsis: Resolved. Pt appeared to be septic, given his fever,
tachycardia, low BP, secondary to a large RUL lobar pneumonia of
likely bacterial etiology but culture negative. Treated
empirically for pneumonia with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vanco
and then switched to levofloxacin prior to discharge.
.
2. Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Lobar pna, culture negative.
Improved on antibiotics.  Changed ABX to levofloxacin for total
of 14 day course (Started [**11-1**] to be continued until [**11-15**]).
Continued ipratroprium and albuterol and guaifenesin.  Patient
was weaned from supplemental oxygen and encouraged to do
incentive spirometry.
.
3. Pleuritic chest pain: Pt had peak positive Troponin of 1.45,
CK 580, CKMB 10 on admission. EKG with inferolateral TWI. During
his MICU course they trended down. On [**11-4**] (day prior to
discharge) showed troponin of 0.08, CK of 141, CK-MB of 2. The
cause was unlikely ACS and more likely myocarditis/pericarditis.
Urine cocaine screen was negative. Treated pain with ibuprofen
and tylenol as needed (patient uncomfortable with offers for
pain control with narcotics).
.
4. Hx of polysubstance abuse: Pt denies recent drug use (sober x
7 months). HIV and HepC negative. Urine tox screen was negative
