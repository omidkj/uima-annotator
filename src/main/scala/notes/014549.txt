Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 13755**] was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit on
[**2153-8-19**] after presententing to the Emergency Room with severe
abdominal pain. A CT scan was performed on that occasion and
revealed marked progression of her GIST tumor as compared to
[**5-/2153**] and within this tumor an area of central hyperdensity in
a blush-like pattern was identified,concerning for active
intratumoral extravasation. There was also a moderate amount of
hyperdense free fluid consistent with intraperitoneal
hemorrhage.
The patient was made NPO, on IVF and a foley catheter was placed
for urine output monitoring. Overnight serial Hct were obtained
and she was given 2U of PRBC and 1U FFP.
On HD 2 since her INR continued to be high (1.9)she was given
10mg of Vit K IV. IR was consulted for possible embolization of
bleeding source. A selective angiogram was performed but no
bleeding source was identified at that time.
Between HD2 and 3 the patient's O2 requiremets increased and her
CXR showed minimally progressive pulmonary edema. Mrs [**Known lastname 13755**] is
on Lasix at home; she was therefore cautiously diuresed to
improve her respiratory status.
Overnight on HD2 and early morning on HD 3 she received a total
of 3 more Units os PRBC with good Hct response. An echo was also
performed on HD 3 and showed a mildly dilated L atrium, moderate
symmetric L ventricular hyperthrophy and a LVEF >50%. It did
show some moderate L diastolic dysfunction. The pulmonary artery
pressure was higher compared to previous examinations.
Mrs [**Known lastname 13755**] showed signs of improvement with decreasing O2
requirements and resolved abdominal pain on HD4. Her Hct had
remained stable around 30 on repeated checks and she was
therefore advanced to a clear liquid diet, which was well
tolerated and transferred to the regular floor later that night.

On HD5 the patient was advanced to a regular diet and her home
medications were resumed. Her foley catheter was discontinued
and she was able to void regularly. Physical therapy was
consulted for evaluation and she was cleared for home. She was
noted to desaturate to 86% while ambulating and would quickly
recover back to baseline of 96% on RA. She was given an
additional 80mg lasix which provided good diuresis. On HD#6 she
continued to do well, she was ambulating independently with her
walker, tolerating regular diet, and passing flatus. Her
anticoagulation use was discussed with her cardiologist who
recommended aspirin/plavix instead of coumadin. The surgery
service feels strongly about no further anticoagulation in this
patient, now with her second episode of life threatening
intra-abdominal bleeding. The patient was instructed to stop
taking her coumadin and follow up with her cardiologist in 1
week to discuss the treatment of her AFib at that time. This was
explained to the patient with the aid of the russian interpretor
and the patient expressed understanding and agreement of this
treatment plan. She was discharged home with her regular VNA
services.

atrial fibrillation.

Call your PCP or return to the Emergency Department for:
