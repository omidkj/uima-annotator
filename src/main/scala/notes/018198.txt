Allergies:
Ergot Alkaloids / Norvasc

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for venous graft intervention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cathetherization-stent placement

History of Present Illness:
This 72-year old female with an extensive medical history
including CABG and valve replacement, PVD, CRI, presents here
from [**Hospital1 **] with chest pain/management of MI.
Patient reports being admitted for chf exacerbation in mid-[**Month (only) 116**]
at [**Hospital 4415**] with active diuresis and concern
for ACS, but because of imparied renal function, plan to medical
manage and not sent to cath lab. Patient discharged to
independant living.
On [**4-13**], patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] with cheif complaints of
left scapular pain and shortness of breath - diagnosed with
acute decompensated heart failure, subsequently diuresed, ruled
in for NQWMI with troponin up to 11.4, ck 290, 12% R/I. [**4-17**]
cardiac cath showed 3-v native disease (RCA not seen), LIMA to
LAD-40-50% mid disease, SVG to LV branch of prox CX: 80%
eccentric proximal stenosis which became worse during cath (?
catheter trauma), SVG to OM: proximal occlusion, with an
estimated EF 55-60%. Course complicated by ? of TIA vs. stroke
last Wed [**4-18**] day after cath, with clinical signs of right hand
weakness, with no other signs/symptoms since that time and CT
scan negative for acute pathology (no MRI done). On [**4-18**],
patient had another rise in ck and troponin, with rise back up
to 12 (previously 2). An Echo on [**4-18**] showed EF 40-45%. A
carotid u/s showed "no changes from previous", but by report,
unsure of previous findings. Patient has reportedly been chest
pain free over weekend on ntg and heparin gtts. Right groin site
clean, dry, and intact. Patient referred for venous graft
intervention. Vital signs upon transfer BP 170/77, 130/55
post-hydral and lopressor, hr 60s sinus, afebrile, sat 2lnc 98%.
Bilateral wheezes.
In cath lab, cobalt chronium, BMS stent placed in proximal [**11-22**]
of SVG to RCA, where a 70% stenosis was identified.
ROS+ for claudication symptoms in her lower extremities after
walking distance. + nasal symptoms thought [**12-22**] to seasonal
allergies.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD - MI complicated by cardiogenic shock in [**2107**], leading to
CABG with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV
2. [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] aortic valve replacement.
3. PVD - s/p aortobifemoral bypass graft with left renal artery
bypass
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm - repaired [**2108**]
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
6. Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 2.5 with acute
failure with creatinine rise to 5.0. Renal artery angioplasty in
[**2107**].
7. GI bleed - unsure of nature of bleed
8. Hypertension
9. Hyperlipidemia - untreated due to side effects
10. Pulmonary hypertension
11. Right carotid stenosis - CEW [**2107**]
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, atrial
fibrillation
Cardiac History: CABG - LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV

history, not currently smoking, quit six years ago. There is no
significant history of alcohol abuse.  Patient lives in
[**Location 47**] Housing Complex, living independently.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
CXR - Single AP view of the chest in upright position
demonstrate patient to be status post CABG. There is pulmonary
vascular congestion with interstitial edema. No evidence of
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion with
interstitial edema representing CHF.
.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the basal and midventricular
segments of the inferior and posterior walls. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2114-4-28**] ECHO

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top

normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and
hypokinesis
elsewhere. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely
represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-24**], the
left and
right ventricles are now more dilated and left and right
ventricular systolic
function now appears more depressed. Mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation are
now more prominent.

[**2114-4-26**] RENAL ULTRASOUND

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.5 cm. There is
mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex. No
hydronephrosis or stones. Bladder is partially full and
unremarkable. Left kidney was not visualized, and by report of
the patient, is scarred and atrophic.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex consistent
with chronic parenchymal renal disease. No evidence of
obstruction.
2. Non-visualization of the left kidney.
