[**12-27**] CT Torso:
INDICATION: 82-year-old female status post mitral valve repair
with question of increased right hemothorax.

No comparison studies.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis were performed without IV contrast. Multiplanar
reformations were obtained.

CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Patient is status post sternotomy
with intact wires. A left cardiac pacer is present with leads
terminating within the right atrium and ventricle. There is
extensive aortic and mitral annulus calcification and there has
been aortic and mitral valve prosthetic repair. Aortic
calcifications extend up along the greater vessels which are
mildly ectatic. The main pulmonary artery is large at 3.7 cm.
There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes which are enlarged,
most notable within the precarinal region measuring 1.8 x 1.5
cm. Additional nodes are present within the right paratracheal,
AP window stations. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are enlarged epicardial nodes, the largest 15 x 12 mm (2/38).
There is an enlarged left retrocrural lymph node at 23 x 9 mm.

The lungs are diffusely emphysematous, most notable at the
apices with mild bullous changes. There is diffuse interstitial
thickening which is asymmetric and most consistent with
pulmonary edema with a small to moderate-sized fluid denisty
right pleural effusion with no evidence of blood density. There
is trace fluid within the left pleura.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Within the caudate lobe of the
liver, there is a 1.2 x 1.2 cm hypodensity that is incompletely
characterized. There are several gallstones in an otherwise
unremarkable gallbladder. There are multiple lymph nodes within
the porta hepatis and portocaval region. For example, anterior
to the IVC on series 2, image 55, there is a 15 x 9 mm lymph
node. The pancreas is unremarkable. A nasogastric tube
terminates within the distal stomach. There are extensive
atherosclerotic aortic calcifications that extend into the
mesenteric vessels with heavy calcification seen at the origins
of the celiac and more notably SMA. The spleen is bulky. The
right adrenal gland measures 1.6 x 1.9 cm, demonstrating
fluid-density Hounsfield units likely representing an adenoma.
The left adrenal gland is not well visualized. The kidneys are
unremarkable. The unopacified small and large bowel are within
normal limits. There is no mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a small amount of
intraperotoneal fluid extending along the paracolic gutters and
most notable anterior to the rectum on the right. Additionally,
there is diffuse stranding within the subcutaneous tissues of
the lower torso.

There is no iliac lymphadenopathy. Overlying the left femoral
vascular sheath, there is a 3.6 x 2.0 cm mildly hyperdense mass
likely representing hematoma, possibly from recent left femoral
access.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hemothorax. Small right pleural effusion with
moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema.
2. Status post mitral and aortic valve replacements with
extensive mitral anulus and aortic valvular and aortic
calcifications.
3. Mediastinal and periportal lymphadenopathy and borderline
enlarged spleen. Recommend correlating with prior history to
determine the cause of these findings. These findings would fit
with prior history of lymphoma, sarcoidosis, or possibly
tuberculosis.
4. Gallstones.
5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
6. Small intraperitoneal fluid, most notable in the pelvis along
with subcutaneous edema and right pleural effusion. Together,
these findings ay be representing a unifying cause such as third
spacing.
7. Large left groin hyperdense collection, most consistent with
hematoma.
8. Emphysema.
9. Focal liver hypodensity in caudate lobe, incompletely
characterized. Although probably a benign cyst, a mutliphasic
MRI would better evaluate this lesion is there is further
clinical concern.
10. Right adrenal adenoma.

[**12-28**] ECHO (TEE)
There is mild left atrial enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A color
Doppler signal is seen in the mid-interatrial septum with
bidirectional flow c/w a secundum atrial septal defect. After
agitated saline injection, there is prompt appearance of
contrast in the left atrium c/w a bidirectional shunt. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. However evaluation of
the aortic bioprostesis is limited by acoustic shadowing from
the mitral mechanical valve. A bileaflet mechanical mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The valve is well seated with good disc
motion and normal gradient. There is a small paravalvular leak
with regurgitation on the anteroseptal and inferior aspect of
the interatrial septum. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

CONCLUSION: Well seated bileaflet mitral valve with good disc
motion/normal gradient, but small para valvular leak. Secundum
type atrial septal defect with bidirectional flow.

[**1-1**] ECHO (TEE)
The left atrium is dilated. A patent foramen ovale or a small
ASD is present. Doppler evaluation suggests predominantly
left-to-right shunting during the study, with a Qp:Qs of 1.4.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets appear normal. Mild (1+) central aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tric
