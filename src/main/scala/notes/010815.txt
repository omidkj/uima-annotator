Findings
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor
native endocardial border definition.

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. The IVC is
normal in diameter with appropriate phasic respirator variation.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Markedly dilated descending aorta

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve leaflets. No valvular AS. The increased transaortic
gradient related to high cardiac output.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR. Normal LV inflow pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. Indeterminate
PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related
to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-24**] and tight BP control titrated. Vascular consult
also obtained and CTA of torso done. Transferred to floor and
transitioned to oral BP control. Cardiology and pulmonary
consults also completed to help stratify risk of possible
surgery. Surgery was planned for early the next week. On the
early morning of [**10-28**], the pt. suffered an asystolic cardiac
arrest with ACLS protocol done and shocked when Vfib occurred.
Went into PEA and did not respond despite 25 minutes of
resuscitative attempts. Expired at 8:05 AM. Family subsequently
notified.
