Admission Date:  [**2119-8-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-8-15**]


Service:  Medicine

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. Shortness of breath.
2. Increasing extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented on
[**2119-8-4**] for increasing extremity edema and shortness of
breath despite being on peritoneal dialysis for the past five
weeks for end-stage renal disease.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count and chemistry panel
including creatinine were at baseline on admission.  Cardiac
etiology ruled out via CK and EKG.

The patient was admitted for conversion to hemodialysis in
stable condition.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. End-stage renal disease:  Peritoneal
dialysis catheter was removed and a tunnel catheter was
placed.  The patient underwent hemodialysis on [**2119-8-5**].  The
patient remained stable until [**2119-8-7**] when the patient
became hypoxic, developed rigors, tachycardia and temperature
of 101.  The patient transferred to the intensive care unit.
Intensive care unit course will be dictated separately by the
intensive care unit team.  The patient was transferred back
to the floor on [**2119-8-10**].  The patient's course has been
stable since transfer.  Systolic blood pressure is back at
baseline ranging in the 90s per primary care physician;
afebrile and saturating greater than 91% on room air.  In
preparation for discharge the patient was evaluated by PT as
well as nutrition for albumin of 2.4.  The patient underwent
another session of hemodialysis before discharge to ensure
that the patient could tolerate the procedure.  The patient's
blood pressure remained at baseline and the patient is
asymptomatic status post dialysis.

2. Fever:  Etiology unclear.  The patient had been started on
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole per vascular
surgery at admission for nonhealing left foot ulcer.  The
patient does not appear infectious on examination but
osteomyelitis could not be ruled out.  The wound remained
stable throughout examination.  However, urine was noted to
be purulent at collection, and urosepsis became the working
diagnosis during the patient's intensive care unit stay.
Indocin, gentamicin, and vancomycin were started in the
intensive care unit.  Metronidazole and levofloxacin were
discontinued.  Panculture remained negative throughout
hospital course.  Infectious disease consultation recommended
cessation of all antibiotics except Zosyn to be continued for
a 10-day total duration upon discharge.

3. Congestive heart failure:  No indication of decompensation
during this admission.

4. Pleural effusion:  Diagnostic thoracentesis was consistent
with transudate.  No organisms were isolated.  Further taps
were deferred as the patient was asymptomatic.

5. Physical therapy:  The patient was evaluated by both
occupational therapy and physical therapy.  It was deemed
that the patient would need rehabilitation placement upon
discharge.  The patient was discharged in stable condition on
[**2119-8-15**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  General:  Awake, alert,
sitting up, lucid, appropriate.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rhythm, mild tachycardia.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally except lower one-fourth lung field
that showed decreased breath sounds but no crackles.
Abdomen:  Soft, distended, but nontender to palpation.
Dressing removed from PD catheter site.  The site is now
clean, no discharge, no erythema, and no edema.  Extremities:
2+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Left foot dressing is in
place, dry, pressure boot in place.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed a white blood
cell count of 8.6, hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.9/31/7,
platelet count 164, physical therapy 13.7, PTT 30.7,
interrupted 1.3.  Chemistry panel was sodium 140, potassium
4.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN 25, creatinine 4.2,
glucose 111.

IMAGING:  Echocardiogram from [**2119-8-9**]:  "Compared with the
findings of the prior study, tape reviewed of [**2119-5-1**], the
left ventricle was not dilated with similar systolic
dysfunction.  The aortic valve gradient is now higher and
calculated valve area is now marginally smaller.  Estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.  Ejection
fraction is now less than 15%."

Chest x-ray of [**2119-8-12**] shows:  "Continual bilateral pleural
effusion at bases."

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

PROCEDURES:
1. Removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter from the abdomen.
2. Placement of tunnel catheter for dialysis.
3. Diagnostic thoracentesis.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  End-stage renal disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2. Paroxetine 10 mg q.d.
3. Simvastatin 20 mg q.d.
4. Sevelamer 800 mg, two tablets p.o. t.i.d.
5. Collagenase 250 units per gram of ointment applied q.d. to
affected area of ulcer.
6. Digoxin 125 mcg, 0.5 tablet q.o.d.
7. Heparin sodium 5,000 units per mL, one injection q. 12.
8. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
9. Trazodone 50 mg, 0.5 tablet q.h.s. p.r.n.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to be followed up with primary
care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient is also scheduled for follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of podiatry within one week of discharge.
