Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

guidance)
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
78yo male transferred from OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) after unwitnessed
fall at NH. The patient is a poor historian and does not recall
the incident. Patient is  CT head from OSH negative. No focal
neurologic symptoms. No localizing [**Last Name (un) 68421**] of infection. By
report, the patient had a C6 fracture. According to the
patient's son, the patient has had multiple falls in the last
1-2 years. Initially, his falls were thought to be related to a
cardiac etiology and "small heart attacks". He is seen by a
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5503**] who sent him for defibrillator/pacer
placement a few months ago. He has continued to have falls since
then which are usually unwitnessed and thought to be secondary
to generalized weakness. The patient receives hemodialysis on
Mon, Wed, Fri and did receive his dialysis yesterday.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to have extensive DJD of the
cervical spine with resultant cord compression at C4-C7 and a
large lytic lesion in a throacic vertebral body. Pleural
effusion on the left side was noted on CXR.
.
ROS: not able to obtain, but patient denies any pain

GEN: somnolent, minimally responds to verbal commands or painful
stimuli
HEENT: L eye opaqu, R pupil responsive to stimuli; MM dry
Lungs: pt not able to comply with exam, tachypneic, rhonchorous
throughout
CV: tachycardic, RR, nl s1/s2, II/VI SEM loudest at LUSB

LABS: see below
.
IMAGING:
[**2139-9-22**] P CXR (AM): Large left pleural effusion with associated
opacity presumed atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2139-9-22**] T Spine: Mild L1 compression fracture of unknown
chronicity.
1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body for
which bone scan is recommended. Large left pleural effusion and
tiny right pleural effusion.
.
[**2139-9-22**] C Spine: Extensive degenerative changes with severe
spinal cord compression at multiple levels as described above,
presumed secondary to degenerative changes. Small well
corticated osseous fragment adjacent spinous process of C7 is
likely old trauma, much less likely acute avulsion injury.
There is no definite evidence for fracture.
.
[**2139-9-22**] P CXR (PM - after hypoxic episode): final read pending;
appears to have increased opacification of RLL
.
A/P: 78 yo M with MMP presents s/p fall at NH and change in
mental status.
#. Tachypnea - Patient became acutely tachypneic and hypoxic
upon transfer to the floor. He most likely experienced an
aspiration event related to post-tussive emesis. Other
etiologies include pneumonia versus fluid overload versus
pulmonary embolus. The patient stabilized with suction and a
short period on 100% NRB. His oxygen saturation has been stable
on 2L nasal cannula after this acute event.
- Monitor sats, titrate O2 as indicated
- CXR
- already on levaquin 250mg q24h for presumed UTI
- Vanco given hemodialysis, recent hospitalization, and exposure
to nursing home
- ABG - attempt to repeat if worsens clinically, venous pCO2 wnl
.
#. UTI - [**Month (only) 116**] be etiology for fever. Concern for bacteremia given
change in mental status, tachypnea, slightly elevated lactic
acid and degree of fever.
- renally dosed Levaquin x 7d
- UCx, BCx
- IVF at 100cc/hour
- place foley
.
#. Mental status changes - delirium, somnolence. UTI/infection
related vs hypoxia vs ICH s/p fall vs. hypercarbia vs. CASHD vs
metabolic. No sedating meds given recently. Not hypercarbic by
venous pCO2, no metabolic derarrangements indicated by labs.
- Head CT as OSH negative
- started on levaquin for UTI, vancomycin empirically
- ABG if O2 sats worsens
- TSH pending
.
#. Elevated cardiac markers - concern for ischemia given h/o
CASHD; LBBB on EKG; hemodynamically stable
- Repeat enzymes x 2
- Continue ASA, statin, B-blocker per home regimen
.
#. C4-7 cord compression - [**1-15**] severe DJD. Concern for lytic
lesions in T5 vertebral body. Pt has questionable history of
both renal and prostate ca.
- Neurosurg following
- Myelogram tomorrow, will coordinate with hemodialysis
- Check UPEP, SPEP, PSA
- bone scan as an outpatient
.
#. CKD - on hemodialysis, last treatment yesterday
- Renal consult --> no need for urgent HD
- Hemodialysis in AM
- okay to have myelogram tomorrow
.
# Biliary duct dilation s/p stent placement, abdominal exam
benign
- LFTs, pancreatic enzymes elevated
- Add flagyl to cover for cholecystitis given clinical status
- CT or U/S of abdomen as indicated for further evaluation
.
#. Anemia - unknown baseline, but stable for now
.
#. F/E/N - IVF for now given poor PO intake, pt is on thick
liquids at NH, NPO until improvement in mental status, replete
lytes as indicated
.
#. Prophylaxis - heparin SC
.
