Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30201**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with hx of ESRD on HD, diastolic CHF, PVD s/p
bilateral lower leg amputations, and atrial fibrillation
presenting with shortness of breath.  She was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-5-14**] following an admission for
hypertensive urgency complicated by hypoxia due to pulmonary
edema.  During that admission, she was placed on CPAP, had blood
pressure control with a nitroglycerin gtt initally and had extra
HD/UF sessions.  There was no clear etiology to the
decompensation as she had no clear cardiac ischemic event nor
missed HD session.  She was discharged to resume her usual MWF
dialysis sessions.
.
On Saturday night she first noted shortness of breath when she
was trying to sleep.  She stated that everytime that she would
try to lay flat she would get more short of breath. She denied
chest pain, cough, or diaphoresis.  She had no
fevers/chills/sweats prior to coming to the hosptial. She stated
that before coming into the hospital that she noted her heart
was racing.
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were T not recorded HR 113 BP
230/112 38 100%NRB.  She was started on a nitroglycerin gtt. She
was started on CPAP. She received lasix 100 mg x1 to which she
urinated ~80cc.  She received 1 dose of ceftriaxone and was
prescribed 1 dose of levofloxacin.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2163-5-30**]:Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T
wave changes. Left atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2163-5-13**] the ST-T wave changes are more prominent and
may represent superimposed inferolateral ischemic process.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.
.
Renal U/S [**5-31**]: IMPRESSION: No solid renal masses identified.
Echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic renal disease and
multiple bilateral small simple renal cysts.
.
CXR: Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess as there are
dense fluffy bilateral perihilar consolidations, obscuring the
heart borders. Pulmonary vascularity is increased, with
cephalization. There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2163-3-24**] TTE - The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 9 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric LVH with a small cavity and
hyperdynamic systolic function. Minimal resting LVOT
obstruction. Moderate functional mitral stenosis. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old woman with hx of diastolic CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD
presenting with acute hypoxia and hypertensive urgency
.
# Hypoxia: Given her hx of severe dCHF, difficulty removing
fluid at HD due to LVOT obstruction, pulmonary edema on
presentation CXR, hypoxia appeared most consistent with
diastolic CHF exacerbation.  As she was hypertensive to the 200s
systolic and reported palpitations prior to admission, both htn
and perhaps a.fib with RVR caused worsening of her pulmonary
edema on presentation.  Although she had leukocytosis, she was
without fever, cough, sputum production to suggest underlying
pulmonary infection.  She does have hyperinflated lungs on CXR
and was mildly bronchospastic on admission, so she was started
on azithromycin, spireva, and albuterol nebs.  Cardiac enzymes
x3 showed flat troponin at 0.04-0.05 and negative MBI so as not
to suggest ischemic event.  As she has no PFTs in our system,
she should follow up for outpatient PFTs.  Additionally, as she
is on 2L O2 via nasal cannula at night (prescribed by outside
MD), she should have outpatient sleep study.
.
# Leukocytosis:  All cell lines were up on presentation however
this was pre HD/UF so unlikely due entirely to
hemoconcentration.  She was, however, without fever and no clear
source of infection.  CXR showed pulmonary edema and small
effusions without clear evidence of infiltrate and she was
without cough and fever.  UA was negative for infection.  She
had no GI symptoms to suggest as possible infective source.  As
she was initially mildly bronchospastic on exam, she was started
on azithromycin x 5 day course.
.
# ? COPD:  No formal diagnosis, however lungs markedly
hyperinflated on CXR and with significant pack year history of
tobacco use with continued use (although less so).  There was
initially some concern for COPD contributing to her hypoxia
given mild bronchospasm on presentation.  She was started on
spireva and albuterol nebs as well as azithromycin and her exam
improved markedly.  She should follow up for outpatient PFTs.
.
# Erythrocytosis:  Previous baseline hct high 20s-low 30s.  She
presented with hct 51-->43.  Last HD/UF session was 3 days PTA
so seemed unlikely all hemoconcentration; she did report poor PO
however.  She has not been receiving epogen at HD session per
renal as her hgb has been > goal.  Renal U/S was negative for
mass suggestive of erythropoietin producing mass.  An epo level
was sent.
.
# End-stage renal disease: She was continued on her home phos
binder and nephroca
