effusions and O2 sats decreased to 92% on RA.  Sats successfully
increased with 2L NC.  He was found to be in atrial fibrillation
and was sent to the ICU d/t need of diltiazem gtt. He had a
temperature of 101.7 and increased to 11.3 from 10.0 so blood
cultures were sent and came back negative. Cardiology was
consulted on the patient and he was successfuly weaned off dilt
and rate controlled on lopressor (100TID).  Patient was able to
be transferred out of the SICU to the floor with telemetry where
his rate-controlled Afib was monitored.  Cardiology recommended
coumadin for anticoagulation before cardioversion.  While
awaiting cardioversion, he converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He
had an episode of bradycardia POD He also experienced knee pain
on POD3.  His knee was swollen and warm. An xray showed no
fractures.  A joint fluid evaluation revealed high WBC and
crystals consistent with gout.

be followed up with by his PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18835**] for cardioversion in

knee pain was improving. Physical therapy was set up to assist
