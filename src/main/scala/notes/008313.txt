History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 y/o man with alcoholic cirrhosis with
recently diagnosed SMV thrombus now transferred to the MICU with
hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. Please see
H&P from [**2159-11-7**] for full details of his admission; he
originally presented with nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension,

nonocclusive SMV thrombus on CT [**11-7**]. He was started on heparin
gtt after banding of three esophageal varices on [**11-8**];
transplant surgery was consulted due to SMV thrombus and are
following along with patient. He has had worsening renal failure
with creatinine > 3 which was presumed HRS.

RUQ US: Cirrhosis and ascites. No evidence of portal vein
thrombosis. Severe splenomegaly.

CT head: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.

CT abd: Stable findings of cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
splenomegaly.  Abnormal lack of migration of oral contrast
administered three days prior. Interval development of multiple
dilated small bowel loops, with gradual tapering to thickened
distal small bowel loops and no focal point of obstruction
identified. The lack of motility (and distal small bowel wall
thickening) may be secondary to the patient's known SMV
thrombosis causing venous ischemia. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis
admitted with abdominal pain/distension requiring transfer to
MICU upon development of hypotension/bradycardia and altered
mental status.  Initially there was concern for SBP, however
diagnostic tap was negative.  Abdominal CT revealed an SMV
thrombosis with some small bowel thickening.  Because of the
patient's severe liver disease it was decided to treat the
patient conservatively as the patient would be unlikely to
tolerate an operative procedure.  Over the ensuing days, the
patient never developed significant abdominal exam changes or
hard laboratory evidence of ischemic bowel, and thus
conservative management continued.  On [**2159-11-13**] a liver became
available.  The patient was taken to the operating room for
transplantation.  Upon exploring the abdomen prior to commencing
with the transplant, the patient was found to have 75 cm of
necrotic but not perforated small bowel.  This small bowel was
resected with primary anastomosis.  No transplant was performed
at this time.  Rather the patient was transferred back to the
ICU on the transplant surgical service.

Post operatively, the patient had uncontrolled diabetes
requiring insulin gtt, hemodynamic instability requiring
pressors and swan ganz catheter placement, acute renal failure,
as well as a significant fluid requirement due to significant
ascitic losses through JP drains.

On [**11-14**] the patient returned to the operating room for a second
look.  No new compromised bowel was seen at this time.
Furthermore, his new anastomosis appeared intact.  Subsequent to
this operation, it was anticipated that if the patient
stabilized after a few days he would be relisted for liver
transplant.  Because the patient did not seem to wake up
subsequent to surgery, he underwent head CT scanning, which
revealed no acute abnormality.  TPN was started for nutrition.
Pressor, insulin, fluid, antibiotoc management continued.  Over
the next days, the team was please to find the patient holding
his own.  His pressor requirement resolved and his acute renal
failure improved.

On [**2160-11-18**] the patient returned to the operating room for liver
transplantation.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He
had no pressor requirement immediately postop.  As per protocol
the patient received solumedrol, mycophenolate, valcyte,
bactrim, and fluconazole.  He also remained on vancomycin and
ceftriaxone.  Typical liver transplant resussitation ensued with
fluid and blood products.  Overnight the patient developed rapid
atrial flutter refractory to beta blockade or diltiazem.  He was
given amiodarone which corrected his arrhythmia.

Postop day 1 the patient had a liver ultrasound which was normal
with good vascular flow.  He was started on tacrolimus.  An echo
was performed which showed an EF of 55% and normal function.
The amiodarone was stopped due to concern for liver toxicity,
and the patient was placed on lopressor.

Intraabdominal cultures returned with VRE as did blood cultures.
 Antibiotics were changed to daptomycin and zosyn per infectious
disease consult.  The patient continued to require extensive
intensive care for blood pressure control, as he intermittently
needed pressors, hyperglycemia, fluid resuscitation due to
persistent extensive ascitic output from drains.  On [**2159-11-23**] an
abdominal CT scan raised the question of an anastomotic leak;
however, on further scrutiny, it was determined that the patient
did not have an active leak.  Repeat CT on the 7th again raised
question of small bowel leak although no active extravisation
was noted.  SMV thromosis was persistent with mild bowel
thickening.  The patient was observed until the 11th at which
time, due to failure to progress, the patient was taken to the
operating room for exploration.  Indeed a leak was noted at the
jejunojejunostomy.  This was revised.

Subsequent to this revision he improved and was extubated on
[**12-4**].  That same day,  subtherapeutic heparin dose was started
for SMV thrombosis.  A subtherapeutic dose was chosen to make
sure the patient did not have any bleeding complications.
Unfortunately, the patient had a torrential nose bleed requiring
packing by ENT and reintubation.  Thereafter, the patient
received a tracheostomy.  After the revision, the patient's
drain output also began to decrease significantly.  His lateral
drain was removed and diuresis was commenced although
sluggishly.  His renal function returned essentially to normal.
His liver function slowly began to improve.  The patient was
easily transitioned to trach mask and his mental status improved
greatly.  During this time, the patient did become neutropenic
requiring temporary hold on mycophenolate. Neupogen was given.
Tube feeds were started 1 week out from this revision and
heparin anticoagulation was resumed.  Both were well tolerated.
TPN was stopped.

Over the weekend of [**3-12**],the VAC dre
