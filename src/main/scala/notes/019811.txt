History of Present Illness:
77 year old Male with history of Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,
Peripheral Vascular Disease presenting to OSH ED last night with
Chest Pain, Shortness Of Breath, nausea and elevated Blood
Pressure to 200s/100s. Over the last 2 years, he has experienced
intermittent chest pain, unable to define how often it occurs,
that starts in the abdomen and radiates to the chest, which
resolves on its own after about 15-20 minutes.  He does note
that it's associated with activity, but anxiety is also a
component.  In addition, over the last 2 years he has felt
weaker and gets more short of breath when walking, and
occasionally chest pain with activity.  No symptoms at rest.  Pt
had stress mibi in [**3-11**] that showed poor exercise tolerance, no
angina but reversible mild perfusion defect.  Over the last
week, episodes have increased in frequency, about 2-3 times over
the last week he has experienced chest pain, which resolved
within 15 minutes as usual, but on night of presentation he had
chest pain that lasted for about 2 hours, did not resolve. Onset
was while driving and worsened after he sat down to watch TV.
.
He presented initially to [**Hospital3 **] hospital because his pain did
not resolve. BP on prsentation initially 133/94, increased to
169/104 and later noted to be 200s/100s per report (although
this is not documented in OSH dc summary).  On EKG [**Last Name (LF) 90446**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
depressions noted in anterolateral leads, Q waves in V1 V2, ST
elevations in V1-V2. On f/u EKG, findings were similar, but in
addition noted to have ST elevation in aVR. He ruled in for
NSTEMI at OSH ST changes as above, in addition noted to have
elevated enzymes (trop I increased from .06 -> 32.9, CKMB 5.4 ->
162.9.  He was started on NTG gtt, morphine, aspirin, and loaded
with plavix 300 mg, heparin gtt was started with bolus.  Also
given metoprolol and lasix with relief of chest pain.  He was
admitted to CCU at OSH where he experienced no further chest
pain.  He was continued on NTG gtt at 10 mcg.  Referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for left heart cath.  VS on transfer 198/99 temp 98.5, HR 67, RR
15-20, sat 97% on 2L NC.
.
L heart cath showed diffuse disease, with stenosis of 70% L
main, 70% prox LAD, 80% ostial RCA, EF 45%. LVEDP noted to be 35
mmHg.  Femoral sheath was left in place and cardiac surgery team
was called to evaluate for bypass surgery.  Patient is currently
chest pain free and has been since admission to OSH.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
multiple complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on no inotropic infusions. There is
a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is a peak gradient of 16 mmHg and a
mean gradient of 8 mmHg across the aortic valve. Biventricular
function is unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The
aorta is intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was transferred in from OSH for evaluation of coronary
artery revascularization. He was initially plavix loaded and
patient was stable,therefore surgery was postponed for plavix
washout.  IABP placement was deferred due to tortuous
vessels/PVD and patient remained hemodynamically stable and
chest pain free.  He was continued on a NTG drip to decrease
preload / diastolic pressures improve coronary blood flow. He
was continued on a heparin drip and his home ASA was increased
to 325 mg PO daily.  His atenolol was changed to metoprolol, and
his simvastatin 40mg daily was changed to atorvastatin 80mg
daily.  He was started on lisinopril, but this was the held
secondary to acute renal failure.

Creatinine on admission 1.1, increased to 1.6 after cath. His
lisinopril was held.
Referred for surgery and underwent AVR (#25mm St.[**
