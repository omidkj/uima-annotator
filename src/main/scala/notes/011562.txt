Pertinent Results:
[**11-5**] Echo: PREBYASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] was notified in person.
POSTBYPASS:The patient is on Epi @0.2mcg/kg/min ,
levo@.2mcg/kg/min There is now a 27 bioprosthetic valve in place
The mean gradient across the valve is 10 with no paravalvular
leaks The EF is 20%,no dissection flaps seen in the aorta. The
rest of the exam in unchanged
