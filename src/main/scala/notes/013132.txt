given a dose of IV solumedrol, then converted to PO prednisone
60mg, to be tapered over 5 days.  He was also started on a 5d
course of Azithromcyin. He was continued on nebulizers and
inhaled steroids.  He will need PFTs as an outpatient, as he has
never had these before. Pt improved clinically (was weaned off
O2 supplementation) and was discharged with ambulatory sats in
90-92% range.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a COPD
exacerbation.  You were started on prednisone pills to help
decrease the inflammation in your lungs, which will make you
feel better.  The prednisone will be tapered, as directed below.
 You were also started on an antibiotic, which yo ucan continue
to take at home as directed below.  Finally, it is important
that you continue to take your inhalers as prescribed.  Please
keep your follow-up appointment with your primary care doctor as
shown below, as you may need a referral to a pulmonologist for
further treatment and monitoring of your COPD.

As we discussed, you have a predisposition towards diabetes, and
the prednisone can increase your blood sugars. It is important
that you keep with the diabetic diet, not just cutting back on
sugars but also cutting back on starches such as potatoes.

Please remember to have your PSA drawn at your
