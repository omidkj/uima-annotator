Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Guaifenesin AC

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis with placement and removal of pleurex catheter
Bronchoscopy with biopsy


History of Present Illness:
81F w/ history of depression in the past, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism, was in usual state of
health until about 2 weeks ago when she called her PCP c/o SOB
and some confusion. PCP was able to set up chest x-ray, CT scan
of the chest, MRI of the brain. Chest CT showing a near complete
collapse of the left upper lobe of the lung, with mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy, and an MRI of the brain with multiple
lesions consistent with likely metastasis.

Was going to have outpatient evaluation however had worsening
SOB and referred to ED. On arrival was triggered for
hypoxia/hypotension upon arrival. +coughing. SOB worse with
exertion. No fever. No abd pain. No CP. CT on [**2-2**] showed Left
upper lobe collapse, concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma.
possible mets seen.


In the ED, initial VS were were significant for O2 sats of 80%
on room air. CXR shwoed left sided pleural effusion. She was
seen by IP who placed pig-tail catheter and removed 1L fluid.
Her hypoxia improved and prior to transfer she was requiring 1L
NC. She became hypotensive to SBP 80 and received 1L NS with SBP
coming up to low 90's. Second liter running at time of sign out.


Labs signficiant for WBC of 16, Cr of 1.9 (baseline 1.0), K of
2.6. She received 40meQ KcL and K in her IVF. She was also
started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for possible PNA.
Levofloxacin caused red splotches

On arrival to the MICU, She is complaining of left shoulder pain
with coughing and deep breaths.


Past Medical History:
- Depression
- high cholesterol
- hypertension
- hypothyroidism
- osteoarthritis
- ulcerative proctitis


Social History:
60 pack year smoking history.  Quit 15-20 years ago.
She is widowed.  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 745**].
She has two daughters who are very involved.  She worked
previously as a bookkeeper.  She is quite active.  She spends

Pleural Fluid Cytology:
ATYPICAL.
 	
 	Few atypical cells (see note).
 	
 	Note: Rare groups of atypical epithelioid cells are seen in
 	a background of reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and
 	mixed inflammatory cells. Two concurrent hematology slides
 	(1364D) were also reviewed. A cell block specimen
 	(S12-4617D) was prepared in an attempt to better
 	characterize the atypical cells, but these cells were not
 	seen on the cell block preparation. Preliminary results were
 	e-mailed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13670**] on [**2201-2-10**], and the final
 	results were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on [**2201-2-12**].

MICROBIOLOGY
==============
All blood, urine, and pleural fluid cultures without growth.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
ECG [**2201-2-9**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Low voltage. Borderline
intraventricular
conduction delay. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2187-12-21**] voltage has decreased. ST-T wave abnormalities are
new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Chest Radiograph [**2201-2-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Left hilar mass with left upper lobe collapse and likely
partial left
lower lobe collapse. Small left pleural effusion also noted.
2. Increasing airspace consolidation in the right upper lobe
abutting the
minor fissure is compatible with pneumonia.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2201-2-20**]
6:04 PM
A clip is identified within the lower pole of the left thyroid
gland, unchanged from prior. The remainder of the gland is
homogeneous without focal nodule. No supraclavicular or axillary
lymphadenopathy is identified. Multiple enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes overall appear slightly larger as compared to recent
prior. A pretracheal lymph node previously measured 11 mm in
short-axis diameter and is unchanged (3:40) and a subcarinal
lymph node currently measures 22 mm and previously measured 19
mm (3:55). A right hilar lymph node measures 17 mm and
previously measured 15 mm (3:53). A superior pretracheal lymph
node is
enlarged measuring 15 x 11 mm as compared to 12 x 7 mm on the
prior (3:29).
The heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
Extensive
coronary atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are unchanged.
The thoracic aorta is non-aneurysmal throughout its course and
demonstrates no signs of acute aortic syndrome. There is no
pulmonary embolism to subsegmental levels.
There is unchanged complete collapse of the left upper lobe.
However, there is now complete lobar collapse of the left lower
lobe; these findings are new from prior CT though similar to
multiple recent chest radiographs. The left mainstem bronchus is
obliterated just beyond its origin, which may be due to mucous
plugging or bronchial invasion by tumor. There is increasing
midline shift of mediastinal structures, consistent with volume
loss and progressive atelectasis. There is increasing
non-hemorrhagic pleural fluid bilaterally, large on the left and
small on the right.
The aerated right lung demonstrates moderate-to-severe
centrilobular
emphysema. A calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe is
stable as
compared to prior examination (3J:71). An adjacent previously
described 3-mm nodule is not well seen. Interlobular septal
thickening, ground-glass
opacities, and micronodular opacities predominantly with a
perifissural
distribution have increased and now involve both the anterior
and posterior aspects of the right upper lobe, and perifissural
portions of the right middle and lower lobes. Regions of more
confluent consolidation along the inferior margin of the right
upper lobe along the major and minor fissure, may reflect
confluent nodularity or subsegmental atelectasis(500B:12). The
overall increase in reticular-nodular septal thickening and
ground-glass opacities suggest either progressive lymphangitic
spread of tumor, infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Though not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, again seen
are multiple punctate hypodensities throughout the liver,
findings most consistent with biliary hamartomas. However, an
ill-defined hypodensity in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]/VIII has increased in
size, now measuring 2.1 x 2.0 cm as compared with 1.1 x 1.3 cm
on the prior examination (3:98), findings concerning for
progression of disease. An additional 1.0 x 0.9 cm ill-defined
nodule is newly identified in segment VII
