History of Present Illness:
69yo M PMhx afib on coumadin, psuedomonal pneumonia c/b
intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure c/b difficult weaning
requiring tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheostomy
bleeding, also w recurrent bilateral pulmonary effusions s/p
bilateral chest tubes,
now p/w progressive SOB x1d found to have Hct 18 at OSH, CXR w
R-sided pleural effusion. Patient reports that during week prior
to admission, he experienced progressive dyspnea on exertion; he
denied chest pain, dizziness, HA, motor/sensory deficits during
this time. He did report mild epistaxis, but denied hematuria,
hematemesis, melena, hematochezia. Patient was transfused 1 unit
pRBCs and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

HR 81-86, RR 16-17, SpO2 95-100% on 3L (baseline). Exam was
recorded as signifcant for decreased R sided breath sounds; no
rectal exam or guaiac was performed. Labs were significant for
WBC 12.3, Hct 20.6, Cr 0.3. CXR demonstrated R sided pleural
effusions, as well as potential bilateral infiltrates. EKG w/o

CXR [**2126-7-29**]
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, increased since the prior study,
and likely at least partially loculated.
2. Ovoid right base opacity, while could represent loculated
fluid,
consolidated mass is not excluded. Additional bibasilar
opacities are seen, while could represent combination of
effusion and atelectasis, additional consolidations not
excluded. Ill-defined right upper lung opacification has
decreased since the prior study, with some mild residua
remaining. There is also patchy opacity at the left mid to lower
lung.
.

CT Chest [**2126-7-30**]
Overall decrease in extent of the bilateral pleural effusions,
the effusions, however, are now loculated but without evidence
of focal
pleural thickening or focal hyperenhancement.
Adjacent areas of atelectasis. Most of the pre-existing
additional
parenchymal opacities have either cleared or substantially
decreased in
extent.
Emphysema, mucus in both the larger and smaller airways.
Moderate enlargement of the pulmonary artery. Coronary
calcifications.
Healed rib fractures, vertebral wedge deformity, all unchanged
since the
previous CT.
.
[**2126-8-2**] Video Swallow
Evidence of aspiration with thin liquids. For full details,
please refer to the speech and swallow note in the OMR.




Brief Hospital Course:
69yo M PMhx of ETOH abuse, afib on Coumadin, COPD, CHF, Recent
pneumonia c/b intubation requiring tracheostomy [**1-30**] difficulty
weaning, H/o DVT and PE, also w recurrent bilateral pulmonary
effusions s/p bilateral chest tubes, who presented with acute
anemia and possible R-sided consolidation.
.
#Hypoxia: Pt was found to have bilateral pleural effusion at the
time of his admission and possible R sided consolidation.  He
was started on  zosyn, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin and
completed an 8 day course of treatment for HAP, completed on
[**2126-8-5**].  He underwent diagnostic thoracentesis on [**2126-7-31**] of the
right pleural effusion and then chest tube was placed to
suction.  The patient experienced an hypoxic episode 2 hours
after chest tube placement, two CXRs confirmed correct tube
placement and the absence of a pneumothorax. The patient
stabilized after NT suction.  Effusion was noted to be exudative
from CHF.  In the mean time, echocardiogram was obtained showing
moderate to severe heart failure and aggressive medical
management of heart failure was recommended.  Pt was
aggressively diuresed which improved hypoxia, but no improvement
in chest tube output.  He began to develop difficulty with thick
secretions on [**2126-8-7**] for which regimen frequent suctioning,
chest PT, and deep suctioning was started.  Chest tube remained
in place draining 100-300cc daily until decided to d/c chest
tube on [**2126-8-9**] to avoid further complication.
.
On [**2126-8-9**] Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] became unresponsive, hypoxic, and
hypotensive, and a code blue was called. He was intubated and
transferred to the ICU. He required intermittent pressors for
several days thought to be secondary to sepsis.  Pneumonia vs.
aspiration were thought to be the cause of his respiratory
failure, and he was started on Tobramycin/Vancomycin/Zosyn for
coverage of his known bugs and empirically.  He was also
diuresed aggressively.  The MICU team noted difficulty weaning
the vent secondary to secretions.  On [**2126-8-15**] he self-extubated,
was transitioned from a bag mask (immediately after extubation)
to a NRB and was weaned to a face mask. He tolerated the
extubation and change to face mask well.  He was transferred to
the floor on [**8-16**].

On the medical floor, he developed interm
