Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI, vfib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o M who while working at [**Hospital1 778**] started complaining of
substernal chest pain. EKG at the park showed STEMI, he received
aspirin 325 mg, and he was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**]. Initial
systolic BP at [**Hospital1 778**] was in the 90s. While enroute, he lost his
pulse and arrested. He underwent CPR for approximately one to
two minutes prior to arriving in the ED. He was intubated. In
the ED, he was in Vfib. At that time he received 2 shocks. He
also received epinephrine and atropine x1 dose each. He also
received one dose of amiodarone. A pulse was obtained and a
systolic blood pressure in the 90s. He was started on levophed
and dopamine prior to cath. He went into afib and then sinus
tachycardia.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were unobtained as patient in wide
complex rhythm without a pulse. See above for code sequence.
.
He was taken directly to the cath lab. In the cath lab, he had
proximal LAD occlusion with residual mid and distal disease, had
placement of 2 promus stents in proximal LAD, 2 cipher stents
distally. Placed on integrillin and heparin. Stopped integrillin
and heparin b/c had petechiae on legs b/l. He did have hypoxia,
which was due to ventilator malfunction and cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was
reintubated in the cath lab. By the end of the procedure, he was
weaned off the dopamine and levophed. During cath CO=9, CI=4.5.
Required a large amount of sedation for the cath. Had arterial
sheath in, large bore so pulled in lab. A femoral swan catheter
remained in place.
.
In the lab, he received an amiodarone gtt, dopamine gtt,
levophed gtt, propofol gtt, bolus of succinylcholine and
vecuronium, bolus of versed, bolus of heparin and integrilin and
plavix 600 mg. The dopamine and levophed were weaned prior to
transfer.
.
ROS and specifically, cardiac review of systems could not be
obtained as patient intubated and sedated. While in the CCU,
patient dropped BP's to 70's systolic (also in the setting of
sedation), and required levophed briefly. An arterial line was
placed. Was weaned overnight.

Imaging:
C Cath ([**2165-3-25**])
COMMENTS:
1- Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one
vessel disease. The LMCA ahd RCA had no angiographically
apparent
disease. The LAD was proximally occluded. The LCx had mild
diffuse
disease without angiographically significant stenoses.
2- Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 18mmHg. The PCWP was elevated at 21mmHg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial systemic hypertension with PASP 39mmHg.
The
cardiac index was preserved at 4.2 L/min/m2. The systemic
arterial blood
pressure was normal with SBP 119mmHg and DBP 72mmHg.
3- Successful primary angioplasty of the LAD with placement of 4
DESs:
two overlapping Promus DESs to the culprit lesion at proximal
LAD
(3.0x18 and 3.0x8 mm) and two overlapping Cypher DESs to the mid
LAD
(3.0x13 and 3.0x8 mm) with excellent results (see PTCA Comments)

4- Successful closure of the RCFA (arteriotomy) with a 6F
Angioseal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1- One vessel coronary artery disease.
2- Elevated right sided filling pressures and PCWP.
3- Preserved cardiac index.
4- Successful primary angioplasty to the LAD with two Promus DES
to mid
vessel (culprit lesion)
5- Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with two Cypher
DESs
6- Successful closure of the RCFA (arteriotomy) with a 6F
Angioseal

Echo ([**2165-3-26**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis
of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR:
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though there may be mild
retrocardiac atelectatic changes.

CT head:
1. Left parietal hypodensity with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation concerning for acute or early subacute infarct.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M who presented with substernal chest pain, STEMI and
Vfib arrest.
.
# Cardiogenic Shock: On admission, patient in cardiogenic shock
from STEMI with Vfib arrest. Had elevated filling pressures in
the lab, CO 9 and CI 4.5. Intially had required levophed and
dopamine to maintain BP's, weaned off within hours of leaving
the lab. Found to have multiple tight lesions in LAD. BP
improved after PTCA and stents.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Patient with STEMI, proximal LAD
occlusion with residual mid and distal disease, had placement of
2 promus stents in proximal LAD, 2 cipher stents distally.
Started on Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week
then 75mg daily, ASA 325mg daily. Metoprolol Succinate
