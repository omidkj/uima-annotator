History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old man on 81 mg Aspirin daily who
presumably fell this week but is amnestic to the event.  He is
accompanied by his wife who states that he has been in bed with
nausea and vomiting since Wednesday. He states that he went out
with friends and has alcoholic beverages on Tuesday evening but
does not recall falling.  He was brought to the ED at [**Hospital **]
Hospital after his daughter noted that he was not acting "right"
according to his wife who does not reside in the same home.

The patient presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with a healed
laceration over the top of his head and ecchymosis around the
inner canthus of the right eye.  A Head CT was performed which
was consistent with Sub Dural Hematoma.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Currently, the patient denies numbness tingling sensation, bowel
or bladder dysfunction, or weakness.  He reports right hip pain
and nausea.  He appears sleepy during the exam and requires

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]       [**Hospital1 18**] [**Numeric Identifier 54877**]Portable TTE
(Complete) Done [**2139-1-5**] at 2:58:37 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Mild pulmonary
artery hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta. No structural
cardiac cause of syncope identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

 Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2139-1-4**]
4:42 AM

IMPRESSION:
Unchanged degree of right SDH. Left frontal SDH appears slightly
more
prominent on todays study.
Blood is also noted within the falx and the right tentorium.
Stable right
frontal parenchymal hematoma with surr vasogenic edema as well
as parenchymal
hemorrhage affecting the left frontal lobe is noted. Possible
intraventricular
extension with blood layering in the left ventricle.
2. 5mm leftward shift of midline structures is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.




Brief Hospital Course:
On [**1-3**], The patient was consulted by this service in the
Emergency Department.  The patient was loaded with Dilantin 1 gm
IV for seizure prophylaxis.  Decision was made to hold his daily
Aspirin 81mg.  The patient had painful range of motion of the
right hip.  A hip xray was performed which was consistent with
no fracture or dislocation. A head Ct was performed which was
consistent with right SDH, Left frontal SDH and Falx SDH and
along the right tentorium. Right frontal parenchymal hematoma.
The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery service to the
intensive care unit with q 1 hour neurological assessment.
Blood presure goal was systolic range of 100-140.

On [**1-4**], The patient was transferred to floor on telemetry.  The
patient required nicardipine intravenous drip which was
trnsitioned to Labetalol 200 mg PO/NG TID
labetolol for blood pressure control.  The primary care
physician was called to notify of patient's admission to the
hospital. The patient was febrile to 101.

On [**1-5**], The patient's serum NA 130 was and Sodium Chloride tabs
1 gm TID were initiated. The serum potassium was low and was
repleated. The patient had low grade fevers and the tylenol was
held as to not mask a temperature spike.  The patient was
tremulous in the bilateral upper extremities and was treated
with ativan PRN per CIWA scale.  An ECHOcardiogram was performed
which was normal.  A carotid ultrasound was performed which
showed <40% stenosis bilaterally.  A dilantin level was sent and
was 8.2. Overnight into 1.17 he was febrile to 102.8

On [**1-6**] he was neurologically intact, his dilantin was changed
to keppra, his diet was advanced, and he worked with PT. He was
DC'd to rehab facility on [**1-7**] in stable condition.
