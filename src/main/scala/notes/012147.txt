History of Present Illness:
63yo F w hx of HTN, s/p liver transplant w refractory afib/RVR
on coumadin and amiodarone, recently hosp'd for afib [**2116-8-24**],
and diagnosed by pcp with PNA on [**9-9**] (Rx: bactrim and doxy) as
outpatient, admitted through ED with c/o increasing dyspnea,
[**Location (un) **], 10 pound weight gain over 10 days. Denies CP. Failed
cardioversion x 2 on last admission and Amiodarone loaded at
time of discharge. Pt reports that she was in slow afib for
17days after discharge and self-converted on Friday [**9-4**]. 2
days later, she started to feel like she had "pneumonia without
fever or cough" a/w DOE, [**Location (un) **], wt gain. Also reports nasal
congestion, green post-nasal drip, headache, 1 week of loose
stool. No sick contacts. She has been on oral [**Location (un) 621**] for pna vs
sinus infection (rx'd by pcp) since Wed [**9-9**]. Low grade temps
99-100.0 over past week. Pt came to ED w worsening SOB that she
attributes to the amiodarone.
Of note, pt planned ablation for afib this Thursday [**9-17**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
In the ED, vitals on intake 98.6 56 125/74 16 100%. She c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
L>R and CTA obtained which was negative for PE. Labs: BNP is
950, trop<0.01, K 3.1 repleted to 4.0, INR 3.4. Given aspirin
325mg. Chest xray: minimal interstitial prominence/edema
suggesting fluid overload. Not hypoxic.
Pt admitted for CHF exacerbation and tune up prior to ablation.
.
On transfer to the floor, confirms 10days of DOE, [**Location (un) **], orthopnea
(3 pillow), fatigue. +Weight gain from 143lb to 153lb on
admission. Denies any CP or palpitations. She believes that
these symptoms are related to the amiodarone and did not take it
this AM. She also reports symptoms consistent with URI: dry
cough, low grade fever, nasal congestion w green mucus, HA, and
1 week loose stool.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias. S/he denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
or syncope or presyncope.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed
of the
bilateral common femoral and left-sided superficial femoral,
popliteal and
calf vessels. Vessels demonstrated normal flow, compressibility
and
augmentation. There is a prominent greater saphenous vein, which
compresses
normally. There is edema within the ankle.

IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity. Prominent,
patent
superficial vein.
.
Chest xray
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Mild
blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles persists, consistent
with small
bilateral pleural effusions. Mild diffuse prominence of the
interstitial
markings suggests minimal interstitial edema. Prominence of the
ascending
aorta persists. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The
aorta is
calcified and tortuous. No new focal consolidation is seen.
Surgical clips
are noted in the midline of the upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION:

Small bilateral pleural effusions and minimal interstitial
prominence/edema
suggesting fluid overload. Stable enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette.
.
CTA Chest
FINDINGS:
There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree,
with no
filling defects identified to the subsegmental level to suggest
pulmonary
embolus. The main pulmonary artery is prominent, measuring 3.1
cm, which may reflect mild pulmonary hypertension.
The ascending aorta is again dilated, measuring up to 4.3 cm,
though this is stable from [**2116-3-23**].  The heart is
enlarged. There is prominence of the right atrium, with reflux
of contrast into the IVC, hepatic and azygous veins. There is no
pericardial effusion. There are small bilateral simple pleural
effusions, with associated atelectasis. There is minimal septal
thickening.
There is a subcentimeter per-carinal lymph node. The trachea and
central
airways are patent to the subsegmental level. The esophagus is
normal. There is a small sliding-type hiatal hernia.
The lung parenchyma is clear, without focal consolidation. There
is no
pneumothorax. There are no pulmonary nodules or masses.
There is no acute abnormality identified in the visualized
portion of the
upper abdomen. The bones demonstrate no suspicious lytic or
sclerotic osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome. No pneumonia.
2. Stable prominence of the ascending aorta, measuring up to 4.3
cm.
3. Findings compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
63 yoF s/p liver transplant with refractory AFib/RVR s/p
self-conversion on amiodarone presenting w DOE, orthopnea, [**Location (un) **],
and PND.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely acute on chronic diastoic heart failure
secondary to HTN induced LVH and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
exacerbated by recent 17day run of atrial fibrillation. Chest
xray and CTA suggestive of volume overload. PNA unlikely given
lack of findings on chest xray, afebrile,
