Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, transfer from [**Hospital3 3583**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
History is limited and is obtained from the patient's chart from
[**Hospital3 3583**], her [**Hospital1 18**] cath report, and her daughter.

Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o lady w/ h/o ?CAD (details unknown), HTN, COPD,
who presented with sudden onset of chest pain w/ radiation to
her left shoulder at 7 am today, upon waking. She also c/o of
diaphoresis, nausea, and associated shortness of breath. Of
note, she was feeling well up until the day before admission,
when she was driving to [**Company **], going shoppoing. She was
brought to [**Hospital3 3583**] by EMS at approximately 9 am and
given 4 ASA and 3 SL Nitro without relief. Upon arrival to
[**Last Name (LF) 46**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG revealed tombstoning ST elevations in V1-V6. She
was given a heparin bolus, drip started, aggrastat, morphine 4
mg, nitro, fluid bolus, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
emergent catheterization. On arrival, the patient was
communicative and still complaining of chest pain. Her blood
pressure was approximately 80/40, per cath lab report. Of note,
a loud systolic murmur was appreciated over the precordium. Cath
revealed the following:

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
significant
lesion. The LAD was diffusely diseased throughout the vessel
with a 50%
narrowing in the proximal vessel and serial 70-90% lesions in
the mid
and distal vessel. A large septal branch had an 80% ostial
lesion. The
LAd supplied a single, late diagonal branch that was free of
flow-limiting disease. The LCX had no angiographic disease and
supplied
a single, bifurcating OM branch before terminating in the AV
groove. The
RCA had diffuse disease proximally with a 90% stenosis. The mid
vessel
had a 50% tubular lesion before giving rise to moderate sized
PDA and
PLV branches. Competetive flow in the PDA and PLV could be seen.

2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right-sided
pressures
in the setting of systemic arterial hypotension despite the
administration of dopamine and levophed. For this reason and
because
there was flow in all coronary arteries, a PA catheter was
placed before
beginning any intervention. Right heart catheterization revealed
a PA
saturation of 87% raising concern for a left->right shunt. We
therefore
decided to proceed with left ventriculography.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated a large VSD with contrast
reflux
into the RV and RA. LVEF could not be calculated.
4. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed given her cardiogenic
shock.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior MI.
3. Large VSD.
4. Cardiogenic shock.
5. Placement of an IABP.

Patient was seen by CT surgery, but was not a candidate for
surgical intervention. Patient was then admitted to the CCU and
transitioned to comfort measures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given the patient's large anterior wall MI w/ VSD (wall
rupture), she was admitted to the CCU in critical condition,
still with an aortic balloon pump. Her condition was grave and
her daughter was at her bedside, aware of her prognosis. Upon
arrival to the CCU, the patient's pressors were turned off, the
balloon pump was transitioned to 1:8 from 1:1, and morphine was
ordered for comfort. She did not require any of this medication,
as she was very comfortable.

The CCU team was called to pronounce the patient just before 8
pm on [**10-15**]. She had no corneal reflex, dilated pupils, no
respiratory effort, no pulse, and was pronounced dead at 8:00
pm. Patient's daughter declined autopsy. Cause of death was
cardiac arrest, secondary to VSD and myocardial infarction. Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending, was notified. Medical examiner's office was
also notified, given patient's death within 24 hours of
admission. They declined autopsy as well.
