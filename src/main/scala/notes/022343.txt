CT head [**2131-5-24**]: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
edema.

ECHO [**2131-5-23**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is  moderately depressed with mid
to distal septal, distal LV and apical akinesis.  The anterior
wall is not well seen but appears hypokinetic. No LV thrombus is
 seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The  aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not  present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**11-27**]+)  mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is  no pericardial effusion.


ERCP [**2131-5-22**]:
Five fluoroscopic images were obtained in the ERCP suite without
the presence of a radiologist. The first demonstrates
opacification of the distal portion of the pancreatic duct, with
a subsequent image showing a stent placed across it. There is
opacification of the common bile duct, common hepatic and
intrahepatic biliary ducts, the cystic duct and gallbladder also
filled with contrast. Left hepatic distal duct has smooth
tapering with mild proximal dilatation.

The final image shows a stent across the common bile duct; the
pancreatic duct has been removed. Pancreatic duct stent has been
removed. The common bile duct by report drained purulent
material.

CTA chest [**2131-5-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Atherosclerotic ulcers of the aortic arch and descending
aorta.
2. No evidence of PE.
3. 10 mm gallstone as well as smaller gallbladder neck stone.
Possible gallbladder wall edema may be secondary to
pancreatitis.
4. Finding consistent with pancreatitis.

Abd u/s [**2131-5-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. 3.2 cm cyst within the lower pole of the right kidney.

bld cx [**2131-5-22**]: [**11-29**] E coli (pansensitive)
bld cx [**5-23**], [**5-24**]: no growth
urine cx [**5-22**]: no growth

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo man w/ HTN, DM presents with fever, hypotension and
epigastric discomfrot.
.
#. E coli septicemia:  Initially required ICU stay for pressors.
 Likely source was ascending cholangitis. LFTs were elevated to
ALT:777 AST:924 AlkPhos:367 Amylase:873. GI performed an ERCP on
[**2131-5-22**] and though no duct stone was found a CBD stent was
placed with subsequent purulent bile drained. E.coli grew out of
[**11-29**] of the original blood cultures and based on sensitivities
Unasyn was switched to levofloxacin ([**2131-5-24**]). The patient's
LFTs have trended down to normal since the ERCP. Subsequent
surveillance blood cultures negative.  On [**2131-5-24**] the diet was
advanced to solids, and the patient is tolerating this well.  He
is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-29**] months for a repeat ERCP
for stent replacement.  Other potential sources of infection
were ruled out, including no infiltrate on chest CTA and
negative urinalysis and urine culture.  No other signs/symptoms
of infection identified.
.
#. NSTEMI:
In setting of hypoxia and hypotension, patient had troponin peak
with anterior ischemic changes on EKG. Peak Troponin([**2131-5-23**])
1.59 Peak CK-MB:46 Index:11.5 has since trended down.
Cardiology was consulted and assisted with anticoagulation
during the ACS. Patient was treated with heparin x 72 hours.
Plavix was d/c due to falling platelets.  Final recommendation
to consider catheterization once medical issues improved, but
currently patient refusing.  I have scheduled follow-up with his
primary care doctor so that he can discuss this further.
.
## CHF:
Flash pulmonary edema during ICU stay which improved with
diuresis. ECHO [**2131-5-23**] shows EF 30-35%, no LV thrombus, and with
only [**11-27**]+ MR.  Discharged on ASA, statin, BB (changed from
atenolol to metoprolol XL), and ACEI.
.
# Pancreatitis:
Lipase peaked at 1538 and has subsequently trended down to 938.
Tolerating po with no pain.
.
# Rash: Preliminary path c/w hypersensitivity reaction, likely
due to unasyn but possible levofloxacin. Improving off
antibiotics. Managed with triamcinolone 0.1% cream [**Hospital1 **] (avoid
face, axilla, groin) x 2 weeks only.
.
# Seborrheic dermatitis: Started on nizoral 2% cream daily to
face and shampoo 3 times per week.
.
# Facial Droop: Developed in ICU. Neuro consulted. Stat head CT
showed no bleed. On statin. Glucose and bp well controlled
(hemoglobin A1c 6.2%).
.
#. Chronic renal insufficiency.
Creatinine stable. No issues.
.
#. DM. Patient eventually restarted on glyburide prior to
discharge with good control of blood sugars. Hgb A1c < 7%.
.
#. HYPOTHYROIDISM. TSH WNL.  Patient continued on his home dose
of levothyroxine.
.
#. FEN. Low sodium, diabetic, low fat diet.
.
