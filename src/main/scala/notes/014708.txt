Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer w/ abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
(History confirmed by sign-out from PCP and OSH notes)
.
[**Age over 90 **]M anesthesiologist h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 45%), pAF s/p
pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome, AS and MR, CRI, esophageal
stricture s/p PEG, and recent PNA c/b C diff, transferred from
[**Hospital3 3583**] with abdominal pain [**1-9**] known CDiff colitis.
Three weeks prior to admission, pt had been diagnosed with PNA
and treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate at OSH, after which he
developed C. diff colitis, for which he was treated with
vancomycin/metronidazole and then transferred to rehab.  Three
days prior to admission, pt developed T 103.9, vomiting and was
admitted to OSH, where CXR showed RLL PNA (recurrent vs
persistent) with positive C. diff toxin.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
underwent a CT scan chest/abd/pelvis w/o contrast today which
showed new ascites, cholelithiasis, B renal cysts, subcutaneous
edema, an IM lipoma, and no obvious source of abdominal pain.
Pt also had a negative HIDA scan.
.
Because pt had been "yelling in agony for up to 6 hours" at the
OSH, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u.  Of note, pt
had been transfused 2 units PRBC given decreased hematocrit of
27 from baseline 32, in the setting of chronically
guaiac-positive stools.
.
In the MICU, patient reported an intermittent [**8-17**] "sensation"
in his abdomen which was best characterized as colicky pain.
.
ROS: Positive for intermittent [**9-16**] abdominal pain.  Negative
for SOB, cough, fever, nausea, myalgia/arthralgia.

Studies:
.
# CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2139-8-1**] 3:20 PM
The patient is status post sternotomy, with moderately severe
cardiomegaly and a calcified aorta. The hila appear prominent,
suggesting pulmonary hypertension. A left-sided pacemaker is
present, lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. There
is a focal opacity adjacent to the left hilum, of uncertain
etiology or significance. There is patchy opacity diffusely
throughout the right lung -- at least some of this is thought to
represent CHF, with superimposed more consolidative process.
There are bilateral right greater than left effusions. No
pneumothorax is detected. A right subclavian PICC line is
present, tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. There is
probably fluid in the minor fissure, accounting for some of the
opacity seen in the right lung.  A rounded loop linear density
is seen adjacent to the right main stem bronchus. This lies
near, but is not clearly related to the PICC line. Attention to
this area on followup films is recommended. This may also lie
outside the patient.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. PICC line at cavoatrial junction. Unusual loop-like structure
near it, but not clearly arising from it. Attention to this area
on followup films is recommended. No pneumothorax.
2. Doubt CHF. Bilateral pleural effusions. Question underlying
pneumonia.
.
# LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2139-8-1**] 8:55 AM
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There are multiple layering
gallstones. The gallbladder is not distended and there is no
wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. A [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was not
elicited. The common bile duct is not dilated. The liver
demonstrates no echotextural or focal abnormalities. The main
portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow.
Increased pulsatility likely reflects right heart failure. There
are multiple cysts in the right kidney, the largest within the
lower pole measuring 3.4 x 3.2 x 3.7 cm with a single thin
septation. There is a moderate-sized right-sided pleural
effusion and trace perihepatic ascites.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
3. 3.7-cm renal cyst with single septation.
.
# CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O
CONTRAST
[**2139-8-1**] 1:13 AM
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary
adenopathy. AP window lymph nodes measure up to 1.3 cm in size.
No other mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is appreciated.
Examination of soft tissue windows also demonstrates marked
vascular calcifications involving the aortic arch as well as the
descending thoracic aorta. Impressive coronary artery
calcifications are also present. Marked cardiomegaly is present.
A dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker is present. A moderate-large
right-sided pleural effusion is present, as well as a small
left-sided pleural effusion with some fluid loculated within the
major fissure.
.
Examination of lung windows demonstrates a patency of the
central airways in the segmental bronchi bilaterally. However,
in conjunction with compressive atelectasis of the right lower
lobe, there are also some regions of air bronchograms, and
narrowing of the more distal bronchi, suggesting superimposed
infection/consolidation within these regions.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for non-contrast
technique, the liver is unremarkable. Calcified stones are seen
dependently within the gallbladder. No evidence of
cholecystitis. Coarse calcifications are also seen within the
spleen, consistent with granulomata. Marked vascular
calcifications of the splenic artery as well as the abdominal
aorta are appreciated, without aneurysmal aortic change.
Multiple low-density lesions are seen arising from both kidneys,
many of which have attenuation characteristics consistent with
simple cysts, but others which are too small to accurately
characterize. It is unclear whether several punctate
calcifications seen within the kidneys represent vascular
calcifications or calcifications within the collecting systems.
Right adrenal gland appears unremarkable. The left adrenal gland
is not well visualized. The pancreas appears atrophic, but again
is not well visualized without IV contrast. Note is made of a
gastrostomy tube. A trace of ascites is present. No abdominal
