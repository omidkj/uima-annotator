Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8367**]
Chief Complaint:
Sent for anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transfusion of 3 un pRBCs

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old (Russian-speaking) male with history of severe CAD
s/p multiple PCI, chronic systolic and [**Age over 90 7216**] CHF, moderate
AS, and chronic GI bleeds presented to the ER with anemia. He
was referred in to the ED by his gastroenterologist for a blood
transfusion.  The patient has a long history of chronic GI
bleeds which have been attributed to an undetected AVM that have
been bleeding due to the dual anti-platelet agents.  He has been
previously thought too-high risk to undergo EGD or colonscopy
based on his coronary disease so complete diagnostic evaluation
for his source of bleeding has not occurred.  He was last
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 95898**] for chest pain and ruled in for
NSTEMI that was exacerbated by his bleeding.  During that
admission he had several melanotic stools, and his Hct nadir was
20% and peak Tnt was 0.2.  He remained on his aspirin and
plavix.  He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2123-9-23**] at which time his
Hct was 28.6 which was down from 34.5 on [**2123-9-6**].  Per note in
OMR from his GI doctor, his aspirin was to decrease from 325 mg
to 81 mg daily.
.
Upon arrival to the ED his initial vitals signs were 98.1  71
114/53  12  96%RA.  Within ~first hour of being in ED, his blood
pressure dropped to 89/palp with HR stable in 75.  He received
1L of NS and 1 unit of PRBCs.  He was found to have dark brown
guaiac + stool. He received protonix 40 mg IV x1. With his son
as interpreter, he was asymptomatic denying chest pain,
dizziness, or shortness of breath. He stated that he was feeling
weak but no other symptom.

TTE: [**2123-9-3**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with history of CAD s/p multiple PCI, systolic and
[**Age over 90 7216**] CHF, aortic stenosis and chronic GI bleeding admitted
for GI bleed and hypotension.

1. GI bleed:  Patient's anemia appears to be likely related to a
slow and chronic GI bleed, which was thought related to an
undiagnosed AVM, however unable to get colonoscopy considering
CAD.  Following admission to the MICU, his GIB bleed slowed.
His blood pressure rapidly normalized following 1L of saline and
1 unit of pRBCs.  His bleeding likely exacerbated in the setting
of dual anti-platelet agents- plavix and ASA 325mg.  Stopped
Plavix and switched to ASA 81mg, also treated with PPI IV bid,
then switched to PO PPI.  Received three units of PRBC's on
admission, Hct improved significantly.  H. pylori serologies
pending.  Checked [**Hospital1 **] Hct.  Maintained 2 peripheral IVs as
access in the event that the patient developed a more acute
bleed, however was not necessary.  Continued iron supplements.
.
2. Coronary Artery Disease:  No evidence of acute ischemia with
unchanged EKG, has ST depressions chronically in V2-V6, and no
elevation in cardiac enzymes, times three sets.  Contact[**Name (NI) **]
primary cardiologist who agreed with stopping plavix.  Restarted
BB prior to leaving the MICU but at a reduced dose of 12.5mg
[**Hospital1 **].  Patient remained chest pain free once sent to the floor.
Continued statin, beta blocker, nitro prn, aspirin while
