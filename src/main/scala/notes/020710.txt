 Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with
history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She
denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by
daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40
with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid
80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and
Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect->
UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time,
she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain,
N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in
the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on [**5-9**].
.
Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She
is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s
(per PCP 160s in office at baseline).
.
Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/
levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.
.
At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She
denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%).
.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
[**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done
[**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for
respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her
ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure
medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
* ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg TID for g
