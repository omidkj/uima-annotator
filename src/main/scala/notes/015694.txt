Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed significant respiratory
variation in
all intracardiac and pulmonary pressure recordings. The mean RA
pressure
was elevated at 16mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension
(52/31 mmHg with a mean of 38mmHg). The PCW was elevated at a
mean of
21mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
3. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension
ECHO
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild
(1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.6 cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area
1.9cm2). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
No AI is visualized. The remaining study is unchanged from
prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catheterization that revealed normal
coronary arteries and was admitted for preoperative workup.  On
[**2188-7-3**] was brought to the operating room for aortic valve
replacement and resection of left atrial appendage.  See
operative report for further details. He received vancomycin and
cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics, and transferred to the
intensive care unit for post operative management.  That evening
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without complications.  Post operative day one he was
weaned from pressors.  He was transferred to the surgical step
down floor. He was restarted on Coumadin for chronic atrial
fibrillation and his INR quickly became supertherapeutic
requiring vitamin K so he was restarted on a reduced dose of
coumadin. Diltiazem and Lopressor was increased for better rate
control. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol. His pain was controlled with Dilaudid and
Ativan. Once on the step down unit he was ambulating with
assistance, tolerating a full oral diet and his incisions were
healing well. Slight erythema was noted at the mediastinal
incision so he was started on Keflex.  While his liver function
tests were elevated post-operatively, they were downtrending and
near normal by discharge.  He was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] [**Hospital 87730**] center.
