Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum, dizziness, lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Mesenteric angiography on [**2111-10-26**]
2.  Colonoscopy on [**10-11**] and [**10-15**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84830**] is a 74F with a PMH s/f CAD (s/p CABG), and atrial
fibrillation recently diagnosed and started on coumadin about 4
weeks ago.  She was in her usual state of health until about 10
days ago when she developed lethargy and dizziness with
standing.  Over the past two days she developed abdominal pain
with BRBPR.  Abdominal pain is described as a sharp pain in the
middle of her abdomen, associated with nausea, no vomiting.
Non-radiating.  She began to have BRBPR yesterday, when her aide
noticed it.  She cannot recall the color or consistency of her
stools prior to this.
.
In the emergency department her presenting vital signs were:
T=98.7, BP=151/72, HR=84, O2sat=100%RA.  On exam she was noted
to have BRBPR.  Laboratory data was significant for a HCT of
16.6 (baseline is 26), and INR of 2.9, and a lactate of 4.9.
The patient was given 2 L NS, 2 units of FFP, 2 units of pRBCs,
10mg IV vitamin K, and factor 9 ([**2041**] units) per protocol.  A CT
of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was obtained which
showed no colitis, and trace ascites.  A surgical consultation
was obtained, they felt there was no urgent surgical issues.
Gastroenterology was made aware of the admission, and
recommended IV PPI, which was given.  She was hemodynamically
stable in the ED with SBPs 103-120, with adequate urine output,
and reporting mild dizziness.  She has two large bore PIVs.  She
also had two episodes of sinus bradycardia with dropped QRS
complexes, which was transient.

.

Social History:
Denies EtOH, tobacco and lives in [**Hospital3 **] elder housing.
 She is part of the [**Hospital **] medical system and has regular home
visits from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 19434**] and his nursing staff.

Family History:
non contributory

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
GENERAL: Pleasant, answers questions appropriately, in no acute
distress
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Left cataract. No scleral
icterus. Right pupil responds to light. Very dry mucous
membranes.
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. [**1-16**] low-pitched systolic
ejection murmur, high-pitched S2
LUNGS: Diffuse bilateral inspiratory crackles and expiratory
wheezes
ABDOMEN: NABS. Soft, NT, ND.  No HSM
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior
tibial pulses.
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant

Pertinent Results:
EKG: Sinus rhythm at 82 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, old
TWI in I and AVL, new STD in V4-V6
.
Chest XR: Worsening airspace disease on the right lower lung
.
CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast: [**2111-10-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute colitis. No bowel obstruction.
2. Thickened urinary bladder wall, raising the concern for
cystitis.
3. Dilated CBD measuring 15mm, of uncertain significance. MRCP
may be
considered if concern for biliary pathology.
4. Evidence of prior renal insults vs ongoing
pyelonephritis--correlate
clinically.
5. Small right-sided pleural effusion.

Tagged RBC study: Detailed results:
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
16.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2111-10-10**]);
HISTORY: Patient is a 74 year old female with brisk
gastrointestinal bleeding, evaluate for location.

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. A left
lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained. Blood flow images
show arterial flow in the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
Dynamic blood pool images show a quick appearance of radiotracer
overlying the right upper quadrant likely within the hepatic
flexure that could be duodenal, though given history of brisk
bleeding, is thought to be colonic in origin. There is no
significant accumulation of radiotracer on subsequent images in
the dynamic series.
Bleeding was first noticed within the first several minutes of
the examination.

IMPRESSION: Gastrointestinal bleeding seen in the right upper
quadrant likely within the hepatic flexure of the colon, with
duodenal origin thought to be less likely. The bleeding appears
soon after tracer injection but does not continue throughout the
study.
.
ECHO results from [**2111-10-12**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets aand supporting
structures are thickened. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area 2.0cm2). No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal functioning aortic bioprosthesis. Mild mitral
stenosis with thickened leafles and supporting structures. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. No evidence for an
intracardiac shunt.
.
[**2111-10-12**]: CT HEAD: no evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2111-10-12**]: CT head perfusion study: There are no focal perfusion
abnormalities. 1. Mild to moderate atherosclerotic disease
without high-grade stenoses. 2. Pleural-parenchymal disease as
detailed which should be correlated with the patient's pulmonary
history and imaging.
.
[**2111-10-12**]: CTA Head/Neck: There is a two-vessel aortic arch with a
normal variant bovine configuration. There is mild
atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch and origins of the
great vessels. Other than mild atherosclerotic disease at the
carotid bifurcations bilaterally, the common and cervical
internal carotid arteries are normal. The middle and anterior
cerebral arteries are normal. Incidental note is made of a small
posterior communicating artery infundibulum on the right.
There is left vertebral artery dominance with the right
vertebral artery
effectively ending at the level of PICA and the vessel origins
are not well evaluated. There is moderate atherosclerosis of the
distal left vertebral artery. There is mild mucoperiosteal
thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. There are
small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
minimal associated consolidation and bilateral interlobular
septal thickening. There are multilevel degenerative changes of
the cervical spine.
.
[**2111-10-20**]: MRCP: 1. Dilation of the common hepatic duct, common
bile duct, and proximal pancreatic duct to the level of the
ampulla without evidence of stricture or mass. These findings
may be secondary to ampullary stenosis versus a small ampullary
lesion below the level of detection of MRI. An ERCP is
recommended for further characterization.
2. Interlobular s
