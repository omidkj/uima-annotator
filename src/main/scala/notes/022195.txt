Service:  CCU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2,
inflammatory breast cancer who presented to an outside
hospital ED on [**2103-3-19**] with chest pressure and shortness of
breath at 11 a.m.  The patient reported also having
palpitations associated with tightness and shortness of
breath.  She has had palpitations on and off x2 months now.
Denies any history of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, or orthopnea.  She denied any associated nausea,
vomiting, or diaphoresis.  In the ED, she was noted to be in
CHF.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction, was noted to
have T-wave flattening inferiorly and laterally, with an
echocardiogram which showed global hypokinesis, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **], mild AS, and ejection fraction of 30 to 35 percent with a
dilated hypokinetic right ventricle, severe pulmonary
hypertension.  She had a Persantine MIBI, which showed
diffuse fixed defects with partially reversible septal
defect.  She was sent for a CT angiogram, which showed no
pulmonary embolism, moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
She was subsequently sent for catheterization, which revealed
severe pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 15 with calcified 80 percent proximal LAD lesion and
a 75 percent mid LAD lesion.  Left main with 30 to 40 percent
distal stenosis without dampening of pressures, 70 percent
ostial RCA lesion.  She was subsequently transferred here
initially for possible CABG, but felt to be contraindicated
with chronic right breast wound status post XRT and poor
healing would be expected.  She therefore underwent
rotablation of her proximal LAD and mid LAD lesions today.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 94.2 degrees, heart rate
86, blood pressure 150/92, respirations 17, saturating 99
percent on 2 liters.  Generally, she is in no acute distress.
Alert and oriented x3.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes moist.  JVP
at 9 cm .  No bruits.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and
rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border, [**1-19**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  PULMONARY:
Bibasilar crackles.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Two plus pedal
edema, trace dorsalis pedis pulses, 1 plus posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.  BREAST:  Small right breast ulcer with
small amount of clear drainage, no fluctuance or erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.6, hematocrit 36, platelets
228,000, INR 1.1, sodium 142, potassium 4, chloride 107,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 43, creatinine 1.6, glucose 100,
magnesium 1.8, ALT 10, AST 14, LDH 204, alkaline phosphatase
74.  EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute.
Normal interval and axis.  Inferior T-wave flattening.  T-
wave flattening in AVL, V5, and V6.  No ST changes.  Chest x-
ray:  Unchanged collapse and consolidation of the right
middle lobe, right lower lobe, and partial right upper lobe.
Catheterization here revealed left main distal 30 to 40
percent stenosis into the origin of the LAD, no dampening,
LAD calcified, 85 percent proximal and 75 percent mid lesions
both rotablated, circumflex 40 percent mid vessel OM margins,
and small vessel 60 percent, RCA ostial 70 percent, and 50
percent distal lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ischemia:  The patient remained chest pain-
free after interventions.  She was continued on Lopressor and
Integrilin after catheterization for 18 hours, Plavix,
aspirin, and statin.  She will need to have likely future RCA
intervention, pumped ejection fraction 30 to 35 percent,
global hypokinesis with severe pulmonary hypertension.
Euvolemic after catheterization, Lasix was held initially.
Rhythm, normal sinus rhythm.

Breast ulcer:  Was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Breast Surgery,
looked uninfected during her stay.  She can follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if she wants possible revision of her fistulous
tracts.

Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine baseline at 1.3.
She was given 2 doses of Mucomyst after catheterization.  Her
ACE inhibitor and Lasix were held initially.

Diabetes:  Her oral agents were held.  After catheterization,
was continued on Regular Insulin sliding scale and was
restarted on her oral agents on discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with her
primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6051**], in the next week.  She is
also to have her labs drawn on Monday, to have her renal
function and electrolytes checked with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6051**].
She is to follow up with her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55162**], in 2
weeks regarding further intervention on her right coronary
artery.  She is to make appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
Breast Surgery if she is interested in having surgical
revision of her chronic right breast wound.
