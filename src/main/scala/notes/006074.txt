History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] is an 84 year old gentleman who was admitted into

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**2157-12-19**]: The pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is
smaller than on the previous examination. Areas of right basal
atelectasis have clearly decreased in size. Overall, the right
lung appears much better ventilated than before.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild decrease in
extent of
pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis. No newly appeared
parenchymal
opacities. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.

Chest X-ray    [**2158-12-16**]
Impression:
Two views. Comparison with the previous study done on [**2158-12-15**].
Bibasilar
consolidation, more pronounced on the right and right pleural
fluid and/or
thickening persists. A very small right apical pneumothorax is
redemonstrated. There is streaky density at the bases consistent
with
subsegmental atelectasis as before. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

Chest X-ray    [**2158-12-15**]
Impression:
There is interval increase in right pleural effusion. There is
small amount of right apical pneumothorax better appreciated on
the current view and seen at the apex and along the mediastinum.
The loculation of the air in the basal pleura is also seen.
Mediastinum is at the central position. Left lung is essentially
clear except for minimal basal atelectasis. Calcifications
surrounding the right humeral head most likely located within
the joint are redemonstrated and most likely consistent with
synovial osteochondromatosis.

CT chest scan  [**2158-12-15**]
Impression:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Loculated right hydropneumothorax status post right lower
lobe superior
segmentectomy.
3. 2.9 cm low-density collection with multiple foci of air noted
within the
subcarinal space. Given its location, these findings likely
represent the
sequelae of mediastinal lymph node biopsy. However, differential
diagnosis
includes abscess. If the patient is stable, a followup chest CT
in three
months is recommended for further evaluation. If the patient is
not stable, a
repeat study may be obtained in one week for further assessment.

4. Bibasilar consolidations with marked secretions within the
right bronchus
intermedius and basal segmental bronchi. Findings are concerning
for
aspiration and atelectasis. However, superimposed infection
cannot be
excluded.
5. Mild enlargement of the mediastinal and right hilar lymph
nodes, possibly
reactive in nature.
5. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with
pulmonary artery
hypertension.

ECHO [**2158-12-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2158-12-12**] where he underwent VATS converted to open right
thoracotomy RLL superior segmentectomy for a right lower lung
FDG avid lung nodule. The patient was kept intubated overnight
in the ICU. POD 1 he was extubated. An epidural was placed by
acute pain service which was discontinued POD 2. The following
is a systems review of the hospital course:

Neuro: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout his
stay. He was sedated initially on propofol while intubated, then
received paravertebral block with bupivacaine, along with IV
Dilaudid. This was dc'd POD 1, and the patients pain was
controlled well with ibuprofen, Tylenol and oxycodone.

Pulmonary: Aggressive pulmonary toilet was encouraged. The chest
tube was on wall suction, then to water seal POD 2, then dc'd
POD 3. His oxygen requirements increased. A CTA was done on
[**2158-12-15**] to rule out PE given rapid fib and need for oxygen. This
was negative for PE, but revealed a pneumonia process.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs and incentive
spirometer were continued.  Oxygen saturations were 77-83% on
room air, with ambulation, 93-95% on Liters via nasal cannula.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable until the eve of
POD 2, at which time he went into rapid fib which was not
converted after Lopressor 5mg IV x 2 and diltiazem 10mg IV push
and 10mg/hr gtt. Cardiology consulted [**2158-12-15**] am, and
recommended amiodarone, and echo (see report). Amiodarone 150mg
IV bolus and gtt started, and the pt cardioverted around 1500 to
NSR.  He was converted to PO amiodarone 200 mg daily. On
[**2157-12-18**] while ambulating he had another episode of Afib 140's
which converted to SR with IV Lopressor and PO Lopressor was
started.  He was seen by cardiology again who recommended
increasing his Amiodarone to 400 mg daily and stopping toprol
and home with an event monitor.
Dishcarge heart rhythm sinus 60-70. Blood pressure stable
100-120.

ABD: Diet advanced and tolerated. Stool softeners given.

GU: Foley was placed intra op and dc'd after paravertebral block
dc'd on POD 2. He void
