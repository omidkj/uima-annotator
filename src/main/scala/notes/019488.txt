HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] diagnosed in [**2163**]
who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department on [**2168-5-21**] with the complaint of four
days of cough, increasing shortness of breath, and low-grade
fever.  On initial examination, she had a temperature of
99.4, oxygen saturation of 93% and appeared mildly dyspneic.
Lung examination revealed basilar rales.  Chest x-ray showed
atelectasis of the lower lobes and could not rule out
infiltrates.  She was initially admitted to the medicine
service for pneumonia versus bronchitis.  On arrival to the
floor, on the night of admission, she was found to be in
respiratory arrest with an ABG showing a pH of 7.11, pCO2 of
102 and pO2 of 147.  She was intubated in rapid sequence and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was on
antibiotics at that time for possible pneumonia.

NEUROLOGIC:  Neurology consultation was obtained for
management of her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  She was felt to be in
myasthenic crisis in the setting of pneumonia.  While she was
intubated, she received five plasmapheresis treatments.  She
was also started on steroids.  She began the plasmapheresis
treatments on [**5-22**] and completed the fifth treatment on [**5-30**].
She was also started on CellCept for the myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
The Mestinon was held while she was on the ventilator.
Respiratory function improved with the plasmapheresis as did
her strength in the extremities.  She was extubated on [**5-30**]
after she completed her fifth plasmapheresis treatment and
did well and the respiratory status has remained stable since
extubation.  She also completed a seven-day course of
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for pneumonia.

On [**2168-6-1**] the patient was transferred from the ICU to the
neurology floor.  At the time of transfer she was feeling
much improved.  She had no shortness of breath, no dysphagia,
and she was tolerating a p.o. diet well.  She also stated
that she felt her strength was significantly improved in her
arms, legs, and neck.
