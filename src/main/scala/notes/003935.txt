History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44755**] is a 73 year old man transfered from an outside
hospital with chest pain and ecg changes.

Patient has past medical history of ESRD on HD for 5 years, PAF,
CVA, anemia, CAD s/p MI, Aortic stenosis. Patient was admitted
to [**Hospital3 4107**] last month with an MI. His hospital course
was complicated by bradycardic arrest, MRSA pneumonia, C diff
colitis. He was discharged to NESH 3.5 weeks ago. Since this
admission he has had worsening mental status with dementia.

On the day of admission he complained of chest pain [**9-20**]
radiating to his right shoulder. This was relieved only after 3
NTG. BP was stable; HR was 105-113 during this episode. He was
transfered to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where ECG showed
intermittant rate related RBBB and LVH with strain. Patient was
pain free on arrival and remained pain free. He was given one
aspirin. TnI was 0.2 and the patient was transfered here for
management of ACS.

On arrival here the patient had 10/10 chest pain. ECG showed
sinus tachycardia with LVH and strain. Pain resolved with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. TnT here 0.6, and CK is 51.

Currently the patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. He reports frequent diarrhea.
He has h/o orthopnea, PND but denies pedal edema. He has SOB
with ambulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 73 year old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD,
ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 35%, PAF, h/o CVA, h/o CAD s/p MI
who was initially transferred here from [**Hospital3 4107**] on
[**2113-7-23**] with chest pain, intermittent RBBB/LVH, TropI 0.6, CK
51. [**Hospital3 **] course notable for bradycardic arrest, MRSA
pna, C diff colitis and was d/c to rehab. with MRSA pneumonia, C
diff colitis.
.
On admission here, pt thought not to have acute ischemia;
finished course of PO vanco for c diff and IV vanco for MRSA
pna. His mental status was noted to be poor, thought to be [**3-15**]
delerium. Dialysis was continued. Wished for CTA to r/o PE, but
pt has iodine allergy. Had abnl cxr so v/q not pursued either.
Passed swallow study on [**7-25**] and [**7-31**].
.
[**7-25**], pt had resp distress but cxr showed layering pleural
effusions L>R, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 44756**].
.
[**7-26**], patient had another episode of tachypnea, hypoxia at HD
and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mngt. In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he
was rapidly weaned to nasal cannula, CPAP at night (has OSA).
SOB thought to be multifactorial from volume overload, pleural
effusions, AF w/ RVR. Leukocytosis to 13-14 persisted but ID
work up negative besides his previous known infections, as
above. Effusion not tapped since patient's resp status improved
(he also apparently refused per record).
.
[**7-29**] Recurrence of tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension on [**7-29**]
that was thought [**3-15**] aspiration vs flash pulm edema vs mucous
plugging, again improved w/o intervention. Aggressive chest PT
was initiated. Cards consulted who wished to optimize his CHF
mngt w/ Ace-i, cont amio/bb and stop digoxin. EF now 25% with
new akinesis.  Cardiac cath considered for concern of recurring
ischemia (INR elevated [**3-15**] coumadin, so held off for some time).
Vanco was started on [**8-1**] for GPC's in sputum and increased
secretions.
.
[**8-1**] With clinical improvement was transferred to general
medicine [**Hospital1 **]. Cath tentatively planned for [**8-7**], pt started on
heparin today for stroke ppx since INR now.

[**2113-8-5**] Had HD session w/o incident and had acute onset of resp
distress w/ sats 83% approx 30 min after arrival on floor. MICU
team near by and helped evaluate patient. VS at that time were T
96.3 BP 108/60's HR 90's RR 30's sats 83% NRB (was 98% 2L
previous to this). Pt confused but semi-alert, not mentating,
not comuunicative. ABG 7.42/40/49 on NRB. Code blue called for
impending resp arrest. pt w/ pulse; ekg NSR 90's old TWI's in
V1-V5. Intubated and brought to MICU.
.
MICU stay Underwent throacentesis with 1700 cc of serous fluid
removed which was transudative. He was thought to have flash
pulmonary edema. He was initially on a levophed gtt for
hypotension, but with fluid boluses he was weaned off the gtt.
[**8-7**]
-weaned off all pressors,
-seen by cardiology and they decided to defer catherization
until the patient was stable from a respiratory standpoint.
-Patient's stool was positive for C diff. He was started on
Flagyl for a ten day course. He was also
-started on levofloxacin/flagyl for empiric treatment of
aspiration pneumonia.
[**8-8**].
-extubated, transferred to general medicine wards
