Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old woman with hx of chronic PE,
therapeutic on warfarin, and TIA who presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
with hypoxia in the 70-80s on RA at her living facility.  She is
on oxygen with ambulation at baseline.  She was also noted to
have retractions and dyspnea worse than at baseline. Hypoxia was
slowly responsive to O2. Denies recent fevers or cough.
.
On [**2153-6-7**], patient was diagnosed with PE by V/Q scan,
subsequently started on enoxaparin 40mg sq daily along with
bridge to warfarin 2mg daily.  Warfarin dose was increased to
4mg daily on [**6-22**] at which time INR was noted to be 1.7.  On
admission patient had been taking 3mg of warfarin daily, per
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.4 88 130/64 24 92% on simple face
mask.  Pt was intermittently tachypnic up to mid 40s, started on
NRB. Desatted quickly to low 80s when NRB removed and takes a
while to return to low 90s.  EKG showed S wave in lead I, Q
waves and inverted T waves in lead III.  CT-A showed apparent
filling defect in the right upper lobe subsegmental branch,
compatible with PE (age indeterminate), dilation of the branch
suggestive of a more acute component. Patient was given a dose
of levofloxacin and vancomycin in the ED.  Vitals in ED prior to
transfer to MICU were as follows:   98.2F  HR 82  BP 122/72 O2
sat 82-97% on NRB.

******************

Reports:
[**7-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: There has been marked interval increase in
the size of the cardiac silhouette with, in particular, a
somewhat globular configuration.  Underlying cardiomyopathy
along with a possible accompanying pericardial effusion may
account for this appearance. There is also mild perihilar
opacity which could be related to underlying central vascular
congestion and early interstitial edema. Bilateral pleural
effusions support the possible negative fluid balance.
Incidentally noted, but not mentioned above, there is healed
deformity of the mid diaphysis of the left clavicle from prior
fracture.

[**7-9**] CTA: 1. Apparent filling defect demonstrated within a right
upper lobe
subsegmental branch compatible with pulmonary embolism, age
indeterminate.  Expansion of the vessel and overall morphology
suggests an acute component. Also chronic embolism noted in
right lower lobe segmental branches.
2. Diffuse centrally located ground-glass opacification and
right greater
than left pleural effusions, most compatible with a component of
congestive heart failure.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology.


[**7-12**] TTE: The right atrium is moderately dilated. A patent
foramen ovale is present. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting at
rest. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Small left
ventricle with preserved systolic function. At least moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

[**7-14**] CXR: Tube is probably within the proximal stomach. Heart is
enlarged. There is no definite vascular congestion, although the
central vessels appear somewhat prominent. No suspicious
infiltrates or pleural effusions are noted. Old fractures of the
left clavicle and humerus are again noted.

[**7-16**] CXR:An enteric feeding tube tip terminates within the
stomach. There are no new focal opacities concerning for
pneumonia. There may be perihilar opacification that may
indicate a component of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There
is stable cardiomegaly. There are no large pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of focal pneumonia.

[**7-23**] Speech and Swallow:
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx into the
esophagus
without evidence of holdup. There is mild-to-moderate residue in
the
valleculae after a bite of crackers; however, there is no gross
aspiration or penetration.
