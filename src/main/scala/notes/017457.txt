Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Gross hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement.

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o man with PMH significant for Parkinson's disease, BPH,
atrial fibrillation, CHF, and CRI admitted through the ED with
gross hematuria, anemia, and hypotension. The patient self
discontinued his Foley catheter yesterday resulting in traumatic
bleeding. Today, a moderate amount of blood was noted in the
Foley catheter bag. In the ED, VS were 95.8 67 106/48 100% RA.
Labs were significant for a Hct of 22.6 (of note, his baseline
is between 24-25). An urology consult was obtained in the ED.
They placed a 22 French 3-way with continuous irrigation. There
was initially some clearing of the urine then it turned more
bloody again. The patient was given vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
He also was transfused 1 unit of PRBC. The patient was kept in
the ED for observation.
.
At 8:00 AM the morning of admission, the patient SBP decreased
to 70. He was given 1 liter of IV fluids with an increase in his
SBP to 90-110. At this time, he is being admitted to the
medicine service for further care.
.
On his arrival to the floor, the patient repeatedly asked for
food. He also reported that he was quite tired. Denied pain or
any other concerns. Most of history obtained from his daughters.

[**11-3**]-Portable CXR- IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.
.
[**11-6**]-CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Heterogeneous flow to
basilar segments of collapsed right lower lobe likely
physiologic/artifactual.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion. Likely multifocal
atelectasis in the right lung. Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. Near complete resolution of left upper lobe pneumonia.
Residual left lower lobe minor atelectasis.
4. Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
.
[**11-7**]-Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating no
hydronephrosis or gross renal calculi in either kidney.
.
[**11-8**]-Portable CXR: There has been interval improvement of the
right upper lobe opacity most likely representing clearing of
consolidation demonstrated on the previous chest CT; the right
pleural effusion is increased which could be due to positional
change of the patient. The left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged. No evidence of failure is present.
There are no new areas of consolidation. The ET tube tip is 2.5
cm above the carina. The right subclavian line tip is in the mid
SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o man with PMH significant for Parkinson's
disease, BPH, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and CRI initially
admitted through the ED with gross hematuria, anemia, and
hypotension. Hospital course summarized below:
.
Of note, the pt was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-10-16**] for
Staph aureus and Enterococcal bacteremia (grown in blood and
urine). He had completed 3 out of 6 weeks of Vancomycin for LLE
ulcer and empiric endocarditis treatment. His recent history is
notable for recent acute urinary retention after hospitalization
for sepsis ([**7-2**]) at which point he was discharged with catheter
(14F) in place. He was subsequently readmitted with gross
hematuria about one month later; unclear precipitant, no clear
trauma, however his catheter had been changed to an 18F PTA. He
was later found to have a UTI, P. Aeruginisa, sensitive to Cipro
and was discharged on this. He returned to the ED [**8-15**] with
painless hematuria, was irrigated and discharged.
.
On this admission, the pt had hematuria thought to be due to
pulling his foley catheter. The patient self discontinued his
Foley catheter resulting in traumatic bleeding. He was found to
have a hct of 22.6 (BL 24-25), and urology placed a 22 French
3-way with continuous irrigation. In the ED, the patient's BP
dropped to SBP 70, and he was given 1L IVF with SBP increasing
to 90-110.
.
Since admission to the medicine service, the pts hematuria had
resolved. His hct had been stable at 31-33. He received 5 units
PRBC over 3 days, and he had intermittent wheezing treated with
atrovent nebs and prn Lasix 10 IV.
.
On [**11-6**], the pts HR increased from baseline of 100-110, up to
160. His RR also increased to 32. The pt was found to be satting
78% RA. On 100% NRB, his sats only increased to 85% NRB. He was
given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and he was intubated given his hypoxia.
His SBP then droped to 74/60. He was then cardioverted with
shock x1, and converted into NSR. Several minutes later he went
back into afib with HR in 120s and then again spontaneously
cardioverted to NSR upon transfer to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, the patient was initially unstable having
hypotension and atrial fibrillation with [**Month/Year (2) 5509**].  He received 3 L
of NS with initially some effect.  Antibiotics were broadened to
include cefepime and ciprofloxacin (for chronic LLE ulcer and
empiric endocarditis treatment) and Cipro (h/o psuedomonas.  He
received a levophed bolus in the setting of hypotension, but his
HR increased to 210 so levophed was turned off. The pts BP
increased with neo and it did not seem to affect his HR. Again,
his pressures decreased in the setting of [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was given
amiodarone 150 mg IVx1, but he had [**12-30**] second pauses thereafter.
 Levophed was resumed at a low dose in addition to the neo, and
the pts BP stabilized.  On HD 2 in the MICU, levophed was weaned
off.   His respiratory status also improved and the patient was
extubated on HD 2.  The
