CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A right 1st and 2nd toe cellulitis with
known cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old Kuwaiti
male with type 2 diabetes, known peripheral vascular disease
who has had bilateral fem/[**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses in [**2170**] and a left TMA
who presented to [**Last Name (un) 67481**] Hospital in [**Country 22390**] on [**2182-5-28**]
with a right foot swelling and erythema for a duration of 7
days. He had known absent peripheral pulses at that time of
the right foot with a right 1st and 2nd toe erythema which
extended to the anterior leg. He was begun on Zosyn and
Flagyl with improvement of his cellulitis. The vascular
surgeon in [**Country 22390**] advised a right 2nd toe amputation
secondary to wet/dry gangrene and an angiogram diagnostic
planned, but the patient requested evaluation and transfer to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] service in the United States at [**Hospital1 346**]. The patient is now here for
definitive treatment of his peripheral vascular disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Zosyn 4.5 grams q.8h.,
Flagyl 500 mg q.8h. IV, aspirin 100 mg daily, Imdur 30 mg
daily, digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d., Zocor
10 mg at [**Hospital1 21013**], Cozaar 50 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily,
Lovenox 40 mg daily; he had been on Coumadin, which was on
hold.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Include type 2 diabetes with
neuropathy; history of hypertension; history of coronary
artery disease, status post coronary angioplasty and stenting
at the [**Hospital 3340**] Clinic Foundation in [**Location (un) 3340**], [**State 4260**];
history of complete heart block requiring pacemaker
implantation in [**2172**]; status post bilateral fem/[**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses
in [**2170**]; status post left TMA in [**2174**]; history of renal
artery stenosis; history of peripheral vascular disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Country 22390**]. He is a smoker.
No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.3, pulse
84, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 128/70, oxygen
saturation 96% on room air. Fasting fingerstick on admission
was 214. GENERAL APPEARANCE: Alert male, non-English-
speaking, in no acute distress. HEART: Regular rate and
rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMINAL EXAM: Unremarkable,
without bruits. EXTREMITIES: The left foot has a well-healed
TMA. The right 2nd toe shows necrotic tissue with ulceration
of 1 cm in size. The right 2nd toe also shows dry/wet
gangrenous changes with ulcerations. PULSE EXAM: Shows
palpable femoral's bilaterally. PT and DP are monophasic
dopplerable signals only bilaterally. The radial arteries are
palpable. There were no carotid bruits.

LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  Include a white count of 17.6,
with a hemoglobin of 15.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted the vascular
service. Wound cultures were obtained. He was continued on
the Zosyn and Flagyl. The patient's wound culture grew staph
coag-negative sparse growth of 3 colonies and staph coag-
positive sparse growth, but oxacillin resistant and staph
coag-positive second morphology oxacillin resistant. The
staph sensitivities of both species sensitive to gentamicin,
rifampin, tetracycline, vancomycin. The anaerobe cultures
were no growth.

The patient's admitting chest x-ray showed pacing device
seen, with a single-lead overlying right ventricle. There
were cardiomediastinal and hilar contours, appeared
unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature appeared within normal
limits. There were no focal consolidations within the lungs.
The patient's admitting white count was 11.7, hematocrit
39.3, BUN was 16, with a creatinine of 0.9, and a potassium
of 4.5. The patient had vein mapping done of the upper
extremities which showed patent right basilic and cephalic
veins. The patient also had a Duplex of the carotids
secondary to a history of carotid bruit. Right internal
carotid artery stenosis was less than 40%. The left internal
carotid artery was totally occluded. The patient's
electrocardiogram on admission demonstrated atrial
fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and
occasional premature ventricular contractions, underlying
right bundle branch block with a secondary ST wave
abnormality.

The patient underwent a diagnostic arteriogram on [**2182-6-10**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] via the left common femoral artery
with abdominal and right leg runoff imaging. The infrarenal
aorta was patent but diseased. There were single renal's with
mild origin stenosis of less than 50% with brisk nephrograms.
There was patent bilateral common iliac. The internal and
external iliac's were also patent. The right lower extremity
runoff showed a patent common femoris and profunda femoris.
The SFA was occluded along with the bypass on the right side.
There was reconstruction of the mid popliteal at the knee
with 50% stenosis in the mid distal popliteal artery. The BK
[**Doctor Last Name **] was patent. The anterior tibial artery occluded. The
tibial peroneal trunk was patent. The peroneal and the
posterior tibial filled retrograde via the DP via large
plantar's. The PT was a large vessel in the foot. The patient
did develop a small hematoma post arteriogram, which was
controlled with manual pressure. His hematocrit's remained
stable.

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] diabetic physicians were consulted for diabetic
management. He was begun on NPH insulin b.i.d., and his
Humalog scale was increased with improved glycemic control.
Because of the patient's history of cardiac disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was requested to evaluate the patient preoperatively for
perioperative risk assessment. The patient had an
echocardiogram done which showed an ejection fraction of 25%
to 30%. The findings demonstrated left atrium was elongated.
The right atrium and interatrial septum moderately dilated.
Right atrium, a catheter or pacing wire seen in the right
atrium and extending to the right ventricle. The left
ventricle was normal wall thickness and cavity size with
severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. No
resting LVOT gradient. No LV mass or thrombus. The right
ventricle was normal in chamber size. There was borderline
normal RV systolic function. The aortic root was a normal
diameter. There was mild dilatation of the ascending aorta.
The aortic arch diameter was normal. The aortic valve showed
moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with moderate
aortic stenosis, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve showed moderately thickened mitral valve
leaflets, moderately mitral anular calcification with mild
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There was no mitral
stenosis. There was mild mitral regurgitation. Due to the
acoustic shadowing, the severity of the mitral regurgitation
may be significantly underestimated. The tricuspid valve was
mildly thickened. There was mild-to-moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and mild pulmonary systolic hypertension. A
Persantine MIBI was obtained. This study demonstrated
moderate partially reversible perfusion defect in the basal
and mild segments of the anterolateral and inferolateral
walls, but also may include lateral aspect of the inferior
wall. The left ventricle was enlarged with severe global
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 23%. Both studies
were reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of interpretation.

The patient proceeded to surgery at a moderate risk. He
underwent on [**2182-6-12**] a right femoral-to-popliteal
bypass with PTFE grafting of 8 mm in size. The right upper
extremity was explored for vein conduit. The right 2nd toe
was amputated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He
required a unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
He was transferred to the PACU in guarded condition. In the
PACU the patient remained hemodynamically stable. His postop
hematocrit was 30.1, BUN 10, creatinine 0.8. He h
