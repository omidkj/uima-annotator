Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 y.o. Male w/ h.o. diastolic dysfunction, A.
fib/flutter s/p recent PVI, COPD, asthma, ?IPF, HTN, initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] w/ [**1-8**] week h.o of lower extremity
edema, shortness of breath. Intubated for hypercapneic
respiratory distress. Transferred for further hypoxic work-up
whether this is COPD exacerbation, PNA, CHF exacerbation.
.
On review of pt's outside medical records it appears he was
initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2173-1-18**] w/ a 2 week h.o.
progressive lower extremity edema, several days of SOB. Day
prior to admission pt was seen by his PCP who prescribed Steroid
taper, Azithromycin for possible COPD exacerbation. Upon
assessment in the ED it appears his oxygen saturation was 52% on
RA, HR 120, RR 32, BP 157/99. His labs at that time were
significant for a Leukocytosis of 22.0 (attributed to steroids).
Pt was given IV diuresis 100mg with poor urine output response.
A CXR was obtained which showed extesnive alveolar edema. Pt was
given repetitive Furosemide doses with little to no response in
urine output, pt was noted to have increase Creatinine,
decreased urine output. His admission labs also showed +CK-MB,
MBI, Troponins but negative CKS, am Echo which was obtained 3
days later, however, showed normal LV function, RV dilatation,
no MR, trivial TR. Pul HTN 37.
.
During the evening of [**1-19**] pt was noted to become hypoxic to
the 70% and was placed on a NRB where his O2 sat was ntoed to be
86-88%. He was titrated up to BiPAP with no reoslution in his
hypoxia, he was noted to be more lethargic. ABG showed pH of
7.17, pO2 66, pCO2 82-101, HCO 30.6, pt was intubated. His
initial ABG showed CO2 49, HCO3 30.4, pH 7.40. Sputum cx were
sent which showed . He was also noted to be anemic in the low
20s on admission. Surgery and GI were consulted and he underwent
a CT scan of his abdomen to check for an RP bld given his recent
PVI which was negative. Stools were guaiac negative as were NG
lavage. He was transfused 2 units with stable Hcts. Prior to him
leaving [**Location (un) 620**] he received Cefepime, Levofloxacin, IV
Solumedrol. A Femoral line was placed for central access. He was
influenza neg, Sputum cx showed [**10-31**] PMNs, GPC chains, rare. GP
bacili.
.
Of note pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] last year with similar
presentation, was initially diuresed for ?CHF exacerbation and
went into [**Last Name (un) **]. Eventually was diagnosed with Influenza A. He has
been noted to have CT changes in his chest suggesting IPF though
he has not seen a Pulmonologist. He was also admitted to [**Hospital **] in [**Month (only) 1096**] with new onset A. fib/flutter and underwent
pulmonary vein isolation. He was discharged on Coumadin as well
as a course of steroids. Per his wife he has been on a
requirement of 5L n.c. over the past month or so. Over the past
week he has been noted to desaturate to mid 80s on 5L n.c. with
movement.

Original CXR:
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
supine position. The patient is intubated, the ETT is seen to
terminate in
the trachea some 3 cm above the level of the carina. Heart size
is difficult to determine because of obscuring pulmonary
abnormalities. There exist extensive bilateral pulmonary
parenchymal densities occupying practically all lung fields in
this single view examination. There exist undoubtedly some
coinciding perivascular haze with blurred-out vascular contours.
The pleural spaces on the other hand are grossly free and in
particular the lateral pleural sinuses are not blunted. There is
no pneumothorax identified, nor is there any chest wall
emphysema.

IMPRESSION: Not having any clinical history available,
conclusive diagnosis cannot be established. Findings as
presented here are compatible with acute left-sided heart
failure and extensive pulmonary edema or ARDS. Severe pulmonary
edema related to left-sided heart failure is a likelihood.
Differential diagnosis must rely on clinical presentation.
Comparison with possibly available previous examinations is
essential

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure
