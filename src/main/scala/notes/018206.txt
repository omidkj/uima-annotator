Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 y.o woman with history of CAD s/p CABG, cardiomyopathy with
EF of 30%, left ventricular aneurysm, vtach and Vfib s/p ICD
placement in [**2104**] who presented initially to the ED with a
complaint of urinary retention but was then found to be in
ventricular tachycardia.  The patient initially described
symptoms of 2 weeks of dysuria, suprapubic tenderness and
urinary retention consistent with a UTI.  However during her
workup, she developed palpitations and was triggered for a heart
rate in 140s-150s.
.
The patient's EKG demonstrated a narrow complex ventricular
tachycardia with a left axis, at a rate of 132bpm.  She
maintained her pressure initially, however at one point
developed mild hypotension with BP of 87/62 for which she was
given a 500cc NS bolus.  She was initially treated with
metoprolol 10mg IV, and cardiology was consulted.  On
interrogation of the ICD, the patient has had since her prior
admission multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia that had
been terminated by anti-tachycardia pacing.  Her native rhythm
currently is sequential A-V pacing.  She was subsequently loaded
with 50mg of lidocaine and started on a drip of 1mg/min, and her
rhythm self terminated.  She was noted to be mentating
throughout this episode.  The patient does report that she has
had episodes in the past similar to this that generally
terminate within several minutes, however none as severe as this
one today.  She also reported some nausea associated with the
episode, but no chest pain.
.
Other events in the ED included a workup for her UTI/suprapubic
tenderness.  Her urinalysis was negative, however a CT of the
[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis demonstrated an infra-renal aortic clot of
undetermined age for which vascular surgery was consulted.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was started on levofloxacin
and flagyl empirically.  Prior to transfer, she was in her
native rhythm with vitals of HR 76 BP 117/69 RR 18 Saturation
98% on 2L, afebrile.
.
Review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, vomiting,
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, dizziness or
lightheadedness.

- most recent settings per clinic note [**2117-6-4**]:
Her device is programmed to treat rates greater than 150 beats
per minute for 16 intervals in the VT zone.  Rates greater than
188 beats per minute for 18/24 intervals are treated in the VF
zone.  The brady portion of her device is in the DDD mode, lower
rate 75 beats per minute, maximum tracking 110 beats per minute.

The paced AV interval is 140 milliseconds, sensed AV interval
130
milliseconds.  The mode switch function is ON for atrial rates

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2117-6-9**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. 3-cm long segment of infraabdominal aortic
dissection with associated eccentric thrombus of indeterminate
age, but new since [**2106**].  2. Appendix not identified, but no
secondary inflammatory findings in the right lower quadrant to
suggest appendicitis. No evidence of acute

CXR PA & LATERAL [**2117-6-9**]:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. The
lungs are clear with no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is present. Median sternotomy wires are
intact. A left-sided generator is seen with leads implanted in
the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is top normal
and unchanged. Several calcified granulomas are seen at the
right base and right mid lung. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
84-year-old female admitted from rehab facility for complaints
regarding urination and found to have monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia in the emergency department.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: This was possibly
precipitated by reduced home metoprolol dose.  Initially treated
in the emergency department with metoprolol with limited
success, then treated with lidocaine drip with reversion to
sinus rhythm.  Though there was a low suspicion for ischemia
having a role in etiology, cardiac enzymes were checked which
demonstrated mildly elevated troponin to 0.09 but flat CK and
CK-MB. Patient stable in CCU with lidocaine d
