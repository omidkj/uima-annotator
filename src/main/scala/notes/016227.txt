HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female
with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease on three liters of 02 at home for the last two or
three years, who was admitted to the [**Hospital6 649**] from [**11-25**] to [**12-4**] for severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, who was
intubated on [**2116-11-25**] for hypoxic and hypercarbic
failure.  She was extubated and then that night on [**2116-11-26**] was reintubated and sedated, hypotensive, had to have
some dopamine and  got a little bit tachycardic.  Levophed
was placed on.  It was difficult to wean from the ventilator
secondary to anxiety.  The patient was trached on the [**12-1**] and then discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on
the 11th.

Patient was off the ventilator at [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2116-12-20**] and then decannulated off the trach on
[**2116-12-28**] and antibiotics were stopped on the 9th, as
well as her prednisone was also stopped on the 8th.  It was
down to 10 from her previous 60 in hospital.  Patient had an
episode of shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] on the day of admission at the
rehabilitation center.  Prednisone was increased to 30 and
they restarted levofloxacin.  Patient continued to have
shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].  They tried putting her on BiPAP of 14
and 5 with two liters and failed the trial of BiPAP at the
rehabilitation center as the patient had worsening shortness
of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it was decided to admit her to the [**Hospital6 1760**].

In the Emergency [**Hospital1 **], patient was given 60 IV of Solu-Medrol
and one gram of vancomycin as well.

admission.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 99.1.  Blood
pressure 184/85.  Heart rate in the 130s.  Respiratory rate
78.  02 saturation of 92% on three liters.  Generally, thin
61-year-old female on a nonrebreather mask in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact.  Sclerae are anicteric with
a BiPAP mask on.  Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular was tachycardic with no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
wheezing.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm with no
cyanosis, no clubbing or edema.  Neurological was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Nonfocal exam.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 12.0,
hematocrit of 41.9, platelets of 421,000.  Chem-7:  Sodium
136, potassium 4.4, chloride 94, bicarbonate 27, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.5, glucose of 147.

Patient had a last echocardiogram on [**2116-11-27**] with an
ejection fraction of around 60% with moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

In the Emergency Department, on four liters nasal cannula her
arterial blood gases was 7.14, 94, 89.  Once placed on the
BiPAP of 14 and 5, arterial blood gases was 7.37, 48 and 50.
Electrocardiogram on admission was sinus tachycardia with a
rate of 112, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, old
Qs in V1 through V3.  no significant T wave changes.  Chest
x-ray showed no infiltrates but flattened diaphragm
compatible with emphysema, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
overnight and was placed on her BiPAP as well as a steroid
taper was started at 60 mg po q.d.  Patient remained pretty
comfortable and that night was also given albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers prn.  Flovent, Serevent, MDIs and
Singulair were obtained.  Patient was also started on
levofloxacin as well as a dose of vancomycin in the Emergency
Room which was thought to be may worsening of a pneumonia.
Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
overnight and remained on BiPAP.  She did well on BiPAP and
was able to be transferred over to a nasal cannula in the
morning.  Patient was then called out to the floor and was
transferred to the floor.  Of note, the night that patient
was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, patient had an
episode of chest tightness, heaviness, as well as some jaw
tightness, at which time an electrocardiogram was done which
showed some T wave inversions and subsequent normalization
with a troponin that was slightly elevated.  Patient had
troponin peak of 2.4.  CKs remained flat.  Patient was
started on aspirin and ACE inhibitor as the beta-blocker was
felt to be contraindicated given the patient's severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  [**Hospital **] medical course
continued to be on the floor in terms of monitoring her
respiratory status in which she required BiPAP in the evening
time, as well as continued nebulizer q. 2-3 hours on the
floor.  Patient's cardiovascular status, patient had a
Cardiology Consult who thought that a catheterization would
not be warranted at this time and basically was told to use
aspirin as well as ACE inhibitor for some after load
reduction and to continue the diltiazem.

Infectious Disease wise, the patient was continued on her
levofloxacin throughout her course and for her depression,
patient was continued on Zoloft.  On [**2117-1-15**], it
was warranted that the patient wasn't getting any better on
the floor with on and off use of the BiPAP but no improvement
in her overall state as patient continued to need the BiPAP
on and off, as well as desaturating and having episodes in
which she became more tachycardic, as well as hypertensive
with desaturations down into the low 80s.  Patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
pulmonary management as well as for questionable tracheostomy
if patient failed to do well on the BiPAP machine.

On day of admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
patient's white count increased to 23.4 and hematocrit of
31.2.  With the elevated white count a new chest x-ray that
showed a right lower lobe consolidation with some small
pleural effusions.  It was decided that we would change the
antibiotics to broaden the coverage, so we began vancomycin
as well as ceftazidime to cover the patient's Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the
Stenotrophomonas that she has had in the past.  Patient was
continued on her diltiazem, aspirin, as well as captopril for
her non Q wave myocardial infarction and patient was
monitored on the BiPAP as well as nasal cannula throughout
the day.  At different times of the day, the patient required
her BiPAP and at different times of the day, the patient was
on nasal cannula. Mostly using the BiPAP in the evening times
and at night time.  Patient had her pulmonary function tests
faxed over to us from her outside hospital which showed
severely decreased lung fields and increased TLC and FRC and
RV diffusion.  DLCO was mildly to moderately severely
decreased. Pati
