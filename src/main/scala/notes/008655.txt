X-Rays:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2146-10-17**] 2:50 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary emboli.

2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and fluid in the right
lateral chest wall. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the
right chest wall.

3. Right middle lobe bronchial distortion, likely post-surgical,
causing right middle lobe atelectasis.

[**2146-10-20**]: PICC Placement: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound
and fluoroscopically guided 5-French double-lumen PICC line
placement via the left brachial venous approach. Final internal
length is 47.5 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is
ready to use.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2146-10-29**] 11:43 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided pigtail catheter seen within the pleural space
anteriorly. There has been marked decrease in size of the
previously seen loculated right pleural collection with a small
amount of persistent pleural fluid and gas noted.
2. Decrease in size of left pleural effusion. 5-mm nodular
density at the left base likely represents atelectasis, although
attention to this area on followup studies is recommended.
3. Otherwise, no significant change from prior study with
multiple paraesophageal and mediastinal lymph nodes again seen.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2146-10-30**] 1:40 PM
No obvious pneumothorax. Loculated effusion on the right side.
The pigtail catheter on the right side appears to have been
removed.








Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old female readmitted on [**2146-10-17**] with a
loculated effusion and right middle lobe opacity and an elevated
white count.  She was seen by interventional pulmonary for a
thoracentesis sent for culture and cytology which grew staph
aureus sensitive to nafcillin.  She was seen by the pain service
who recommended PCA Dilaudid and Toradol. On hospital day #2 she
was taken to the operating room on [**2146-10-18**] and underwent
successful right thoracoscopy, drainage of right empyema, with
partial decortication.  She transferred to the intensive care
unit intubed, 2 chest-tubes, a foley and IV Dilaudid for pain.
On postoperative day #1 she was extubed and her white count
trended downward from 26 to 12.4.  On postoperative day #2 she
had a double lumen PICC line placed in the left brachial vein.
She was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  On
postoperative day #3 she was seen by Infectious Disease who
recommended 4 weeks of nafcillin for MSSA.  She was followed by
serial chest x-rays that remained stable. The foley was removed
and she voided without difficulty. Physical therapy was
consulted to assist with ambulation.  She was converted to PO
pain medication with good pain control.  A chest CT without
contrast was done on postoperative day #4. The posterior
chest-tube ([**2143-10-26**])was removed. The basal chest-tube was
converted to a empyema tube. A CT scan on [**10-25**] revealed anterior
right pleural loculation. The patient was sent to Interventional
Radiology for placement of pigtail and TPA was instilled into
the pigtail and empyema tube for 3 consecutive days with a good
response. On [**2146-10-29**] the pigtail and empyema tube were removed.
A follow-up chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.  A follow-up
chest CT on [**2146-10-29**] showed marked decrease in the size of the
previously seen loculated right pleural collection with a small
amount of persistent pleural fluid and gas noted. She continued
to make steady progress and was discharged to home on
postoperative day #9.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
