Service: ORTHOPAEDICS

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**]
Chief Complaint:
R knee replacement c/b postop hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OR [**10-4**]: R TKA.
OR [**10-8**]: L TKA.


History of Present Illness:
ORTHO HPI: 86M w/ severe b/L OA, admitted to ortho for
sequential bilateral TKA. Pt was admitted to ICU for hypotension
and tachycardia x 3 which subsequently resolved and was
transferred to the floor. Pt ultimately underwent bilateral TKA
w/o complications.

ICU HPI: 86 y/o M with PMHx of arthritis, BPH & osteoporosis s/p
elective right total knee replacement c/b post-op hypotension.
Pt was not intubated, he received spinal anesthesia with
superifical femoral block and EBL was 160cc. After one
uneventful pain-free hour in PACU, patient began "rigoring", SBP
climbed into 200s and HR into 150s. Pt denied CP/SOB. After
receiving Labetalol 5mg IV with Metoprolol 2mg IV, SBP dropped
to 160. An EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with HR 103, and PACs.
 AFter a second dose of Metoprolol 2.5mg IV, the pt's SBPs
dropped into 70s and the pt became lethargic and ashen [**Doctor Last Name 352**]. SBP
recovered to 100s after a neosynephrine bolus (100mcg); and the
SBP subsequently recovered to the 170s. An A-line was placed.

On arrival to ICU, the pt's SBP was measured to be elevated at
170/70 by the arterial line. The pt denied SOB and CP, but
complained of nausea that he attributed to not eating for 24hrs.
During an attempted PIV placement, the SBP suddenly dropped to
70/40s, HR remained in the 80s (T stable at 98.7, and BS 167).
Pt complained of lightheadedness, diaphoresis & nausea. After an
IVF bolus, the SBP recovered to 140s within minutes and symptoms
resolved.
.

vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena,
hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, urinary

FLOOR TRANSFER
Once patient was transferred to the floor after 24hrs of
observation, pt had no similar episodes of hypotension. Pt
remained slightly tachycardic at 100-110. He did have an episode
of tachycardia to 140-150s without any stimulus, but no reasons
were found. Cardiology was consulted who recommended lopressor
100 [**Hospital1 **]. ECHO and EKGs were normal. Troponin were normal. Pt was
ultimately cleared for his R TKA ([**2142-10-4**]) on POD4 from LTKA
([**2142-10-8**]). PT was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] where the patient underwent uncomplicated R TKA. The
procedure was well
tolerated and there were no complications. Please see the
separately
dictated operative report for details regarding the surgery. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the post-anesthesia care
unit
in stable condition and transferred to the floor later that day.
Overnight, the patient was placed on a PCA for pain control. IV
antibiotics were continued for 24 hours postoperatively as per
routine. Lovenox was started the morning of postop day 1 for DVT
prophylaxis. The patient was placed in a CPM machine with range
of
motion set at 0-45 degrees of flexion up to 90 degrees as
tolerated for both knees.
The drain was removed without incident. The patient was weaned
off of
the PCA onto oral pain medications. The Foley catheter was
removed
without incident. The surgical dressing was also removed, and
the
surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and intact without
erythema nor purulent drainage.

During the hospital course the patient was seen daily by
physical
therapy. Labs were checked both post-operatively and throughout
the
hospital course and repleted accordingly. The patient was
tolerating
regular diet and otherwise feeling we
