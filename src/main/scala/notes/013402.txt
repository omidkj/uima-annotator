REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
high speed [**Hospital 39447**] with sternal fracture and T4 fracture. Would like
to evaluate chest and abdomen with IV contrast. NO PO contrast.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT SCAN OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST DATED
[**2186-9-16**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post high speed [**Month/Day/Year 39447**] with sternal
fracture and T4 fracture. Please evaluate chest and abdomen with
IV contrast.

TECHNIQUE: CT scan evaluation of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
was performed with IV contrast using 5 mm collimation. Images
were reformatted and evaluated in both the coronal and sagittal
planes.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to prior CT scans of the
cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines.

FINDINGS: There is a nondisplaced fracture through the
manubrium. A small amount of retromanubrial hematoma is
identified.

As seen in the recent CT examination, there is a complex
fracture involving the T4 vertebral body. There is approximately
80% compression of this vertebral body and 25 degrees of
kyphosis at this level. Bilateral pars fractures are also
identified at T4, representing posterior column injury. Moderate
canal narrowing and angulation is noted at this level. A small
amount of paraspinal hematoma is noted.

There is also a compression fracture involving the T7 vertebral
body with approximately 30% loss of vertebral body height. The
fracture does not appear to extend to the posterior column. No
significant canal narrowing is identified at this level.

There is no evidence for mediastinal hematoma. The aorta is
normal in contour and there is no evidence for contrast
extravasation. Heart and great vessels are unremarkable.

There are small bibasilar consolidations and small bilateral
effusions. No significant lymphadenopathy is identified within
the chest.

The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically and are
otherwise unremarkable. There is no free fluid or significant
lymphadenopathy within the abdomen or pelvis. A Foley catheter
is noted within the bladder.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nondisplaced fracture through the manubrium.

2. Complex fracture involving the T4 vertebral body with
involvement of the posterior column and 25 degrees of kyphosis.
This results in moderate narrowing and angulation of the spinal
canal at this level.

3. Compression fracture involving the T7 vertebral body with
loss of approximately 30% of vertebral body height.

4. No evidence for aortic injury.

5. No evidence for free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62533**] at the time of the
examination.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2186-9-16**] 7:18 AM

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: evaluate known T4 fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman s/p MVA
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate known T4 fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 59-year-old female status post MVA with T4 acute
fracture.

COMPARISONS: No comparisons are available.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple CT axial images of the thoracic spine were
obtained without IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations
were performed. Coronal and sagittal reformations of the sternum
were also performed.

FINDINGS: There is compression fracture of T4 with retropulsion
of the superior corner of the body into the spinal canal. There
are bilateral fractures at the bases of the pedicles, pars
interarticularis and transverse processes and the left lamina.
There is approximately 25% narrowing of the canal. There is 30
degrees of kyphosis.
There is also a mild compression fracture of the T7 vertebral
body. No other thoracic spine fractures were identified. The
spinal canal contents are not well evaluated.

There are small paraspinal hematomas associated with the above-
described fractures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unstable fracture of T4 with features as discussed above.

2. Compression fracture of T7

3. Subjacent to the xiphoid process of the sternum is a small
density, probably a vein, but there could be a small hematoma.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: HYPOXIA, EVAL FOR PE
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with h/o asthma, COPD; admitted to hosp
following [**Last Name (LF) 39447**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] spine fracture now with hypoxia and left
pulmonary artery fullness on CXR.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
PE?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 59-year-old female with asthma admitted status post
[**First Name3 (LF) 39447**] now presenting with hypoxia, left pulmonary artery fullness
on the chest x-ray.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to [**2186-9-16**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained without
and with IV contrast. Nonionic IV contrast was used as a rapid
bolus as necessary for this study. 100 cc of Optiray 250 were
used.

Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.

CT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant axillary lymph nodes.
There are multiple small AP window lymph nodes that do not meet
CT criteria for pathology. There is no pericardial effusion. The
heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta appears to be intact. The
pulmonary artery is slightly enlarged measuring 2 cm, which may
represent chronic pulmonary artery hypertension. Clinical
correlation is recommended. This is unchanged to [**2186-9-16**]. The pulmonary artery branches are patent. There are no
filling defects which suggest pulmonary embolism. There are mild
calcifications of the coronary arteries. The suggestion of
enlargement of the left pulmonary artery as seen in the chest
radiograph is likely due to atelectasis of left upper l
