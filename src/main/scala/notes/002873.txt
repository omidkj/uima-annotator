History of Present Illness:
70 yo m w/ h/o etoh cirrhosis who presented to [**Last Name (un) 60160**] Hop in [**Month (only) **]

abscess to c4-c6 vertebral bodies, l pleural abscess, and lumbar
epidural abscess.  S [**Month (only) 60161**] intermediately sensitive to PCN so pt
txt with PCN/gent and d/c to rehab. After rehab, abx changed to
ceftriaxone 2g.  [**11-30**] pt developed massive epistaxis w/
reported swallowing of "4 units" of blood and trasnferred back
to [**Hospital 46**] Hosp.  Briefly hypotensive and tachycardia but
responded to fluid resuscitation. Labs at OSH showed Hct 29.2,
plt 240, INR 1.6. Hospital course c/b onset of eeg verified
[**Hospital 19562**] encephalopathy that intialyl responded to lactulose but
[**Month (only) **]. in BM made it worse. A head CT showed no actue process. His
ammonia on admission was 181 and fell to 8 ([**12-9**]) but then rose
to 63 ([**12-13**]).  UCx [**12-11**] grew out yeast so pt was started in
fluconazole.  On [**12-15**], fever to 102 with eelvated WBC ct,zosyn
added.  Bld cx NGTD and CXR no PNA. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

    Pt a poor historian. Much of history from chart, unit
residents and notes. Pt not oriented, occasionally answers
questions and follows commands. He states he is in pain in his
belly and his back. Little insight into why he is here. Seen in

Angio report: PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 60162**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the staff radiologist,
was present and supervising throughout. The patient was placed
supine on the angiography table. His right upper extremity was
prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Since no
suitable superficial vein was visible, ultrasound was used for
localization of an appropriate vein. The right basilic vein was
patent and compressible. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were
anesthetized with 5 cc of 1% Lidocaine. Using ultrasound
guidance, the right basilic vein was accessed with a 21 gauge
micropuncture needle. A .018 Nitinol wire was advanced through
the access needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
visualization. The skin entry site was incised with a #11 blade
scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 4 French
micropuncture sheath with inner dilator. The inner dilator was
removed. Using the Nitinol wire for measurement, it was
determined that a length of 39 cm would be appropriate. The PICC
line was then trimmed to length and advanced over the guidewire
through the peel away sheath into the superior vena cava. The
guidewire and peel away sheath were removed. The catheter was
flushed, capped, and HEP-locked. It was secured to the skin
using a STAT-lock device.
Fluoroscopy was used to investigate the possibility of a PICC
fragment in the left upper extremity. Again, consisitent with
the examination performed [**2130-12-22**], there was no fragment
identified.

Hip xray [**12-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked degenerative changes in the lower lumbar
spine. No fracture seen.
Lumbar spine [**12-24**]:
Marked degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine. No
fracture seen.

Echo [**12-22**]:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. 5.The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

CT Chest [**12-24**]:
1. No abscess identified.
2. Pulmonary edema with patchy atelectasis and small bilateral
pleural effusions.
3. In the visualized portion of the abdomen, there is ascites
seen. The liver has a nodular appearance.

MRI [**12-22**]:
Limited lumbosacral spine imaging suggests that there is
discitis osteomyelitis at L1/2 and L5/S1 levels. Previous
imaging examinations reported to have been delivered to the
radiology
