Admission Date:  [**2108-12-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-12-19**]


Service:  NEUROSURG

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiorespiratory arrest following
cerebrovascular accident.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old lady who
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
status post fall with change in mental status.  CT scan
showed evidence of subdural hemorrhage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam she was initially arousable to
name.  Pupils were reactive.  Air entry was bilaterally
equal.  She had a pacemaker in situ with regular rate and
rhythm.  There was no murmur.  Abdomen was soft and
nontender, bowel sounds heard.  Left hand showed evidence of
an old stroke with contracture and clonus and the same with
the left lower extremity.  Neuro exam was not possible
because she was uncooperative.  There was residual left
hemiparesis.  She was moving the right arm and leg well.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT scan was repeated on admission which
showed extension of the subdural hematoma involving the
sagittal, falx tentorium as well as the left convexity.
There was also parenchymal hemorrhage involving the occipital
and parietal lobes.  There was substantial left to right
subtentorial herniation.  Admission labs were hematocrit of
37.1, white cell count 12.4, platelets 219.  INR was 3.2, PT
21.3, PTT 40.7.  Sodium was 143, potassium 3.9, chloride 107,
bicarb 23, urea 28, creatinine 1.  Blood sugar was 132.  CK
was elevated to 1365, troponin less than 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The coagulopathy was corrected, but despite
there was an extension of the subdural bleed.  The
neurosurgery team evaluated the possibility of evacuation of
the subdural hematoma to relieve the pressure.  The patient's
general condition and very low ejection fraction put her at a
very high anesthesia risk.  The risk was discussed with the
family and the family decided against any surgical
intervention and opted for comfort measures only.

The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] medical treatment was discontinued
and she was given morphine and comfort measures were given.
The patient eventually passed away on [**2108-12-19**], at
10:42 a.m.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient expired at 10:42 a.m.
