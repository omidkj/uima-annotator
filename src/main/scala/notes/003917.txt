Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2186-7-1**] CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52653**] is a 55 yo M with end-stage sarcoid on 3LNC at
baseline, transferred from Radius with shortness of breath,
tachypnea, hypoxia and fevers.  According to reports from Radius
has has been hypoxic for several days with O2 sats 91-92% on
100% NRB with desaturation to 86% with minimal exertion, patient
refusing to come to hospital.
.
In the ED T99.2 BP 145/84 RR 20-30 HR 92-140 96% on 100%NRB.  He
was noted to be significantly hypoxic and tachypnic and was
intubated due to concern for increasing work of breathing.  He
was given 2.5LNS, levofloxacin 750mg IV, cefepime 2g IV x1,
decadron 10mg IV x1 and versed 2mg IV x1.

Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C, diagnosed as part of the lung transplant workup

at the [**Hospital1 756**]. He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in GI. He
is hepatitis B core surface antibody positive and surface
antigen
negative. In addition, he has hepatitis C antibody plus type 2b

with a viral load in [**8-/2185**], of 5.5 million. He had grade 2
fibrosis on [**2184-4-28**]. He is not thought to be a candidate
currently for interferon treatment given his sarcoidosis. He has

transaminitis.
2. Sarcoidosis. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**]. The patient has
been obtaining PFTs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and he is currently on
azathioprine and prednisone with prophylaxis Bactrim.
3. Sleep apnea.
4. Erectile dysfunction.
5. Emotional lability and anxiety.
6. Status post mandible fracture [**8-20**].
7. Status post multiple rib and clavicle fractures over the past

year secondary to fall.
8. Spinal stenosis: diagnosed on MRI and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] orthopedic physician at the [**Hospital1 18**]. The diagnosis was
established as part of a workup for progressive lower leg
weakness, which led to multiple falls and currently an inability
to ambulate.
9. Shingles in [**12/2184**] on the right side of the face with
residual neuropathic pain.


Social History:
Has been living in a rehab facility since recent admission in
[**2186-4-13**]. Previously lived in an apartment in [**Location (un) 1459**] with his
27 yo daughter who is s/p traumatic brain injury in a motor
vehicle accident. Has another daughter from whom he is
estranged. Recently divorced from his wife of 33 years who he
says did "not want to take care of him." Patient is a former
food salesman, selling restaurant supplies to pizzerias. Has
been unemployed for about a year, no longer on unemployment.
Recently obtained some disability benefits. Reports a 10 pack
year smoking history, but quit 20 years ago. Reports no history
of ethanol use or IV drug use. Pt had previous admission in
which he was on high doses of methadone and benzodiazepenes that
were verified by PCP to be prescribed by an outpatient physician
to treat his pain from spinal stenosis; pt believed to withdraw
from both on previous admissions.

Family History:
Noncontributory of pulmonary disease.

[**2186-4-8**] CTA chest:
1. Small PE of segmental/subsegmental right upper lobe branch.
This was communicated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 24949**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3766**] by telephone in the AM on [**2186-4-10**].

rib. Multiple additional bilateral healing rib fractures.
3. Healing left distal clavicle fracture.
3. Resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia.
4. Chronic severe pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of
sarcoidosis.
.
[**2185-11-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-6**],
right ventricular systolic function now appears depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
SIRS/Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria based on tachycardia and
bandemia of 29%.  Most likely cause is PNA given underlying
severe sarcoidosis, other consideration is infected midline
which has been in place for unclear duration of time. Vancomycin
IV was started to cover for possible line infection.  Meropenem
was started to provide coverage for resistant pseudomonas seen
on recent sputum culture.  Patient's urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Urine cultures were obtained.  PICC line was
discontinued on arrival to ICU.  Patient had central line placed
in ED.  IVF fluids were administered to maintain CVP 8-10.  With
progressive hypoxia patient became hypotensive requiring
norepinephrine and phenylephrine to maintain MAP > 65 on his
second day of admission. Additional fluid boluses had no effect
on hypotension and tachycardia. Pressors were discontinued only
after the family made the decision to make him CMO.

Hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of fever and recent
pseudomonas-positive sputum culture, pneumonia superimposed on
underlying sarcoidosis is most likely etiology.  No clear
infiltrate on CXR although difficult to interpret in the setting
of already severe pulmonary fibrosis. Sputum and blood culture
were obtained. Due to his increased susceptibility patient was
treated empirically with vancomycin and meropenem for possible
PNA, with levoquin added for double PSA coverage and atypical
coverage.  He was also covered empirically for PJP, although he
had been on bactrim prophylaxis, and ETT PCP DFA was ordered.
Patient also received frequent nebulizer therapies.  Patient was
intubated on arrival to ED and became progressively more hypoxic
during his admission.  Pt ultimately r
