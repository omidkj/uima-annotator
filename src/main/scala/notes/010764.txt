Date of Birth:   [**2092-2-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 17437**] is a 62-year-old
female who was found unresponsive by her husband at
approximately 7:00 p.m. the night of admission.  For
approximately one week prior, the patient had been having
intermittent back pain, located between the shoulders and
radiating down her arms.  The pain would come on at rest and
last several hours.  The patient was seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital
ED and told that the pain was not cardiac.  They were having
apparently normal EKGs and one negative set of cardiac
enzymes and a negative CT of the chest.  The patient was
apparently then sent home but continued to have the pain
intermittently through the next week.

On the day of admission, the patient went to the movies with
her husband.  After coming home, the patient collapsed in the
kitchen.  She was not breathing and did not have a pulse.
The patient's husband called [**Name (NI) 9168**] who came within five to ten
minutes.  An automated external fibrillator was placed and
shocked to 200 joules, restoring normal [**Name (NI) **] rhythm.  The
patient was intubated in the field and started on lidocaine
and a nitroglycerin drip.  She was given Lopressor 5 mg IV
times four and Esmolol 40 mg IV times one.

The first set at the outside hospital showed a CK of 55.9,
troponin 6.02.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
and further evaluation and treatment.  At baseline, the
patient is very sedentary.  She has had some dyspnea on
exertion.  She has never had chest pain before.  She has had
syncope three to four times throughout her life, no known
etiology.  She has a 75 pack year history.  Occasionally, she
takes Percocet for abdominal discomfort.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Flare of MS many years ago.
2.  History of GERD.
3.  Depression.
4.  Anxiety.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Percocet p.r.n.

TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lidocaine drip at 2.0 mg per minute.
2.  Nitroglycerin drip at 80 micrograms per kilogram per
minute.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

She does have some type of allergy to paper tape.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She works at a surgical supply company.  She
is married and lives with her husband, but no children in the
house.  She has a 75 pack year history, quite ten years ago.
She denied any alcohol or drug use, per the family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother had a MI in her 50s and
died in her 50s after having a defibrillator placed or a
pacemaker.  The patient's family denied any history of
diabetes, hypertension, or sudden cardiac death.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Upon presentation to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, the patient had the following
physical examination.  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.3, blood
pressure 118/70, heart rate 105, [**Hospital6 **] tachycardia.  She was
on assist control ventilator with tidal volume 600,
respiratory rate 12, 75% oxygen.  She had a PEEP of 5,
saturating 99% on those settings.  General:  Intubated and
sedated, unresponsive.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light.  She had eyes roving bilaterally.  She
was anicteric.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac but regular.
She had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  There was normal S1
and S2 appreciated.  There was no S3 or S4.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  She had 2+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Arm responses, not withdrawing to
pain at that time.  Her feet were held in extension
bilaterally, slightly increased tone and upper extremity tone
was within normal limits.  Her toes were downgoing
bilaterally.  Her deep tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric
throughout.

LABORATORY STUDIES FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood
cell count 14.2, hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 43.0, platelets
340,000.  PT 13.1, PTT 23.1, INR 1.1.  Chemistry Seven:
Sodium 143, potassium 3.8, chloride 108, bicarbonate 22, BUN
15, creatinine 0.9, glucose 146.  Of note, she had a tox
screen that was positive for opiates at the outside hospital.
She had a U/A which showed 30 protein, [**3-5**] red blood cells.
Her CK here at [**Hospital3 **] was 1,142 with MB of 56, troponin
6.

She had a head CT at the outside hospital which was negative
for bleed.

An EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] tachycardia
around 100, left axis deviation, normal intervals, possible
[**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement, no ventricular hypertrophy.  There
were Q waves in I and aVL and V5 and V6.  There was T wave
flattening in I, aVL, V4 through V6.  There were no rhythm
strips available from the field where she was defibrillated.

LABORATORY DATA FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  The first set of
laboratories revealed a white blood cell count of 18.5,
hematocrit 39.8, platelets 327,000.  PT 20.1, PTT 127, INR
1.1.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 108, bicarbonate
21, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7, glucose 157.  Calcium 8.8,
magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 2.6.  Her first CK here rose from
the outside hospital was 1,142 to 2,273.

She had an echocardiogram at the bedside which showed global
left ventricular hypokinesis with an EF of about 20%.  She

had a chest x-ray shot which showed possible cephalization
and possible right upper lobe collapse.  In addition, the
patient subsequently had an U/A drawn which showed trace
leukocyte esterase, [**4-2**] white cells.

She also had cardiac catheterization performed which revealed
the following:  The patient had a cardiac output of 3.75,
cardiac index 2.13.  Her coronary angiography revealed a
normal left main coronary artery, a moderate calcification of
the LAD with a 50% mid, 60% ostial D1 lesion.  Her left
circumflex was with 100% thrombotic OM-1 with patent left
collaterals.  The RCA showed balance dominance fills a small
portion of PDA territory.  No significant disease.  The other
findings included mildly elevated filling pressures with a
depressed cardiac index.

Left ventriculography showed anterolateral and apical
akinesis, no mitral regurgitation.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction of 25%.

The patient had subsequent chest x-rays which revealed
resolution of CHF and no opacities or infiltrates.  Her CKs
continued to rise to 4,044 and peaked there.  Her pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 20.

The day prior to discharge, the patient had the following
laboratory values.  Her white blood cell count was 8.2,
hematocrit 30.1, platelets 222,000.  Sodium 139, K 3.9,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 26, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, calcium
8.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 4.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Pump function as shown by
echocardiography and cardiac catheterization:  The patient
has a severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction
with elevated filling pressures.  The EF is approximately
20%. The patient was clinically volume overloaded with
crackles bilaterally on examination. She was diuresed and
started on 40 p.o. q.d. of Lasix with gradual resolution of
the crackles.

She was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and
tolerated these well for her low ejection fraction.

RHYTHM:  The patient was transferred here for apparent V-fib
arrest presumed due to ischemia given the ruling in by
cardiac enzymes, findings on EKG consistent with a myocardial
infarction.  She had an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator placed two days prior to discharge.  She
experienced no ectopy the last several days of her admission.
She was rate controlled with beta blocker.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had a stent placed to a
large OM-1 vessel following non ST elevation MI.  She
remained chest pain-free throughout the duration of her
hospital stay.  She was started on Plavix, statin, aspirin,
beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  Of note, the patient
complained of back pain t
