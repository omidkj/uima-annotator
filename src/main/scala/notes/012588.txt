Imaging:
Head CT [**12-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral extra-axial collections which exert mass effect on
the brain as noted above.
2. Multiple facial fractures are unchanged since [**2156-11-9**].
.
CTA Chest [**12-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Equivocal nonobstructing emboli, one set of segmental
arteries, left
lower lobe, not sufficient to explain desaturation.
2. Mild-to-moderate small airways obstruction.
3. Possible tracheomalacia. Possible small tracheal nodule.
Suggest repeat
examination in three months to include dynamic expiratory
imaging for airway assessment.
.
Head CT [**12-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable size of bilateral subdural collections. A new focus of

hyperdensity within the right subdural collection is consistent
with acute
hemorrhage.
2. Increased opacification of the left maxillary sinus and of
the posterior oropharynx. Soft tissue density appears to extend
into the posterior oral cavity.
.
Head CT [**12-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Expected postoperative pneumocephalus was decreased in size
of left
subdural collection.
2. Increase in size of right subdural collection, with new, 7 mm
leftward
shift of midline structures.
.
Head CT [**12-10**] #2:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of right-sided subdural catheter with
decreased size of
subdural hematoma. Subarachnoid blood and air are now apparent
at the right
frontoparietal convexity.
2. Slight increase in size of left-sided subdural collection
with high-
density material superiorly could be due to new hemorrhage or
due to
redistribution of blood. Further followup recommended. Other
changes as
above.
.
Head CT [**12-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post removal of right subdural catheter. No
significant interval
change in bilateral regions of subdural hemorrhage as described
above and
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the high right frontoparietal region.
Decreased
pneumocephalus.
2. Aerosolized secretions with air-fluid levels noted within all
the
paranasal sinuses. While this may be related to patient's
intubated status,
similar findings can be seen with acute sinusitis.
.
Head CT [**12-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Comparative study demonstrating larger fluid
collection in the
soft tissues adjacent to the burr hole site on the right
parietal bone,
producing soft tissue swelling. Additionally there is a larger
area of low
attenuation in the right frontoparietal region measuring
approximately 2.9 x 3.6 cm and inferiorly measuring 3.1 x 3.6 cm
as described above, suspicious for an early abscess formation
versus vasogenic edema, persistent mild mass effect in the
lateral ventricle. Unchanged bilateral subdural hygromas.
Residual blood products noted on the left subdural space.
Unchanged residual subdural hematoma along the right tentorium.
No significant pattern of enhancement is demonstrated after the
administration of contrast.
.
Head CT [**12-16**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in bilateral
predominantly low-
density extra-axial fluid collections, with small foci of
hyperdensity.
Unchanged fluid collection adjacent to burr hole site in the
right parietal bone.
.
ECHO [**12-21**]:
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
EEG [**12-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very low
voltage
slow background throughout with occasional bursts of generalized

slowing. These findings indicate a severe encephalopathy
affecting both
cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes but
raised
intracranial pressure can also be responsible. The low voltage
background can also be the result of subdural hematomas.
Nevertheless,
there were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were
no
epileptiform features.
.
CT Chest [**12-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacity, suggesting
multifocal
pneumonia, could be aspiration.
