PA and lateral chest [**2126-12-16**]:
Change from the initial read including the report of a
mediastinal
mass and recommendation for CT followup

CT chest [**2126-12-17**]:
1. Large heterogeneously enhancing right hilar and mediastinal
mass extending from the right main stem bronchus and causing
collapse of the right middle and right lower lobes. The right
upper lobe bronchus may also be involved, but the right upper
lung has not collapsed and is hyperexpanded. There is shift of
the mediastinum towards the right.

2. Mediastinal adenopathy.

3. Hypodensities in the spleen and liver, incompletely evaluated
on this
examination. The liver lesion is too small to charaterize. The
splenic lesion likely represents a hemangioma.

4. The mediastinal mass extend to and may infiltrate into the
esophagus as no fat planes separate the two and the proximal
esophagus is dilated

PA and lateral chest [**2126-12-17**]:
Right upper lobe previously well aerated is now severely
atelectatic, moderate right pleural effusion has increased, and
middle and lower lobe remain collapsed. Emphysematous left lung
is clear. ET is tube in standard
placement.

[**2126-12-17**] BAL:
Bronchial lavage:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Reactive bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes
  and neutrophils.

[**2126-12-19**] BAL:
ATYPICAL.

  A few atypical keratinized squamous cells in a background
  of neutrophils, bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, and
  debris.

[**2126-12-23**]:
Right main stem bronchus mass:
Right mainstem bronchus mass, endobronchial biopsy:

Respiratory mucosa with acute inflammation, reserve cell
hyperplasia, and organizing fibrinous exudate; distorted
inflamed tissue, question ulcer bed; no malignancy identified;
Stain  for fungus will be sent as an addendum.

TTE:  No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Left ventricular
