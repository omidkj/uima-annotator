History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year-old woman with a history or recurrent UTIs as
well as a history of mild ILD, hypertension, diastolic CHF, CAD
and mild vascular dementia with multiple recent hospitalizations
for pan-sensitive e coli UTIs who presents from her [**Hospital 4382**] facility with fever and decreased responsiveness as found
by the staff at her [**Hospital3 **] facility two hours prior to
arrival.
Her nephew explains that due to her history of recurrent UTIs
she is seen by [**Name8 (MD) **] NP[**MD Number(3) 18184**] ALF every Friday. This past Friday
she was noted to have a fever and a chest x-ray and he thinks a
UA was checked. Per his report she was not started on
antibiotics because there was no physician available to write
for them over the weekend and she and her family want to keep
her out of the ED as much as possible.
In the ED, initial VS were: temp 104, defervesced to 99 after
rectal acetaminophen and fluids. UA positive. EKG: sinus
tachycardia. CXR: similar to prior with left diaphragmatic
paralysis. Mental status improved significantly. BP still low.
Fluids: 4.5 L crystalloid which was stopped given concern for
pulm edema. The patient does not want a central line right now,
but is okay with us starting peripheral norepinephrine, which
currently is at 0.6mcg/kg. She was given vancomycin 1 gram and
cefepime 2 grams for GU coverage, and flagyl 500mg IV for
concern for cdiff at her nursing home. VS at time of transfer
were 99.2 82 91/38 22 97% 2LNC.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were hr 70 bp 75/57 97% on
4L. She appeared comfortable and had no specific complaints.
Patient and nephew confirmed code status of DNR/DNI, with no
central lines or arterial lines but they ok with fluids,
antibiotics, and peripheral pressors. She does not think she
would want blood however her nephew would ask that we further
discuss this with him before not giving her blood if this was
life-saving.

CXFR:
The patient is rotated with respect to the film.  Lung volumes
are low and the
left hemidiaphragm is markedly elevated, similar to prior.
Cardiomediastinal
contours appear stable.  Indistinct appearance of the pulmonary
vascular
markings is compatible with mild interstitial edema.  No focal
consolidation,
substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No radiopaque
foreign body.

IMPRESSION:

Mild pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 85 year old woman with a history of recurrent UTIs
who presents from a [**Hospital1 1501**] with sepsis in the setting of a UTI.

# Sepsis due to UTI: Patient is septic with fever, leukocytosis
and hypotension in the setting of a known UTI. Of note patient
does not want a central line but is ok with peripheral pressors.
She was on norepinephrine for MAP>60, but successfully weaned
off on [**9-10**]. She was also given aggressive fluid resuscitation
and started on cefepime and vancomycin (day 1: [**9-9**]) for broad
GU coverage. Urine culture grew E. coli. Vancomycin discontinued
on [**9-10**].  Subsequently transitioned to Cipro.  Should continue
through [**2120-9-20**], 12 day course.  Foley DC'd
- Consider ID referral to explore options to prevent recurrent
UTI

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt presented with
wheezes and crackles on exam, and has hx of dCHF. Given one dose
of IV Lasix 20mg and symptoms improved with diuresis. She was
restarted on home dose of Lasix every other day, the
