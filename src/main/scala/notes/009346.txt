Studies:

CXR [**2192-1-24**]
PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status
post median
sternotomy and CABG. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size
is difficult due to the presence of a chronic, moderate-to-large
left pleural effusion, which appears slightly increased in size
when compared to prior study. There is persistent left basilar
opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The
right lung demonstrates mild atelectasis at the lung base, but
is otherwise clear. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no
pulmonary vascular congestion. The aorta remains tortuous and
calcified.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large chronic left pleural effusion,
slightly
increased compared to the prior study with persistent left
basilar
opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, though
infection
cannot be completely excluded.

CXR [**2192-1-26**]:
FINDINGS: Sternotomy wires are unchanged. The heart and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits and stable. There
has been interval decrease in a left-sided pleural effusion with
some persisting left basilar atelectasis.  The right lung is
clear. A line between the posterior aspects of the left third
and fourth rib space is more compatible with a skin fold rather
than the visceral pleura of the lung, so pneumothorax is not
favored. However, given the recent instrumentation, if growing
clinical concern for pneumothorax exists, short-interval
followup may be considered.

LENI [**2192-1-25**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
