Admission Date:  [**2196-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-12-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2156-6-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a forty-year-old
woman with a history of asthma, significant smoking history
and Depo-Provera use for birth control who was well until 7:30
p.m. when her boyfriend noted that she got up to walk and
fell down. She could not talk or follow commands and could
not move. EMS was called and she was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for evaluation. While in the
Emergency Room, the patient was within a three hour time
limit for TPA administration and received TPA in the
Emergency Room.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems at the time revealed
that the patient did not have any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, headache, visual changes, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, abdominal pain or GU complaints.

IMAGING STUDIES: MR diffusion imaging showed slowing over the
left MCA. MR  angiography showed occlusion of the left
proximal MCA with T2 scans showing no evidence of bleeding.
At 9 p.m. that evening, the patient was given 6.5 mg bolus of
TPA, followed by 58.9 mg over an hour's time. She was sent to
the Neuro SICU with systolic blood pressures of 160 to 180
using peripheral Dopamine as needed. A follow-up head CT scan
was then performed showing hyperdensity within the left
middle cerebral artery and hypoattenuation within the left
basal ganglia and cerebral cortex with edema, thus confirming
the left MCA distribution infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission
showed blood pressure of 134/175, heart rate of 84,
temperature of 97.7 F. Neck examination showed no carotid
bruits. Mucous membranes were moist with normocephalic and
atraumatic head. Cardiovascular examination shoed a regular
rhythm. Pulmonary examination revealed lungs that were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended. On neurologic examination,
limitation initially presents that she was non-verbal, she
followed midline commands and simple appendicular commands on
the left. Cranial nerve examination, the patient has decrease
response in the right field. Funduscopic examination was
normal. Pupils reacted normally to light. Extraocular
movements were full. Facial movements, there was a dense
right facial paresis at the forehead. Palate elevation is
symmetric. Tongue protrudes midline. On motor examination,
bulk was normal. Tone is flaccid on the right, showing a
severe right hemiparesis in the arm and leg with 1/5 strength
in the flexors of the arm and leg. Reflexes were present and
symmetric with plantar extensor reflexes on the right side.
On sensory examination, the patient had localized pain
including the right side.

LABORATORY STUDIES/X-RAYS: The patient's laboratory studies
were extensively monitored during this admission, especially
during her stay in the Intensive Care Unit. A hypercoagulable
work up was sent including a normal factor VII, normal
antithrombin III, slightly high protein C at 147 with factor
V Leiden pending at the time of discharge. This will be
followed in the clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12544**]. The patient also
had an elevated cholesterol of 230 for which a lipid lowering
medication was started during this admission. Prothrombin
mutation was also pending at the time of discharge. Protein S
was perceived as normal. Cardiolipin antibody was normal, as was
antifossa
lipid antibody. Subsequent imaging over the admission showed
an evolving hemorrhagic transformation in the area of the
left MCA infarction, as per CT scans performed in the two to
three days prior to discharge. The patient's most recent CT
scan obtained on [**2196-5-28**], showed increased density in
the left middle cerebral artery with persistent foci of
increased density in the left middle cerebral infarction
indicative of petechial hemorrhage in the infarction. An
abdominal CT scan performed on [**2196-12-27**], showed a
right iliac deep venous thrombosis with no evidence of
infarction of the liver, spleen or kidney that is clinically
questioned. Otherwise, chemistries and complete blood counts
were monitored closely during this admission with no
clinically significant abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was intensely monitored in the
Intensive Care Unit and repeat imaging showed petechial
hemorrhages in the area of the left middle cerebral artery
distribution but no uncontrolled hemorrhage. It was thought
that the patient's stroke was due to embolic phenomena that
resulted from hypercoagulable state from a genetic
abnormality exacerbated by oral contraceptive use as an
outpatient which when combined with the patient's heavy
smoking put her at risk for cerebrovascular accident. When
the patient was deemed stable with no advancing hemorrhage,
the patient was transferred to the general medical floor on
the Neurology service for further work up. As noted above, an
abdominal CT scan revealed right DVT in the iliac vein, which
required the placement of a DVT filter in the inferior vena
cava by Interventional Radiology. The type of filter that was
placed can be removed at any time if and when the decision is
made to anticoagulate the patient for stroke prevention. The
patient's neurologic examination throughout her admission
improved with her aphasia improving from a dense mixed
aphasia to a transcortical mixed aphasia at the time of
discharge. The patient's power in the right upper and lower
extremities also improved with time and physical therapy
intervention, increasing to a [**3-20**] in the upper extremity and
a 4-/5 in the lower extremity at the time of discharge. The
patient was placed on Plavix and subcutaneous Heparin for CVA
and DVT prophylaxis during this admission. Great care was
taken to prevent any extension of the hemorrhage and the
decision was made not to anticoagulate the patient with
either Coumadin or Lovenox at the time of discharge. However,
repeat head CT scan will be needed and has been scheduled for
four to five days after discharge to evaluate the size of
hemorrhagic transformation and after evaluation,
anticoagulation will likely be started and as indicated in
this young female with large middle cerebral artery stroke.
The stroke work up including carotid ultrasounds, which
showed no stenosis of either carotid artery and a
transesophageal echocardiogram performed on [**2196-12-23**],
which showed no echocardiographic evidence of cardiac source
of embolus. This study included a bubble study search for
patent foramen ovale. Therefore, it was thought that the
patient's source for embolus was hypercoagulable state due to
genetic defect, most likely to be factor V Leiden as per the
prevalence in the general population, although prothrombin
mutation can not be ruled out as these laboratory results are
not available at this time. After coordinating follow-up care
with Interventional Radiology, which will contact the patient
to remove new DVT filter, the patient was sent to acute
rehabilitation facility where she could regain her strength
and resume her abilities to carry out her activities of daily
living. The patient will have close follow-up after discharge
as a repeat CT scan will be scheduled on [**2197-1-4**], at
9:15 a.m. The results of this CT scan will be followed up by
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12544**] of the Stroke Department, at which time, a
decision regarding anticoagulation will be communicated to
the [**Hospital 228**] rehabilitation facility. The patient's primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will also be informed about
this decision. Interventional Radiology Department will also
contact the patient regarding the date on which they can
retrieve the deep venous thrombosis filter placed in her
inferior vena cava as the retrieval equipment is not
available at this time and they can not set a specific date.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
