Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2110-6-6**], he underwent incision hernia repair. Two
[**Known lastname 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drains were placed subcutaneously. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] W.
[**Doctor Last Name **]. Two subcutaneous drains were placed. Please refer to
operative note for further details. Postop, potassium was 7.8.
This was treated with iv insulin and dextrose without decrease.
He was transferred to the SICU where he required placement of a
temporary dialysis line and was emergently dialyzed. Potassium
decreased to 4.5.

He also experienced RUL collapse that responded to chest PT and
face tent. Repeat CXR demonstrated improvement. He was
transferred out of the SICU. Diet was slowly advanced. Bowel
function was slow to resume. He was receiving iv dilaudid as
well as half of his home dose of methadone. He was given MOM x2
with results.

Urine output decreased on [**6-9**]. This was treated initially with
lasix with minimal response. He appeared dry and received
several iv boluses of fluid as well as maintenance IV fluid.
Previously ordered home diuretics were stopped. Creatinine
increased to as high as 3.7 on postop day 4 (baseline 1.6-2.0).
Acute on chronic renal failure was felt to be due to
cyclosporine. For this reason, cyclosporine was stopped on [**6-10**]
and Rapamune 1mg daily was started on [**6-11**]. Rapamune level was
2.0 on [**6-12**] and dose was increased to 2mg a day. Creatinine
decreased to 2.2 on postop day 6. Urine output increased to
1375ml/day.

JP drainage was serosanguinous. The left JP was removed on [**6-11**].
The medial JP remained in place. Incision was clean, dry and
intact.

He was ambulating independently at time of discharge. [**Hospital1 1474**]
VNA was arranged. The plan was for him to have a rapamune level
on [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7 on [**6-14**].

Of note,methadone dose was decreased to 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] as he was on
prn dilaudid for pain. Methadone was increased to 5mg, but
patient experienced respiratory rate of 5. Dose was decreased to
2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with normalization of respirations.
