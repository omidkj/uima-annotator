Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Hydrochlorothiazide

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary catheterization


History of Present Illness:
89 yo F with no prior h/o known CAD who presents with inferior
STEMI.
.
Per home aid pt was sitting at home with friend when the friend
noted a change in her demeaner, when home aid came to se her she
was unresponsive and her eyes were rolling back and so pt's son
was called. After hanging up she noted pt to be diaphoretic and
nauseous.  Since she seemed to improve somewhat after a few
minutes without an intervention the family decided to wait
initially but then shortly thereafter pt was holding her chest
and said "call an ambulance".
.
Per EMS, when they arrived, EKG tracings were significant for an
inferior STEMI and a code STEMI was activated. She was
reportedly hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s while in route to
the ED. Initial vitals in the ED were BP 129/80, HR 88, and O2
sat 100% NRB. An EKG confirmed an inferoposterior STEMI. She was
given ASA 325 mg po X 1, metoprolol 2.5 mg IV X 1, plavix 600 mg
po X 1, and started on heparin and integrillin gtts. A total of
1.5 L of IVFs were given prior to arrival to the cath lab. In
the cath lab, the pt was started on a dopamine gtt at 5
mcg/kg/min for hypotension. A cardiac cath was significant for 3
vessel disease with total occlusion and thrombus in the prox
RCA, total occlusion of the mid LCx, 80% prox and diffuse mid
70% of the LAD, and 40% prox occlusion of the LMCA. A CI was
depressed at 1.77 with mixed venous oxygen saturation of 51%. A
IABP was unable to be placed [**1-16**] tight R iliac lesion. She was
then transferred to the CCU for further care with a Swan-Ganz
catheter in place and off integrillin and heparin gtts.
.
When seen in the CCU, she denied any chest pain, or shortness of
breath.  Her only complaint was that she was cold.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
# Arthritis, knees
# s/p kidney removal as child
# Anxiety/Depression
# s/p cataract surgery
- R eye 2 weeks ago, L eye several years ago

Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**10-28**] demonstrated:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had diffuse disease with a 40% proximal lesion.  The LAD was
also diffusely diseased with an 80% proximal lesion and a
diffuse 70% lesion.  The LCX was totally occluded at the mid
vessel.  The RCA was totally occluded proximally with an acute
thrombus.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 19 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 25 mm
Hg.  Cardiac index was depressed at 1.8 l/min/m2.
3.  Distal aortagram revealed diffuse aortoiliac disease.
.
TTE ([**10-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated (4.5x5.6)
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%).
focal hypokinesis of the apical two thirds of the right
ventricular free wall
mild AR and AS
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
Renal U/S and duplex ([**11-4**]):
The patient is status post left nephrectomy.  The right
kidney measures 9.2 cm.  The renal cortex is markedly echogenic
consistent
with medical renal disease.  A 1.3 cm simple cyst is seen within
the mid pole of the right kidney.  There are no stones or
hydronephrosis. The renal artery and vein are patent, although
detailed assessment is limited. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Echogenic renal parenchyma consistent with medical renal
disease.  Simple right renal cyst.
.
CXR (AP, [**10-28**]):There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is
elongated.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right main
pulmonary artery.  There is moderate interstitial pulmonary
edema with no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusions.
.
CXR ([**11-3**]): Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with bilateral pleural effusions and some indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.  No evidence of acute pneumonia.  Some prominence in
the azygos region raises the possibility of right-heart failure
.

on heparin and integrillin gtts. A total of 1.5 L of IVFs were
