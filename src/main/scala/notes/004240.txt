Chief Complaint:
Aortic Stenosis presenting for Corevalve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-8-4**] Corevalve/transcatheter aortic valve replacement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112078**] is a 86 y/o man with severe aortic stenosis
(transaortic valve gradient of 41 with a valve area of 0.78 cm2
on [**6-11**]), CAD (LHC and RHC on [**2167-6-11**] showed right dominant 60%
stenosis in the prox diag, a 30% stenosis in the prox circ, 40%
distal RCA and 60-70% distal PDA), dCHF NYHA Class [**Date Range 1105**] for
dyspnea,  Afib on Coumadin and Dig, Severe COPD (FEV1 27%, on 2L
O2), pulmonary HTN, who presents for percutaneous AVR. Deemed to
be an Extreme Risk candidate for surgical aortic valve
replacement (> 50% 30-day mortality or irreversible morbidity).

- In the last year he has worsening SOB with minimal exertion
leading to four hospitalizations (last [**4-26**] at OSH).

- Preop admitted on [**8-3**]. Plavix loaded.

phenylephrine, rocuronium, 2L NS, had UOP 600 and ESBL 200. Pt
was in Afib except during pacing, received vanc/ancef at 1300.

POST-OPERATIVE ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is
probably present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
low-normal global systolic function. Dilated right ventricle
with mild global hypokinesis. Corevalve aortic prosthesis with
normal transvalvular gradient and a very small perivalvular
leak. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-6-11**],
estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher. A Corevalve
prosthesis is now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 86 yo M with severe AS, CAD, dCHF, severe
COPD, pulm HTN, and afib on warfarin presenting for CoreValve
placement.
.
# AO STENOSIS s/p CORE VALVE: orders per Protocol. Off Neo and
Propofol, extubated. Post op hemodynamics per above. With pacing
wires still in place.  The procedure went well and was
uncomplicated.  Post-operative echo showed normal LV systolic
function w/EF 55%, Mild symmetric LVH with low-normal global
systolic function (EF 55%). Dilated right ventricle with mild
global hypokinesis. Corevalve aortic prosthesis with normal
transvalvular gradient and a very small perivalvular leak.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.   Labs prior to
d/c including CBC, ytes, GFR, and ECG were WNL.  He was seen and
evaluted by physical therapy who recommended be discharged to
rehab for continued physical therapy.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Currently in Afib with transvenous pacers
in place. On Digoxin, Dilt, and Warfarin at home, Last INR 1.2.
Diltiazem and warfarin were held post-operatively, but digoxin
was continued.  Warfarin was restarted without a heparin bridge.
 Initially, diltiazem was held in the setting of hypotension on
post-op day 1, but was restarted w/o complications prior to
discharge.  In addition, warfarin was restarted prior to d/c and
will be followed by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] INR was 2.6 on the day of
discharge and he will also be continued on aspirin.
.
# dCHF chronic NYHA Class [**Name10 (NameIs) 1105**] (EF 45% on [**8-4**]): Currently
Euvolemic. Not complaining of SOB/dyspnea/PND. Will cont medical
management. BNP 1546. He was diuresed post operatively with IV
lasix until euvolemic.  He was instructed to continue monitoring
his weight upon discharge as well.  His home medications were
restarted prior to discharge as noted above.  In addition, Lasix
was discontinued and he was discharged to skilled nursing
facility on Torsemide 40mg daily. Weight today ([**8-10**]) 74.2 kg.
.
# Pulmonary HTN - Due to severe obstructive and restrictive
pulmonary disease. Long standing COPD, on home O2, last PFT
shows FEV1 27%, FEV1/FVC 87%. Pulmonary team consulted and
recommended continuing home medications.  Prednisone was
discontinue
