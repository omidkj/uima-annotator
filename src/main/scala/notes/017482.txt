History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old male with prior history of 2 vessel
coronary artery disease s/p 5 DES(3 to LAD and 2 to D1 in [**2170**])
who woke up on [**2178-3-11**] with chest discomfort and palpitations.
Associated symptoms included nausea, lightheadedness,
diaphoresis, and acute lower extremity edema, with associated
shortness of breath.  He presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he
was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the
160s.  He received nitro and chest pressure resolved.  He was
started on IV diltiazem drip for afib with RVR and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**].  Given a positive D-dimer, a V/Q
scan was ordered in setting of his renal failure, which was
negative.  Troponins were negative; EKG revealed LVH and T wave
inversions in V4-V6. He was hypertensive to 200/100s; a nitro
drip was started in addition to diltiazem.  IV lopressor boluses
were also given.  Initially was hypoxemic and was placed on
non-rebreather and then was weaned to 5-6 L NC with saturations
in the mid 90s.  CXR revealed vascular congestion.  He was
started on lasix boluses and was empirically treated for PE with
IV heparin until V/Q scan was negative.  In the setting of acute
congestive heart failure, a 2D echo was obtained which revealed
severe MR, severe elevation of PA pressures (39 mm Hg) and
tricuspid regurgitation.  The cause for acute MR was mysterious.
 On [**3-12**] he went for right heart catheterization which revealed
pulmonary wedge pressures in the 20s, with peak v wave pressure
of 40; PA pressures were 40/25, with RVEDP of 15, and RA
pressure 20.  Coronary angiography was not performed due to
renal failure.  Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed to augment
forward flow.  At time of transfer to CCU, he was additionally
started on nitro drip and continued on lasix drip for his
pulmonary edema and further afterload reduction.  He is
currently endorsing improved shortness of breath.  Cardiac
surgery was consulted; a consult for possible surgical mitral
valve repair is pending.

COMMENTS:     1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system
revealed two-vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically
apparent
disease.  The LAD had patent stents and no angiographically
significant
disease.  The D1 had a 99% mid in-stent restenosis.  The LCx had
no
angiographically significant disease.  The RCA was known
chronically
occluded and had good left to right collaterals.  2.  Limited
resting
hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertenstion with a
central
aortic pressure of 151/105 mmHg.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.

[**3-17**]
ECHO
IMPRESSION: Moderate concentric LVH with borderline normal
systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**3-18**]
ECHO
IMPRESSION: Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and
left atrial appendage with probable thrombus in the left atrial
appendage. Mildly thickened mitral valve with mild prolapse of
A1 scallop and tethering of portions of the anterior and
posterior leaflets. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Extensive
complex, mobile atheroma in the thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old man with acute onset of symptoms who presented to
the ED with no signs of ACS and found to have new 4+ MR, 2+ TR
and Volume overload.
.
# Acute mitral regurgitation:
Likely etiology of his decompensated CHF.  Ischemic event
thought to be unlikely given onset of symptoms > 24 hrs with no
troponin or CK elevation; EKG reveals T wave inversions in V4-V6
which are likely in setting of LVH.  Chest pain free on
admission.  Other possibilities for acute MR included: (1)
spontaneous rupture (2) infective endocarditis (3) myxomatous
disease, ie. mitral valve prolapse (4) severe ischemia without
cardiac necrosis. On admission he was afterload reduced with
IABP/heparin as well as a nitro gtt with goal SBP 140-160s. He
was also started on a lasix gtt with 2L negative goal overnight.
On [**3-14**] he developed a fever 100.4 and his IABP was removed on
[**3-15**], however he then developed absent right distal pulses and
his right foot began to feel numb. Vasc surgery was consulted
and he was started on heparin gtt with Q2H neuro checks on his
distal extremities. Although his leg remained cool, he did not
have pain or sig numbness. His pulses became dopplerable on
[**3-17**]. On [**3-16**] he underwent a Cath which showed 90% D1 stenosis,
RMCA occlusion, no other significant dz. We suggested he undergo
a CABG w/ MVR.
