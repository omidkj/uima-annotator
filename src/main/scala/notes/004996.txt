History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**]
aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2)
who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from
medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently
somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details
are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex
care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry
cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight
was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On
[**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output ("only
drops") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported
compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she
had not filled her aldactone rx.
.
On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived
her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED.
In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR
showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP
with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were
significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was
admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was
initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was
transferred to CCU for pressor support.
.
On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR
18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC.  She was drowsy, but denied current SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling.  She endorsed orthopnea
(c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ
discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills,
diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR.
.
Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF
exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip
with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration
with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not
required outpatient HD since discharge.

Pertinent Studies
ECHO [**5-/2194**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with regional
variation, the apical segments more hypokinetic than the basal
segments. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2194-7-18**]: There is a left-sided pacemaker/ICD with right
atrial and right ventricular leads, as before. Severe
cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Pulmonary venous
congestion is seen without definite interstitial pulmonary
edema. No focal consolidations are seen. There are no pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. There is minimal right
basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission
70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and
poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia,
now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension.
.
Active Issues:
.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient was
hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal
distension at presentation.  Given the patient had been
refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during
her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on
admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic
therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and
hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was
discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and
metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of
dopamine.  It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved
when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with
asynchronous ventricular pacing.  Therefore the patients
pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native
rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR.  Despite this change
urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a
lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis
catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line
(see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient
will be HD dependent.
.
#Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission in the
setting of volume overload.  Her hypotension was beli
