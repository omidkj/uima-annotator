MRI to exclude a more aggressive lesion


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17811**] was admitted to the ACS surgery service for [**Known lastname **]
of the perirectal abscess. On [**4-8**] he underwent an I/D of the
large perirectal abscess and placement of a penrose drain.
Intraop he was in afib with RVR and was transferred to the ICU
for [**Month/Year (2) **]. The following day, he was hemodynamically stable
and was in NSR with betablocker so he was transferred to the
floor. He was put on broad spectrum antibiotics. He was also
having significant hyperglycemia requiring insulin boluses.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for glycemic control. Also, nutrition was
consulted for diabetic diet education. The atrial fibrillation
recurred postoperatively after a brief period in NSR. A CT scan
was obtained to rule out ongoing infection/undrained perirectal
abscess. The CT showed that the abscess was adequately drained.
Cardiology was consulted for assistance in [**Last Name (un) **] of the
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. They recommended continuation of
home Metoprolol XL 100mg PO daily, anti-coagulation for
paroxysmal AF, [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart Monitor on discharge, f/u with
