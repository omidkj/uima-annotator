cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20598**] is a 78 year old with a past medical history of
hypertension and remote tobacco abuse who presents with 8/10
substernal chest pain with the onset at rest at 7AM while eating
breakfast. She called EMS within 1 hour of developing this pain
and en route to hospital in aspirin and 2 sublingual
nitroglycerines were administered. Her pain then decreased to
[**3-5**]. In the outside hospital emergency department, she was
found to have an inferior STEMI with initial vital signs of
110/82, 77 and 100% on 4 L. She was started on heparin,
integrellin, and nitro drips and transferred directly to the
[**Hospital1 18**] cath lab. There she was found to have 3 vessel disease
with a culprit RCA lesion. Her RPL branch was stented. On
hemodyamic evaluation, she was found to have tall V waves
concering for MR. However, once her stent was placed, the tall V
waves resolved. Additionally, to rule out shunt pathology as the
etiology for the tall R waves, her oxygen saturations were
assessed. She had no step up with PA sat 83 and SVC sat 83. CT
[**Doctor First Name **] was consulted in the cath lab and they are working her up
for possible CABG. Her cardiac output post cath was 6.4 and her
index was 3.73.

ECHO: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function appears grossly preserved but
regional wall motion could not be fully assessed. The inferior
wall and apex were not well visualized. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20598**] is a 78 year old woman who presented with an
inferior STEMI on [**4-5**]. She has 3VD with placement of a cypher
stent in the RCA RPL branch as culprit lesion. She was started
on plavix and aspirin. She did appear to have ischemic MR since
she had tall V waves which resolved after stent placement in the
RPL which supplies the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve.
Her repeat echo showed an EF of 55% and 2+ MR.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for operative revascularization.
She was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-9**] for
CABGx3, LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-PDA.  The mitral regurgitation
was found to be mild in the operating room by TEE and the MVR
was not replaced.  She tollerated the procedure well and was
transfered to the CSRU in stable condition.  Upon arrival to the
CSRU she was found to have ST changes on her EKG.  A TEE was
performed which showed mild inferior hypokinesis which was not
thought to be significant. She was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventillation without difficulty and remained
hemodynamically stable with a good cardiac index.  She developed
atrial fibrillation on POD#2 and was started on amiodarone.  She
was transfered to the floor on POD#3 where she began working
with physical therapy.  She quickly progressed with physical
therapy, but repeatedly complained on feeling short of breath
with ambulation.  Her lasix was increased and a CXR did not show
significant effusions or infiltrate.  On POD#7 she was noted to
have an elevated WBC.
