PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

4.  Blindness.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Venostasis.
8.  Diverticulosis.
9.  Gross hematuria.
10. Second-degree AV block.
11. History of endocarditis in [**2118**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker and denied
alcohol use.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  WBC 25.1, hematocrit 35.5,
platelets 370,000.  Sodium 125, potassium 5.2, chloride 86,
C02 21, BUN 55, creatinine 3, glucose 235.

KUB revealed small bowel dilated.  Air-fluid levels were
present.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97, pulse 95, BP 144/52, respirations 16, 02 saturation 99%
on room air.  General:  The patient was in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  The sclerae were anicteric.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese, nontender, with no
rebound or guarding.  Extremities:  With stasis disease,
palpable DP and PT pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Service for aggressive hydration and electrolyte repletion.
NG tube and Foley catheter were placed.  She was started on
antibiotic coverage with levofloxacin and Flagyl.  CT
examination of the abdomen was performed which revealed small
bowel dilation to the ileum with no clear transition point.
Small bowel obstruction was evident and large bowel was
collapsed.

Given these findings, Ms. [**Known lastname 12367**] was taken to the Operating
Room on [**2119-6-5**] where she was found to have a left
incarcerated inguinal hernia.  The hernia was reduced.  The
procedure was performed without complication.  The patient
was transferred to the floor after recovery in the PACU.
Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 12367**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12368**] to 84% on 100% face
mask.  She was found to be hypoxic and acidotic on blood gas.
Chest x-ray at this time revealed massive atelectasis with
collapse of the left lower lobe.

Given the large AA gradient, Ms. [**Known lastname 12367**] was taken to CAT scan
for CTA to rule out pulmonary embolus.  This examination was
negative.  With oxygen and incentive spirometry, Ms. [**Known lastname 12369**]
oxygenation status progressively improved.  This was followed
by respiratory failure which provided aggressive nebulizer
treatments.  A NG tube was placed on [**2119-6-7**] due to
increasing gastric distention.  Given her slow course, Ms.
[**Known lastname 12367**] was started on TPN for nutritional supplementation.

NG tube output progressively decreased and was discontinued
on [**2119-6-12**].  Her diet was slowly advanced; however, she
suffered from a prolonged ileus and with each diet
advancement began having nausea and vomiting, even after
return of bowel function she continued to have nausea and
vomiting and thus her diet was advanced very slowly and she
was continued on TPN.

On [**2119-6-20**], Ms. [**Known lastname 12367**] developed bradycardia down to the 30s
and 40s.  She also felt short of breath at this time.  She
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring.  Cardiology consult was obtained and Ms. [**Known lastname 12367**]
was found to be in atrial fibrillation.  It was decided at
this time that she would not necessarily need pacemaker
placement and that her bradycardia and hypotension was likely
a vagal response.  All beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers were held at this time.  The patient will follow-up
for further cardiology workup as an outpatient.

Her stay in the unit was unremarkable and cardiac and
pulmonary status remained stable.  She was transferred back
to the floor on [**2119-6-21**].  She was doing well at this point.
Her diet was advanced to a diabetic diet which she tolerated
well.  TPN was discontinued.  She was working well with
physical therapy.  She did develop a urinary tract infection
which was treated with Levaquin.

On [**2119-6-24**], she was felt stable to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Vital signs:  Temperature
98.1, pulse 72, BP 150/70, respirations 24, 02 saturation 98%
on room air.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally with mild left lower lobe
coarseness.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  The incision was clean, dry, and
intact.  Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atrovent nebulizer, one neb q. six hours p.r.n.
2.  Albuterol nebulizer, one neb q. six hours p.r.n.
3.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Tylenol 325 to 650 mg q. four to six hours p.r.n.
6.  Aspirin, coated, 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Ambien 5-10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q.d. times three days.
9.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.
11. Glucotrol XL 5 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Regular insulin sliding scale for glucose of 0-150, 0
units; 151-200, 3 units; 201-250, 5 units; 251-300, 7 units;
301-350, 9 units; 351-400, 11 units; greater than 400, 13
units.
