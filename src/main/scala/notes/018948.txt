C-SPINE CT [**2192-2-10**]:
1. Traumatic grade II anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 with right
inferior C6 facet fracture and locking of the C6-7 facets. The
left C6-7 facets are perched. There is likely moderate-to-severe
cord compression and associated epidural hematoma.

2. Prominent posterior soft tissue stranding and numerous
osseous fragments are observed posterior to the spinous
processes. These findings are worrisome for associated
ligamentous injury.

HEAD CT: There is residual IV contrast(given in OSH) in the
dural venous sinuses. A hazy area of increased attenuation is
observed in the medial right frontal lobe. There is no
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is
preserved. Osseous structures are unremarkable. A small
subgaleal hematoma is noted over the posterior vertex.

MRI of  C-SPINE:[**2192-2-11**]
Subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a
flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal,
interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior
subluxation of C6 over C7. Moderate spinal canal stenosis and
indentation on the spinal cord at this level with a small
posterior epidural hematoma measuring approximately 1 cm. The
right facet joint is dislocated and locked and the left facet
joint is perched as described on the CT. No increased signal
seen within the spinal cord. Degenerative changes at other
levels.

BILAT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER STUDY;[**2192-2-13**]
Evidence of chronic prior DVT on right leg. No acute DVT.

ECHO; [**2192-2-13**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color  Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal  cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall  motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are  normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis  is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated  pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial  effusion.


MR CERVICAL SPINE; MR THORACIC SPINE;LUMBAR SPINE [**2192-2-18**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with s/p cervical fusion, decreased lower
extremity movement

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the cervical and thoracic spine were acquired.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of
[**2192-2-11**].

FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone
spinal fixation for correction of previously seen fracture
subluxation at C6-7 level. Laminectomy is seen from C3-4 to C6-7
level with pedicle screws from C5 to T1 level. There is
increased signal seen within the disc at C6-7 level indicating
previous trauma at this level. There is no intraspinal fluid
collection identified. There is no subdural hematoma or spinal
cord compression seen in the cervical region.

From skull base to C6 level, no increased signal seen within the
spinal cord. However, at C6-7 and inferiorly to T2 level, there
is increased signal seen within the central portion of the
spinal cord which could be secondary to cord edema or ischemic
changes within the cord.

In the thoracic region, multilevel degenerative changes are
seen. No evidence of abnormal signal seen within the thoracic
cord below T2 level. There is no evidence of intraspinal
hematoma seen.

IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI study, the patient has
undergone fusion for previously noted subluxation at C6-7 level.
Increased signal is seen within the spinal cord from C6-7 to T2
level indicative of cord edema or ischemia within the cord.
Followup examination is suggested. Degenerative changes are seen
at multiple levels in the cervical and thoracic region. No
evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or extrinsic spinal
cord compression is seen. Multilevel degenerative changes.
Mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level secondary to disc
bulging, central protrusion and facet degenerative changes.
Fluid within the facet joint at L4-5 level indicating increased
mobility.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2192-2-10**] after sustaining a
fall down [**9-27**] stairs at home. At that time, chest and pelvis
X-rays were negative fro fractures, although he did have a tiny
right upper lobe nodule that should be followed up in one year.
Hand X-rays were negative for fracture.  A CT of his C-spine
revealed a traumatic grade II anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 with a
right inferior C6 facet fracture and locking of the C6-7 facets.
The left C6-7 facets are perched. In addition, there was
evidence of moderate-to-severe cord compression and associated
epidural hematoma.  There were also prominent posterior soft
tissue stranding and numerous osseous fragments posterior to the
spinous processes, which worrisome for associated ligamentous
injury. A CT of his head demonstrated a hazy area of increased
attenuation along the medial right frontal lobe, which was
unclear whether it was secondary to previously administered IV
contrast or a small amount of subarachnoid blood.  An left
radial arterial line and a left subclavian central line were
placed and he was transferred from the ED to the ICU.  He was
given Solumederol and Dilantin and kept NPO for surgery.  Since
he had been on coumadin for a previous DVT (INR 1.6), he had to
be corrected with 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  On HD 2, a
repeat head CT showed a small focus of hyperdensity along the
medial border of the right frontal lobe concerning for an
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as a small (4mm width)
subdural fluid collection concerning for a small subdural
effusion. An MRI of his spine showed a subluxation of C6 over C7
with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption
of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior
longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
There was also evidence of moderate spinal canal stenosis and
indentation on the spinal cord at this level with a small
posterior epidural hematom
