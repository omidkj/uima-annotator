Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo female history poorly controlled DM1, HTN, HL, and
cardiomyopathy presents with N/V/D in DKA.
.
#DKA: The patient presented with hyperglycemia and DKA with an
anion gap of 28. The patient was started on IVF with potassium,
as well as an insulin gtt. We awaited closure of the patient's
AG, after which point SC insulin was started (home regimen of
lantus 60 plus humalog sliding scale).  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.
The patient's DKA was felt likely secondary to insulin
non-compliance, as she did not have any active signs or cultures
indicative of infection, though it is possible that she had a
mild viral gastroenteritis as a trigger. A normal EKG made ACS
unlikely. We aggressively repleted her potassium. Extensive
diabetes education was done by MDs and RNs.  She will follow up
closely with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**First Name (STitle) 31365**].
.
#leukocytosis: Pt WBC count was initally 20 on arrival to the
ED, which trended down to 12 the next day in the ICU, then
normalized. Urine cx and CXR were unremarkable, and did not
reveal any source of infection; this was likely a stress
response from DKA.
.
#tachycardia:  likely [**12-22**] to dehydration in the setting of DKA.
Abdominal pain improving.  The patient's tachycardia resolved
after administration of IV fluids.
.
# she was continued on her home medications for hypertension and
hyperlipidemia.
