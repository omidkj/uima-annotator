Diagnostic Studies:

Cardiac MRI:
1. Severely increased left ventricular cavity size severe global
hypokinesis. The LVEF was severely depressed at 21%. The
effective forward LVEF was severely depressed at 15%. No CMR
evidence of myocardial scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild free wall
hypokinesis. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 39%.
3. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
4. Mild right atrial atrial enlargement. Moderate left atrial
enlargement.

TTE: No intracardiac evidence of thromboembolic phenomenon.
Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis
(LVEF 15%). Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CT Perfusion: Right parieto-occipital CVA, with increased mean
transit time, decreased cerebral blood flow and decreased
cerebral blood volume.

CTA head/neck: Cut off of the parieto-occipital and calcarine
branches of the right PCA, which appears occluded beyond the P3
segment.

MRI head: Similar distribution of right PCA territory infarction
with
subsequent hemorrhage

CT head ([**5-25**]): Allowing for difference in modality, no
significant change from MR prior the same day, with small amount
of hemorrhage and right PCA territory infarction as described

CT head ([**5-27**]): Unchanged appearance of the right posterior
cerebral artery territory infarction with hemorrhagic
transformation. No increased hemorrhage. Progressive effacement
of the right frontal and parietal sulci at the vertex, without
evidence of cytotoxic edema to suggest new infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the Cardiology
service for EP study and further work-up/management of new onset
dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%). While inpatient on [**5-24**], he
awoke and the TV looked blurry and he could not see anything to
the left; a Code Stroke was called- NIHSS was 3 and there was no
clear symptom onset so tPA not given. CT stroke protocol
performed- CT perfusion showed right parieto-occpitial stroke
and CTA showed cut off of the parieto-occipital and calcarine
branches of the right PCA, which appears occluded beyond the P3
segment. IV heparin started for presumed cardiomebolic etiology
given his poor cardiac function (low EF). He subsequently
developed occipital headache and was sent for MRI, which showed
hemorrhagic transformation. He was then sent to the Neuro ICU
for further management. Repeat CT studies have been performed
and have showed that the hemorrhage is stable. He was restarted
on Aspirin for secondary stroke prevention as anticoagulation
with Coumadin needs to be held in the setting of hemorrhage. The
Coumadin can be started on [**2131-6-1**] with Aspirin bridging until
INR therapeutic. Once INR between [**1-18**], the Aspirin can be
stopped. To allow for BP autoregulation in the setting of his
stroke, Lisinopril was initially held but was restarted at lower
dose of 5 mg daily to allow for cardioprotective effect. On
exam, he remains with left hemianopia.

Cardiology:
 -Dilated Cardiomyopathy: New dx of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
with EF 15-20% on Echo. Cardiac MRI performed (please see
results in results section). Initially given Lasix 80 mg IV with
good effect and then switched to lasix 80 mg PO BID. Also given
spironolactone, lisinopril, carvedilol. In the setting of his
stroke, his medications were adjusted to prevent hypotension.
Currently on dose of Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 5 mg daily,
Spironolactone 25 mg daily and Metoprolol XL 50 mg daily.
 -Ectopy: Pt had ectopy at OSH and was transfered here. Pt had
EP study which was not able to induce VT. He will get repeat
echo in 3 mo. If EF<30%, will consider ICD placement.


Endocrine: Newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 durign
admission. HbA1C 6.6 during admission. He was seen by [**Last Name (un) **]
consult for help with management. He was initially on Metformin,
but this was stopped due to low EF. Oral hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
switched to Glipizide 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge. He was on
SSI and Lantus 4 units qhs as inpatient, but after discussion
with [**Last Name
