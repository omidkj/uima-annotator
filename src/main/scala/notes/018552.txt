severe 2-3 days prior to that admission.  The pt was SOB both at
rest and on exertion with "labored breathing".  The pt denies CP
at that time.  The pt was found to have bilat PEs on CT at the
OSH. At the OSH, O2 sat 89% on RA. ABG: 7.47/34/66 on 3 lt O2.
Received heparin gtt, albuterol and Lasix. Trop 0.20. INR 1.15.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.  Venous duplex of the LLE revealed

pt has been continued on heparin gtt and started on coumadin in
the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 78 yo M with PMH significant for afib, HTN,
and DM who presented for further management of PEs in bilateral
pulmonary arteries diagnosed at OSH. Pt still subtherapeutic on
coumadin at the time of discharge.
.
1) PE: Per OSH record, the pt had extensive bilateral pulmonary
artery embolisms extending into the segmental arteries.  Lower
extremity duplex at our hospital revealed a L posterior tibial
vein thrombus, which is the likely etiology for the pulmonary
embolisms.  TTE was negative for thrombus and revealed EF >55%.
Pt was continued on a heparin gtt with goal PTT 80-100, and
started on coumadin 5 mg po qhs.  Ultimately the coumadin was
increased to 7.5 mg po qhs given his subtherapeutic INR (goal
[**1-20**]).  The pt was discharged home with a prescription for
lovenox injections to cover him for 5 days while his INR becomes
therapeutic.  The pts wife was instructed on proper lovenox
injection technique.  The pt is to follow up with his PCP in
[**Name9 (PRE) 18344**] for coag checks and coumadin adjustment over the next
week. Consideration may be given to a hypercoaguable workup as
an outpt (ie. r/o malignancy with PSA and colonoscopy
screening).
.
2) HTN: The pts home dose metoprolol was increased to 75 mg po
BID for SBP in the 150s.
.
3) Afib: Apparently pt has not been on coumadin since [**2095**].  As
stated above, the pt was started on coumadin and bridged with
heparin.  He was discharged home with Lovenox bridge.
.
3) NIDDM: The pt was on a RISS while inpatient.  He was
discharged home on his home glyburide regimen. Given h/o DM, pt
was started on daily ASA.
