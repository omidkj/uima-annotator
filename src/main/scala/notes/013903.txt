Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2168-4-13**]:IMPRESSION:

1. Status post frontal craniotomy and resection of left frontal
extra-axial mass. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

2. Persistent edema within the left frontal lobe resulting and
minimal of the normally midline structures.

MRI head [**2168-4-15**]:
The study is markedly degraded by motion from respiratory
artifact. The patient is status post bifrontal craniotomy with
postoperative changes including an extraaxial fluid collection
and pneumocephalus. There is redemonstration of extensive edema
in the left frontal lobe, no convincing enhancing lesion is seen
to suggest residual neoplasm. Ventricles and sulci are stable in
size. There is less midline shift.

LENIs [**2168-4-17**]: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity deep
venous thrombosis


Brief Hospital Course:
Neurosurgery: Patient admitted to Neurosurgery service s/p
bifrontal craniotomy. Post-op CT/MRI showed post-operative
changes with minimal pneumocephalus and no hemorrhage. The
patient's post-operative course was complicated by uncontrolled
pain. Patient has history of chronic narcotic use and
acute/chronic pain consult placed. Consult service recommended
Dilaudid PCA pump which improved pain control and he was
continued on home dose of Oxycontin 30 mg po q12hours. He
required lowdose ativan for anxiety. He was able to be
transitioned to his home oral pain medication regimen POD 3.Per
Pain consult, his Neurontin can be titrated to 3600mg /day and
patient can be switched to Methadone if chronic pain becomes an
issue in the future. He was started on Decadron which will be
tapered over weeks. Dilantin started and patient will continue
on this medication till follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient
worked with PT/OT which cleared him for home.

Resp: Post-op patient had stridor and upper airway wheezing
thought to be laryngoedema. This improved with racemic epi,
atrovent and patient had a negative CXR. He may benefit from
sleep study in the future for sleep apnea.

ID: Patient spiked a fever on POD #3 and BCX NGTD. His UA and
CXR were normal. He had lower extremity ultrasounds which ruled
out a deep venous thrombosis. His right IJ sight was indurated
so line pulled and tip cultured. He was started on Keflex for
skin infection x 7 days.
