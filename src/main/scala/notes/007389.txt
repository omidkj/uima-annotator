diagnosed in [**2105-11-30**], status post exploratory
laparotomy and drainage of ascites on [**2105-12-11**], who presented
to an outside hospital with small bowel obstruction.  On
initial surgery, unable to debulk secondary to extensive

and a KUB which was compatible with small bowel obstruction.
Gastrogram enema revealed two obstructing lesions in the
sigmoid.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

3.  Hiatal hernia.
4.  Hypothyroidism, status post partial thyroidectomy for
multinodular goiter.
5.  Anemia.
6.  Depression.
7.  Ovarian carcinoma as per history of present illness.

4.  Advair 250/50 one puff twice a day.
5.  Dulcolax suppositories PR twice a day p.r.n.
6.  Neupogen 300 mcg subcutaneously.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature of
99.2, blood pressure 112/66, heart rate 109, respiratory rate
20, oxygen saturation 94% on two liters of oxygen.  In
general, the patient is in no acute distress, alert and
oriented times three.  Chest is with decreased breath sounds
and occasional expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular -
tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is
soft, markedly distended, minimal diffuse tenderness to
palpation, tympanitic areas, high pitched bowel sounds.
Extremities are without edema, notable for ecchymosis in the
upper arm and right hip and right knee.  Neurologic
examination is grossly intact throughout.  Nasogastric tube
is draining thick brownish discharge.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 16.0, hematocrit
28.9.  Sodium 129, potassium 3.9, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 0.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the OB/GYN
service, and her bowel obstruction was managed
conservatively.  She was followed by gastroenterology and
surgery services.  A colonoscopy revealed a tight 3.5
centimeter stricture in the midsigmoid colon.  The sharp and
abrupt angulation of the stricture prevented the deployment
of a metal stent.  The patient was managed conservatively and
was started on clear liquids on [**2106-2-16**].  Her hospital
course was complicated by septic right knee joint for which
she was started on Vancomycin.  On [**2106-2-10**], the patient
complained of difficulty breathing and was evaluated for a
pulmonary embolus with a CT angiogram which showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolus.  The patient also had an
episode of mild chest pain with tachypnea on [**2106-2-14**], and
she ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time.  Given
her persistent recurrent episodes of tachypnea and
tachycardia, the patient was started on Advair, for possible
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare worsened by
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Following another episode
of shortness of breath with tachypnea to the mid 30s, the
patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and started on intravenous Solu-Medrol.  She was diuresed
with intravenous Lasix with substantial symptomatic
improvement.  She received CPAP and nebulizers.  She was
finally transferred to the floor where she was continued on
p.o. Lasix.  Her respiratory function improved and the
patient was considered ready for transfer to rehabilitation.
On [**2106-2-23**], the patient received a dose of Carboplatin (725
mg).
