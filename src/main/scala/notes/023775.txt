History of Present Illness:
 is 46 yo F with hx of IVDU, HCV, granulomatous disease of GI
tract, liver, spleen, and bone, hx of cellulitis, osteomyelitis
of spine, and chronic leg ulcers, and anxiety who p/w 2 days of
leg pain, right worse than left, bilateral leg swelling that
feel hot to touch. She was in her usual state of health until 2
days ago when she noticed that her R leg was painful and
swollen, she took 6 Advil for pain relief which did not help.
Measured her fever at home to be 103. Yesterday, she began to
notice swelling and pain in her L leg. No recent trauma in the
area, no open cuts or wounds preceding swelling. She was seen
yesterday at OSH where she was advised to be admitted for
antibiotics, she left AMA because she had a negative experience
during an admission last year. Did not get any antibiotics PO on
discharge. Last night, she used a pin to put a hole in her R leg
in hopes of relieving pressure, noticed minimal clear drainage
from the area. Of note, pt has chronic venous stasis changes
with erythema on R leg. Also has large ulcers in inguinal areas
L>R (6cm ulcer with pus and drainage in L inguinal area, 1cm
ulcer in R), she does dressing changes for these daily at home
using Silvedene. Inguinal ulcers are [**3-1**] heroin injection, pt
reports she has not injected in about 6 months and ulcers have
improved since then. She never injected in her toes, has not
injected in arms in many years due to scarring. Pt says she was
tested for HIV since stopping drugs and has been negative, HCV
infection is "inactive" per her, she was never treated for this.

vancomycin.

[**2146-12-21**] TEE
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There
is a mass in the right ventricle. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to XX cm from the incisors. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

POSR CPB:
1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolci function with inotropic
support
2. Bioprosthetic valve in aortic p[osition. Well seated and good
leaflet excursion (PG =30 mm Hg
3. RV mass in the subvalvular apparatus is still visible
4. No other change


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is 46 yo F with hx of IVDU, HCV, hx of cellulitis and
osteomyelitis who p/w chronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use
b/l and fever, found to have MSSA bacteremia and aortic valve
endocarditis.
.
# MSSA Bacteremia - blood cultures ([**3-3**]) bottles from admission
positive for MSSA. The most likely source is the bilateral
chronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use. Though pt reports not
having used heroin in the past 6 months, ulcers have not healed
despite dressing changes at home. On admission, ulcers appeared
infected and pt was febrile. Pt was started on IV nafcillin for
MSSA, to complete a total 6-week course. Of note, pt has history
of MSSA infections in the past (abscesses, bacteremia, and R
sided endocarditis) for which she completed nafcillin courses.
Pt also had history of thoracic osteomyelitis in [**2144**] treated at
[**Hospital1 2025**], though this was considered as possible source of bacteremia
on this admission, it seems less likely given no clinical
symptoms of back pain and more likely source of ulcers. Pt
refused MRI imaging, but should consider outpatient open MRI if
does not continue to have improvement. All surveillance cultures
since admission have had no growth to date. As described below,
pt was found to have aortic valve vegetation and infective
endocarditis with no abscess seen on TEE.
