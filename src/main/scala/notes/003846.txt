Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 77625**] is a 26 yo female with history of obesity,
childhood asthma, smoker, poorly controlled diabetes. She
initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with cough, fever,
chills, myalgias, N/V/D x2 days with progressive SOB in the
setting of several recent sick contacts. She had also been
non-compliant with her diabetes medications with glucose
elevated to 537 with no gap. On arrival to the ED, vitals were
remarkable for T 103, HR 140, satting 91% on 2 L, WBC elevated
to 16.4. ABG showed hypercarbic respiratory failure and the pt
was intubated. Right subclavian was placed and she was started
on moxifloxacin, albuterol, duonebs and insulin. She was
transfererred to the CHA ICU on [**2179-3-29**].
.
At [**Hospital 8**] hospital, she was treated with tamiflu and started
on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for PNA, which was broadened to
vanc, cefepime, gent on [**4-4**] with persistent fevers. Treatment
was based on her presenting symptoms however CT chest on [**3-31**] did
not show any consolidations, CTA did not show any evidence of
PEs, however per OSH report there was concern for
tracheomalacia. Extubation was attempted on [**4-1**] but failed.
There was also concern for sepsis and she was started on
solumedrol 60 [**Hospital1 **] but did not require pressors. Cxs were
negative with the exception of 1 blood cx growing coag negative
staph. HIV test was ordered and was pending on transfer.
Aspergillis serology was sent due to elevated IGE levels. CT
head was done to eval for sinus infection and was pending. She
was also treated for cdiff with PO vanco given new diarrhea with
abx (cdiff assay pending). She was treated with insulin and
started on tube feeds. CEs were drawn and found to be mildly
elevated with a normal EKG, therefore enzymes were trended and
this was thought to be due to demand ischemia. ECHO showed EF
70%, mild RA enlargement, mild PHTN, mild MR, TR. She was
transferred for further work-up of her respiratory distress and
possible bronchial stenting.

On the floor, pt is intubated and sedated, opens eyes to voice
but is otherwise not responsive.

[**4-6**] CXR: Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 1 cm above the
carina.
Retraction 3 cm is recommended. Lung volumes are low. Pulmonary
vascular
congestion is likely secondary to low lung volumes. Heart size
is within
normal limits given low lung volumes. No focal consolidation,
pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax is seen on this single view.

[**4-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
26 yo female admitted to OSH([**Hospital1 **]->[**Hospital1 8**]->[**Hospital1 **]) for
respiratory distress, intubated and treated with abx with
minimal improvement in sxs, persistent fever, med flighted to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management. She initially was treated in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit ([**Date range (1) 90132**]), and then she was
transferred out to the floor. Her brief hospital course,
organized by problem, was as follows:

# Respiratory failure: History of course prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] somewhat unclear, though per notes/reports on initial
presentation patient c/o cough, sputum production and shortness
of breath, which raises concern for PNA, however this was not
confirmed by imaging. History also suggestive of possible
influenza given reports of fevers and myalgias, though patient
tested negative for flu and completed course of treatment with
oseltamivir. Shecompleted treatment course of vanc/cefepime
([**Date range (1) 90133**]). Other viral illnesses and atypical infections
including PCP and legionella were also considered, however were
not confirmed by testing. HIV test was negative. Patient was
slowly weaned from the vent and was extubated on [**2179-4-8**] without
difficulty. She was also followed by infectious disease. She was
scheduled for pulmonary follow-up at [**Hospital1 18**]. An albuterol inhaler
was prescribed on discharge.

#. Fevers: Patient continued to have persistently high fevers
during her first few days of hospitalization. As with her
respiratory failure discussed above, the etiology of fevers
unclear, and differential included PNA (completed vanc/cefepime
course), C. diff (though stool negative x4), viral infection
(completed ostelmavir course), drug fever, NMS (CK within normal
limits, no new pharmaceuticals).  Patient does
