History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27273**] is a 72F with H/O CABG [**56**] yrs ago, DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, chronic diastolic CHF, asthma/COPD on home O2,
atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin (hx of cerebral aneurysm s/p
clipping) presenting from [**Hospital3 3583**] with 2 day history of
progressive worsening chest tightness and SOB. She has a
baseline chronic productive cough which worsened over the 2 days
prior to presentation; it did not respond to her home nebs and
and she developed SOB at rest. She concurrently had intermittent
2/10 chest pain which was substernal and radiating to her Right
shoulder, associated with diaphoresis. She also noted blood
tinged phlegm 2 days prior to presentation to OSH, but no
fevers, rigors or chills. Of note, the patient has chronic lower
extremity edema with no significant changes from baseline.

At the OSH, her troponin peaked at 16.5, CK of 513. She was
given Lovenox and Plavix at the OSH. Also given vancomycin 1 g,
Zithromax IV 500mg and started on prednisone 40 mg daily for
possible COPD exacerbation. EKG showed a-fib with underlying
LBBB and freq PVCs; no significant changes noted from prior, no
ST-T changes. CXR showed mild bilateral pleural effusion; final
report pending. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization tomorrow, chest pain free and in stable
condition.

[**2146-11-15**] CXR: 1. pulmonary edema. 2. Asymmetric density in the
right upper lobe and right paratracheal region merits further
evaluation on a followup chest radiograph after diuresis to
exclude right upper lobe infection and right paratracheal
adenopathy.

[**2146-11-22**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, a small left pleural effusion,
small retrocardiac atelectasis and evidence of mild
overhydration. The pre-existing right upper lobe and perihilar
parenchymal opacities unchanged in extent.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged
alignment of sternal wires, unchanged position of right-sided
PICC line.

[**2146-11-16**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near-akinesis of the inferior wall and inferior septum and
hypokinesis of the other segments. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH. Severe regional and mild
global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation, probably due
to posterior leaflet tethering. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle.

[**2146-11-21**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated the following: LMCA 100%
proximal occluded and RCA 100% proximally occluded.
2. Saphenous graft angiography demonstrated a Y graft with RCA
limb occluded proximally and the OM limb with a proximal 95%
graft stenosis.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent left
internal mammary artery to the LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed a SBP of 135 mmHg and a DBP 56
mmHg. Right heart cardiac catheterization revealed the following
pressures (mmHg): RA 19, RV [**2107-8-24**], PA 71/32/49 and PCWP 31.
Fick cardiac output was 4.79 L/min and Fick cardiac index was
2.58 L/min/m2.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal 95% stenosis in the OM
limb of the Y graft with a VISION Rx 3.5x18 mm bare-metal stent
(BMS) deployed at 19 atm. Final angiography revealed normal
flow, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual
stenosis in the stent. (see PTCA comments)
5. R 6Fr femoral artery angioseal closure device deployed
without complications.
6. R 8Fr femoral vein sheath sutured into position for removal
post procedure.

R Femoral Vascular U/S [**2146-11-27**]:
There is no evidence of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, or AV
fistula at the site of catheterization. There is no fluid
collection or hematoma.
