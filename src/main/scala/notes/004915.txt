Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Found Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated in the ED on arrival, extubated [**12-8**]

History of Present Illness:
72 year old man with history of marginal zone lymphoma s/p
splenectomy presented to the ICU after being found unresponsive
for up to 1 hour. He was known to have had a recent flu
vaccination and exposure to [**Location (un) **] droppings while doing carpet
work. He had questionable recent history of shingles. On [**11-24**],
his wife reported the patient was in his usual state of health
excluding a  mild cough. He was found down by his wife at home
and she had last seen him one hour beforehand. EMS found the
patient to be tachycardic, but with poor pulses and hypotension.
The patient was cardioverted x3 without much effect. In the ED,
he was still found to be unresponsive with the following vital
signs: T 101.3, HR 144, SBP 72, RR44. He was intubated and
started on 3 pressors. Initial WBC was 3.1 with 12% bands;
eventually the count rose to 13.1 with 44% bands. BUN/CR 23/2.1.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for likely sepsis
but no clear source found (cultures unrevealing). His sputum
grew unspeciated yeast; gram stain showed rare squamous cells,
few polys, few yeast, and no bacteria. Otherwise, urine, sputum,
and CSF cultures were negative for any growth.
.
Initial workup at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital included a negative head CT.
LP at the OSH with traumatic tap had 3 WBCs in tube #4. Gram
stain and CSF cultures were negative for microrganisms and
growth. Coagulation labs were elevated on admission with PT 22.8
and PTT 130.0. Fibrinogen was initially low and then increased.
During course of admission, his coags remained elevated and
platelets progressively dropped (to nadir of 46K). There was
evidence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
.
Prior to transfer to the ICU, the patient was panscanned; head
CT at the OSH showed multiple areas of bilateral
hypoattenuation. A 2nd CT scan from the OSH demonstrated
multiple brain lesions, some located in watershed areas, but no
evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Chest CT had large,
dependent consolidations with air bronchograms and multiple foci
of airspace opacity. This was considered possibly pneumonia
secondary to aspiration versus CHF exacerbation. Over time, he
improved after diuresis and was successfully extubated on [**12-8**].
.
At time of transfer to the ICU, the patient was almost
completely unresponsive to voice/noxious stimuli (no real
sedation from OSH, small amounts on transfer, no sedatives while
in ICU). He had been treated broadly with antibiotics and
antifungals on vancomycin, ceftazadine, azithromycin,
clindamycin, acyclovir, and liposomal ambisome. Pressor support
included neosynephrin and vasopressin and the patient was
intubated on ventilator support. Once in the ICU, vent settings
were adjusted to AC 550 x20, FiO2 60%, PEEP 8. Antibiotics were
changed to vancomycin, levoquin, zosyn, and ambisome per ID
recommendations. Acyclovir was discontinued. The patient was
noted to have stable blood pressure on pressor support.  Vital
signs in the ICU were the following: Tm 102.2 HR 97 BP 100/54 RR
31 96%O2 sat ABG 7.35/35/96 on AC.  Generally, the patient
appeared jaundiced with icterus, had anasarca, and was
nonresponsive to painful stimuli. Petechiae were noted on the
oral mucous membrane. Breath sounds were decreased at the bases.
Cardiac and abdominal exam were unremarkable. Extremities had 3+
pitting edema to the thighs, flaccid muscle tone, and absent
reflexes.  Pupil equal round reactive to light, doll's eyes
showed no movement, he was non responsive to painful stimuli,
and had minimal corneal or gag reflexes. A head MRI was
performed to better evaluate the brain lesions. Neuroradiology
observed basal ganglia and cerebellar lesions consistent with
watershed infarctions and some remaining lesions that were not
located in watershed areas. The questin of septic emboli was
raised since the patient appeared to be septic with hypotension
at presentation.  However, a source for embolism was not found:
TTE/TEE were negative for vegetations, PFO, or suspicious aortic
disease.
.
In the course in the ICU, EEG showed no evidence of seizure
activity. It showed diffuse slowing consistent with
toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. n admission was almost
completely unresponsive to voice/noxious stimuli (no real
sedation from OSH, small amounts on transfer, no sedatives while
here). Neuro exam @ OSH w/ evidence of brainstem findings,
however, here, pt??????s PERRL, conjugate gaze, doll??????s eyes intact,
intact corneal, intact gag reflexes. Over time, he had slow
recovery in mental status. On [**12-9**], he was awake enough to be
extubated with appropriate RISB. Afterwards, he had
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] lethargy. Blood pressure was stable through most
of MICU course. The leading diagnosis was overwhelming sepsis
with hypotension and watershed infarctions. Cultures at OSH and
here were unrevealing, including tests for histoplasmosis,
cryptococcus, and nocardia. Thus, the patient's antibiotic
regimen on admission was limited to vancomycin, levofloxacin,
and zosyn. In the ICU, acyclovir and anti-fungal coverage were
held. Zosyn was later broadened to meropenem and the
levofloxacin was discontinued. The patient eventually
defervesced and was maintained on vancomycin and meropenem up
until time of transfer to the medicine floor. ID consult
recommended a 6 week course with follow up imaging on CT.  Also,
at the time of transfer to the medicine service, the patient was
being evaluated by GI for possible PEG placement out of concern
that the patient may be unable to maintain his own nutritional
intake.  He'd been NPO in the ICU and was getting free water
repletion for hypernatremia secondary to inadequate oral intake
and resulting hypoalbuminemia.  He also had anasarca with
weeping fluid from lesions in the upper extremities due to the
volume overload. He'd had a 20kg wt gain after delivery of large
amounts of IV fluids.  In the ICU, he was given standing lasix
40mg iv qam, 20mg iv qpm and was -11.9L overall.  The patient
also developed acute renal failure likely ATN in setting of
hypoperfusion. However, he was never oliguric. Creatinine
trended down close to baseline while treated in the ICU.
