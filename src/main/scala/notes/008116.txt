Admission Date:  [**2164-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2164-10-6**]



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male with
an extensive cardiac history significant for aortic valve
replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral
vascular disease (status post femoral-popliteal bypass),
required removal of the pacemaker in [**2158**], and type 2
diabetes mellitus who was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] from an outside hospital for
placement of a new pacemaker for intermittent bradycardia
consistent with Mobitz type 2.

The patient was admitted to the outside hospital on [**Month (only) 359**]
The patient also has a history of pancreatitis, and his
amylase and lipase were increased on admission.  The patient
was reported to have made a rapid recovery, and his diet was
advanced on [**9-12**]; and he reportedly tolerated a soft
die [**Doctor First Name **] [**9-13**].  Cardiology was consulted and recommended
further intervention for heart block.

On admission, the patient experienced [**3-30**] to [**6-30**] left chest
pressure.  It was different from his previous anginal and
pancreatic pain.  He denied radiation to the back or
extremities.  There was no improvement with sublingual
nitroglycerin times three.  He was given morphine which
resulted in nausea and vomiting.  A nitroglycerin drip was
started by the nurse [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improvement.
Electrocardiogram remained unchanged without ST changes, Q
waves, or inversions.  His blood pressures in the bilateral
upper extremities were equal.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
A chest x-ray was unchanged from his previous study.  His
amylase and lipase were still noted to be evaluated.
Otherwise, the patient stated that his gastrointestinal
discomfort was improved.  He was tolerating solids and had
regular bowel movements.  He denied shortness of breath,
fevers, and chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Aortic stenosis; status post aortic valve replacement (a
Bjork-Shiley valve) in [**2146**].
 2.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2158**]; pacemaker for syncope in [**2156**] with
endocarditis in [**2158**] with resultant pacemaker removal.
 3.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post right
below-knee amputation; status post left femoral bypass in
[**2161**] with revision; status post left great toe amputation.

 7.  History of partial small-bowel obstruction.
 8.  History of aspiration pneumonia.
 9.  Hiatal hernia.
10.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.

 9.  A regular insulin sliding-scale.
10.  NPH 4 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 1 unit
subcutaneously q.p.m.

ALLERGIES:  An allergy to ZOCOR (which increases his liver
function tests).  DIGOXIN (causes nausea and vomiting).
PEPCID (gives him mental status changes).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is negative for ethanol and
tobacco.  He was a professional ballerina and lives with his
wife who is an astrophysicist.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 99.1, blood pressure
was 176/68, heart rate was 66, oxygen saturation was 98% on
room air.  Blood sugar was 194.  He was alert and oriented
times three, in mild discomfort.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat revealed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  A
right-sided facial droop was noted.  Bilateral bibasilar
crackles on lung examination.  No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
He had a regular rate with intermittent dropped beats.  He
had a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  His abdomen was soft and
diffusely tender.  Extremities were notable for a right
below-knee amputation and left bypass scar.  No edema with
normal perfusion.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit was 35.3,
and platelets were 209. Differential with 58% neutrophils.
Sodium was 142, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 107,
bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine
was 1.2, and blood glucose was 111.  Calcium was 8.8,
magnesium was 1.7, phosphorous was 2.5.  AST was 25, ALT was
14, alkaline phosphatase was 86, total bilirubin was 0.2,
amylase was 203, and lipase was 369.  Creatine kinase was
124.  CK/MB was 3.  Troponin I was less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram with a heart rate in
the 60s, prolonged P-R interval, poor R wave progression.  No
ST changes.

A chest x-ray anterior/posterior film with appropriate
mediastinal shadow compared with previous study.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially treated for rule
out myocardial infarction due to significant coronary artery
history.

Initial cardiac enzymes were negative, and the
electrocardiogram was without acute changes.  He was
continued on his ACE inhibitor, Norvasc, and nitroglycerin
drip for blood pressure control.  He was also continued on
aspirin.  According to an echocardiogram in [**2164-8-21**]
revealed he did have an ejection fraction of greater than
55%, but he was noted to have intermittent bradycardia to the
30s on telemetry while sleeping.  He was planned for a
possible pacemaker placement the following morning.

In light of his recent episode of pancreatitis with still
elevated amylase and lipase, the patient was again made
nothing by mouth due to his abdominal pain.  In addition, he
was started with gentle hydration.

Overnight, the patient continued to have increased abdominal
pain which was similar to his previous pancreatitis.  He also
had nausea and vomiting with greenish/yellowish output.  It
was determined by Electrophysiology not to place a pacemaker
at this time in light of the previous history of endocarditis
that required pacemaker removal.

Since the patient was not going to receive a pacemaker at
this time, and in light of his continued nausea and vomiting
(consistent with pancreatitis), the patient was transferred
from the Cardiology Medicine Service to the general Medicine
[**Doctor Last Name **] Service.

On the Medicine Service, he was continued as nothing by mouth
with intravenous hydration and intravenous Dilaudid as needed
for pain.  Electrophysiology continued to follow the patient
in light of his history of atrioventricular block and likely
pacemaker placement once acute pancreatitis resolved and
Infectious Disease cleared him.  He was managed supportively
for pancreatitis.  To evaluate his risk for pacemaker, they
recommended following routine blood cultures.

An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was offered
to evaluate for stone causing pancreatitis, which the patient
refused.  Thus, he was continued with just supportive
management.

On [**9-14**], his diet was slightly advanced to ice chips
and sips of fluids.  Overnight, he started vomiting and had
increased nausea.

On the morning of [**9-15**], he had increased shortness of
breath and respiratory distress.  His temperature was 99.7
axillary, blood pressure was 233/80, respiratory rate was
approximately 25, heart rate was 90 on electrocardiogram.
Concerning for a possible gastric volvulus or obstruction.
Of note, his bicarbonate was noted to have dropped to 9.
Thus, he was managed with a nasogastric tube with several
hundred cc of bilious fluid out.  He was also given
bicarbonate and transferred to the Unit.

In a discussion on this day, the patient stated that he was
full code.

Planned to get an abdominal computed tomography.  In
addition, he was put on levofloxacin and Flagyl, per
Infectious Disease Service recommendations in this setting.
The patient was fluid resuscitated, received frequent
arterial blood gases and Chemistry-7 panels to assess for
improvement of his acidosis.  An nasogastric
