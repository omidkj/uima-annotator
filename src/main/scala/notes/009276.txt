History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57-year-old female well known to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] for
multiple prior admissions, last [**2182-7-20**], for small bowel
obstruction relating likely to adhesions as well as to her
multiple incisional hernias which appeared to be a swiss cheese
type of hernia. Because of her inability to properly comprehend
and give consent for herself, she had an attorney as a guardian
as well as a son and a caseworker who were involved in her care.
Therefore consent was obtained from her attorney after reviewing

were asked to assist with the open hernia repair anticipating
need for component separation as well as a mesh repair.

Portable Abdomen for assessment of dobbhoff placement:
Single portable AP radiograph demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube
slightly coiled and terminating in the distal stomach. There is
no intraperitoneal free air.

TUNNELED DIALYSIS LINE PLACEMENT:
Successful conversion of existing right internal jugular
hemodialysis line to a right tunneled hemodialysis line. The
catheter length is 23 cm tip to cuff. The tip is in the right
atrium. The line is ready to use.

IMPRESSION: Successful [**Month/Day/Year 950**]-guided transhepatic

[**2183-1-5**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORTIMPRESSION:
1. Findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis; however
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was confounded by pain medication. If
necessary this may be further evaluated with HIDA scan.
2. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder sludge, which is mobile on
real-time
scanning and not impacted within the gallbladder neck.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous thyroid gland, ultrasonic evaluation may be
considered.
2. Pulmonary nodules with the largest being a 6-mm ground-glass
right upper lobe nodule, could represent hypoventilatory changes
or atelectases. However, given ground-glass appearance, a
six-month followup to exclude BAC is recommended.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Bilateral basilar opacities, may reflect atelectasis.
Superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
5. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis and pericholecystic
stranding, cannot exclude acute cholecystitis for which
[**Month/Day/Year 950**] is a better modality.
6. Postsurgical changes from recent hernia repair with
consequent stranding and mild soft tissue edema without
drainable fluid collections or abscesses.
7. Focally dilated loop of small bowel without obstruction. This
could
represent a small bowel diverticulum, may be further evaluated
by small bowel
series.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 99617**] [**Known lastname 805**] was admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] surgical service
on [**2182-12-18**] with a history of  small bowel obstructions likely
secondary to abdominal adhesions and incisional hernia. Because
of her inability to properly comprehend and give consent for
herself, she had an attorney as a guardian as well as a son and
a caseworker who were involved in her care. Therefore consent
was obtained from her attorney after reviewing the procedure
with him in detail. In anticipation of the complexity of the
required operation, plastic surgery was also consulted for
assistance. She was taken to the operating room on [**2182-12-18**] by
both teams. Intraoperative findings significant for adhesions
incarcerating the omentum and adherent bowel to the multiple
hernia defects. Please refer to their individual operative notes
for more detail. There were no technical complications to the
procedures but it was a long operative case. We elected to keep
the patient intubated expecting requirement for additional fluid
in particular.  She was transferred to surgical intensive care
unit post-operatively for further management.

Her complicated and extensive hospital course can be summarized
by the following review of systems:

Neuro: Patient has underlying schizophrenia and mental status
was difficult to assess. While intubated, she was sedated with
propofol and fentanyl, which was then switched to precedex as a
temporizing wean. Her psychiatric medications were restarted as
she was able to tolerate orals.

Cardio: Baseline HTN. Immediately, post-operatively, lopressor
was used and now added to her regimen for more effective
management. Hydralazine was used for additional break through
relief with good effect. She otherwise remained hemodynamically
stable throughout her hospital course.

Pulm: Patient has underlying COPD which made ventilator
management a challenge. CXR were taken daily to monitor for
interval changes. Several days of antibiotics were initiated for
presumed pnuemonia. She was ventilator dep
