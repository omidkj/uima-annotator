History of Present Illness:
76 year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, CAD s/p MI and
PCI ([**4-29**]), and hypertension admitted [**2102-11-15**] to ortho spine
for recurrent lumbar spine epidural abscess and L3-L4 discitis
and ostemyelitis. He is now post-op day 4 for partial
vertebrectomy, fusion, debridement, and vertebral spacer
placement at L3-L4. Previously followed by medical service,
transferred to unit for respitatory distress.
.
Patient initially presented [**6-29**] with coag-negative Staph lumbar
epidural abscess at L3-S1 and bacteremia attributed to prior
epidural infection for chronic LBP. He subsequently underwent
debridement and lumbar laminectomies and was maintained on a
prolonged antibiotic course. TTE at that time was without
evidence of endocarditis. Patient returned for follow-up to
ortho spine clinic [**10-30**] and was found to have recurrent back
pain and difficulty walking. MRI L-spine showed L3-L4 discitis
and osteomyelitis with recurrent paraspinal fluid collection. He
underwent partial vertebrectomy, fusion, debridement, and
vertebral spacer placement at L3-L4 on [**2102-11-17**].
.
Post-op, patient was noted to be hypoxic. In PACU, 100% 3L NC.
On floor, per surgical team, O2 saturation >88% on 6L shovel, 2L
nasal canula. Today improved to 100% on same setting. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN,
patient with hypoxia to 83% on 35% facemask when need
suctioning. Suctioning with scan white sputum, and improves O2
saturation to 96% on facemask FiO2 35%.
.
This AM patient was improved early but spiked to 102
mid-morning, followed by respiratory distress with O2 sats down
to 70's, RR up to 30's, tachycardia. O2 sat to 95 with NRB, EKG
negative. New lower left chest consolidation on exam; CXR
obtained and difficult to interpret given ileus. Transferred to
ICU for presumed PNA and further respiratory support.
.
Post-op course also complicated by altered mental status. By
report, patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. Per
discussion with RN, much improved today, particularly with
decreasing fentanyl patch from 50mcg to 25mcg.

         Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2399**])
immediately if
         sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this
patient's isolate.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

[**11-15**] CXR
The heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour and
width are
unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasal
linear small
opacities consistent with small areas of atelectasis. There is
slight
deviation of the upper trachea towards the left that might be
consistent with
thyroid enlargement, unchanged since the prior study. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax is demonstrated.

11/27 L spin

Three views. Comparison with the previous study done [**2102-10-18**].
Changes
consistent with laminectomy from L3 to S1. Disc space narrowing
and
degenerative arthritic change are again noted. A cage device has
been
inserted in the L3-4 disc space which is widened. L3-4 endplates
are less
distinct and this may be due to post-surgical change. Metal rod
is present to
the left of the spine with screws extending into the L3 and L4
vertebral
bodies. Vertebral body alignment appears to be good.

IMPRESSION: L3-4 fusion as described.

[**11-19**] Abd plain film

FINDINGS:

The entire colon is distended with gas and stool unlikely to
represent
obstruction. There is spinal fixation hardware in the lumbar
spine. NG tube
is seen coiled within the stomach under the diaphragm. The
visualized lung
bases are unremarkable, and the heart size is normal. The pelvis
is not
included in the current study.

IMPRESSION:
NG tube below the diaphragm in the stomach.

[**11-20**] EKG

Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Diffuse non-specific ST-T
wave change.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2102-7-8**] the rate has
increased. The
previously recorded ST-T wave abnormalities persist. The tracing
is marred by
baseline artifact. Repeat recording suggested.


[**2102-11-23**] CXR
There are persistent low lung volumes. ET tube is in the
standard position.
Right central catheter is in the lower SVC. NG tube is in
unchanged position
coiled in the stomach. Small to moderate bilateral pleural
effusions are
unchanged a
