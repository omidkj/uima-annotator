Pertinent Results:
[**2118-4-7**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: Biventricular systolic function now appears normal.
LVEF >55%. There is a well seated, well fucntioning
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is a trace
perivalvular leak. The study is otherwise unchanged compared to
the prebypass period.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**4-6**] for IV Heparin and surgical
work-up after being on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. On [**4-7**]
she was brought to the operating room where she underwent an
aortic valve replacement, Maze procedure and LAA ligation.
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later this day she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. EP was
consulted for a pacemaker interrogation and found it was
functioning normally. On post-op day one she was started on
beta-blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. Later this day she was transferred to the
step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. She worked with physical
therapy for strength and mobility. Coumadin was restarted and
titrated to goal INR for her chronic atrial fibrillation.  She
was discharged home with PT and VNA services on POD 4.
