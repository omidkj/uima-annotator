Imaging:
[**3-27**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified.

[**3-30**] CXR: There is new bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and
effusions with volume loss in the left lower lobe as well. There
is hazy bilateral vasculature with vascular redistribution. It
is unclear how much of this process due to CHF or if there is an
underlying infectious infiltrate. Dual-lead pacemaker is
unchanged. Right subclavian line tip is in the superior vena
cava.
IMPRESSION: New bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Sepsis - Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was administered
approximately 5L IV fluid for hypotension.  Pt required levophed
support for 24 hours and was subsequently weaned off pressors.
Cortisol stimulation test was normal.  CXR was without
infiltrate; UCx grew Enterococcus and [**4-28**] blood cultures grew
coag negative Staph with same sensitivity profile as coag neg
Staph from PICC tip.  Pt was initially treated broadly with
Zosyn and Vanco; once sensitivities returned from blood cultures
and PICC tip, antibiotics were reduced to Vancomycin alone, to
continue for 14 days total (last dose [**2167-4-11**]). Patient remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile on the floor.
.
2. Congestive heart failure - Patient was fluid overloaded on
exam after aggressive resuscitation in the setting of sepsis.
Pt autodiuresed well and lung exam improved through hospital
course. Patient was weaned off supplemental oxygen on the floor,
and continued to oxgenate well on room air.
.
3. s/p bowel resection with ostomy, short-gut syndrome - PICC
line had initially been placed for nutritional optimization
prior to reversal of ostomy planned for later this month at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Ileostomy had high-ouput drainage; in discussion with patient's
PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**], numerous medical interventions had been tried
without success. Patient was continued on Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **], and
Lansoprazole added to regimen for GERD-type symptoms with good
effect. Once access was obtained (R IJ tunneled cath), TPN was
cycled, first over 24 hours, now 12 hours overnight.
.
4. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG - Given high output from
ileostomy, patient was not on ACE or BB as she was prone to
dehydration and BPs ran asymptomatically low at baseline. Pt was
continued on aspirin.  Patient with statin allergy -
rhabdomyloysis on prior administration. Patient without coronary
issues on this admission.
.
5. Depression - continued on outpatient Amitriptyline 15
.
6. Access - A right subclavian was placed while in ICU which was
subsequently dc'd after hemodynamically stable. PICC was removed
shortly after admission as it was the etiology of sepsis. After
surveillance cultures were negative x72 hours, PICC replacement
was attempted but unsuccessful due to subclavian stenosis on
right, and left was not engaged due to presence of pacemaker.
Cardiology was curbsided and they recommended against PICC
placement on left. Patient then received double-lumen tunneled R
IJ via Interventional Radiology on [**2167-4-6**].
.
7. PPX
Patient with history of Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, NO
heparin products were administered. Patient was given
Fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis.
