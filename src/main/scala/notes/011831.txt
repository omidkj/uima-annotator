leg swelling

History of Present Illness:
.
History was obtained via interpreter and medical reports.
.
HPI: This is a 69yo [**Location 7972**] male with a history of ITP on
prednisone 80mg, HTN who presents with left leg swelling and
shortness of breath. The patient reports that over the past 1
week he has had worsening left leg pain and swelling.  He stated
it was associated with some mild shortness of breath,
palpitations and fatigue.  He denied any chest pain, hemoptysis
or trauma to his leg.  He presented to his PCP office today and
VS were significant for O2 saturation of 94% on room air, heart
rate 108 and blood pressure 100/74.  He was also noted to have
some swelling of his left leg.  Mr. [**Known lastname 55897**] was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, 98.7 109 102/70 16 99%RA.  He underwent LENI that
showed extensive DVT of the left lower extremity that involved
the femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins.  He then
underwent CTA of his chest that revealed b/l pulmonary embolus
including right and left pulmonary arteries and middle & infeior
branches.  There was also some concern for bowing of the
intraventricular septum that could indicate right heart strain.
The patient CE negative x1. He was started on a heparin gtt
(weight based) with a 5400U bolus and 1200U/hr infusion. He was
guaiac negative.  The patient's glucose was also noted to be 515
and was given 6U humalog and FS improved to 227. VS upon
transfer from the ED to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] were 98.1 98 107/82 16 100% RA.
He was sent to the ICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring given
concern for right heart strain on CT-scan.
.
In the ICU he denied SOB, pain or other complaints.
.
Of note, the patient was seen in the ED on [**12-24**] and found to
have platelets of 17K and started on 80mg prednisone daily per
Hem/Onc.  He was supposed to follow-up, but did not show for his
follow-up appointment.  His platelets in the ED were 165.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

.
LENI:
Extensive DVT in left lower extremity involving femoral,
superficial femoral
and popliteal with small amount of residual flow in those veins.
calf veins
not visualized and may be occluded.
.
CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the right interlobar
artery and
branches to the right middle and lower lobes as well as the left
pulmonary
artery with branches to the lingula and lower lobe.
2. Right ventricle larger than left ventricle (RV:LV >1),
suggestive of right heart strain.
3. Ascending aorta measuring up to 4 cm, mildly dilated.
.
Cardiac Echo Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal global RV systolic function. Indeterminate
pulmonary pressures. Limited study.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been interval development
of
peripheral ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe. Given
the known
left lower lobe pulmonary embolus, these likely represent
pulmonary infarcts.
No pulmonary nodules seen. No pleural effusion seen. No
pericardial effusion
seen.

There is a linear hypoenhancing structure seen superiorly within
the right
lobe of the liver. This is closely related to the middle hepatic
vein which
is attenuated, particularly apparent on the coronal reformats.
The left
hepatic vein is also not seen however. The appearances are
concerning for
thrombus within a hepatic vein, it is not clear whether this is
within the
middle hepatic or left hepatic vein. Ultrasound or multiphasic
CT could
clarify the vascular anatomy. No definite extension into the IVC
is seen
although this is poorly opacified. No other focal liver lesions
are seen. No
biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder is distended but
otherwise
unremarkable in appearance. The portal vein is patent. There is
a 1 cm
hypoenhancing lesion seen in the lower pole of the right kidney.
While this
most likely represents simple cyst, the measured Hounsfield
units are higher
than one would expect. This could be further characterized on
ultrasound.
There are two small cortical lesions in the left kidney, both of
which are
hypoenhancing but too small to characterize. These may also be
visible on
ultrasound. The spleen is unremarkable in appearance. The
pancreas is
somewhat atrophic but otherwise unremarkable, no pancreatic duct
dilatation
seen. Both adrenal glands are unremarkable in appearance. No
enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen. No free
fluid. The small
and large bowel is normal in caliber.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, rectum
and prostate
are unremarkable in appearance. No free fluid seen. No pelvic
lymphadenopathy. There are prominent veins seen in the left
gluteal region
with thrombus expanding the left common femoral vein and
visualized
superficial femoral vein. The prominent gluteal vessels are
likely
collaterals draining the lower limb.

BONY STRUCTURES: There is a mixed lucent and sclerotic lesion
seen in the
right ilium with adjacent sclerosis inferiorly. This is a
medullary-based
lesion without evidence of cortical involvement and is of
uncertain
significance. No other bony lesi
