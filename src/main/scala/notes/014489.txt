CXR ([**2140-7-20**])
FINDINGS: The heart is top normal in size and the mediastinal
contours are unremarkable. There is atelectasis at the left lung
base. There is no evidence of CHF or pneumonia. There is no
pneumothorax. A healed right humeral neck fracture is noted. The
bones are demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Left base atelectasis. No failure or pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory failure: Patient was transferred to ICU for NIMV
for hypoxia and hypercapnea for presumable COPD exacerbation.
Patient was given Solu-medrol and nebulizer which showed
improvement.  BIPAP was weaned off, however, patient became
intermittently somnolent on nasal cannula and had to be put back
on BIPAP.  Patient continued to have day time somnolence with
desaturations on nasal canula requiring BIPAP.  There was a
question of obstructive sleep pnea vs restrictive/obstructive
lung dz scondarty to kyphosis. Patient's oxygen saturation was
generally maintatined >90% but <95% since pt has COPD and needs
hypoxic respiratory drive.  Solu-medrol was taper to prednisone
po and patient will be discharged with prednisone taper.
Doxycycline was initially started for possible infectious cause
as a trigger.  Since CXR was unlikely for pneumonia, doxycycline
was discontinued in 2 days.  Patient did well with nasal canula
the last 36 hrs but there is a possibility that patient may
become somnolent and hypoxic again.  This was discussed with her
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who agrees that patient will no be put back on
BIPAP if she were to get hypoxic at the rehab.  Patient may
benefit from sleep studies to evluate for obstructive sleep
apnea.

2) UTI: Patient came in with UTI, finished [**7-20**] day course of
macrobid.  Repeat urine culture was negative.

3) Schizophrenia: Patient with history of catatonic
schizophrenia.  Patient remained on Zyprexa, Ativan, Depakote
throughout admission.  Per PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 7027**], [**Name9 (PRE) 7130**] was
changed to 5 mg qAM and 2.5 mg qPM.

4) Hypothyroid:  TSH normal.  Patient was on levothyroxine.
