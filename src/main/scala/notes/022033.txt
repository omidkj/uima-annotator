Chief Complaint:
Prostate Cancer, scheduled robotic assisted lap prostatectomy
EKG changes post-operatively

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ROBOTIC ASSISTED LAPAROSCOPIC PROSTATECTOMY
Cardiac Catherization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old mandarin-speaking male with a past
medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and T2a [**Doctor Last Name **]
8 prostate cancer s/p robotic prostatectomy under general
anesthesia by Urology on [**2177-1-20**].  There was only 10cc blood
loss during the procedure. Post-operatively in the PACU, he was
noted to be hypotensive to SBP 78-90.  He also has an increasing
oxygen requirement, with SaO2 92% on 5L NC. His RN noted
ST-segment changes on telemetry and ECG was performed. He was
found to have new STE in aVR and V1 with STD V2-6, I, and aVL.
At the time, he denied chest, back, arm, or jaw pain, shortness
of breath, nausea, diaphoresis. He only notes pain in his
pelvis, likely related to his surgery. He is Mandarin speaking
only and his daughter is at his bedside assisting with
translation. Patient was started on phenylephrine in PACU and
his pressures recovered and the EKG changes resolved. He
received a full dose aspirin.  During this whole episode,
patient states that he has not had any chest pain or difficulty
breathing despite being on 12L face mask and with saturations in
the low 90s.
.
His daughter, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Known lastname **], is a cardiologist and notes that
her father had a good functional capacity prior to surgery,
including exercising daily on a treadmill at fast pace. He was
asymptomatic with exertion. He has no history of coronary artery
disease and is a lifelong non-smoker.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], vital signs BP 109/50 HR 88 O2 90% on
4LNC.  He denied chest pain or any other discomfort.

Imaging:
CXR [**1-20**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:
Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal vasculature is normal, and
there is no appreciable pleural effusion. Extensive and severe
perihilar pulmonary
consolidation and ground-glass opacification more peripherally.
The stomach is moderately distended with air as is the upper
esophagus. There is no pneumothorax.

TTE [**1-21**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal hypokinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Focused emergency
study.

Cardiac Cath [**1-21**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had
diffuse
proximal 80% stenosis involving the origin of a large D2, also
with
diffuse 70-80% disease.  The LCx had serial 60-70% stenosese in
OM1.
The RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
2.  Limited resting hemodyamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic arterial pressures.

Carotid US series [**1-22**]:
Impression: Right ICA no stenosis.
Left ICA no stenosis.
