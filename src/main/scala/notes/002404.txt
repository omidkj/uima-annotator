[**5-6**] angio with coiling PCOMM / amgioseal


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old female on 81 mg Aspirin daily with
known right PCOM aneurysm 7 mm as seen on MRI in [**Month (only) 956**] of
this
year was transferred from [**Hospital6 **] following a 5
minute episode of "triple vision" , blurred vision.  She
describes this as when she looked at the receptionist at [**Hospital6 **] she saw three heads stacked upon each other
instead of one.  The patient was about to be discharge from [**Last Name (un) 1724**]
with a left sprain wrist.  After she experienced the triple
vision a head ct was performed which was found to be negative.
Given the patient's known right PCOM aneurysm , she was
transferred here for further evaluation and treatment by this
Neurosurgery service.

The patient originally had the MRI in [**Month (only) 956**] due to an episode
of slurred, non sensical speech.  She states that she was at an
appointment and her words became garbled.  She notified her PCP
who ordered an MRI. The patient was to see Neurology to discuss
the MRI findings later this week on Tuesday.

Currently, the patient has no neurological complaints.  She
denies diplopia, speech difficulty, weakness other than at the
location of her sprained left wrist.  The patient denies
weakness, numbness, tingling sensation.  She denies bowel or
bladder dysfunction or hearing deficit.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-5-5**] NCHCT at [**Hospital6 **]
Impression:
1.  No evidence of acute large vessel territorial infarct or
     intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Nonspecific periventricular and subcortical white matter
     hypoattenuation, likely the sequelae of microangiopathic
     disease.

MRI Brain  [**2165-3-25**]:Impression:
1.  Right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring
7 mm,directed posteriorly and slightly laterally.2.  Fetal
origin
of the right posterior communicating artery withnonvisualization
of the right P1 segment.3.  Stenosis of the proximal right
internal carotid artery of approximately 55%.4.  Mild
nonspecific
periventricular and subcortical white matter disease, likely the
sequela of small vessel ischemic change in a patient this age.
