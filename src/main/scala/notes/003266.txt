HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year old gentleman
who has a recent significant history for excision of
malignant melanoma in [**2133-3-19**], with bilateral groin lymph
node dissection with positive groin lymph nodes, had been
recovering well until one week prior to admission when he
developed increasing shortness of breath and decreased
exercise tolerance, positive orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, and left sided chest discomfort with exertion.  The
patient presented to outside radiation technologist to
receive radiation therapy to his groin, where upon discovery
of symptoms, the patient was referred to the Emergency
Department for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

Hypercholesterolemia.

History of malignant melanoma as previously described.

Status post ventral hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glucophage 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
2. Glipizide 1.25 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. once daily.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5. Verapamil XR 240 mg p.o. once daily.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he was noted to have
congestive heart failure by chest x-ray, was started on
Heparin drip, Lasix for diuresis and he subsequently
improved.  The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization
on [**2133-5-27**], which showed pulmonary artery pressure of 59/32
with a wedge of 32, 100 percent mid right coronary artery
lesion, 100 percent mid left anterior descending coronary
artery lesion, 90 percent first diagonal lesion, 100 percent
obtuse marginal lesion.  During the cardiac catheterization,
the patient developed worsening pulmonary edema and
subsequent respiratory failure and required emergent
intubation for this.  The patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and the
patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**]
emergently for a coronary artery bypass graft and a mitral
valve repair.  The patient's ejection fraction had previously
been determined on echocardiogram to be 25 percent with three
plus mitral regurgitation.

In the operating room upon performing sternotomy, it was
noted the patient had a fair number of darkly colored nodules
as well as a dark rubbery spot on the heart.  These tissues
were sent to the pathology department with the subsequent
frozen section coming back positive for melanoma.  In the
operating room, the patient [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a coronary artery
bypass graft times two, saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, as well as a mitral valve repair.  Postoperatively,
the patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition with an intra-aortic balloon pump which had
been placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory on a
Milrinone infusion, Levophed infusion, Epinephrine infusion.
Please see operative note for full details.

The patient remained intubated on his first postoperative
night with good hemodynamics.  The Milrinone was weaned down.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day
number one.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day number two.  On
postoperative day number two after the patient developed
atrial fibrillation, the patient was started on Amiodarone
and Lopressor after the pressors and inotropes had been
weaned off.  The pulmonary artery catheter was removed as the
patient continued to have good hemodynamics in spite of the
atrial fibrillation.  Chest tubes were removed without
incident.  On postoperative day number three, the patient
began working with physical therapy.  On postoperative day
number four, the patient was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.  By that time,
he had converted into sinus rhythm.  He had no further atrial
fibrillation.  The patient's pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day number five.

At that time, he was noted to have a moderate amount of
serosanguinous drainage from his sternal incision.  The
patient was started on Keflex.  The amount of drainage
decreased over the next several days and had completely
disappeared by postoperative day number seven.  By
postoperative day number six, the patient had completed a
level V with physical therapy and was able to ambulate 500
feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty and at
that time had been cleared for discharge to home by physical
therapy; however, due to the patient's drainage from his
sternal incision, the patient remained in the hospital until
postoperative day number eight at which time he was cleared
from a cardiac surgery standpoint.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 98.8, pulse 93,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 123/79, respiratory rate 16,
oxygen saturation in room air 94 percent.  Laboratory date
showed white blood cell count 12.9, hematocrit 31.4, platelet
count 337,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 26, blood urea nitrogen 27, creatinine 1.0.  The
patient's weight on [**2133-6-4**], is 126 kilograms.  The patient
weighed 120 kilograms preoperatively.  Neurologically, the
patient is awake, alert and oriented times three.
Examination is nonfocal.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm
without rub or murmur.  Respiratory - breath sounds are
decreased at bilateral bases.  Gastrointestinal - The abdomen
is obese, positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
Sternal incision is clean and dry.  There is a small amount,
less than one half centimeter, of erythema at the distal
portion of the incision.  The sternum is stable.  Bilateral
lower extremities have two to three plus pitting edema.  The
left lower extremity vein harvest site has a small amount of
serous drainage, no erythema and no pain on palpation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day times ten days.
2. Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times ten days.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4. Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
5. Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6. Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
7. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
8. Keflex 500 mg p.o. once daily times seven days.
9. Glucophage 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
10.      Glipizide 1.25 mg p.o. once daily.


DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home in
stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease.

Status post emergent coronary artery bypass graft and mitral
valve repair.

Malignant melanoma.

Postoperative sternal drainage.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**]
on [**2133-7-1**], at 1:15 p.m. and the patient has an appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6530**], his oncologist, on [**2133-7-8**], at 9:15 a.m.  The
