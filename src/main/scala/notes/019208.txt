Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure, transferred for IP evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Tracheostomy Placement
2. PEG Tube Insertion
3. Bronchoscopy
4. VATS and Chest Tube Placement

History of Present Illness:
59 y/o M w/hx of type 2 DM, HTN, who originally presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2177-7-23**] with acute onset of R sided pleuritic
chest pain. Per report, he had SOB due to the pain which was not
different from his baseline shortness of breath. Denied cough,
fevers, chills, abd pain, nausea, vomiting. He did have diarrhea
for 24 hrs PTA. On admit to [**Hospital1 **], his bp was 106/69, p 106, R
24, 94% on 2L, afebrile at 98.3. Labs significant for WBC 29.9
w/34% bands, creat 1.8. CXR demonstrated R wedge shaped
infiltrate. He was treated vanco, zosyn, and levaquin. Also was
covered with solumedrol. He was intubated on [**7-24**] for hypoxic
respiratory failure. He initally required levophed but quickly
was weaned off. He then developed afib with RVR requiring a dilt
gtt. He converted back to sinus and has been maintained on po
dilt. On [**7-25**], he had a bronchoscopy revealing an obstructing
grapelike tumor in the RUL in the anterior and posterior
segments. His sputum cx (endotracheal) grew group A strep. His
fevers persisted on antibiotics, and because of his persistent R
pleural effusion, he had a chest tube placed by IR on [**7-26**] which
revealed over a liter of purulent material. Pathology of his
tumor (from brushings during bronch) revealed poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. He was transferred here
on [**7-29**] for further evaluation by IP of possible endobronchial
tumor debulking. Prior to transfer, he received 4 mg TPA via
chest tube for adhesions, and put out at least 500 ml extra ml
of pleural fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure:
Patient was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to
post-obstructive pneumonia with loculated empyema formation.
Patient had VATS procedure performed by thoracic surgery, which
demonstrated a loculated empyema and broncho-pleural fistula
formation. Three chest tubes were placed to drain pleural fluid.
Patient was started on penicillin initially to cover Group A
strep sputum culture which grew at the outside hospital but was
then transitioned to vancomycin due to bacteremia with
coagulase-negative staph. Patient's multiple sputum, pleural
fluid, and pleural tissue cultures did not grow any bacteria.
Due to continued ventilation requirements and a likely prolonged
course of assisted ventilation, patient had tracheostomy placed
per interventional pulmonology.
.
2. Obstructing endobronchial lesion:
Patient was initially admitted for stent placement and possible
debulking of tumor mass to improve ventilation and oxygenation
in right lung. At outside hospital, pathology demonstrated the
mass consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma. Patient had bronchoscopy performed by interventional
pulmonology which demonstrated continued mass obstruction. Due
to patient's acute illness and respiratory failure here, patient
did not have further oncology work-up. Please follow-up with
patient's outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19512**] and thoracic
surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
3. Fever
Throughout patient's admission, he continued to spike low-grade
fevers, most consistent with his draining empyema. Patient did
develop coag negative staph bacteremia and was being treated
with vancomycin, starting on [**2177-8-8**].
.
4. COPD:
Patient admitted with a diagnosis of COPD, although no PFTs were
available. Patient was maintained with albuterol and atrovent
nebs.
.
5. Afib:
Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm during his
hospitalization but has been on metoprolol for rate control
.
6. Type 2 DM/Glucose control:
At home, patient is maintained with insulin 50 NPH, 10 regular
in AM, and 10 regular insulin at PM. While in the hospital,
patient has been maintained with 35 NPH at breakfast and dinner
and 6 of regular with breakfast, and 6 of regular with dinner
with sliding scale.
.
7. Nutrition:
Patient currently on tube feeds with novasource pulmonary at
60cc/hour, which is his goal.
On TF (novasource pulmonary) at 60 cc/hr at goal.
.
8. Prophylaxis:
Patient has been maintained with venodynes and protonix.
