Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year-old lady with DM2, Afib on Coumadin,
HTN, HL, CKD(baseline Cr 2.8-3.5) anemia (baseline HCT 25) and
prior lower gastrointestinal bleeds who presented from home with
weakness and was found to be profoundly anemic in the ED, with
HCT of 13.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for active GIB.
She was given 7 units PRBC and HCT stabilized in the 30's.  She
was subsequently transferred to the floor.  Her HCT was stable
in the 30's over the weekend while she waited for
EGD/Colonoscopy.  EGD/Colonoscopy revealed active oozing of
blood from AVMs in the colon.  HCT remained stable for 24 hours
after the procedure and the patient was discharged home with
services.

PROBLEM LIST:
1. LOWER GI BLEED [**3-17**] bleeding AVMs in colon: Ms. [**Known lastname **]
presented with weakness, maroon stools and HCT 13, which was
concerning for GI Bleed. Given her prior colonoscopy reports,
she has known polyps and diverticuli. The most likely source of
her LGIB was diverticular bleed and also on the differential are
arteriovenous malformations. Per report from GI fellow and ED
resident, she had guiac positive maroon stools with fresh clot
on presentation. She required a total of 7unts of PRBC over 48
hours given tachycardia and continued maroon stools.  Her
tachycardia resolved and her hct stabalized out.  In the ICU she
continued to have some bloody bowel movements but was otherwise
stabe and so transferred to the medical floor.  Endoscopies were
performed and found bleeding AVMs.  It is recommended that the
patient undergo capsule enteroscopy to evaluate for AVMs in the
small intestine.  Anticoagulation for Afib will be deferred to
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that the patient stay off of anticoagulation for
at least several weeks to allow areas of bleed to heal.

2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ON COUMADIN/EKG CHANGES: Pt's INR  was
1.8 on admission and she received Vit K 10mg IV x 1 and 2u FFP.
Her INR was 1.3 on 2nd hospital day and coumadin was held. Her
baseline ECG had some ST depressions which were more pronounced
in the setting of tachycardia and GI bleed.  Her cardiac enzymes
were negative and a repeat ECG did not show any dynamic changes.
 The patient had episodes of RVR that were controlled with her
home dose of propranolol.  Anticoagulation has been discontinued
because of the recent severity of GIB.  Pt to discuss with PCP
regarding safety of restarting anticoagulation.

3. [**Name (NI) **] Pt was normoglycemic on admission labs. Humalog
dose was decreased while in-house.  Blood sugars were not too
elevated on reduced dosing, so patient discharged on reduced
dose.  PCP to increase dose as needed for optimal control.

4. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Baseline creatinine
appears to be ~3.0. Was 5.1 on admission labs. Perfusion-related
renal injury given significant anemia seems most likely. Pt's
creatinine was closely monitored and improved with volume
resuscitation. The Cr reached a nadir of 2.3.

5. HYPERTENSION: pt has hx hypertension but was hypotensive
(relative to her baseline) in the ICU, likely in the setting of
volume depletion from blood loss. BP was closely monitored and
improved with volume resuscitation. Home anti-hypertensive
regimen including diovan, nifedipine, furosemide and hydralazine
was held in ICU.  Pt was restarted on hydralazine, propranolol,
and half dose of valsartan by the end of hospitalization.
Nifedipine and Furosemide were held during the entire
hospitalization and may be restarted by PCP as indicated.
