History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mrs. [**Known lastname 81814**] is an 84 yo F with PMH dementia,
diverticulosis, CAD, [**Hospital **] transferred from the medical floor for
persistant BRBPR.  She was initially admitted this morning from
[**Hospital 4199**] hospital for BRBPR with HCT on arrival of 27.9 from 29
at the OSH.  Over the course of the day she has had about 6
episodes of BRBPR and clots, estimated at about 1L of blood
loss.  She was transfused 3 units PRBC prior to transfer and IR
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she arranged to have a tagged RBC scan, as per
GI recommendations.  After speaking with her niece who is her
HCP, she does not have any prior significant history of GI
bleeding, although she was admitted over the past year for
dehydration and anemia, the source of the anemia was never
determined.  She has had a colonoscopy within the past year
which according to her niece showed diverticulosis, but was
otherwise unremarkable.  She takes prilosec for GERD but has
never had stomach ulcers.
.
Of note, prior to transfer she developed bilateral periorbital
edema and irritation which started about 7 hours after her
transfusions were first started.  She was given benadryl 12.5mg
IV x1.  According to nursing she was rubbing her eyes and had
stool/blood on her hands which they felt may have contributed to
the local irritation.  Her periorbital edema improved following
benadryl even with continued blood transfusion.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
16.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2100-10-30**]);
HISTORY:GI BLEEDING AND BRIGHT BLOOD FROM THE RECTUM.

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. A left
lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.  Blood flow images
show normal flow of blood in the aorta and external iliac and
femoral arteries. Dynamic blood pool images show active
extravasation from the expected location of the sigmoid colon.
Due to patient body habitus, the upper thighs have been included
and part of the upper abdomen has not [**Doctor First Name **] included. The bleeding
was first noticed at 12 minutes.
IMPRESSION: Findings are compatible with moderately active
bleeding from
expected location of sigmoid colon.

Brief Hospital Course:
84F with history of atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension
(HTN), and dementia who presents with a gastrointestinal bleed
(GIB) secondary to diverticulosis.

# GIB - The patient's Hct fell from 28 at the time of admission
to 22 on the following morning, and she was transferred to the
MICU for further management.  Her GIB was thought to be
secondary to diverticulosis, and a tagged RBC was performed and
confirmed bleeding from the sigmoid colon.  An angiography was
subsequently performed to embolize the bleeding vessels but the
patient was no longer actively bleeding at the time of this
study, and no embolization was done.  She received six units of
PRBC in the MICU and her Hct improved to 36.  It remained stable
for the five days she remained in the hospital after her last
transfusion.  She continued to have scant bleeding per rectum,
however.  This was discussed with the GI consult service, and
they recommended a colonoscopy on an inpatient or outpatient
basis, but were not concerned about acute bleeding because of
her stable hematocrit.  She will follow-up with GI after
discharge (an appointment has been made).  Her aspirin was also
discontinued but the patient and her niece were instructed that
the re-initiation of aspirin could be discussed in the future
with the patient's primary care doctor.  If the patient has any
further episodes of GIB at rehab, please check her hematocrit
and call her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 42142**], to share
the results.

# UTI - The patient had a foley catheter inserted in her bladder
when she arrived in the MICU.  and her urine was noted to be
immediately opaque.  A urinalysis showed many bacteria and she
was started on ceftriaxone for a presumed UTI.  Her urine
eventually grew E. coli that was sensitive to ceftriaxone and
cipro.  She received a total of three days of antibiotics for an
uncomplicated UTI, as her infection was already active before
the insertion of the foley.

# Right basillic vein thrombus:  The patient developed a
thrombus of the right basillic vein as a result of peripheral IV
access.  A right arm ultrasound was performed that confirmed
this finding.  There was no involvement of the deep veins,
however, a
