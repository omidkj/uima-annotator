HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma who is on two liters
of home oxygen, not on chronic steroids, spontaneous right
pneumothorax, status post suction with video-assisted
thoracic surgery, and talc pleurodesis who now presents with
a history of two to three days of increasing shortness of
breath, chest tightness, and a cough productive of yellow
sputum.

The patient denied any chest pain, fever, or cough; but the
patient did report upper respiratory tract symptoms beginning
two days prior to admission.  Her baseline exercise tolerance
is half to one block.  She has a chronic with white sputum
with oxygen saturations of 96% on room air with 90% on
ambulation.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
evaluated at 180/70.  Her heart rate was elevated at 130.
Respiratory rate was 20.  Her oxygen saturation was 94% on
room air.  Initially, she was given albuterol nebulizers but
became increasing dyspneic with a respiratory rate to 30.
Arterial blood gas was 7.03, PCO2 was 105, PO2 was 198, and
the patient was intubated for airway protection.  A chest
x-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs, bilateral apical bola, no
infiltrate.  She was given Levaquin 500 mg intravenously,
Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously, with one and a half liters
of IVF in the Emergency Department and transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1 of 32%
of predicted; on two liters of oxygen at home.  Baseline PCO2
of 50s to 60s.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Status post spontaneous pneumothorax in [**2190-1-29**]
with resection and right pleurodesis via video-assisted
thoracic surgery.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Bilateral total hip replacement.
7.  Herpes zoster virus in [**2189-3-1**].
8.  Multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
admissions; no prior intubations.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Flovent 110 mcg 3 puffs inhaled b.i.d.
2.  Atrovent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.
3.  Serevent 2 puffs inhaled b.i.d.
4.  Vitamin D 400 units p.o. q.d.
5.  Tums.
6.  Albuterol as needed.
7.  Levoxyl.
8.  Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 98.7, blood pressure was 101/66, and
heart rate was 84.  Respiratory revealed pressure control
ventilation was 26/10, respiratory rate was 12, 40% FIO2,
tidal volumes in the high 600s, oxygen saturation was 98% to
97%.  Most recent arterial blood gas on that setting was
7.17/61/67.  In general, the patient was awake, responded to
commands.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes
with decreased breath sounds at the bases.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed distant first heart sound and second
heart sound.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Decreased bowel sounds.
No masses.  Extremity examination revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  No rashes.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count
of 3.5, hematocrit was 30.9, and platelets were 130.  INR was
1.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 136, potassium was 4.4,
chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was
23, creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 207.  Calcium
was 7.4, magnesium was 2.2, and phosphorous was 2.1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed
hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragm.  Bilateral
pleural thickening versus pleural effusion, congestive heart
failure, a sixth rib fracture.  No pneumonia.  No congestive
heart failure.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140, normal
axis and normal intervals.  T wave flattening in lead I and
aVL.  1-mm ST depressions in leads V5 and V6.  Left atrial
hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her hospital course was notable for the
development of metabolic acidosis which the Renal Service
attributed to ethanol-induced nontubular acidosis.  She was
given bicarbonate times one day and then self-corrected.  She
was given intravenous steroids and nebulizers, and she was
extubated on [**2190-12-3**] but had to be reintubated 20
minutes later because of fatigue.  She was felt to have
ventilator associated pneumonia and was started on
ceftazidime for a question of left lower lobe infiltrate on
[**2190-12-3**]; although, all chest x-rays had been
negative.

On [**2190-12-6**], she was extubated and did well.  She was
weaned off systemic steroids.  Evaluation revealed evidence
of granulation tissue; probably secondary to gastroesophageal
reflux disease prompting continuation of Protonix.  A bedside
evaluation revealed evidence of aspiration.  She also
received Valium for ethanol withdrawal and tachycardia.  She
had no complaints, and review of systems was only positive
for a sore throat and weakness.

She called out to the floor on [**2190-12-7**].  She was
restarted on intravenous steroids, calcium, and vitamin D.  A
video swallow was performed which revealed aspiration of both
thin and nectar-thick liquid.  She was seen again by
Otorhinolaryngology who did a flexible bronchoscopy which
revealed slight edema of the vocal cords, normal mobility,
less than 3-mm granuloma of the right vocal process,
completely normal post intubation.  It was felt to continue
to watch, continue proton pump inhibitor, and repeat the
video in one to two weeks.

Her systemic steroids continued to be weaned.  She was
continued on nebulizers and meter-dosed inhalers.
Cefpodoxime was continued for a 10-day course.  A pureed diet
was continued.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was encouraged to quit
smoking.  The patient was discharged to home with services on
[**2190-12-11**].  The patient was to follow up with
Ear/Nose/Throat in two weeks.
