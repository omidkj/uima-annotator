Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old man with HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent PE on
coumadin, who was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on
[**2148-5-3**] for sepsis secondary to pneumonia (thought to be
community-acquired vs aspiration).  His antihypertensives were
initially held, though they were restarted in the setting of his
NSTEMI.  He was put on empiric ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
metronidazole to cover both community-acquired and aspiration
bacterial pathogens and has symptomatically improved.  A speech
and swallow evaluation was concerning for esophageal dysphagia;
since this was known to be old by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], further
evaluation was deferred for now; he was kept on a diet of ground
solids and thin liquids.  Prior to discharge, his antibiotic
regimen was simplified to levofloxacin and metronidazole to
complete a 10-day course.
.
On admission, he was also found to have an NSTEMI with CKs
peaking at [**2160**] in the setting of marked anterior ST depressions
which subsequently improved; he was not heparinized due to his
supratherapeutic INR, and he was loaded with clopidogrel.  A TTE
showed a marked drop in his LVEF to 25% (from 71% on nuclear
stress in [**10/2146**]) presumed secondary to ischemia.  In the
setting of this NSTEMI and also due to clinical volume overload,
he was diuresed with a series of Lasix boluses.  The MICU team
chose to start him on Plavix to help maximize his medical
management.  A cardiology consultation was obtained; they
recommended adding an ACEi to help maximize his medical
management.  They also reviewed his cardiac cath report from
[**1-/2148**] and recommended that he have a P-MIBI due to this new,
large drop in his LVEF.  Per cardiology, even if he had a large
reversible defect on his MIBI, his [**1-/2148**] cath report showed few
(if any) options for potential further revascularization.  In
light of this, both the patient and his PCP chose to defer the
MIBI at this time and maximize his medical management.
.
He was on home warfarin given his recent diagnosis of pulmonary
embolism.  On admission, however, he was noted to have a
markedly elevated INR which was presumed to be due to his
concurrent antibiotic use.  His INR subsequently rose >9 and he
was given 2 units of FFP while in the MICU.  His warfarin was
initially held but, as his INR came down, he was restarted on a
reduced dose (1mg) of warfarin.  On the day prior to discharge,
his INR dropped to 1.8, which is below therapeutic level; he was
bridged with treatment-dose enoxaparin on that day and his INR
was 2.0 by the next day.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be in acute-on-chronic renal failure
upon admission.  Following aggressive hydration in the ED,
however, his creatinine quickly returned to baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a severe pneumonia as
well as a heart attack.  Your pneumonia has improved with
antibiotics, and we will send you home to complete a course of
these antibiotics.  For your heart attack, you and your PCP have
decided to maximize your medical management rather than pursue a
stress test a
