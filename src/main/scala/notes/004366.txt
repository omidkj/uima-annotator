Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent desmoid tumor of the left chest wall.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radical resection of recurrent left desmoid tumor with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex
chest wall and flank reconstruction with concurrent omental flap
and primary
closure with the assistance of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of plastic
surgery.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59199**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with a previous
enucleated desmoid tumor that was referred to me 2-1/2 years ago
at which time I performed a wide excision of this and a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex
chest wall reconstruction. He has been followed radiographically
and was found to have 2 enlarging soft tissue masses, one at the
superior aspect of the excision below the latissimus muscle
involving the 6th rib and one inferiorly growing lateral to the
[**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex patch into the subcutaneous fat and dermis. After
preoperative consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], we planned a
radical excision of this. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] placed tissue expanders up
behind the scapula and over the buttock to recruit additional
soft tissue for closure as there would be a substantial amount
of skin resected. The patient agreed to proceed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2103-10-22**]. Post-operatively, the pt had an
intrathoracic chest tube and [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain on the left side, as
well as three [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains placed by plastic surgery. The pt had
an uncomplicated hospital course as was discharged home with VNA
services on POD#7. The pt was extubated overnight in the SICU on
the evening of POD#0. Pain was well controlled with an epidural
catheter. On POD#2 the pt was transferred out of the SICU to a
regular floor bed on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2. The chest tube was removed on POD#2
and the intrathoracic [**Doctor Last Name 406**] was left to bulb suction.
[**Last Name (un) 1372**]-gastric tube was removed on POD#3. On POD#4 Epidural and
Foley catheter were removed and diet was advanced as tolerated
to a regular diet and antibiotics were switched from Kefzol IV
to Keflex PO for prophylaxis while drains remain in place. On
POD#5 the chest [**Doctor Last Name 406**] was removed, the three JP drains placed by
plastics remained to bulb suction. On POD#6 pt was ambulating,
tolerating a regular diet, and pain was well controlled with
oral pain medication. There was still a significant amount of
drainage from the wound site and over the remainder of the
hospital course the patient was closely monitored for signs of
wound dehiscence, infection and breakdown. One of the 3 JP
drains was removed on POD#12. The pt was discharged home on
POD#12 with 2 JP drains to bulb suction with VNA services to
empty drains and check wounds daily. Upon discharge the wound
was clean, dry and intact with no signs of infection. Pt will
follow-up with Plastic Surgery in one week and with Thoracic
Surgery in one week as well.
