wt loss. She had shortness of breath on exertion after walking
about 40 feet. denies orthopnea. Denies PND. patient had
dependent edema at baseline, which she says has been worsenign
over the past 2-3 months. She also c/o fatigue, decreased
appetite.

have elevated creatinine, likely chronic renal failure from htn.

not take medication for it. She did not follow up the chronic
kidney disease.

Patient has never had colonoscopy or mammogram. Does not see
doctor regularly.

[**2131-7-21**] Renal U/S
RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 8.6 cm.  The left
kidney measures 7.2 cm.  There is increased echogenicity of the
renal sinuses and thinning of the cortex bilaterally.  There are
no stones or hydronephrosis.  A 1.4 x 1.1 cm cyst is seen within
the lower pole of the right kidney.  A partially full bladder is
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Atrophic kidneys bilaterally consistent with chronic
medical-renal disease. No stones or hydronephrosis.
.
[**2131-7-21**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast
CT CHEST FINDINGS:  Some subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes
are noted that are not pathological by size criteria.  The main
pulmonary artery is prominent at 3.2 cm with a maximum diameter
of the right pulmonary artery measuring 2.8 cm.  There is some
vascular calcification noted.  There is volume loss in the left
hemithorax.  There is a left pleural effusion which extends
circumferentially around the lateral side of the chest wall.
There is a slightly thickened rim of parietal pleura just
adjacent to the chest wall in relation to this pleural effusion.
 There is associated atelectasis; superimposed consolidation
cannot be excluded. There are calcified pleural plaques noted
suggesting a history of asbestos exposure.
CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS:  Given that this is a non-contrast CT, the
liver and
spleen are normal.  The gallbladder is normal.  There is
calcification of the splenic vasculature.  The adrenals are
normal.  The kidneys are reduced in size.  Some areas of low
attenuation are seen in the right kidney which may be consistent
with cysts.  Some tiny scattered punctate areas of high
attenuation are seen in relation to the kidneys bilaterally
which represent calculi that are nonobstructing.
The pancreas is normal.  No significant retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.  The bowel where visualized is normal.
CT PELVIS FINDINGS:  Note is made of diverticulosis without
evidence of
diverticulitis especially in the sigmoid colon.  The bladder is
normal.  The uterus is unremarkable.
Bony windows reveal some degenerative changes at the L5-S1
level.
Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in depicting the
anatomy and
identifying the pathology.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Volume loss in left hemithorax with moderate-sized left
pleural effusion and associated collapse and atelectasis but no
definite mass identified. No evidence of high attenuation in
pleural fluid to suggest recent hemorrhage.
2.  Calcified pleural plaques suggesting asbestos exposure.
Thickening of the parietal pleura surrounding the left pleural
effusion.
3.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4.  Prominent pulmonary artery which may suggest pulmonary
hypertension.
5.  Renal cysts and nonobstructing calculi.
.
[**2131-7-23**] Echocardiogram
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional  left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased  left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber  size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary  artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity  size and regional/global systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitatio.
.
[**7-24**] Venous duplex
IMPRESSION:  Right cephalic and basilic veins are patent.  The
left basilic vein is patent and the left cephalic vein is
clotted at the level of the forearm.
.
[**2131-7-31**]  Chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent left loculated pneumothorax with air leaking
along the chest wall into the subcutaneous tissue.
Bronchopleural fistula cannot be excluded. Overall slight
decrease in the amount of the right pleural effusion.
2.  Right pleural effusion, slightly increase in size,
accompanied by left
lower lobe atelectasis.
3.  New multiple bilateral, right more than left consolidations,
which may
represent aspiration and/or pneumonia.
4.  Improvement of aeration of the left upper lobe compared to
the most recent chest radiograph.
.
[**2131-8-9**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with known
loculated
hydropneumothorax on the left.
