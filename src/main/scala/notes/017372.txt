[**Hospital1 18**] ED with DKA. Throughout the day, she was not answering her
home phone and family came to her house to find her lying in
bed, obtunded, with FSG "critically high." EMS was called and
she was brought the the ED where she was found to be
hypothermic, hypotensive with SBP in 70s, with critically high

DKA. In the MICU patient was found to be severly acidemic with a
pH of 6.8. In the ICU patient was given aggresive IVF and put on
insulin drip until anion gap acidosis corrected. Patient was
also hypotensive and hypothermic in the MICU and started on
empiric treatment with levo/flagyl/vanco for possible sepsis,
cultures were sent. Patient anion gap acidosis eventually
corrected and she weaned off the insulin drip and started on SC
insulin. Patiented was extubated on [**2126-4-11**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are notable
for a consolidation in the left lower lobe. The right lower lobe
has atelectasis. Bilateral tiny pleural effusions are seen. No
pericardial effusion is noted.

Within the abdomen, there is a large amount of ascites, new
since the last examination. The entire GI tract is edematous,
with enhancing walls. No evidence of perforation is seen.
Several foci of air bubbles within the lumen of the GI tract are
nondependent, probably reflecting air within lumina, not
intramural air. The gallbladder wall is markedly edematous. The
liver shows marked edema of the portal triads. The kidneys,
adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen are otherwise unremarkable. A
nasogastric tube is seen coiling in the stomach.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: As noted above, there is a
large amount of ascites, with several loops of fluid-filled
edematous bowel, both small and large, floating within it. Bowel
also notable for hyperemia, as noted throughout the GI tract. No
definite free air is seen within the pelvis. Air is noted within
the lumina of several loops of b
