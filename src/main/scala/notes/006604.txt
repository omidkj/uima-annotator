Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-16**] admitted, AAA open repair( ABI ) , acute myocardial
infract,s/p cardiac cath PCI of LAD.LMT moderate disease,LAD 95%
proximally,Lcx. moderate diffuse disease, rca totallly occluded
, collatralized Left to right. Epi dural d/c' RE intubated for
hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the basal inferolateral segment and mild hypokinesis
of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with multi-vessel coronary artery
disease.

Based on [**2126**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-12-16**],
wall motion abnormalities are better appreciated on the current
study (as above). There is now a wire/catheter in the RA/RV.

[**12-24**] Patient in septic shock requiring vassopressor support.

drainage.Bronchoscopy with theareupedic aspiration.ID consulted;
legonella c/s negative.

[**1-18**] off vent, Trach mask, PMV placed. transfered to VICU
[**1-19**] aphasia and dysphagia very pronounced with increasing
mental confusionn. WBC 20. c/s urine negative no temp.
[**1-20**] Antibiotics discontinued
[**1-22**] planned spine stabllization cancelled secondary to
leukocytosis.
[**1-23**] Neuro consulted for persistant confusion. MRI of head
pending.MRI could not be done because patient needed to be
vnetelated and sedated.WBC monitered
[**2039-1-23**] continued to moniter WBC 12.5 Cervical stablization by
neuro done.
