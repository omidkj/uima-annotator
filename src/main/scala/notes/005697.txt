Brief Hospital Course:
58yo F admitted to Blue Surgery service after undergoing R
colectomy [**2115-2-26**]; please see operative report for details. She
was hemodynamically stable and transferred from the PACU to the
floor with a Foley catheter, NGT and PCA. On the first
post-operative evening, she was noted to be hypoxic with
decreased responsiveness and depressed respiratory rate. On
review of her medications, it was determined that she had
received an excess of narcotic pain medication, perhaps from a
family member pressing the PCA, and received a dose of narcan
with appropriate response. A blood gas at the time demonstrated
significant respiratory acidosis and she was transferred to the
ICU for closer monitoring. She did not require intubation. She
received serial ABGs which showed improvement, and she was
clinically improved upon transfer to the floor on POD 2. The NGT
was removed, she was begun on a liquid diet on POD 3. The foley
catheter was removed and she voided. On POD 4 she passed flatus
and tolerated a soft-solid diet. The dressing remained clean,
dry and intact. She was discharged home in satisfactory
condition.
