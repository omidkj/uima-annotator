Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, confusion, nausea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with LAD stent

History of Present Illness:
59 year old w/ hx of IDDM (followed by [**Last Name (un) **]), presented w/ [**2-2**]
days hx of nausea/vomiting, "feeling like a cold/flu" (per
husband), chronic L shoulder pain, increasing lethargy,
confusion. Husband called EMS day of admission for increasing
lethargy. EMS arrived to find FS 700s.  She was transported to
[**Hospital1 1474**] ED. She was noted to be lethargic and obtunded w/
glucose in 700s, + ketones, glucose, prot in her urine, with VBG
6.88/21/98, and started on insulin gtt at 10 units/hr.  She was
responding to noxious stimuli, tachypneic with P 99 BP 82/50
O2sat: 97% on 2L NC.  She was given NS bolus X 2, then NS at
500cc/hr, total of 2.2L at OSH.  She was also given 10 units
regular insulin, 1 amp NaHCO3, insulin gtt.  CXR was negative
for PNA, EKG was concerning for STEMI on her anterior leads. She
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival, she was lethargic, responsive to noxious stimuli.
Her RR was 30s, O2 sats in mid 90s on 4l-5L, BP 80s/50. EKG
confirmed STE changes over V2-V4, cardiology was consulted. CXR
was w/o pna. glucose was >700, u/a + ketones, WBC was 20K,
lactate 6.3. CK and troponin was also elevated.  Code sepsis was
called. R subclavian was attempted w/o success. CXR was w/o PTX.
R groin fem line was placed in ED. She was given total 12L NS, 1
uPRBC, levophed gtt was started. Vanco/levo/flagyl/CTX was
given. Pt was intubated for airway protection in ED.

Imaging:
CATH REPORT [**2122-4-15**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the LAD.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.
Specifically
the left main demonstrated no significant disease. The LCX also
demonstrated no angiographic evidence of any flow limiting
lesions. The LAD had a hazy mid vessel lesion (60%) with TIMI
III flow distal. The RCA was a large dominant vessel without any
significant disease.
2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated a low central pressure
(97/53 mm
Hg).
3. LV ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful stenting of the LAD with a 3.0 mm Cypher
drug-eluting
stent.

[**2122-4-13**] CXR portable
IMPRESSION: Left subclavian CVL with tip in distal SVC, no
pneumothorax. CHF
with interval increase in pleural effusions bilaterally.
.
[**2122-4-12**]: CXR portable
Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal
tube with its tip at the clavicular heads. A nasogastric tube is
present with its tip coiled in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is within normal limits. Prominent pulmonary
vasculature and increased bibasilar pulmonary opacities
represent mild CHF. There are small-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
[**2122-4-11**]: CT head
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is
identified.
.
[**2122-4-11**]: CT TORSO
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, there is extensive
ascites and fluid within the mesentery. These findings, along
with septal thickening within the lung parenchyma, may reflect
third spacing of fluid and fluid overload.
2. There are bilateral patchy opacities within the lungs,
predominantly at the lung bases, which may represent aspiration
or multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2122-4-11**] CXR Portable
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. No pneumonia.
.
[**2122-4-14**] ECHO EF 40-50%.
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection
fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior
septum and apex. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of
the right ventricle. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course: The patient was admitted to the MICU in critical
condition. An arterial line was placed for close hemodynamic
monitoring and to follow arterial blood gases. An insulin gtt
was started at 10U/hr. The potassium, magnesium, phosphorus and
calcium levels were monitored closely and repleted. The pH
slowly improved, the anion gap slowly closed over the course of
the first hospital night. The patient was ventilated on AC and
the FiO2 was weaned down, and the tidal volumes were decreased
for lung-protective ventilation. EKG showed ST elevations in the
anterior leads, with elevations of the CK and troponin, and
Cardiology was consulted. The etiology of the ischemia was
thought to be [**3-5**] the severe acidosis from the DKA, and medical
management was optimized with ASA, beta-blocker; a heparin gtt
was held [**3-5**] concern about the patient's episode of UGIB.
.
Renal was consulted on arrival to the MICU; there was no need
for emergent dialysis as the patient was making urine (at least
30cc/hr in the first day) and the acidosis was improving with
IVF and bicarb and insulin. GI was consulted on arrival to the
MICU [**3-5**] dark red blood in the OGT; NS lavage was performed and
it cleared with 150 cc NS. The patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] dosing
of a PPI for presumed stress gastritis
