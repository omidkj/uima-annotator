Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endovascular aneurysm repair with bilateral groin cutdowns
[**2166-10-14**]


History of Present Illness:
70 year old male presented with abdominal pain. The pain started
the afternoon of [**10-14**] afternoon he laid down.  Pt reported
dizziness when he stood up.  He had similar abdominal pain
approximately 4 days prior, and at that time, he had a CT scan
without IV contrast that demonstrated a non-leaking 4 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The patient was then sent to the
[**Location 1268**] VA for admission and further evaluation.  He
reports he was discharged 2 days ago from the VA with a negative
work-up for his abdominal pain.  He had been pain free the day
prior to admission but he also had nothing to eat until this
afternoon.  He denied fever, chills.  No nausea or vomiting. No
diarrhea.

Blacked out at home and went to Caritas HC where a CT without
contrast showed leaking aneurysm and creatinine up to 5.8 from
baseline 1.8. He was hydrated and [**Last Name (un) **] Flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] to have
emergent EVAR of AAA by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2166-10-14**] transferred from an OSH for ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  An urgent CAT scan with IV contrast
performed at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated a contained, leaking abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  Due to prohibitive surgical risk, the pt
underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair with bilateral groin
cutdowns on emergent basis on [**2166-10-14**].  BP during the procedure
was initially 90-100s over 40-50s (one value to 80/40) then
110/80s. Postoperatively, the pt was transferred to the CVICU
intubated on pressors. He required fluid boluses and prbc as
well as albumin. BP stabilized.  He was extubated.

Due to increase in creatinine from baseline of 1.8 to 5.0,
nephrology was consulted on [**2166-10-15**]. ARF on CRF felt [**2-8**] to
hypotension and poor perfusion. HD was not indicated. Avoidance
of all nephrotoxins was advised as well as keeping MAP >65.

On [**2166-10-16**], surgeon [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was consulted for concern for
ischemic bowel as the patient had an episode of watery diarrhea.
 A flex sig was performed at the
bedside which revealed no evidence of either mucosal slough or
transmural ischemia. The colon was entirely normal up to 45 cm.
No further episodes of diarrhea occured following the
sigmoidoscopy. On [**10-19**],he was kept NPO, an NGT was placed for
vomiting and a KUB was done to eval for free air.

Urine was positive for pan sensitive enterobacter cloacae. Cipro
was started.

CT abdomen on [**10-21**] demonstrated findings consistent with ileus.
Status post aortobifemoral graft with no interval change in the
size of extensive right retroperitoneal hematoma.
Cholelithiasis was noted. Of note, there were gas locules noted
in the aneurysmal sac and in the retroperitoneal region likely
post-surgical in nature. Although, there was concern for
possible fistula. Hepatobiliary was reconsulted on [**10-22**].


On [**10-22**], hepatobiliary surgery was reconsulted for concerns for
obstruction as he had abdominal pain and distention since
[**2166-10-16**] without BM. The NGT output was 1L to 1.5L of gastric
contents on a daily basis for the past 72 hours. After review of
the MRI and CT scans from the VA, the pancreatic mass was felt
to likely be either a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma or
potential renal cell carcinoma metastasis.  Because the mass was
obstructing the distal common bile duct, the patient underwent
ERCP and stent placement.  Brushings obtained during the ERCP
were negative for malignancy, and biopsy obtained during a
subsequent EUS of the mass was an insufficient sample and thus a
proper diagnosis could not be made.

GI was consulted on [**10-22**] for possible EGD. This was not felt to
be indicated and recommendations to assess the pancreatic stent
were recommended given elevated t.bili and alk phos (6.5 and
272). On [**10-23**],

He was started on vanco, zosyn and flagyl for possible small
perforation.
Of note, patient's other current major issue is progressive
renal
dysfunction.

***NO SUMMARY FROM [**10-22**] - [**11-18**].

On [**11-18**], the patient was noted by nephrology to have altered
mental status concerning for uremia, and so he received a
tunnelled hemodialysis cathether.

On [**11-19**] he was started on hemodialysis but became hypotensive
to 40s and so dialysis was stopped early.

On [**11-20**] AMS, hypoxic, transferred to SICU, intubated, became
tachy/brady then asystolic, pulse returned w/ CPR found to have
massive MI by echo put on pressors and taken to cath lab. Pt had
stent placed in left main coronary and required IABP support,
which was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] given recent AAA repair. Pt required 4
pressors and transient CPR. IABP was removed shortly due to
distal skin mottling thought to be due to emboli from his aorta.
He continued to deteriorate with pH on ABG of <7, and Potassium
at 6.7. Pt's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and decision was made to be
DNR/DNR, and soon after CMO. Pt's medications were all stopped,
including pressors and morphine drip started for comfort. Pt
passed away within 30 minutes from cardiopulmonary arrest. Pt
was warm, with no heart sounds or breath sounds. Negative gag
reflex, neg corneal reflex and neg oculocephalic reflex. Pt's
family was notified and appropriate death certificate and
autopsy paperwork was filed.
