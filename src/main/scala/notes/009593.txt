Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**]
Chief Complaint:
73 year-old man with a history of proximal basilar artery
stenosis on coumadin, previous strokes, HTN, DM, CAD s/p [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH with left-sided weakness, dysarthria and
right-sided intracranial bleed.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG
Tracheostomy
arterial line
Endotracheal intubation x2


History of Present Illness:
Per EMS records, at ~4:15 this AM, wife awoke to find pt
slightly confused, weak on left side, unable to ambulate and
incontinent of urine and called 911. Pt was well last night when

he went to sleep. EMS found pt in bed, alert and oriented,
speaking full sentences, but with dysarthria, left facial droop
and arm/leg weakness, and complaining of headache. Blood
pressure
was 180/100, pulse 82.

At OSH, blood pressure remained elevated. Initial labs showed
glucose of 230, INR 3.4, WBC 11.4, otherwise normal including
negative cardiac enzymes. Head CT revealed a right mostly medial

temporal bleed with extension into lateral ventricle. Pt given
10 mg vitamin K, 1 mg morphine and transferred here. On arrival,

SBP 200/103 and pt was started on labetalol drip and given
proplex (clotting factors 2, 7, 9 and 10).

ROS: Still c/o mild headache. Denies chest pain, trouble
breathing

Head CT (OSH): Right medial temporal bleed with some basal
ganglia involvement with extension into lateral ventricles. No
subarachnoid blood seen.

EEG([**1-18**])
(PLEDs) seen over the right hemisphere. These discharges suggest
cortical dysfunction involving the right hemisphere and
represent an increased risk for seizure activity. No clear
seizure activity was seen during this recording.

MRI:
1. A punctate area of restricted diffusion involving the
posterior left frontal lobe, suggestive of a tiny area of acute
infarction.
2. High signal surrounding the right basal ganglia hemorrhage
seen in the diffusion images, is more likely due to artifact
from T2 shine-through.
3. No change in the size of the right basal ganglia hemorrhage
in its intra- ventricular extent.
4. Blood products seen most likely within the left sylvian
fissure indicate it is bordering sulci. When reviewing a prior
CT, this is most likely due to subarachnoid blood in these
locations.

ECHO:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global
biventricular hypokinesis (?related to tachycardia). Mild mitral

regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CT Chest (with contrast) [**1-29**]:
1) No evidence of pneumonia. Bibasilar atelectasis with small
bilateral pleural effusions.
2) Findings consistent with resolving CHF.
3) Cholelithiasis.

Duplex Left UE:
Long segment of occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
vein.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt initially admitted to the neuro ICU for management of right
temporal and basal ganglia hemorrhage.  He was transferred to
the Step Down unit on [**2-1**].

Neuro: His INR was reversed and he was admitted to the ICU for
neurologic and BP monitoring.  He became more somnolent, had
decreased movement on the left side and had episodes of extensor
posturing [**1-18**].  EEG was done and showed PLEDS. He was started
on dilantin. Dilantin was later changed to depakote b/c of
suspected drug fever from dilantin. Repeat head CT showed stable
appearance of bleed.  MRI showed several areas of hypointensity
on susceptibility sequences suggesting possiblity of
microbleeds/amyloid. Subsequent CTs have shown stable appearance
of bleed.  After transfer to the floor, his neuro exam remained
stable. He is awake, follows simple commands, moves his right
side spontaneously and is able to move his left toes and
slightly pull left leg proximally.

RESP: Pt developed aspiration PNA early in hospital course.  On
[**1-19**], pt had increasing respiratory distress requiring
intubation. He failed extubation on [**1-29**] and required
re-intubation and subsequent tracheostomy ([**2137-1-31**]).  Chest CT
done [**1-29**] showed no evidence of infiltrate, resolving CHF,
bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  Since transfer to
the floor, he has had difficulty managing trach secretions and
required frequent suctioning.  Rpt CXR have been without change.
 Secretions improved, suctioning frequency improved as well to q
2-3 hours.

CV: BP initially controlled with labetalol drip-then switched to
dilt. On [**1-19**], pt had new onset Afib.  Cardiology was consulted
and recommended initial rate control with dilt drip and beta
blocker. TEE was negative for clot. He was started on amiodarone
for rhythm control since we are unable to anticoagulate him at
this time.  After transfer to floor, ACEI was added to his
regimen for BP control.  He is currently taking lisinopril,
metoprolol, diltiazem for BP control. Amiodarone for Afib-has
been in and out of afib (rate well controlled). He will need
followup with cardiology to determine duration of amiodarone
therapy.

** restart coumadin on [**2-17**] at 2.5mg qHS with goal INR 2-2.5
for afib. **

HEME: Pt was on Coumadin on admission for tx of basilar artery
stenosis.  His INR on admission was 3.4. Given prop
