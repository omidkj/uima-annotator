History of Present Illness:
66 year old [**Location 7972**] man with systolic CHF, ESRD on
dialysis, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic ulcer
disease, h/p CVA who presented with respiratory distress. The
patient was due for HD on Tuesday, the day of admission, but
became increasingly short of breath throughout the evening,
especially in the last two hours prior to calling EMS. When EMS
arrived, the patient was wheezing, diaphoretic, using accesory
muscles. Of note, the patient endorsed eating Chinese food the
evening prior but did go to hemodialysis and had been compliant
with all his medications. The patient was recently hospitalized
on the Medicine Service ([**2161-9-18**]) for dyspnea thought to be due
to fluid overload. On that admission he had increased his PO
fluid intake in the setting of the heat and lost his advair
inhaler. A proBNP was [**Numeric Identifier 8189**] in the ED on last admission.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.3 P 115 BP 215/102 R
22 O2 sat 100% on ?. His history was very limited by respiratory
distress and on physical exam, lungs very tight with diffuse
wheezing. The patient received duonebs, steroids. He failed
trial of bipap and received rocuronium and was intubated,
sedated with propofol. His labs were notable for lactate 2.1,
leukocytosis to 19.4 with no bands, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 8269**]. Troponin 0.07 in
the setting of Cr 9.7. Urinalysis negative. UTox negative. CXR
showed congestion suggestive of CHF exacerbation but could not
rule out opacities. The patient was felt to have been in
respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload with a component
of COPD flare, requiring urgent dialysis. He acutely developed
wide complex tachycardia, was found to have a blown right pupil
(unclear baseline exam) and EKG concerning for STEMI. The
patient [**Numeric Identifier 1834**] CT head for the blown right pupil which showed
no intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Cardiology was consulted and Code STEMI was called. The patient
was admitted to the CCU from the Cath Lab. ECHO showed EF
30-35%. In the CCU, Neurology was consulted who reviewed the CT
head and felt he had not had an acute stroke. His dilated right
pupil resolved and was felt due to albuterol exposure of the
right eye. Right femoral line was placed when it was noticed
that the patient had blueness and mottling of his foot; [**Numeric Identifier **]
Surgery was called who recommended STAT removal of sheath and
heparinization, with which the leg turned pink. Heparin gtt was
continued for LV thrombus concerns. He was dialyzed with 400cc
fluid removal, with vast improvement in pulmonary status
(negative 1.4L length of stay) and the patient was extubated. He
started complaining of abdominal pain (RUQ) the morning of
[**9-22**] and given maalox/simethicone.
.
The patient was called out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 where he continued to have
abdominal pain which improved with bowel movements, LFTs normal.
This morning, [**9-24**], the patient developed severe abdominal
pain with radiation to the back. MICU was called to evaluate the
patient. There was concern for peritoneal signs and he [**Month (only) 1834**]
CTA which showed pancreatitis. Lipase also 208. In this setting,
he was transferred to MICU for pain control and volume
resuscitation with need for close monitoring as he is anuric at
baseline with EF 30-35% and could require intubation/CVVH for
pancreatitis management.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD  (Last Spirometery [**2-24**] FEV1 41% of predicted c/w GOLD
severe to Very Severe COPD depending on Symptoms, DLCO mildly
Reduced in '[**54**])
2. ESRD (on HD since [**2160-10-1**])
3. hypertension
4. hypercholesterolemia
5. peptic ulcer disease
6. colocutaneous fistula status post low anterior resection,
colostomy, and a loop ileo-ostomy [**2154**]

endartectomy [**2160-4-3**]
9. h/o left frontoparietal stroke
10. systolic CHF (LVEF 45-50% on [**2161-8-12**])

Social History:
He lives with his daughter, he is retired from instructing at a
driving school. He has a significant smoking history, but quit
in [**2160-3-17**]. He endorses drinking varying amounts of
whiskey and beer daily but denies drug use.  Per further
questioning of his daughter, patient reportedly drinks up to a
bottle of whiskey a night.

Family History:
Brother is on dialysis as a complication of type 2 DM. Mother
also had diabetes.

Currently: narrow but widening QRS', PR normal, Leftward axis,
sinus rate of 99, ST depressions horizontal I, II, III, aVF, ?q
V2, Concave ST-elevations v1-v3, TWI with horizontal ST

- ECHO:

The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with septal, inferior and apical akinesis. Views
suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion; estimated
left ventricular ejection fraction ?20-25%. Cannot exclude left
ventricular apical thrombus. Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve is
not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. N
