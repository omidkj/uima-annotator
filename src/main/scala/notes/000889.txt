CTA CHEST: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic
dissection.
2. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities in both lungs, most pronounced
in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe, compatible with a
small airways
infectious or inflammatory process.
3. Partial collapse of the right middle lobe.
4. Paramediastinal fibrotic changes secondary to radiation, with
neighboring
traction bronchiectasis.

TTE [**2163-6-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basl to mid septal
hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2155-12-16**], regional LV systolic dysfunciotn is
new.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory Failure - Mrs. [**Known lastname 108231**] was admitted to the ICU
due to hypoxia and tachypnea on presentation to the ED.  PE was
ruled out by CTA, which also showed RLL pneumonia with tree [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities throughout lungs.  In ED, she acutely worsened in
setting of tachycardia, thought likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema.  She was given diuretics, placed on BiPap with
some improvement, however ultimately required intubation for
hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was admitted to the ICU.  She
was treated for her pneumonia.  She was intermittantly
hypotensive, requireing pressors.  She was extubated after 24
hours with steady improvement in her oxygen requirement over the
course of her admission.  Blood pressure was closely monitored
to avoid repeat flash pulmonary edema.  On dishcarge, she was
breathing comfortably on room air.

# Pneumonia- Atypical distribution on CT with a RLL
consolidation.  She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  ID was
consulted.  While intubated, bronchoscopy was performed which
showed thick secretions, but no other pathology.  Cultures were
taken and all were negative to date at time of discharge.  Per
ID, antibiotic regimen was changed to Ceftriaxone given no
positive cultures.  She was treated with Ceft
