1. CV:
A) Pump: The patient presented with a history of CHF/CMP and hx,
sx and exam consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, JVD, mild
crackles, non-pitting edema). On admission, she was started on
milrinone and her lasix was increased as her BP tolerated.  She
did not diurese well on this regimen and was transferred to the
CCU on [**2166-3-27**] where a a Swan Ganz catheter was placed for
tailored CHF therapy.
In the CCU, she was continued on milrinone gtt and a nipride gtt
was titirated up to achieve a CI of >2.2 and a decreased SVR and
PAP.  On this therapy she achieved good diuresis with average 24
hours fluid balance negative 1-2L. After the initial success
with diuresis, the patient was started on valsartan and imdur in
an attempt to wean off drips and convert to oral medication.
With steadily increasing doses of valsartan and imdur, she did
wean off the nipride and the milrinone but developed an episode
of sustained hypotension and decreased urine output when the
milrinone was stopped. From this it was presumed that the
patient required the additional inotropic support of the
milrinone, and after re-starting milrinone her CO and CI
increased sufficiently to maintain MAP >60.  On HD#10 ([**2166-4-2**]),
the patient was on a stable dose of aldactone 25mg once daily
(decreased from 50mg po daily as an outpatient), bisoprolol 5mg
once daily, milrinone 0.385mcg/kg/min gtt and was loaded on
digoxin. Her isordil, nipride, valsartan, and lasix were
discontinued.  Once on a stable heart failure regimen, the
patient was transferred out of the CCU and sent to the step down
unit.  There her ins and outs were not well recorded and
secondary to a foley that was re-inserted on the floor, she
developed a UTI/pyelonephritis confirmed by CT scan which
required re-admission to the CCU for further management.  On her
second admission to the CCU, her heart failure regimen was again
altered due to her inability to tolerate milrinone secondary to
development of persistent HA.  She was empirically taken off
milrinone with subsequent decompensation and was then started on
low dose dopamine instead.  She tolerated the dopamine well with
good urine output and maintenance of pressures.  She was able to
regain forward flow and returned to compensated heart failure.
At this point her regimen consisted of Dopamine 2.5mcg/kg/min,
bisoprolol 5mg once daily, and digoxin 0.125mg once daily.  She
was taken off the aldactone for persistent hyponatremia.

Initially the plan was to discharge her on home dopamine, but
without right heart catheterization, approval was not granted
for home dopamine infusion.  The patient refused another right
heart cath.  Upon the patient's insistence, dopamine was
discontinued.  She maintained her blood pressures and remained
in compensated CHF during the following day.

She also decided to pursue cardiac transplantation prior to
discharge.  The PFT's, carotid studies and panel of serologies
were sent prior to discharge.

B) Coronaries: The patient has had CABG in past but appears most
of her initial CAD was secondary to complications of the cath
from atypical chest pain. The patient is on baby aspirin, and
b-b (bisoprolol), and diuretics. Statins were held temporarily
given her elevated LFTs on admission (which was most likely due
to RHF).  This will need to be revisited by her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 6
weeks of discharge for possible re-initiation of statin therapy.

C). Rhythm: The patient was admitted in afib which was thought
to contribute to her decompensated heart failure (with loss of
her atrial kick).  She spontaneously converted to NSR after some
diuresis but then continued to go in and out of atrial
fibr
