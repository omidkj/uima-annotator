Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT
Echo
INtubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo male w/ PMHx sig for atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, pacemaker, aortic valve repair who p/w acute onset
right sided weakness.  History is obtained entirely from family
as the patient is intubated.  Wife states that pt was in his
USOH ~ 9:30 PM when he complained that his right arm was not
moving
well.  Shortly after, the patient developed a right facial droop
and complained of right leg weakness as well.  His speech was
slurred.  Wife called EMS and the patient was brought to the ED
at [**Hospital3 **].  He was ultimately intubated for airway
protection and CT scan showed 2.5 cm L basal ganglia hemorrhage.
 Pt was given vitamin K and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further
management.

Upon arrival to the ED, BP was 238/130.  INR was 4.0.  Pt was
given proplex and IV Labetolol for elevated BP.  Neurosurgery
was consulted and felt that there was no surgical issue.

STUDIES:
EKG [**12-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. T wave inversions in leads II, III, aVF and V4-V6
suggestive of inferolateral ischemia with occasional ventricular
paced beats. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-8-18**]
intermittent ventricular pacing and lateral T wave abnormalities
are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG [**12-24**]: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.
Pacemaker rhythm. No further analysis. Compared to the previous
tracing the pacing is new.
  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

PCXR [**12-24**]: AP chest compared to 12:32 a.m.: Lateral aspect of
the right chest is excluded from the examination. Moderate-
to-severe cardiomegaly and mild generalized interstitial
abnormality that could be edema is unchanged. Tip of the
endotracheal tube, with the chin down slightly is 3 cm from the
carina, is in standard placement.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads enter
from the left subclavian but not attached to a pacemaker. A
right-sided lead extending from pacemaker not included in the
study, projects over the floor of the right ventricular apex. No
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion seen along the
pleural surfaces included on this study.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.

Head CT [**12-24**]: No overt difference in size of large left basal
ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but with slight increase in
the intraventricular hemorrhage, with new focus of hemorrhage in
the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.

PCXR [**12-25**]: Patchy left lower lobe opacity, slightly increased,
which may represent atelectasis/consolidation. Pneumonia in this
region should be considered.
Fluid overload.
Endotracheal tube should be retracted at least 1 cm for better
positioning.

CT [**12-25**]: No appreciable difference in the size of large left
basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but slight increase
in intraventricular hemorrhage, particularly in the occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.

ECHO [**12-26**]:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. The lower half of the
left ventricle is akinetic.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal
for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ECHO [**12-27**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.



Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: Patient was admitted to NeuroICU for further monitoring.
Repeat Head CT at 0900  [**12-24**] showed some slight increase in
intraventric blood, but no sig increase in hemorrhage size or
dilation of ventricles.  A repeat CT scan later that afternoon
was stable and there was no indication to place a drain.

A repeat CT [**12-25**] AM was stable with no hydrocephalus and
supportive measures were continued.  Began to follow commands
with all extremities although spontaneous movements of RUE
absent.  On [**12-26**] after extubation, was following commands
intermittently and attempting to speak but unable.  Dense right
hemiplegia but able to withdraw to pain.  Was stable and
transferred to step down [**12-26**] pm.  Patient continued to improve
more awake, alert and following midline commands.  Decision was
made not to resume coumadin at this time given recent
intracranial hemorrhage and patient was started on a baby
aspirin.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was evaluted by speech and swallow and
recommended PO diet of pureed solids, nectar thick liquid, PO
meds crushed
in puree with follow up swallows of nectar thick liquid if
necessary to clear oral cavity.  Also, supervised assist with
meals (alternate bites & sips) checking oral cavity for residue.
 At time of discharge, he was able to sing "Happy Birthday" and
will benefit from speech therapy to address dysphagia and mixed
aphasia.  He will also follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital
