Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This young African-American male
with a history of seizure disorder and hypertension as well
as a question of hypercholesterolemia, presented to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department with
acute onset of substernal chest pain and epigastric
discomfort since 7 p.m. in the evening.  The patient had
associated nausea and vomiting.

In the Emergency Room electrocardiogram revealed ST
elevations in leads V1 through V3.  The patient was given
aspirin, nitroglycerin, and a heparin drip was started for
emergent angioplasty and catheterization.  He also stated he
recently had a history of an episode of transient monocular
blindness and transient right arm weakness with subsequent
MRA revealing normal vasculature.  Incidentally, a
subarachnoid cyst was found, and the patient was to begin a
hypercoagulability workup.

In the catheterization laboratory the patient was found to
have clean coronary arteries and was transferred back to the
Cardiology floor in stable condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of seizure disorder.
2.  History of hematuria with a negative ultrasound except
for a simple cyst of his right kidney.
3.  Arachnoid cyst in his left anterior temporal lobe with an
otherwise normal MRA on [**2156-12-18**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home were Depakote,
enteric-coated aspirin, and triamterene.

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  His admission laboratories were a
white blood cell count of 8.8, hematocrit of 37.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 29, BUN 20,
creatinine 1.4, with a blood sugar of 108.  Blood cultures
had all been drawn on [**12-24**], which were pending.  An T3
from the [**12-24**] was pending.  Cardiolipin antibodies were
pending, as were homocystine.  He also had CK/MB and troponin
drawn.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was admitted to the Cardiology Service.
The question was whether or not he had a thromboembolic event
given his sketchy neurologic symptoms.  He continued on
Depakote for his seizure disorder.

He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21662**] of Cardiology who noted a [**1-4**]
holosystolic murmur at the apex and a soft early diastolic
murmur.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had good
peripheral pulses, and no bruits.  His nitroglycerin was
weaned off.   His heparin was discontinued.  He was also seen
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the cardiology attending.

On the following morning, on [**12-27**], he was seen again by
Cardiology by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 46**] who agreed
that there may be some infectious disease process going on
with a possible of showering of embolic material.  He was
seen by Infectious Disease on [**12-27**] after his
echocardiogram.  The echocardiogram showed a large 2-cm to
3-cm vegetation on his aortic valve, and a thickened mitral
valve, and a question of an air abscess behind the aortic
valve.  Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted, and the patient
was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who noted his history and that he
had associated moderate aortic insufficiency with this
vegetation on his aortic valve, left coronary leaflet.  He
continued with his hypercoagulability workup, and cultures
remained pending at that time.

He had a transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**12-28**]
which showed excellent left ventricular systolic function and
a large highly mobile and friable vegetation on the left
aortic leaflet on left ventricular flow tract side.  Please
refer to the final report which also examined the patient an
abscess cavity on the left ventricle.

Infectious Disease continued to follow him with
recommendations as to the possible cause of his endocarditis.
Over the course of the next two weeks he was treated for his
bacterial endocarditis by Infectious Disease and Cardiology
with antibiotic therapy.  He continued with blood cultures
and occasional temperature spikes.  His white blood cell
count rose to 18 on [**12-30**].  He was also seen by
Neurology and Social Work.  His antibiotics were held, and he
had mild renal insufficiency upon the recommendations of
Infectious Disease.  He remained febrile with no neurologic
complaints and continued to ambulate while he awaited surgery
for his aortic valve endocarditis.  He also had a dental
evaluation done which reportedly showed that he needed a
complete edentulation  prior to having surgery.  He remained
clinically stable otherwise as preparations were made for his
dental surgery, and he continued to be followed by
Cardiology.

He had a left lung infiltrate on [**1-1**], so levofloxacin
was added into the antibiotic regimen along with the
ceftriaxone.  Gentamicin was also added into his coverage for
treatment of pneumonia.  He remained hemodynamically stable
as he continued his antibiotic therapy.

On [**1-3**] he was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
anticipation of his surgery.  On [**1-5**] he has his dental
surgery to remove his infected teeth.  His white blood cell
count was 12, hematocrit 28, platelet count 314,000.
Potassium 4.3, BUN 12, creatinine 1.1.  He continued to have
both his systolic ejection murmur and his diastolic murmur,
and was continued on antibiotics.  He continued with
increased intravenous fluids therapy and hydration for the
mild increase in his creatinine, and BUN decrease, and
continued to remain febrile but was hemodynamically stable.

[**Last Name (STitle) 21663**] again on [**1-7**] by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of
Cardiology Surgery who was following his progress and the
timing of his surgery.

On [**1-10**] he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells for his hematocrit, and he remained stable with no
evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.  He was followed daily by
Infectious Disease and Cardiology.

On[**1-12**] he underwent a homograft aortic root
replacement with valve and a resection of his aortic root
left ventricular abscess.  His left circumflex outflow track
was repaired and reconstructed with a pericardial patch, and
he had a repair of his mitral valve after debridement by
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

On postoperative day one, he remained sedated on a Nipride
drip at 2 mcg/kg per minute and a propofol drip at 50.  He
continued on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin per Infectious
Disease.  He had a temperature maximum of 101.8 with a good
blood pressure.  He remained ventilated and sedated.  His
white blood cell count was 8.4, with a hematocrit of 30.1, a
potassium of 5, a BUN of 18, and a creatinine of 1.6.  His
sternum was stable.  His lungs were clear.  His heart was
regular in rate and rhythm in the 90s.  Sedation was
decreased.  Lopressor was started.  He had good urine output,
and he remained in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was seen by
Rehabilitation Services and Infectious Disease.

On postoperative day two, efforts were made to continue to
maintain his blood pressure control.  His Nipride was 3.5
with a blood pressure of 137/66.  He had a temperature
maximum of 102.4.  He remained intubated and sedated on his
double antibiotic therapy with a heart rate slightly
tachycardic in the 100s.  His sternum was stable.  His lungs
were clear.  His abdomen was soft and nontender, and his
extremities were warm.  He started a labetalol intravenous
drip for better control of his blood pressure as well as some
Lasix diuresis.

On postoperative day three, he was extubated.  His Nipride
was restarted for blood pressure control.  He got Ativan in
small doses.  His amiodarone was switched to p.o.  His
Lopressor was increased to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., again in an
effort to keep his heart rate and blood pressure under
control.  His Lasix was discontinued.  He continued on
antibiotic therapy, and central venous line was discontinued.

On postoperative day four, he was off all drips with a blood
pr
