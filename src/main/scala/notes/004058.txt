Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
MS changes and seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:

HPI: 70 year old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes,
dementia, CRI (1.8) who was recently discharged from the
neurology service with a large temporo-parietal bleed in the
setting of Lovenox now presenting from nursing home with mental
status changes and possible seizure activity. Believed that ICH
was secondary to amyloid angiopathy and that surgical
intervention would be in vain. Pt transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab
on seizure prohphlaxis, but apparently was seizure free during
initial hospitalization. Pt transitioned from rehab to nursing
home yesterday. Pt unable to provide history and there is no
documentation of event, however, per EMS report they witnessed
tonic-clonic activity.

CXR [**11-21**]:
1. No pneumonia.
2. Mild volume overload.
.
head CT [**11-21**]: IMPRESSION: 2.8 x 2.2 cm rounded focus at the
site of prior intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is surrounding
decreased attenuation, consistent with edema or malacia. While
this could represent resorbing hematoma, this appearance is
concerning for a mass lesion and further evaluation could be
obtained
.
CXR [**11-22**]: Opacity in the right middle lobe, not present on the
previous study. Findings represent aspiration and/or pneumonia
.
ECHO [**11-22**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion
is normal.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-31**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension
.
CXR [**11-28**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slight improvement in patchy right infrahilar opacity, which
may be due to improving asymmetrical edema, focal atelectasis or
pneumonia.
2. Mild congestive heart failure.
.
CXR [**12-8**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent mild congestive heart failure.

2. Right infrahilar opacity is stable and may represent
asymmetric edema or may be due to aspiration.
.
EKG [**12-10**]:
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 70. Left-sided early repolarization.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2173-12-8**] probably no significant change.
.
CXR [**12-13**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old female w/ h/o HTN, diabetes, dementia, CRI, and
recent temporo-parietal bleed presented with MS changes likely
secondary to seizure, c/b acute renal failure.
.
# Neuro/Resp: Patient was admitted with seizures likely d/t
temporo-parietal ICH with possible mass on CT.  Was seen by
neurology in the ER and loaded on dilantin and started on
keppra.  Tox-Met workup performed and was negative (negative
serum and urine tox screen, neg. UA). It was felt that the
patient would benefit from additional imaging of mass to
differentiate resolvind hematoma from other mass, but this was
not able to be performed because patient was unable to tolerate
MRI at any point d/t continued agitations [**Hospital 49997**] hospital
stay.  Patient was on and off agitated throughout her hospital
course, and a variety of antipsychotics including olanzapine,
risperidone, seroquel, and eventually haldol were used.  The
patient required level II restraints for the majority of her
hospitalization, renewed daily.  Psychiatry was consulted,
followed the patient, and made recommendations.  A FM was used
for a couple of days to maintain O2 saturations, but this was
stopped for fear of decreasing resp drive and an increasing PCO2
(ABG showed pH 7.38/86/80, due to metabolic acidosis with
significant chronic renal compensation).  Patient was
transferred to MICU on [**2173-11-25**] for bradycardia, hypotension,
and hypoxia.  Cause unclear although there was some concern for
seizure.  (Patient had initially had evidence of PNA on CXR and
this was treated with 14 days of abx, but the opacity cleared
after two days and it was unclear if she actually had PNA).
Episode resolved on its own without intervention.  Loaded with
dilantin.  Thought to be d/t cenrally mediated process.  CT of
head unchanged with no new bleed or mass effect.  Cardiology
consulted and found no evidence of structural heart disease or
conduction delay.  A breast mass was found on exam in MICU,
raising concern for etiology of head mass.  Plan was to work
this up further once patient more stable.  No pressors required
while in MICU.  Transferred to floor.  Patient remained agitated
a frequently desaturated to 70's when agitated, but would bump
to 100% with nebs.  Etiology thought to be combination of
asthma/COPD, CHF, agitation, and decreased respiratory drive.
On [**2173-12-11**], pt was noted to be more somnolent with ABG
7.16/110/39/51 and was transferred to unit for trial of BIPAP.
Etiology hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to sedation
and infection (UTI and +blood cultures 1/4) and COPD.  While in
the MICU the patient was essentially made comfort care d/t poor
prognosis and no improvement with BIPAP (pt DNR/DNI).  She was
transferred to the floor where sshe continued to decline.
Family meeting had and it was decided that her chances of
returning to a meaningful life or even back to near baseline was
minimal, and care was focused on comfort.  Antibiotics, FS,
insulin, and diuretic
