Admission Date:  [**2167-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-1-2**]

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
Myelodysplastic syndrome with myeloproliferative disease with
myelofibrosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
sibling allogenic stem cell transplant
Placement of venous central lines x 2 and removal
Intubation x12 days for hypoxic respiratory failure
Placement of femoral hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
51 yo F with no significant PMH, with recent diagnosis of
MDS/MPD with myelofibrosis admitted for sibling allogenic SCT.
.
Patient reports that five years ago, she was found to be anemic
by her PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] colonoscopy and upper GI series were done to
workup the source of anemia. There were colonic polyps which
were removed. She was started on iron supplementation. However,
the anemia did not resolve, and she eventually developed severe
thrombocytopenia (PLT <40). A CT of the abdomen showed
splenemegaly. Patient was referred by PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
[**Name9 (PRE) **] at OSH, who then referred the patient to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. A bone marrow biopsy was done, which was
equivocal. Patient had a repeat biopsy which showed MDS. Her
sister was found to be a matched donor, and so patient is
admitted to subling allogenic SCT.
.
Of note, patient has had little symptoms associated with the
anemia and thrombocytopenia. Denied frequent bleeding,
infections, or increased fatigue. The diagnosis of MDS was very
much a shock, and has been a significant stressor emotionally.
.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
-ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2167-12-25**] 3:07 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of biliary duct obstruction, as questioned.
2. Gallbladder sludge, with no son[**Name (NI) 493**] features of acute
cholecystitis.
3. Stable splenomegaly.
4. Stable 2.6 cm echogenic splenic lesion, benign.

-CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-12-21**] 9:26 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of diffuse and symmetric perihilar
ground glass
opacities and septal thickening, most suggestive of diffuse
pulmonary edema.  Pulmonary hemorrhage and diffuse infection are
considered less likely given the symmetric findings.
2. Increase in size of a right pleural effusion, which is now
large in size.
3. Minimal decrease in size of a left pleural effusion.
4. Ascites and massive splenomegaly, partially imaged.
5. Diffuse osseous sclerosis, compatible with changes relating
to
myelodysplastic syndrome.

-TTE (Complete) Done [**2167-12-21**] at 2:19:06 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motio
