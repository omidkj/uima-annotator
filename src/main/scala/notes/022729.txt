Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal distention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
62F transferred from [**Hospital3 2558**] with tachycardia,
hyperglycemia, respiratory distress and increased abdominal
distension.  The recent history of her presentation is
unavailable.  She was intubated on arrival for a RR of 50 and
unobtainable SaO2.  Nasotracheal intubation performed.
Initially
only IV access available was right foot.  NGT placed for gastric
distension seen on CXR and >2L coffee ground output.  TLC placed
but had to be converted to cordis as crossed to left subclavian.

IVF resuscitation begun.  Lactate elevated, ARF, anuria on foley
placement.  Continued NGT output, almost 3L.  In total 4L LS, 2U
PRBC.

Per the patients family the patient is typically A&Ox3 and is
ambulatory at her center.  She is a [**Hospital3 2558**] resident for
the past year due to a history of "nervous breakdown" in the
setting of a psych diagnosis (?schizophrenia) and a need for
supervision with her medications.  Prior to her admission there,
she was hospitalized for pulmonary issues.  Her psych issues
began late in life after her father passed away in [**2193**].

IMAGING:
CT abd/pelvis ([**2199-9-1**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for early/partial small bowel obstruction
with
possible transition point in mid abdomen (2:50). No current
evidence of
perforation, pneumatosis, or bowel wall thickening.
2. Trace hyperdense material within second portion of duodenum
may represent ingested material. For definite evidence of ulcer,
direct visualization by endoscopy is recommended when patient is
able to tolerate procedure.
3. Bibasal atelectasis and/or infection/aspiration, particularly
in view of patulous esophagus with layering fluid.
4. Probable tiny upper pole left renal angiomyolipoma.

CT head ([**2199-9-1**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2199-9-3**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant decrease in dilatation of proximal small bowel
loops
suggestive of resolving SBO. Currently there is no clear
transition point
that can be visualized. There is no evidence of perforation,
pneumatosis or bowel wall thickening throughout the bowel.
2. Increased bibasilar atelectasis with the left greater than
the right.

KUB ([**2199-9-4**]):
IMPRESSION: Similar dilated proximal small bowel loops. Oral
contrast has
passed distally into the colon.

KUB ([**2199-9-5**]):
marked dilation of several loops of bowel, possibly small and
large bowel, new compared to the prior study. No free air
identified. large amount of stool noted in the colon and rectum.
CT may be obtained for further evaluation.

EGD ([**2199-9-5**]):
Erythema and friability in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis (biopsy). Retained fluids in stomach. Gastroscope
converted to pediatric colonoscope with good visualization to
the proximal jejunum.
