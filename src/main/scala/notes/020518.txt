Pertinent Results:
----------
Reports:
.
[**2176-2-24**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm
Conduction defect of LBBB type
No change from previous
.
CXR [**2176-2-24**]: Left lower lobe infiltrate, which could represent
pneumonia.
Left pleural effusion.  Faint opacity in the right lower lobe
may represent an early infiltrate.
.
CXR [**2176-2-27**]: The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There
are persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities with
relative sparing of the left upper lobe, superimposed upon
baseline areas of fibrosis. This may reflect edema or diffuse
infection. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2176-3-4**]: Evaluation of the lung apices is limited by head
positioning. Compared to prior study there appears to be minimal
change in diffuse interstitial infiltrate within the right lung.
Otherwise, cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
There may be a small amount of volume loss within the left lung.
.
[**2176-2-27**] Swallow Study:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest pt be made NPO with alternate means of nutrition and
hydration, as there were no safe consistencies to recommend
based
on today's evaluation.
2. Pt is not a candidate for an objective swallowing evaluation
(videoswallow or FEES) as the pt is not expected to participate
in either.
3. Suggest  a family discussion to weigh the options/risks for
nutrition regarding continued PO intake vs alternate means of
nutrition and hydration.
4. Should the family health care proxy decide to continue with
PO
intake, would suggest a PO diet of honey thick liquids and
pureed
consistency solids, knowing pt is at high risk to aspirate all
consistencies.
*** it was decided by HCP that pt should continue with PO diet,
as per #4 above.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 yo F with PMH of Mental Retardation, IPL, Grade II
gastritis from [**2169**] EGD on ASA daily who presents with 2
episodes of coffee ground emesis and heme + melena. She was seen
in ED by GI for possible scope.
.
1. GI bleed: Given her presentation and coffee ground emesis
this thought to be consistent with a GI bleed.  She received IVF
and 2 units of pRBCs and her Hct stabilized.  She was also
started on protonix and her aspirin was held.  GI was consulted
but since she no longer had emesis and her hematocrit was stable
an endoscopy was not performed. Her Hct remained stable
throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
.
2. Pulmonary: LLL infiltrate with possible RLL infiltrate and
possible L pleural effusion, in setting of chronic IPF.  Pt.
currently continues to need chronic O2, she desaturates to 70s
on room air. Pt needs to be frequently reminded to keep oxygen
on. She has a h/o CHF (EF 20%), last CXR on [**2-28**] with mod pulm
edema, CXR on [**3-3**] showed ground glass R>L, increased cardiac
silhouette. Lasix 20mg IV given for several episodes of
desaturation, then transition to PO lasix and also started on
aldactone given her depressed EF.  Difficult to measure Is/Os
[**2-1**] incontinence, but subjectively Pt. appeared more comfortable
and interactive at the time of d/c, with clearer lungs and less
work of breathing. Will need K monitored closely given
aldactone/lasix.
