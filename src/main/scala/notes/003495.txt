CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man s/p cABG and MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
STUDY: PA and lateral chest. [**2149-12-7**].

HISTORY: 72-year-old man status post CABG with mitral valve
replacement. Evaluate effusion.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2149-12-5**].

The right-sided venous catheter has been removed. There is
improvement of the pulmonary edema since the previous study.
There remains a left-sided pleural effusion and left
retrocardiac opacity. Atelectasis within the right mid lung zone
is again seen. Median sternotomy wires are seen. There is
air-filled colon interposed between the diaphragm and the liver.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
(1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Partial mitral leaflet flail. Severe mitral annular
calcification. Severe thickening of mitral valve chordae. [**Male First Name (un) **] of
mitral valve leaflets. Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate to severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is
posterior leaflet flail. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is severe thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. An eccentric, anteriorly and posteriorly directed jet
of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is systolic
reversal as noted by pulse wave doppler of both sided pulmonary
veins.
7. Pt has a hypertrophied septum measuring 1.9 cm to 2.2cm. Peak
velocity across the LVOT is 2.4cm/s.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST-BYPASS:
1. Biventricular function is maintained, LVEF >50%.
2. A bioprosthetic prosthetic valve is noted in the mitral
position. The valve is well seated; there is good leaflet
excursion and there is no paravalvular leak or mitral
regurgitations. Peak gradient across the valve is 11mmHg, mean
gradient is 5mmHg, MVA is 1.7cm2.
3. There is no change in the velocity across the LVOTat rest and
measures 2.4 cm/s.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital for surgical evaluation.
He underwent preoperative workup and plavix washout.  On [**12-1**]
he went to the operating room and underwent coronary artery
bypass gradt and mitral valve replacement.  Please see operative
report for further details.  He was transferred to the CVICU on
