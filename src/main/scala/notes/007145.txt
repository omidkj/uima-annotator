Pertinent Results:
[**4-5**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. LVEF is 40 %, but is likely lower
given the severity of mitral regurgitation. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. At least moderate to severe eccebtric ([**1-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is A2 flail and possible
posterior restriction seen on the mitral valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 7958**] was a same day admission and on [**4-5**] she was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 2 and mitral valve repair(Left internal
mammary artery grafted to Left anterior descending
artery/Saphenous vein grafted to Obtuse Marginal/Mitral Valve
Replacement #25mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine).Cross Clamp time=
112 minutes/Cardiopulmonary bypass time =139 minutes.  Please
see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Immediately postoperative a left
chest tube was inserted for a hemothorax. All vasoactive
infusions were weaned to off. She awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated on POD#1. All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. Beta-blocker was optimized.
Due to Mrs.[**Doctor First Name 111028**] psychiatric history, postoperatively  she
was often uncooperative and requiring very close monitoring. She
therefore remained in the CVICU until POD# 5 when she was more
appropriate/cooperative and it was deemed safe to transfer her
to the stepdown unit for further monitoring. The remainder of
her postoperative course was essentially uncomplicated. She
continued to progress and on POD #6 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared her for
discharge to rehab for further strength, endurance, and increase
in daily activities. All follow up appointments were advised.
