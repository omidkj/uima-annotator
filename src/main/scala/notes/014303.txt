Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3853**]
Chief Complaint:
"Lower GI bleed."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line Placement at OSH
Colonoscopy and EGD at OSH

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with hx of CMP (EF 15%), Afib, HTN, with active LGIB.
Presented 10 days  ago to QMC, self-resolved, DC'ed to home on
[**2-25**], then returned again on [**2-29**] with recurrent BRBPR, Hct 27
(baseline 38), has received 4 units over last 24 hours, Hct
remains at 27.  Had C-scope showing diverticulosis and lots of
blood, unable to localize bleeding.  Underwent CTA that does not
show any obvious source of active GIB, however, he is still
having BRBPR ([**Name8 (MD) **] RN, has had >10 BM's today with BRBPR, approx
150ml each time). Surgical consult did bedside rigid
sigmoidoscopy without identification of a clear source of bleed.
Surgical consult recommended transfer to a tertiary care center
in the event that he continued to bleed and required an
ex-lap/colectomy.  Surgery there did not feel comfortable
operating given his cardiac co-morbidities.  Given that he was
still actively bleeding, Hct had not bumped after 4 units
PRBC's, and his pre-transfer BP was 93/51 (hospitalist thought
BP in 130's, but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN in step-down unit, had been trending
down all day). Transferred with 2 PIV (22g, 18g). Pt received 6u
pRBC, 6u platelets, and 2u FFP total. Hct on presentation was 39
decreased to 27 today with bump to 27.9 after transfusion.
.
Also seen by his outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66687**], while at
OSH who recommended he be started on digoxin and that his home
lasix dose be increased.
.
On arrival to the MICU on [**2180-3-3**], he was feeling well. That day
he stooled less (2 BMs) than the day prior (10 BMs). Stools
continue to be BRBPR. He c/o mild burning w stooling and burping
but denied fever, chills, SOB, chest pain, dizziness, abdominal
pain.

TTE [**3-4**]:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is probably
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %)
but due to atrial fib and LBBB regionality could not be well
defined. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are probably normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen.
There is probably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.0-1.2 cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There is
mild compression of the RV free wall in diatole without overt
collapse (suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure
without overt tamponade).

CXR: There is severe cardiomegaly. A transvenous pacemaker leads
are in standard position. There is no pneumothorax. Left lower
lobe opacity is a combination of pleural effusion and
atelectasis. There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis. There
is mild vascular congestion.

CTA From OSH:
No obvious cause for bleeding seen. Small 5mm blush 6 cm from
anal verge ?AVM v valve of [**Location (un) **] v internal hemorrhoid. Also
showed moderate pericardial effusion and "signs of right heart
failure."
Mild pneumatosis of cecum likely incidental wo focal bowel wall
thickening or surrounding infalmmatory change in this location.
No portal venous air. Positive sigmoid diverticulosis wo
inflammation. Remainder of colon unremarkable. Small bowel
unremarkable.
Moderate pericardial effusion 2.8cm thick w signs of R heart
failure w significant reflux into the liver (previously measured
19mm).

Brief Hospital Course:
81y M hx of diverticulosis, colon cancer s/p R sided

cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for
management of acute lower GIB.

1. Lower GI Bleed:
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 10353**] on [**2-29**] after
recurrent BRBPR (was d/c home on [**2180-2-25**] after self-resolving
BRBPR).  His Hct dropped from 38 to 27 and after 6 units of
pRBCs, his HCt remained at 27. He had a colonoscopy showing
severe diverticulosis through
