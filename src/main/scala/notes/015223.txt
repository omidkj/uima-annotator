Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiogenic Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-5-23**] Institution of ECMO via Femoral Arterial and Venous
Cannulation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year old male with HTN, ESRD on HD and a history of
CAD. He was treated with CABG in [**2134**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to
PDA, and SVG to RI and OM. He developed stenosis at the LIMA to
LAD anastamosis and was treated with PCI in [**10-8**]. In [**2140**] he
underwent repeat CABG in [**2140**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] with placement of a free
radial to the OM which had been found to be occluded in [**2138**]. He
presented to the ED this AM complaining of "chest burning" since
early in the day and was found to have diffuse ST depressions
consistent with global ischemia and had rapid hemodynamic
decompensation. He was treated with multiple pressors and
transported emergently to the cath lab where he arrived with no
appreciable pulses and CPR was initiated.

Brief Hospital Course:
As previous stated, patient rapidly deteriorated on presentation
to the [**Hospital1 18**]. He required emergent intubation and multiple
pressors for hemodynamic support. He was urgently brought to the
cardiac cath lab where he arrived with no appreciable pulses.
CPR was initiated and he required multiple
defibrillations/cardioversions. During the cath, successful
stenting of the ramus with a Cypher drug-eluting stent and PTCA
of the circumflex ostium was performed, but due to continued
hemodynamic compromise, the patient was emergently started on
cardio-pulmonary bypass by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] from the cardiac surgical
team. An IABP was concomitantly inserted. He was brought to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring. A bedside echocardiogram revealed
a LVEF of 10% with severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Despite ECMO, IABP support and multiple inotropes, he continued
deteriorate and gradually became more acidotic. After discussion
the family, it was decided to withdraw support. The patient was
pronounced dead at [**2156**].
