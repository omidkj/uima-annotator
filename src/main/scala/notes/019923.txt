History of Present Illness:
55F with recent h/o depression who reported approximately 4
weeks of very limited mobility due to depression. Over the
course of the 4 weeks pt noted worsening irritation on L thigh
and R buttock, but initially assumed irritation was secondary to
recent bouts of diarrhea. She was seen at both a wound care
clinic as well as an OSH, where she was hypotensive, which was
concerning for sepsis. Pt then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management on [**2193-6-15**]. Pt was started on vanco, clinda, and
tigecycline and OSH and was immediately admitted to ICU upon
transfer.

On admission, she denied fevers, CP, SOB but did endorse chills,
decreased appetite and pain in her buttocks.

PE at time of admission notable for a large necrotic area on her
R buttock and surrounding erythema near her rectum as well as a
smaller area of ulceration on L posterior thigh. Pt was afebrile
on admission and otherwise stable (98.8 78 120/73 28 98%RA).

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU following debridement of her
decubitus ulcers given concern for possible acute return to OR.
She did very well after the first debridement on [**6-15**], coming
off the ventilator and pressors soon after. She had an
uneventful evening in the ICU and her dressing was changed at
the bedside POD 1. She tolerated this dressing change fairly
well with Dilaudid, and the wound bed showed no purulence or
necrotic tissue. Her antibiotics were held as the wound appeared
sterile and she was transferred to the surgical floor that day.

[**Hospital 1094**] hospital course since arriving on the floor was notable
only for 1 episode of hypotension (70/30s) overnight on [**6-16**]. Pt
normalized quickly and all test results, notably EKG and cardiac
enzymes, following this episode were completely normal. Pt
experienced no further episodes of hypotension throughout the
remainder of her hospital course.

Pt was discharged on [**6-19**] following assessments by psychiatry,
PT, and SW, all of whom felt the pt was ready and able to be
discharged to a rehab facility for wound care. Pt is in
agreement with this course of action and was transferred to
rehab facility on [**2193-6-19**].
