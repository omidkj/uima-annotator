PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS

Comparison is made to [**8-20**] examination. In the interval,
epicardial leads and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed with
slightly decreased widening in the superior mediastinum
identified. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with fluid in
fissures and adjacent atelectases, not significantly changed.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.6 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *6.6 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 15% to 20% (nl >=55%)

Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.2 cm

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by
2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severely depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic
root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
3. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20
%). The lateral wall and the basal inferior wall regional wall
function is
relatively preserved.
4. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic
aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. The noncoronary cusp is calcified. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+)
central mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve
prolapse or
flail segments.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
9. Post-induction patient required intra-aortic balloon pump;
epinephrine,
neosynephrine, and nitro gtt with improvement of biventricular
function.

POST-BYPASS:
Patient off cardiopulmonary bypass with intra-aortic balloon
pump,
epinephrine.

There is mild improvement of global LV and RV systolic function.
LVEF 20 to
25%. Thoracic aortic contour is preserved.
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the native mitral position
well seated and
functioning well with no residual mitral regurgitation and a
transmitral mean
gradient of less than 5mmof Hg.
