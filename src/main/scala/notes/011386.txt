Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-5-21**]
1. Mitral valve repair with a resection of the middle
    scallop of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve and
    implantation of a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chordae to the middle scallop
    at the anterior leaflet and a mitral valve annuloplasty
    with a 28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.

History of Present Illness:
66 year old male with mitral valve prolapse and atrial
fibrillation has been recently experiencing worsening symptoms
of fatigue and dyspnea. He describes having these symptoms since
[**Month (only) 956**] while he was in [**State 108**] for the
winter. The dyspnea can occur while lying in bed or walking. He
does report episodes of PND occurring a few times per week. He
has also noticed chest heaviness/tightness unrelated to
activity. He feels very weak and fatigue and has limited
activity tolerance which is significantly new and has been
worsening since [**Month (only) 956**]. He has also been experiencing frequent
lightheadedness unrelated to exertion.

Final Report
INDICATION:  66-year-old male post-CABG and mitral valve
replacement.

COMPARISON:  [**2184-5-23**].

There are
small bilateral pleural effusions.  Improved aeration, with
decreased left

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe P2 leaflet and A2
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, anteriorly directed
jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen as
well as a central jet. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Left ventricular function is unchanged. The right
ventricle is mildly hypokinetic. There is a well-seated mitral
annuloplasty ring in place. There is a mean gradient of 3 mmHg
at a cardiac output of 5.5 L/min. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**2184-5-20**] and was started on Heparin.  He
underwent MV repair( 28mm ring)/CABGx1(SVG->OM)/MAZE on [**5-21**].
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition on Propofol.  He was extubated on post op
night and was transferred to the floor on POD#1.  His chest
tubes and wires were discontinued on POD#2. He was
anticoagulated with coumadin and progressed well.  On POD#4 he
was discharged to home in stable condition and in sinus rhythm.
His coumadin will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
