O2sat 91% RA and 98% 4LNC. She received Lasix 120mg IV and was
started on a nitro gtt. She was also given diltiazem 30mg po and
10mg IV. Her SBP subsequently dropped to 90 with RVR still in
130s. The nitro gtt was stopped. She had intermittent recurrent
chest pain that responded to SL NTG. She was transiently on
CPAP. She was then put on a diltiazem gtt, still with poor rate
control. She was 100% on 4L NC and BP 107/60. She was
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.

thought to be associated with reflux sx, but TWI noted [**6-19**] in
precordial leads, concerning for LAD ischemia.  Symptoms now
more frequent, have been treated with nitro with some success.
CEs persistently negative, EKG with TWIs in precordial leads
unchanged.  She underwent cardiac cath  which demonstrated her
SVG to PDA was known occluded and unchanged, LAD had 90% ostial
lesion but fills via SVG, LCX had 70% lesion at OM2 but fills
via SVG and the RCA was widely patent.  She was continued on
aspirin, metoprolol, statin and isordil (reduced to [**Hospital1 **] dosing).
 Her plavix was discontinued and aspirin was lowered to 81mg
daily.

depressed contractility.   Pt was continued on home lasix dose
80mg daily, 120mg on Sundays. Lisinopril was stopped [**2-20**] low BP.
