Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old woman with a history of ESRD on
hemodialysis, CAD s/p MI and PCI, PVD s/p aorto-femoral bypass,
diastolic heart failure, asthma, and chronic abdominal pain who
presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain and is
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
She was last discharged on [**2114-9-20**] after presenting with acute
on chronic abdominal pain.  Her evaluation was negative for
acute etiologies and she was discharged with outpatient GI
follow-up but was unable to keep her appointment.  She was in
her usual state of health until this morning when she awoke with
worsening of her abdominal pain, nausea, two episodes of
diarrhea with loose, watery stools, and three episodes of
nonbloody emesis.  She denied fevers, chills, but had a
non-productive cough with thick sputum last night which had
resolved by this morning.  She was at [**Date Range 2286**] yesterday and had
4.5L removed per her report, but she has had worsening shortness
of breath since last Thursday when she missed her [**Date Range 2286**]
session.  She did undergo [**Date Range 2286**] on Saturday.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were  98.1 82 187/75 16 96%O2 sat
on NRB.  She was found to be hypoxic to 78%3L, hypertensive to
SBPs 180s, and tachypneic with abdominal pain described as sharp
epigastric pain with radiation to her back, and her exam was
notable for bibasilar rales and guaiac neg brown stool.  She was
given dilaudid iv .5 mg x 1 and 1 mg x 1 and placed on a NRB
with O2 sat rising to 97%.  A chest x-ray was performed and
demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates and small pleural
effusions, and she was given vanc/levofloxacin empirically for
pneumonia.  Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible [**Name (NI) 2286**], and ICU
admission was requested for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
On arrival to the floor, she is requesting pain medication for
her abdominal pain and appears uncomfortable.
.
Review of Systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies
wheezes. No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin breakdown. No numbness/tingling in extremities.
No feelings of depression or anxiety. All other review of
systems negative.


Past Medical History:
- "About 20" hospitalizations over the past 5-6 years for
epigastric pain that has eluded definitive diagnosis. According
to her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] carries a diagnosis of
chronic pancreatitis, although this has not been confirmed.
Multiple attempts to have her seen in the outpatient GI unit
have failed because she has not been able to keep her
appointments.
- Coronary artery disease; s/p MI in [**11/2111**] (received stent to
RCA and right PDA at [**Hospital1 112**])
- ESRD diagnosed "10 years ago"; has received hemodialysis since
that time. Receives HD on Tues, Thurs, and Sat. Last [**Hospital1 2286**]
was yesterday. Baseline creatinine is in [**4-6**] range.
- Peripheral vascular disease: s/p aorto-femoral bypass with
atherectomy in [**2099**] after near total occlusion; multiple
revisions of her aorto-bifemoral and cross femoral grafts since
then
- Possible chronic mesenteric ischemia with known occlusion of
inferior mesenteric artery.
- Exploratory laparotomy for pancreas divisum with
sphincterectomy of her minor duct in [**2096**]
- Asthma
- Schizoaffective disorder
- Hypertension
- Insulin-independent diabetes mellitus (last measured HbA1c
6.6% in [**12/2112**])
- History of DVT and clots in aorto-femoral bypass
- Lumbar disc disease (with associated back pain)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Gastroesophageal reflux/gastritis ([**4-10**] EGD)
- Chronic pancreatitis
- s/p exploratory laparotomy for pancreas divisum with
sphincterotomy of her minor duct in [**2096**]
- Benign pelvic mass, s/p R oophrectomy and hysterectomy
- s/p cholecystectomy
- s/p arthroscopy of right knee and medial meniscectomy in '[**04**]
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [**6-/2113**] (positive antibody)

cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary LAD

ABD: BS+, soft, marked TTP in epigastrum.
LIMBS: No LE edema, no tremors or asterixis, no clubbing

extremities

On Discharge:
GEN: NAD
VS:  97.4, 127/58, 64, 16, 97% RA

CV: RR, normal S1 and S2, + 2/6 systolic murmur best at RUSB, no
rub or gallop
Pulm: CTAB, minimal bibasilar crackles, no wheeze or rhonchi.
Abd: BS+, soft, minimal epigastric discomfort, non-distended, no
rebound and guarding

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**10-10**] CXR: Multiple areas of patchy opacity in the right
mid-to-lower lung
and possibly left lung base, raising concern for multifocal
pneumonia.
Recommend followup to resolution.

[**10-11**] CXR:  Worsening pulmonary edema. New retrocardiac opacity
likely
representing atelectasis.

[**10-11**] Abd X ray: In the single supine view, there is no evidence
of large amount of free air within the peritoneal cavity.
Lateral decubitus views may be beneficial for further
evaluation. Air is seen within the colon and rectum. There are
no dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels to suggest
obstruction. Surgical clips are seen on the left margin of the
pelvic inlet. No significant osseous abnormalities are
identified.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence a large amount of free air on this single portable
supine view. If clinically indicated, we would recommend upright
or lateral decubitus views for further evaluation. No evidence
of small-bowel obstruction.

[**10-12**] Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal basal inferior akinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

[**10-15**] AVF duplex HD access (prelim): no stenosis (pending final
read)
