History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 78709**] is an 89 y/o with a history of gait disorder
with recurrent falls, HTN, peripheral vascular disease, and ESRD
on HD, presents as a transfer from an OSH for further mangament
of ICH after a fall.  The patient was reportedly in her USOH
until earlier today, when she reportedly had a fall at her
assited living facility while walking to the bathroom.  The
patient does not recall the event.  She was taken to [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital,where she was reportedly found to have a left
frontal SDH and left frontal intraprenchymal hemorrhage on
non-contrast head CT. She was placed in a soft cervical collar,
though CT C-spine reportedly showed spondylosis without
fracture.  While there, she was reportedly alert and fully
oriented, though a full neurologic examination was
notdocumented.  She was loaded with Cerebyx.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical assessment.  Here
she was initially noted to be fully oriented,but taking longer
to answer questions, and doing so with slurred speech.
Neurology was consulted with interval change in the patient's
examination.

dysarthric speech while awake, no paraphasic errors,
comprehension to commands intact while awake

Cranial Nerves:
Optic disc margins appear sharp; visual fields are full to
confrontation. Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to
1 mm bilaterally.  Reports diplopia in each eye individually.
Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus. Facial sensation
intact bilaterally.  Facial movement normal and symmetric.

midline.  Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.  Trapezii
full strength bilaterally.

Motor:
Diffusely reduced bulk throughout and increased tone in legs.
No tremor, positive asterixis.  Generally impersistent due to
lethargy, but seems to have full power in all muscle groups
tested.  Did not comply with testing in toes.

Coordination: Slowed with minor intention tremor noted

HKS.

Gait:  Deferred given lethargy


Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**8-7**]: There is a large left frontal parenchymal
hemorrhage with associated left subdural measuring upto 8 mm
along the frontoparietal and temporal convexity. There is no
shift of midlline structures or herniation.

Head CT [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION: No interval change in left subdural
hematoma and left intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No new areas of
hemorrhage are identified.

CXR [**8-11**]:
1. Interval improvement in now moderate pulmonary edema and
decrease in size of pleural effusions.
2. Improved aeration of the left lower lobe.

EKG [**8-7**]
Ectopic atrial rhythm. Short P-R interval. Consider left
ventricular
hypertrophy by voltage criteria. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2173-6-28**] the rate has increased. The rhythm is now
ectopic atrial in origin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 78709**] was admitted after a fall with a left subdural
hematoma and a frontal interparenchymal hemorrhage. The
hemorrhage was slightly larger on the second serial CT head
scan. She was monitored closely in ICU. On the [**6-9**],
she became more drowsy, and had fevers. The CT head was stable,
however, her CXR showed pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions. She was started on Ceftriaxone and received a five
day course with improvement in CXR and WBC and no fever. She
received hemodialysis via her left AV fistula, and her usual
schedule is: Sat/Tues/Thurs, note that she is not anuric. She
transferred out of ICU [**8-11**].  She was at her neurological
baseline with exception of difficulty hearing (baseline). On
[**8-13**] she was reassessed by Speech and swallow, who recommended
that she have: nectar thickened liquids, pills crushed with
puree, supervision to assist with feedings, and alternating
between small bites and sips. PT recommended gait, endurance and
strength training, however, she still has significant balance
impairment.

Her neurological exam prior to discharge was the following:
1. Awake, alert, oriented to time/person/place
2. Follows commands.
3. Eyes open (please note the left hematoma around her eye is
resolving)
4. the rest of the cranial nerve examination was unremarkable.
5. No pronator drift.
6. Full power in her arms and legs.
