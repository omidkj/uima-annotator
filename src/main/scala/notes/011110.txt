History of Present Illness:
67 y/o with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, left carotid

intermittent chest pain. He also reported DOE and decreased
exercise tolerance as well as generalized malaise over the past

subsequently sent to the ED. He was ruled out for an MI x 3 sets
of enzymes, Echo LVEF 55-60%. He was given NTG and had a
significant BP drop. He is currently chest pain free. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catherization today which revealed 3
vessel CAD. Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation for
CABG.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-8-5**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel disease. The LMCA
had mid distal narrowing. The LAD had a 90% stenosis after S1.
The LCX had sequential 80% mid lesions with a large distal OM
branch. The RCA was small with diffuse disease with long
moderate mid disease and a 80% stenosis before PDA. 2. Limited
resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures
at the aortic level (121/58 mmHg). 3. Left ventriculography was
defered.

[**2105-8-6**] Carotid U/S: 1. 60-69% right ICA stenosis. 2. No left
common or internal carotid stenosis status post carotid
endarterectomy. 3. High-grade right external carotid artery
stenosis.

[**2105-8-7**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The pericardium appears thickened.
There are pericardial calcifications. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified
in person of the results in the operating room at the time of
the study. POST-BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is
normal biventricular systolic function. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation. No other changes from the pre-bypass
study.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 74922**] was to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization on [**8-5**]. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe
three vessel disease and cardiac surgery was consulted. He
underwent pre-operative work-up on [**8-6**] while receiving medical
care. On [**8-7**] he was brought to the operating room where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting to 3 vessels. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers and diuretics and diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. Later on this day he was transferred to the
step-down unit for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was evaluated by
physical therapy for strength and conditioning. He was noted to
have some premature atrial and ventricular contractions and his
betabockade was increased. His electrolytes were also repleted.
He continued to make steady progress and was cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day 4 with VNA services. All
post-op appointments and instructions were advised. Of note, as
there was little room with his blood pressure, his lisinopril
was not resumed on discharge. This can be resumed as an
outpatient by either his cardiologist or primary care physician
when he has sufficient blood pressure.
