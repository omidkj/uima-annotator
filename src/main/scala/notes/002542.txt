History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87158**] is an articulate 82 year
old man with a history of aortic stenosis and progressive
shortness of breath.   His past history is significant for a
history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD
s/p MI in [**2099**] and [**2117**].   He had been in stable health over the
past 2-3 years until 6 months when he began to develop
significant dyspnea on exertion.  His dyspnea on exertion has
recently worsened so that he can only walk approximately 50
yards
before he has to stop due to SOB and leg pain. Although he
reports SOB for the past 20 years, but states it has been
acutely
getting worse for the past 3-4 months. He denies any syncope,
presyncope,  dizziness, or anginal CP. He is on coumadin for
recurrent atrial fibrillation. Pt denies any orthopnea or PND
but
does report ankle edema.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe critical symptomatic aortic stenosis.
2. Single-vessel coronary artery disease.
3. Atrial fibrillation
PMH:
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Hypertension on medications
- CAD
- hyperlipidemia
- Atrial fibrillation on warfarin
- "Post-polio syndrome" - he reports only orthopedic issues
that require chronic narcotics for pain control. He was
intermittently on an "iron lung" during the early stages of his
poliomyelitis
- Peripheral neuropathy multiple herniated disks s/p back
surgeries
- s/p pneumonia two years previously
- benign neoplasm lg bowel
Past Surgical History:
- s/p back surgeries
- s/p total knee replacement (right) x 2
- s/p surgery for lanryngeal cancer [**2104**]
-bilat cataract
-Appendectomy
-tonsillectomy


Social History:
Tobacco history: remote cigar hx
-ETOH: h/o heavy drinking, quit in [**2097**]
-Illicit drugs: denies

TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
small area of diastolic flow into the main PA distal to the PV.
There is no thrombus or SEC in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

POSTBYPASS
The LV is hyperdynamic. RV systolic function is preserved. There
is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. No AI is visualized. The LAA is no longer visualized.
The remaining study inchanged from prebypass

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87158**] is a 83 yr old gentleman referred for CT surgery by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient was felt to be a
good candidate although higher risk than
normal.  The patient understood the risks, benefits, possible
alternatives and wished to proceed. On [**8-15**] he underwent aortic
tissue valve replacement and CABG x 1 Lima to LAD and LAA
resection, bovine patch by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Bypass time 116mins
cross clamp time was 100mins. Please see intraop note for
further details.  He arrived from the unit intubated and sedated
on propofol, he was hypertensive as he was reversed and extubted
that evening and was started on Niacardipime. Oral
antihypertensive medications were initiated  and nicardipine was
discontinued. He cotinued to progress well and was transferred
to the floor on POD#2. His chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued in timely fashion and without difficulty.  His
post-operative CXR showed a small left pneumothorax that has
since resolved.
Pt remains in rate controlled a-fib tolerating beta-blocker
well. He is tolerating a full diet without swallowing
difficulty. He is a known diabetic and was resarted on his
pre-op diabetic regimen.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
Langdon of [**Location (un) **] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
