Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy
Exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal
[**First Name3 (LF) **] with biopsy, vagotomy and J-tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 69 year old male with hx COPD (on steroids)
CAD s/p CABG, duodenal [**First Name3 (LF) **], admitted with recurrence of GI
bleed. He was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 83164**] for
GIB. he had reportedly received 21 units of blood at outside
hospitalizations but after an endoscopy at an OSH he remained
without further bleeding for 48 hours before his [**Hospital1 18**]
admission. During the [**Hospital1 18**] admission he had a nonbleeding
duodenal [**Hospital1 **] clipped and another shallow, nonbleeding [**Hospital1 **]
monitored; he required no blood transfusions. He was sent to
[**Hospital3 **] rehab, found to have continued bleeding with 1-2
loose black stools/day and was sent to [**Hospital6 **]
(hospitalization was [**11-8**]/-[**11-17**]). Initially, his primary issue
was some respiratory distress for which he had an ultrasound
guided right sided thoracentesis with removal of 600 cc of
serious fluid. This improved his dyspnea but he has continued to
have issues with unstable blood volume and chronic blood loss.
He was transfused to 9.1 on [**11-12**] but then dropped back to 7.5
by [**11-14**]. He had an EGD on [**11-14**], which revealed a
posterior dudodenal [**Month/Year (2) **] with visible vessel and active
bleeding that was secured with clip, BiCap cautery, and
epinephrine injection. He also had diffuse erosive gastropathy
noted. Presumably, he was transfused again on [**11-14**] to a Hgb of
10 that had fell to 8.6 today on [**11-17**]. Thus, he was transfused
a unit on [**2131-11-17**] before being transferred here for continued
care. Overall he recieved 5U PRBC at [**Hospital3 **].
.
On arrival to the floor he was found to have stable VS,denied
any chest pain, worsened dyspnea from his baseline, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, constipation, syncope,
presyncope, fevers, chills, night sweats or other acute issues.
He reported he felt well but was frustrated with the continued
issues relating to this bleed and was asymptomatic with a HCT of
33.6 decreased to 28.5 this am. He continues to have black tarry
stools. A rectal this am showed brown stool in the vault, which
was guiac positive.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-11-20**]: X-ray Wrist Right.
1. There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.

2. There is deformity of the fifth metacarpal suggesting an old
healed
fracture.

3. There is joint space narrowing and there are large dorsal
osteophytes at
the fifth carpal/metacarpal joint.

PICC line placement.

One view. Comparison with the previous study of [**2131-11-4**].
Streaky density at
the lung bases and bilateral pleural thickening and/or fluid are
again
demonstrated. There is a calcified pleural plaque at the right
base as
before. The patient is status post median sternotomy as
demonstrated
previously and mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right
internal jugular
catheter has been replaced. The new catheter terminates at the
level of the
cavoatrial junction or right atrium. There is no other
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment. The patient presented with recurrence
of his GI bleed. This has been a difficult to control issue over
the last months. Most recent EGD revealed discrete duodenal
ulcers with visible vessel and persistent bleeding as well as
oozing gastritis. He has had multiple attempts to achieve
permanent hemostasis of the [**Month/Day/Year **] that have likely been made
more problem[**Name (NI) 115**] by his continued steroid use. An endoscopy on
[**2131-11-19**] showed a 25mm duodenal [**Date Range **] with visible vessels and
this was clipped and cauterized. The patient continued however
to have melanotic stools and required additional blood
transfusions although his vital signs were stable and he was
asymptomatic throughout. A repeat endoscopy on [**2131-11-23**]  showed
active bleeding with blood clots at the previously clipped
single bleeding [**Date Range **] in the pylorus channel. He was maintained
on a PPI drip initially, and then transitioned to a [**Hospital1 **] oral PPI
post endoscopy. His prednisone which he was taking for his
pulmonary disease were tapered back to his baseline 10mg daily.
Given the refractoriness of his ulcers to endoscopic
intervention, he was transferred to the surgical service for
surgical intervention. On [**2131-11-24**], the patient underwent an
exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal [**Date Range **] with biopsy,
vagotomy and J-tube placement.
The surgery went well without complication (reader referred to
the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay
in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the SICU intubated
secondary to his lung disease, NPO, on IV fluids and
antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and on propofol/fentanyl for
pain control. He was extubated and tube feeds were started. The
patient continued to do well and was transfered to the floor.
The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received roxicet with good effect and
adequate pain control.

CV: Postoperatively, the patient remained stable from a
cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
He presented with diffuse edema and anasar
