Admission Date:  [**2176-9-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-10-4**]

Date of Birth:                Sex:  M

Service:  ORTHOPEDIC

The patient was initially on the Service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1022**] of
Orthopedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] is a 50 year old
male with a past history significant for hepatitis C,
depression, childhood asthma, chronic low back pain status
post fall to the low back three months prior to admission,
anxiety, history of suicide attempt times two with last in
[**2176-7-10**], status post penile implant, and status post
left rotator cuff in [**2173**].  The patient was admitted to the
hospital under the Orthopedics Service and taken to the
Operating Room on [**2176-9-26**], where the patient underwent
uncomplicated L5-S1 decompression/fusion with right ICBG
placement for noted lumbar spondyloses.

The patient initially tolerated the procedure well without
complication.  The patient was transferred to the Floor on
[**2176-9-27**].  The patient was noted to exhibit increasing
confusion.  The patient's epidural catheter was discontinued
on postoperative day number one and the patient was started
on PCA pain control.

On [**2176-9-28**], postoperative day number two, the Orthopedics
Service notes the patient increasingly confused and now
agitated.  Psychiatry is consulted.  Conclusions of
Psychiatry consult are the following:  History and
presentation of agitation, somnolence and disorientation
consistent with delirium, although patient has denied recent
alcohol use, his past history would strongly suggest alcohol
withdrawal.  Psychiatry Service suggests alcohol withdrawal
prophylaxis with Ativan, continuation with one-to-one sitter
for patient's safety.

On [**2176-9-29**], the patient was noted to be increasingly
agitated, fever of 100.5 F., is noted; tachycardia to 110
beats per minute noted.  Orthopedics Service continuing with
alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis, Ativan and normal saline drip
for decreased sodium and chloride in the likely setting of
volume depletion.

On [**2176-9-30**], Orthopedics Service is called to see patient
for increasing tachypnea, tachycardia and general agitation.
A fever is noted at 101.3 F.; heart rate between 110s and
120s.  EKG is notable for sinus tachycardia.  A portable
chest x-ray is notable for poor inspiration.  Left lateral
lung parenchymal margin not captured; patchy asymmetric
vascular congestion, greatest in right middle lobe.  Right
upper lobe and left lower lobe with hilar fullness.  Cannot
rule out right middle lobe infiltrate with normal cardiac
silhouette.

On [**2176-9-30**], postoperative day number four, a Medical
consultation is obtained for the above symptomatology.
Recommendations are to discontinue intravenous fluid in
likely setting of volume overload, position the patient
upright, cycle CK and troponin to rule out myocardial
infarction in the setting of congestive heart failure.  Begin
Levaquin 500 intravenously q. day as treatment for likely
pneumonic process.  Recommending CT angiogram to rule out
pulmonary embolism in the setting of immobility and recent
surgery.

On [**2176-9-30**], the Medical Service accepted the patient from
the Orthopedic Service for further treatment for complicating
issues.

On [**2176-9-30**], while in the service of the Medical Team, the
patient underwent CT angio of the chest to rule out pulmonary
embolism which was noted as negative.  Mental status change
continued in the setting of delirium; alcohol withdrawal was
suspected.  Haldol for p.r.n. agitation was continued while
QTC interval was monitored.  Antibiotic regimen was changed
from Levaquin to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for possible
aspiration pneumonia coverage.

On [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, medical
cross-coverage was called to see the patient for increasing
respiratory rate from 34 to 50 per minute and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, now notable to be unresponsive to sternal rub or
painful stimuli.  On physical examination, it was noted the
patient's pupils were fixed and dilated with only minimal to
sluggish responsiveness.

Chest x-ray was noted for increasing right middle lobe
infiltrate and right middle lobe opacity.  On [**2176-10-1**], in
the morning, at around 09:15, an Anesthesia Code was called.

Anesthesia Team responded to the bed of Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] and noted
unresponsiveness and agonal breathing.  The patient was
intubated successfully with the use of Atonomate 10 mg,
succinyl choline 100 mg.  A MAC 3 blade was used without
complications and an 8.0 endotracheal tube was used.  Good
breath sounds were noted bilaterally and a right femoral vein
line was inserted at that time.

On [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, the patient was
transferred to the Service of the Medical Intensive Care
Unit-[**Location (un) **] Team.  Initial thoughts on accepting the patient
Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] by the Medical Intensive Care Unit Team:  From a
respiratory standpoint the patient demonstrated a large
pneumonic process on chest x-ray with [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
necessitating intubation.  The plan was for pressure support,
ventilation, and treatment with Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin,
Flagyl and aggressive pulmonary toilet.

From a neurological standpoint, differential included alcohol
withdrawal versus metabolic versus infectious, although the
patient had denied alcohol use since [**2176-2-8**].  From a
neurological standpoint, head CT scan the prior evening on
[**2176-9-30**], was noted as negative for acute process.

On [**2176-10-1**], the patient was procedurized with a right
radial arterial line and a left subclavian Cordis
PA-catheter, both without complications.  Initial readings of
PA-pressure are 25/10, wedge was 5.  The patient was noted to
have a fever of 108.0??????F.  Aggressive use of ice packs and
cooling blankets were utilized.  Surgery was consulted which,
on [**2176-10-1**], placed a right chest tube, #36 French, without
complication with infusion of one liter of cold sterile
water.

On [**2176-10-2**], the patient was noted to be hyperthermic to a
temperature maximum of 108.0 F., despite cooling blankets, OT
lavage and placement of chest tube.  Dantrolene was given,
100 mg intravenously times one for fear of malignant
hyperthermia secondary to succinyl choline versus Haldol use.
Arterial blood gas notable for severe acidosis.  Started on a
bicarbonate drip.  The patient was noted to be persistently
hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and
continuing use of Neo-Synephrine, Levophed and vasopressin
drips.

Acute renal failure was noted to be worsening on [**2176-10-2**].
The Renal Service was consulted which noted a rise in CK to
initially 13,500.  Renal dysfunction thought secondary to
hypoperfusion/rhabdomyolysis.  Urine output was noted to be
minimal.  As such, Renal Service proceeded with CVVH
treatments via left femoral Quinton placement without
complications.

On [**2176-10-3**], it was noted that the patient's CPK levels
were 49,305, consistent with a picture of rhabdomyolysis.
BUN and creatinine indicating worsening renal function.
Lactate worsening to 11.3.  The patient was started on CVA
with citrate anti-coagulation on [**2176-10-3**].  Temperature
maximum noted on [**2176-10-3**], was 102.0??????F.

On [**2176-10-3**], postoperative day number seven, in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient's white count was noted to
be 33.1 despite aggressive antibiotic therapy including
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for question
of central nervous system process.

On [**2176-10-4**], at 01:15 a.m., Medical Intensive Care Unit
cross cover intern was called to see patient for lack of
respirations.  On examination, the patient did not respond to
verbal or noxious stimuli.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.
There were no peripheral pulses.  Auscultation of the chest
for two minutes revealed no breath sounds and no heart
sounds.  The patient was pronounced dead at 12:55 a.m. on
[**2176-10-4**].
