EKG [**9-12**] 1Low atrial rhythm, likely sinus with atrial premature
beat. Diffuse T wave
flattening. No significant difference compared with prior
tracing.

SUN [**2163-9-11**] 3:08 PM
PFI: Left PICC tip is not clearly visualized. The tip can be
followed to the
brachiocephalic confluence. The lungs are clear. There is no
pneumothorax or
pleural effusion. Cardiac size is top normal.
ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
Stress test: [**2163-9-12**]
 1. Normal myocardial perfusion, apart from the inferior wall
which
could not be assessed. Reimaging was not performed due to
concerning EKG
changes. 2. Normal LV cavity size and systolic function (EF
74%).
CT abd/pelvis [**9-12**] 08
1. No evidence of solid organ injury.

2. Porcelain gallbladder.

3. Right femoral fracture, previously described on recent pelvic
CT.
U/scarotids [**9-9**]
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is a heterogeneous plaque with heavy
calcification in the
proximal ICA. There is minimal flow seen in the right ICA with a
peak
velocity of 17 and end-diastolic velocity of 0. CCA and ECA are
patent with
peak velocities of 44 and 147 cm/s respectively. This is
consistent with
near-occlusive stenosis or recanalization.

On the left there is mild plaque in the proximal ICA. Peak
velocities are
103, 81 and 172 cm/s in the ICA, CCA and ECA respectively. This
is consistent
with less than 40% stenosis.
CTA [**2163-9-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its distal
branches. Some
of the vessels demonstrate a focal noncalcified occlusion but
with
reconstitution of collaterals distally.Please refer to the body
of the report
2. Calcified gallbladder stone versus porcelin gallbladder. A CT
abdomen
non-contrast or ultrasound examination is recommended.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The report has been placed on the radiology dashboard for it to
be relayed to
the referring doctor.
