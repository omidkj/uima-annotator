Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 77154**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD.  Push enteroscopy.  Endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
51yoM with h/o heavy Etoh use and [**2199**] craniotomy for left
subdural due to fall +/- seizure in the setting of drunkeness,
transfered from [**Location (un) **] for GIB and anemia. History is pieced
together from records, pt not good historian. He was reportedly
found down today at home (unwitnessed, unclear how long down).
Brought to [**Location (un) **] with Hct 13.8, ETOH 460, INR of 2.2, ammonia
of 100. He may have had guiaic positive yellow/brown stool there
per the ED dash.  CT head with 3mm hyperdensity L
fontal/parietal, ? new blood vs changes from old SDH at same
site.  Placed 20G IV there. BPs were stable en route to [**Hospital1 **] with
SBP 100, HR 90.
.
Upon arrival, SBPs 80-90. Cordis placed in right IJ. Patient
states that he had been in a fight earlier in the week -- his
daughter's boyfriend may have punched him in the eye, unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was noted to be jaundiced with severe anasarca. He was guiaic
negative with no stool in the vault on signout.
.
In ED, initial VS 97.4, 103, 98/44, 16, 100/2L.
Labs in ED showed:
WBC 13.2, N 79.9, Hct 14.2, Platelets 168. INR 1.7, PTT 39.5.
UA with few bact, 5 WBC, elevated glucose, protein, ketone.
Trop 0.01, creatinine 0.9.
ALT 40, AP 226, TB 8.6, DB 6.7, Alb 2.3, Lipase 88.
.
Multiple images showed chronic fractures per ED. CT chest with
contrast with sternal mid body fracture without hematoma new
since [**2198**], right 11th posterior rib deformity likely subacute
with more chronic rib deformities in right 8.9 ribs, trace b/l
pleural effusions vs subpleural fat, anasarca, ascites. CT
C-spine without acute fracture. CT head with b/l subdural
hematomas measuring 3mm in max diameter without shift. CT abd
and pelvis with small b/l pleural effusions and adjacent
atelectasis, free fluid without hemoperitoneum, mild anasarca,
subacute Right post 11th rib fracture.  CXR with chronic sternal
fracture and rib fractures.
.
Peritoneal fluid with 12 WBC, 246 RBC, 12 poly, protein 0.9, Glu
171. Cultures were sent of the peritoneal fluid.
.
Most concerning, was a L parietal/temporal hemorrhage which is
not apparently new. Seen by neurosurgery but nothing to do. GI
wants NG lavage but ED team feels hesitant doing it down in ED.
.
He received Octreotide 0.6mg, Zofran, Vitamin K 10mg IV X 1,
Morphine 4mg, Lactulose 45 mg PO x1, Neomycin 3gm PO x1, 1g IV
Ceftriaxone. On Octreotide and Protonix gtts now. He was
transfused 4u PRBC's, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, and 2.5 L NS.
.
VS on tranfer were, 85, 98/44 -> 106/85, 16, on NC.  He was
getting either his third or fourth U of PRBC. Twin brother will
be in on Saturday.
.
ROS: He states he's had 6 months of BRBPR (last episode a long
time ago) and melena (last episode 1 mo ago) and no other blood
loss otherwise. Increased abdominal distention for the past [**1-6**]
months. Endorses PND and orthopnea, SOB. Negative for f/c/ns,
CP, abd pain, dizziness/LH. He has been drinking everyday, pints
of vodka. States last episode of hematemesis was 8 months ago at
which point he was "operated on" and [**Location (un) **] and had to have his
stomach pumped -- again poor history.

Past Medical History:
- History of heavy etoh use (1 quart vodka daily)
- S/p craniotomy in [**2199**] for L SDH with shift, at that time
noted chronic bilateral subdurals as well
- GERD
- depression

Social History:
Smoked from 8 yrs old until [**5-13**] yrs ago; heavy ETOH use - 1
quart vodka/daily, lives with wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77153**] ([**Doctor Last Name 1356**]). Has 22
yo daughter, no IVDU or drug use now.

Family History:
M - EtOH
F - deceased at 87yo


Physical Exam:
97   p94 - 105  108/50 (105-124)   15  94% 4LNC
Very large and obviously jaundiced and distended M in no
distress, smells of EtOH. Conversant but slow speech, not
slurred.
Bilateral eyes with purulent crust in eyes, scleral edema, and
scleral icterus
Mouth dry but no obvious lesions, did not open mouth very wide,
unable to assess OP
CTAB anteriorly without w/c/r/r
Low grade tachycardia but regular, no m/g
Abd grossly distended and slightly tight, +caput medusae
Gross anasarca along abdominal wall, BUE's and BLE's
CN 2-12 grossly intact, no focal neuro deficit noted


Pertinent Results:
OSH labs: WBC 16.5, Hct 13.8, Plts 176
Ammonia 102, BUN/Cr 18/0.8, Tbili 9.1, AST 151, ALT 36, Lipase
79, AlkP 218, CK 278, MB 4.3, INR 2.2, Tylenol negative, EtOH
468
.
EKG: NSR at 101, normal QRS axis, normal P waves, sub 1-mm STD's
in V4-6, diffusely smaller complexes in comparison to prior EKG.


CT Abd/Pelvis:  [**2203-5-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral trace pleural effusions versus pleural fat with
adjacent
compressive atelectasis.
2. Simple free fluid (ascites) noted within the abdomen with no
hemoperitoneum.

CT Head [**5-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral subacute to chronic subdural hematomas.
2. Enlarged right parotid gland; correlate with clinical
examination and
history. There is suggestion on prior exams, this may be
chronic.

CT C-spine [**5-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture identified.
2. There appears to be obliteration of much of the [**Last Name (un) **] and
oropharynx upto
the level of the epiglottis which may reflect external
compression versus
material within the pharynx (3;11). Beyond the epiglottis the
airway is
patent.
Recommend clinical correlation and examination. Findings
discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at 3;40am on [**2203-5-19**] via telephone.

CT Chest [**5-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Eleventh posterior right rib deformity consistent with
subacute fracture.
Additional more chronic-appearing fractures are noted along the
right eighth
and ninth ribs.
2. Lucency through the sternal body with no significant
surrounding hematoma
may represent a sternal fracture of indeterminate chronicity,
correlate
clinically.
3. Bilateral trace pleural effusions versus pleural fat with
adjacent
compressive atelectasis.

RUQ/Abdominal US [**5-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate amount of ascites seen within the abdomen.
Very
echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. The degree
of
echogenicity severely limits the ability to visualize the liver.
Patent left
portal vein. The remainder of the exam is virtually
nondiagnostic as
ultrasound is unable to visualize the patient's anatomy due to
the body
habitus.

TTE [**5-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ US ([**5-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis of the liver. Hepatofugal flow in the main and left
portal vein
(through periumbilical vein) suggests portal hypertension.
Stable mild
splenomegaly.

2. Mildly distended gallbladder, without evidence of
cholelithiasis or
son[**Name (NI) 493**] signs specific for cholecystitis.

3. Moderate amount of ascites. The above findings were discussed
with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3419**] at 12:50 p.m. on [**2203-5-28**].

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**5-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe consolidation. While the imaging appearance
is most
consistent with atelectasis, the location is somewhat unusual,
and the airways
appear patent. Thus, it is difficult to defi
