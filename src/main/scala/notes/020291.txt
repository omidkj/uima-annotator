Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation now status post extubation

History of Present Illness:
78yo man with history of HTN, Parkinsons disease, dementia was
sent in from his nursing home with altered mental status. He was
found to be hypoxic at the nursing home and less responsive than
usual. He is typically minimally verbal per report from a nurse
at his nursing facility. He was intubated for airway protection
as he was minimally responsive on arrival and sent to the MICU.
His oxygen saturation at that time was 90% on NRB. He received
Narcan without effect. CT of his head demonstrated evidence of
subacute and chronic ischemic strokes. During his MICU stay, he
was seen by the Neurology consult team. EEG was without seizure
activity. MRI did not demonstrate any acute abnormalities. He
remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
.
Regarding his hypoxemia, he did not have any clear infiltrates
on chest film. He had a CTA done to rule out PE. This showed a
left lower lobe infiltrate, but no evidence of PE. His initial
labs were notable for Hct of 30 with no prior for comparison, UA
with no evidence for infection, chemistry with normal anion gap
and lactate of 1.9. Urine and blood cx were sent. CK and MB were
normal (no initial troponin sent). Serum tox screen was sent.
Also got 2.5L NS.
.
According to staff at his nursing facility, he is severely
demented and minimally functional at baseline. He was eating
breakfast the day of admission per history elicited by Neurology
and was noted to be altered and less responsive by staff. He did
not have any focal weakness or aphasia at that time. Vital signs
were checked, and he was found to be hypoxic. He had his usual
level of home oxygen off (commonly done during meals), but he
was more hypoxic than is typical for him in this setting. He was
assisted back to bed and then checked on several times over the
next hour. Finally, EMS was called as he was persistently
minimally responsive.

.
Imaging:
Chest xray ([**2-26**]): 1. No definite parenchymal consolidations,
however, faint opacities are identified within the right and
left lower lobes which may represent early pneumonia (possibly
aspiration) or simply be an overlap of vascular structures.
Followup radiographs are recommended.
2. Appropriate positioning of endotracheal tube with side port
of nasogastric tube likely at GE junction. Advancement is
recommended.
.
CT head ([**2-26**]): FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is sulcal and ventricular prominence to generalized brain
atrophy. There is an area of encephalomalacia within the
periventricular white matter in the region of the left caudate
head. This represents a small chronic infarct. There is a late
subacute infarct in the left temporal lobe. There is no definite
hydrocephalus. The lateral ventricles are likely delineated due
to generalized brain atrophy. Please correlate clinically as to
the possibility of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
There is opacification of the paranasal sinuses as the patient
is intubated. IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Subacute
left temporal lobe infarct and a chronic left deep white matter
infarct.
.
CTA ([**2-26**]): 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism is seen. 2. Area
of parenchymal consolidation within the left lower lobe that
most likely represents pneumonia/aspiration. Please correlate
clinically.
.
EEG ([**2-26**]):  This was an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow and

disorganized background, suggestive of a moderate
encephalopathy.
Infection, toxic/metabolic disturbances, medication effects and
anoxia
are among the most common causes. Multifocal slowing seen
suggests
subcortical dysfunction. Superimposed beta activity seen is most
likely
due to medication such as benzodiazpines or barbituates. No
epileptiform
discharges or seizures were seen.
.
MRI/MRA head ([**2-27**]): Moderate ventriculomegaly including
dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles and prominence of
temporal horns which in proper clinical setting could be due to
normal pressure hydrocephalus. Alternatively, this could be due
to brain and medial temporal atrophy. Chronic lacune left basal
ganglia with chronic blood products. No enhancing lesions or
mass effect seen. No evidence of acute infarct. Normal MRA of
head.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2-29**]): 1. Massively dilated sigmoid colon
that contains inspissated fecal material. This appearance is
concerning for fecal impaction. There is also proximal
dilatation of large bowel loops. No obstructing lesions are
seen. 2. Mild enlargement of intra- and extra-hepatic bile
ducts. 3. 22-mm cystic lesion within the pancreatic head that is
most worrisome for intrapancreatic mucinous neoplasm. 4.
Multiple hypodense lesions within both kidneys that most likely
represent cysts; however, at least two lesions in the mid pole
of the right kidney do not have the appearance of simple cysts.
This area can be further followed up if clinically indicated. 5.
Consolidated area within left lower lobe that is supplied by a
branch from the aorta. The appearance is consistent with
sequestration.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with h/o Parkinsons Disease, dementia, and HTN admitted
after being found unresponsive and found to have pneumonia,
initially intubated for airway protection now extubated and
doing well on room air.
.
# Encephalopathy/change in mental status: It is unclear if the
patient is now far from his baseline though reportedly he does
speak a few words. It is conceivable that he was less responsive
during his hypoxic episode. He was treated for (aspiration)
pneumonia with resolution.  MRI was normal and EEG did not show
any seizure activity. LFTs were WNL and tox screen was negative.
TSH was elevated but free t4 normal so no thyroid replacement.
B12/folate WNL. Neurology consulted and recommended continuing
with medical regimen.  Question of normal pressure hydrocephalus
on CT (Prior films were not available for comparison so
chronicity unknown) but pe
