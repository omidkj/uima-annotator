Brief Hospital Course:
On the floor, she got progressively more somnelent.  ABG was
done: 7.26, 106, 81 on NC.  She was then transferred to the MICU
for BIPAP.
.
[**Hospital 12145**] Hospital Course [**0-0-**]
.
In the MICU, the patient was weaned from BIPAP to 4LNC and her
pCO2 trended down to 85.  She was then weaned to 1LNC and
tolerated the transition well, with a O2 sat goal of 88-93%, and
a pCO2 of 60-69.  She also seemed to have volume overload on
initial presentation which further contributed to her
respiratory decline; on initial CXR, she had bilateral pleural
effusions.  During her overnight stay in the MICU, she continued
to diurese, with a goal of -500 today.  She admitted to Lasix
noncompliance, exhibited bilateral rales and peripheral edema on
physical exam, and her BNP was elevated to 9800--all pointing to
signs of CHF.
.
Additionally, ED blood cultures grew gram positive cocci, but
speciated as group B strep in one bottle and Viridans
Streptococci in 2 other bottles.  This was felt to be
contamination from her femoral line, as repeat cultures drawn
peripherally remained negative and she remained afebrile and
without leucocytosis throughout the hospitalization. She did
received several days of Ancef, but was discontinued prior to
discharge.
.
Urine cultures--+MRSA and proteus. Since MRSA in the urine
usually comes from the blood and given no MRSA in blood, likely
a contaminant. Noted difficulty obtaining a clean catch due to
body habitus. Urinalysis and urine culture were repeated prior
to discharge. Patient refused nasal and rectal swab to test for
MRSA. Suggested that she could get these tests whenever she felt
the time was right.
.
# AFIB: She is rate controlled with Toprol XL and on coumadin
for anticoagulation at home.  In the ED, RVR to 140's but
controlled with IV dilt. Diltiazem was discontinued prior to
discharge. Rate controlled on metoprolol.
.
# CHF: Probably diastolic dysfucntion with EF 55%, on lasix at
home.  1+ MR.  She had crackles on both lungs and peripheral
edema.  BNP 9800.  She also was not compliant with her lasix.
CXR with bilateral pulm edema. Was diuresed, and placed back on
home furosemide dose prior to discharge.
.
# HTN: At home, she takes metoprolol and lisinopril.  She was
hypertensive in the ED to the SBP 170's but became normotensive
on the floor with reinstituation of her home medications.
.
# ANXIETY: She takes citalopram at home, which was continued.
