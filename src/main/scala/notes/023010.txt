morning in the left upper quadrant. He also had a smaller
stab wound in the left back close to the posterior axillary
line. He was hemodynamically unstable with a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s. However, the abdomen was soft. He was
intubated in the emergency room. A chest film showed no
evidence of pneumothorax. The abdominal wound was a few

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
25 year old man with stabbing
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? iuncrease in pnx
HISTORY: Pneumothorax.

Single portable radiograph of the chest is submitted. The left
lateral hemithorax is excluded. ET tube is 1 cm. above the
carina. The remaining visualized portions of the support lines
are unchanged compared with the chest radiograph obtained six
hours prior. No pneumothorax is identified. Trachea is midline.
Increased airspace opacities involving the bilateral lungs,
particularly in the right hilar region and along the course of
the left-sided chest tube, remain similar in appearance. The
lung volumes are low.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

DIAGNOSIS:



I. Stomach, partial gastrectomy(A):

Segment of stomach with gross defect and focal acute hemorrhage.


II. Proximal jejunum, resection (B-D):

Segment of small bowel with gross defects and focal acute
hemorrhage.

Clinical:  Stab wound chest and abdomen.
Gross:



The specimen is received fresh in two parts, both labeled with
"[**Doctor First Name 2491**] Eu Critical" and the medical record number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled "stomach" and consists of a
segment of tan-pink mucosa measuring 3.8 x 2.7 x 0.5 cm. There
is a hemorrhagic linear defect in the specimen which measures
1.4 cm in length. The specimen is represented in A with sections
including the linear defect.



Part 2 is additionally labeled "proximal jejunum" and consists
of a single tan pink segment of small bowel measuring 2.8 cm in
length x 2 cm in diameter. There are stapled margins present at
both ends of the specimen. The specimen is unoriented. On the
serosal surface are two bulging full thickness defects with
surrounding serosal hemorrhage. The specimen is opened to reveal
tan pink mucosa with the two linear defects noted on the serosal
surface. The specimen is represented as follows: B = shave of
one margin, C = shave of the opposite margin, D = sections of
linear defect.
