Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Bronchopleural Fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-9-25**] Rigid bronchoscopy using Dumon black bronchoscope.
Flexible bronchoscopy, Placement of covered metal stent [**95**] x 40

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 84248**] is a 70 year old man with a history of non-small cell
lung CA s/p R thoractomy with en bloc wedge resection in [**2184**],
who, on [**2189-7-28**] at [**Hospital6 8432**] Center, underwent left
thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy with wedge resection of left
lower lobe for two new lung lesions identified on surveillence
CT
chest in [**5-28**].  Post-operatively, the patient remained intubated
and had a mild elevation in his troponins which later trended
down.  He underwent tracheostomy on [**2189-8-11**] and G-tube
placement.
He subsequently developed ventilator associated PNA (MSSA and
enterobacter) and has been treated with Zosyn and remained
ventilaor dependant. He eventualy recovered well but had a had a
persistant air leak  and on his discharge to a [**Hospital 5442**] rehab
([**Hospital1 **]) his chest tube remained in place. The chest tube then
fell out at rehab and he was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **]
Medical Center for replacement and managament of the chest tube.
He underwent bronchoscopy and it was thought he had a
bronchopleural fistula.  He was planned to undergo a Eloesser
procedure, but was felt to be too high risk and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy and possible endobronchial glue to
treat likely bronchopleural fistula. Has been afebrile at [**Hospital3 84249**], WBC normalized. last BM today. Was complaining of
LLQ pain during admission, underwent Abd CT [**9-19**] that was
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to SICU on [**2189-9-24**] and had CT Chest done which
demonstrated the following.

CT Chest with Contrast ([**2189-9-24**]):
1. Likely bronchopleural fistula from the left upper lobe stump.

2. Ground-glass opacification, peribronchial consolidation and
pleural
effusion, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia and mild
pulmonary edema.
3. Enlarged hyperdense paratracheal nodes that may relate to
patient's
diagnosis of NSCLC or be reactive.
4. Severe emphysema.
5. Pattern of interstitial disease suggestive of usual
interstitial pneumonia
which may be secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
collagen vascular
disease, or drug reaction.
6. Lung loculated effusion on the left with apparenelty
thickened consistent
with intection/inflammation.
7. Aortic and mild coronary artery calcification.
8. Defects the ribs on the right may be due to respiratory
motion or
fractures. Correlate clinically.

Patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement on
[**2189-9-25**].  Plans were made to transfer him back to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1727**]
Medical Center for further surgical treatment ([**Last Name (un) 72968**]
procedure) with his thoracic surgeon there.  After communication
with his thoracic surgeon it was determined that they were
unable to provide him with [**Location (un) **] transportation to his
facility.  Plans were then made to transfer to him back to
[**Hospital **] Rehab with follow-up with his thoracic surgeon in [**State 1727**].
