History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36038**] is a 49F with PMH of GERD s/p Nissen fundoplication x
2 ([**2118**]), Factor V Leiden, HTN, depression, and chronic
abdominal pain (since [**2118**]) presenting with recurrence of her
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and inability to tolerate
PO's. These symptoms had been well controlled over the last two
years but recurred in late [**2132-12-23**]. She says that she is
nauseous all day and vomits about 2-3 times/week. She localizes
her pain to her epigastrium and says that it radiates throughout
her entire abdomen. She says that it worsens slightly with
eating, but identifies no other precipitating or palliating
factors. She states that she has been regurgitating all her
food, and that it comes up undigested.

For these symptoms, she went to her GI doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77510**] on
[**2133-1-27**], and UGI series and manometry were normal at that time,
making mechanical obstruction unlikely. She was thought to have
functional bowel disease. In the middle of [**Month (only) 404**], she had to
be hospitalized at [**Hospital 1774**] Hospital for dehydration, and EGD at
that time was normal. She had her Protonix increased to 40mg
[**Hospital1 **], and was started on Buspirone and Pepcid. Her symptoms did
not improve, and she continued to vomit with any PO intake. On
[**3-12**], she called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was told to present to the
emergency room.

In the emergency room the patient's vitals were T 97.8 HR 88 BP
136/75 RR 18 O2 sat 100. Labs in the ED were WBC 8.7/HCT
39.8/Plt 341. Lytes were WNL. She received Zofran 4mg and
Dilaudid 0.5 mg with no relief. She was admitted for workup of
her abdominal pain, as well as pre-treatment for known contrast
allergy before her scheduled inpatient CT scan. Given her
possible iodine allergy, she was pre-medicated with Prednisone
40mg PO 16, 8, and 2 hours prior to her exam. In addition,
Cimetidine 300mg and Benadryl 50mg were given 1 hour prior to
exam.

Following her CT scan, the patient developed diffuse urticaria
(over arms, chest, back, face), cough, and subjective SOB. She
remained hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and non hypoxic. She
was given IV solumedrol and famotidine and was transferred to
the ICU. In the ICU, she was treated with IV solumedrol q6h and
H2 blocker for her contrast allergy. She was also given ISS
while on steroids. For her abdominal pain, she was treated
symptomatically with zofran, dilaudid, and miralax. In addition,
her PPI, pepcid, and buspirone were continued. During her ICU
course, her vitals were 96.2 to 97.3, 76-109, 95-143/47-78,
[**11-11**], and 93% on RA. Labs in the ICU were WBC 10.9/RBC 33.2/Plt
311. Lytes were WNL except for glucose (181). LFTs and
amylase/lipase were WNL.+

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 49 year old woman who presented with chronic symptoms
(since [**2132-12-23**]) of epigastric abdominal pain,
persistent nausea, food regurgitation immediately after eating,
and weight loss. She has history of severe constipation
following her Nissen fundoplication that was attributed to
colonic inertia. The differential diagnosis for her upper GI
symptoms were esophageal obstruction, esophageal motility
disorder, Zenker's diverticulum, a disease process related to
her fundoplication (nerve damage or compression), gastroparesis,
rumination syndrome, and psychiatric causes. She has had
extensive workup in the past by GI for her symptoms, and thus
far, all studies have been negative including EGD, UGI series,
manometry,and CT abdomen. During this hospitalization, she had a
repeat UGI series, which was normal, and EGD which was also
normal. She had a gastric emptying study that showed delayed
gastric emptying. She, however, was receiving Dilaudid before
and during the study, which may have affected the results. Her
symptoms of immediate vomiting after eating and nausea despite
being NPO for a weak were inconsistent with gastroparesis.
However, we treated her with IV and then PO Reglan as she may
have significant GI motility disorder with severe constipation
and the above mentioned upper GI symptoms. For her severe
constipation, she was continued on a bowel regimen with Colace,
Senna, MiraLax, and Dulcolax with no problems. Rumination
syndrome seemed unlikely as she had 2 inconsistent features:
persistent nausea and abdominal pain. However, she exhibited
depressive syndrome and indifference to her GI illness. A
psychiatric component may potentially aggravate her symptoms.
She was discharged with GI follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **]. Total
discharge time 35 minutes.

Of note she had allergic reaction with hives and subjective SOB
after IV contrast administration for the CT abdomen on [**2133-3-13**].
She was treated with IV Solu-Medrol in ED/ICU and then oral
steroids with complete recovery.
