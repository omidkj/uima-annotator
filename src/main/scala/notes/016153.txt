Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
57M with PMH of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, systolic +
diastolic CHF, CAD h/o MI, COPD on 4L home O2, 4 prior
intubations for pneumonia, p/w less than 24 hours of shortness
of breath.  He was recently admitted from 7/21-27/10 for
shortness of breath and was treated for a CHF exacerbation.  His
lasix 160 mg TID was changed to torsemide 100 mg QD and
spironolactine 12.5 mg QD, under the direction of his
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**].  Echo was stable (or even improved
MR) compared to prior; EF 30%.  His captopril was also increased
from 12.5 TID to 50 mg TID.  He reports that in the past he had
taken as much as 100 mg TID.
.
He reports SOB started yesterday evening after doing well for
several days at home after discharge.  His symptoms were helped
somewhat with use of BIPAP overnight.  He says his O2 req now is
6L from 4L.  He denies cough, F/C, chets pain, N/V, and change
in BMs. He says he has been taking torsemide 100 mg and
spironolactone 12.5 mg QD since discharge, and has been strict
with his diet.  He does report high diastolic BP above 90-110,
which is suboptimal.
.
On initial interview at admission, his cardiac review of
symptoms is positive for [**4-2**] pillow orthopnea, SOB, DOE with 30
feet walking and less than 12 stairs, and generalized fatigue.
.
In the ED, VS were T 98.1, BP 140/71, HR 91, RR 28, 100% on 6L
NC.  He was given vancomycin 1 g x 1 and levofloxacin 750 mg IV
x 1.  He did not yet receive lasix in the ED.  EKG showed AFib,
HR 89, poor R wave progression, no ST changes.

[**2201-8-28**] ADMISSION CXR: no read yet.  opacity on right; c/w
volume overload vs. PNA

[**2201-8-24**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation
of apical setments. (LVEF = 30%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-8-20**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are slightly reduced. Biventricular
cavity sizes and systolic function are similar.

CT head: [**2201-9-6**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or
masses. There
is no shift of midline structures. Ventricles and sulci are
slightly
prominent, could be due to atrophy.

Visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are within normal limits. Osseous structures appear
normal.

IMPRESSION: Normal study.
.
Abd US: [**2201-9-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No gallstones and no biliary dilatation. Mild hepatomegally.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Small simple right renal cyst.
.
EKG on [**2201-9-6**] demonstrated atrial fibrillation with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2201-8-28**].
.
