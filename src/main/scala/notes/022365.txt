Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left sided subdural hematoma drainage

History of Present Illness:
From admission note:

Pt is a 80-yo female resident of [**Location 6682**] House Rehab with PMHx
sig. for ESRD on HD, h/o CVAs, SDH s/p fall in [**9-25**], recent
coag-neg Staph bacteremia (completed 14 day course of vanc in
[**1-26**]) who presents with 2 days of sig. neurological
deterioration, including R sided weakness, loss of ability to
ambulate or comb her hair, L facial droop, and dysarthria. Pt is
unable to provide a history. Per Neuro note, at 8:15 PM, pt was
noted to have slurred speech and left facial droop. Pt has
baseline R > L sided weakness from SDH. She had denied HA,
vision changes, cough, diarrhea, and fever/chills.

Pt was recently admitted for anemia. Work-up was only sig. for
anemia of chronic disease. Her EPO dose was increased. Of note,
pt had hypoactive delirium during her hospitalization. Metabolic
w/u at the time was neg. EEG showed mild to mod encephalopathy
but no evidence of seizure activity. Serial CT scans showed
stable subdural hematomas. With discontinuation of dilantin and
keppra, her symptoms resolved within 2 days.

In the ED, VS were: Temp 100.2 (Tmax 100.4), HR 60s-70s, BP
150/70, SaO2 97% RA. Code Stroke was called. Neurology and
Neurosurg were consulted. No focal deficits were noted on exam.
In addition, she was >3 hrs out from onset of sxs and thus not a
candidate for tPA. CT head suggests "stable bilateral evolving
subdural collections with no new hemorrage evident, stable
minimal rightward shift of midline structures." Neurosurgery did
not feel that there was a change in bleed. Per daughter, pt's
mental status is back to baseline. Neuro deferred LP at this
point. Neuro did recommend restarting dilantin due to h/o
seizures in the past. Pt was admitted for toxic/metabolic
work-up.

tobacco/etoh use.

exam, inattentive. Oriented to person, place (hospital, [**Location (un) 86**],
but not [**Hospital1 **]), but not date (does not say anything). Inattentive,
cannot spell world forwards. Speech is nonfluent, able to name
high frequency objects (chair, hand), but not low frequency
objects. Makes one paraphasic error ([**Last Name (un) **]->[**Name2 (NI) 102794**]), says tip-top,

but does not name any other word list words. Slight dysarthria.

evidence of neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Unable to visualize fundi bilaterally. Pupils
equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm bilaterally.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus.
Visual fields full to confrontation. Sensation intact V1-V3 to
pinprick. Flattening of the L NLF especially with smiling.
Sternocleidomastoid full strength bilaterally. Tongue midline,
non-compliant with moving tongue.

Motor: No observed myoclonus or asterixis. Postural tremor in
L>R

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**3-9**]: Left subdural has increased in size. Maximum width
is now 3.8 cm compared to 2.7 cm, after consideration of
difference in angulation. Right subdural also appears slightly
increased in extent. No change in midline shift seen and no
herniation identified. Revised findings conveyed to the clinical
team at 10 AM on [**2114-3-9**].

MRI head [**3-11**]: Persistent and unchanged evolving subdural
hematoma along the convexity, larger on the left side as
described in detail above with different stages of chronicity.
No diffusion abnormalities indicating acute ischemic event.
Small vessel disease is demonstrated as areas of hyperintensity
signal in the subcortical white matter and lacunar ischemic
changes in both cerebellar hemispheres. Bilateral mucosal
thickening in the maxillary sinuses, larger on the right side.

Brief Hospital Course:
80y/o F with ESRD on HD, HTN, anemia, PVD, DM coming in from
[**Last Name (un) 1188**] house for worsened mental status, found to have
expanding SDH.

# Neurologic deficits: Although pt's baseline is abnormal and pt
generally is disoriented, pt was thought to be worsening. Pt was
evaluated for toxic metabolic etiology, as well as seizures, but
ultimately altered mental status was thought to be due to
enlarging SDH. Pt was followed by neurology, neurosurgery and
pain and palliative care, all discussing options with the
family. Decision was made to undergo evacuation of SDH.  On
[**3-14**], pt underwent a left craniotomy and evacuation of chronic
SDH.  A subgaleal drain was placed.  Pt underwent a CT head
without contrast within 4 hours of the procedure.
Postoperatively, the pt remained dysarthric, but her dysarthria
ultimetly improved and patient was fluent with her speech,
although she had periods of confusion even on the day of
discharge, recalling the events of the previous day incorrectly.
 A CT head was performed on [**3-16**] which demonstrated normal
postoperative changes.  The subgaleal drain was removed, and the
pt was transferred to the floor.  On [**3-17**], the pt was oriented x
3 and full strength, but remained dysarthric.  On [**3-18**], three
doses of subcutaneous vitamin K were given for INR 1.8. She had
her PICC line repositioned.

Pt's aspirin was held for bleed and procedure but will
ultimately need to be restarted to due high risk of CVA.

# End stage renal disease: Pt was followed by nephrology and
continued on her scheduled [**Month/Day (4) 2286**] on Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays. She was also continued on her renal supplements
including EPO.

# Anemia of Chronic Disease: HCT remained stable at baseline
25-30 and pt was continued on EPO at HD, she was also transfused
2 units of blood on this admition.

# Diabetes Mellitus: BSs well controlled, with frequently
recorded asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Pt's output nateglinide was
stopped and started on ISS while inpatient.

# Toxic multinodular goiter: TFTs were consistent with sick
euthyroid, thus pt was continued on her recently adjusted dose
of methimazole and asked to follow up as an out pt with
endocrinology.

# Hyperlipidemia:  Pt was continued on atorvastatin.

As stated on her discharge instructions, patient was advised to
follow up with her primary care physician within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week of
discharge to review her new medications and follow up with
regard to her ongoing anemia.
