Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, Afib w/ PPM, recent ORIF c/b wound dehiscence, PMR (not on
steroids) who was admitted to the MICU for recurrent CDiff and
dehydration on [**2108-3-22**]. The patient's course has been fairly
complicated beginning with a fall in [**2107-11-28**] requiring R
hemiarthroplasty which was complicated by wound
dehiscence/hematoma formation requiring evacuation in [**1-4**] and
further complicated by acute renal failure which ultimately
resolved. Since then, the patient has had episodes of Cdiff at
rehab intermittently for 7 day bouts for the last three weeks.
Apparently, most recently, PCP has ordered PO vanco for
treatment of Cdiff confirmed by lab specimens.
.
On arrival in the ED her temp was noted to be 101.2 89 98/34 18
98%2LNC, subsequently to 88/22, given 6L NS w/ ~1L UOP, and
subsequent improvement of BP to 110s-120s on arrival to MICU for
?sepsis. In addition, she was given ASA 325, levofloxacin 500,
tylenol, flagyl 500 IV, and potassium repletion. Central line
placed in LIJ which showed CVP of 12, however, mixed venous O2
sat on arrival 96%.
.

On arrival to MICU, RR ~30, but the patient denied feeling short
of breath, O2 sat ~100% 3LNC.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2108-3-23**] 8:56 AM
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are present, either persistent or recurrent
since [**2108-1-9**]. Lateral view only suggest new localized
edema or generalized peribronchial infiltration in one of the
lower lobes, probably the left. Edema is less likely given the
absence of pulmonary vascular plethora or any change in the
already dilated cardiomediastinal silhouette. Aspiration should
be considered. Tip of the left jugular line projects over the
SVC. Right atrial and ventricular pacemaker leads follow their
expected courses from the right pectoral pacemaker.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, 2+MR, Afib w/ PPM, s/p ORIF/hematoma evacuation, admitted
for CDiff colitis.
.
# C. Diff Colitis:
The patient was treated with IV flagyl and PO vanco with
improvement of symptoms clinically; she will continue the
antibiotics to complete a 14 day course.  She was treated with
IVF and electrolyte repletion.
.
# Positive blood cultures:
The patient had [**12-1**] blood cultures positive for Coag Negative
Staph.  She was treated with empiric IV Vancomycin from
[**Date range (1) 52920**].   All repeat blood cultures were negative, therefore,
the IV Vanco was discontinued on [**3-26**].

# Hypotension:
The patient was hypotensive on admission, most likely due to
dehydration rather than sepsis; her BP stabilized with IVF
resuscitation.  Her verapamil was restarted on hospital day 2.
.
# Afib/anticoagulation:
The patients INR was elevated on admission, therefore her
Coumadin was held. Albumin level was very low (2.1) which is
contributing to the coagulopathy. The INR was 4 on day of
discharge from the hospital. She should be resumed on coumadin
3mg once INR is less than 3 and the INR should be monitored on a
weekly basis to ensure it remains therapeutic once re-starting
coumadin.
.
# Wheezing:
She was continued on nebulizers: albuterol and atrovent.
Respiratory function improved throughout her hospitalization.
She has a long smoking history, COPD likely played a role.
Also, may be secondary to volume overload, though no evidence of
overt CHF on exam.  The patient was allowed to autodiurese given
recent hypotension. She was discharged on albuterol and atrovent
nebs.
.
# Code status: Presumed FULL.

# Communication: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 52921**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 52922**]
.
# DISPO:
Patient discharged to rehab. Patient not yet ambulating
independently so foley was kept in place. It should be removed
once she is out of bed ambulating or if she prefers to use bed
pan/urinal.
