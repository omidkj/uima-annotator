Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Motor vehicle accident

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
78 yo F with PMH of COPD on 2L home O2, CAD with stent on
ASA/[**Hospital 89203**] transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital after MVA
yestserday with a question of syncopal episode prior to driving
off the road. She was admitted to the trauma service where she
was evaluated by Neurosurgery for ? SAH and L lateral
ventricular bleed per report.
.
Neurosurgery consult though the reported SAH might have been an
overcall and thought it was a trivial SAH. They recommended
starting
Dilantin (x7d), get CTA to assess for aneurysm, perform syncope
workup, q4 Neuro checks, goal SBP <160. She was started on
Dilantin,  Aspirin/plavix were held.
.
CT chest was concerning for ground-glass appearance, consistent
with pulmonary contusions and hemorrhage. Patient subsequently
developed a leukocytosis of 23.6, with positive UA and pending
urine culture. Tmax 101.5 at 10 pm on [**2155-5-26**]. Started on
ceftriaxone for PNA without atypical coverage. Received 10 mg IV
lasix this AM for ? volume overload.
.
Syncope workup was started: echo ordered (not done), CE's
negative x2, EKG showing LBBB that appeared in 2/[**2155**].
.
Gyn consult was obtained for ? displaced pessarie and will
likely help reposition.
.

.
3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CT head ([**2155-5-26**]): Stable focus of intraventricular hemorrhage
in the left lateral ventricle with subtle hyperdensity along the
sulci adjacent to the left temporal lobe suggestive of
subarachnoid hemorrhage, which appears slightly decreased in
conspicuity compared to prior, which could relate to
redistribution. No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2155-5-26**]): Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
alveolar opacities, concerning for hemorrhage/contusion in the
setting of trauma. Aspiration or pneumonia cannot be
excluded,particularly in areas of the right middle and lower
lobes where the consolidation is more confluent and with
air-bronchograms. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is
non-specific and could relate to infection or inflammatory
process, underlying malignancy is also in the differential
diagnosis and should be considered. Follow-up imaging after
acute episode subsides. Hepatic steatosis.
.
- CT spine ([**2155-5-26**]): No evidence for acute fracture or
malalignment of the cervical spine.
.
- Echocardiogram ([**2155-5-28**]): The left atrium is elongated. There
is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum, inferior wall, lateral
wall, and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
35-40 %). The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
- CXR ([**2155-5-28**]): Heart size is slightly enlarged unchanged as
well as there is no change in mediastinal silhouette. Multifocal
consolidations are demonstrated, bilateral with no definitive
evidence of interval progression. Overall there is slight
improvement in the right lung aeration. Small amount of pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.
.
- CTA head ([**2155-5-28**]): No evidence of aneurysm larger than 2-mm
in the intracranial anterior or posterior circulation.
Redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage, with a small
quantity of blood products layering in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle. Resorption or redistribution of
previously seen minimal SAH, with no new
intracranial hemorrhage.
.
- Carotid ultrasound ([**2155-5-29**]): Right ICA with no stenosis. Left
ICA with no stenosis
.
- Echocardiogram ([**2155-5-28**]):
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
mid to distal septum, inferior wall, lateral wall, and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with COPD on home O2, CAD with stents on aspirin/plavix,
presented after MVA with small SAH, initially admitted to Trauma
[**Hospital 2571**] transferred to Medicine Service for syncope workup and
management of pneumonia and UTI.
.
# s/p Motor vehicle accident: Patient was transferred from OSH
after MVA where patient hit a stone wall. She was initially
managed by the Trauma ICU service. CT torso and head confirmed
small SAH and left lateral intraventricular bleed. Neurosurgery
was consulted and recommended seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin
for 10 days. Aspirin and plavix were initially held and then
restarted after clearance from Neurosurgery. No interventions
were performed for the intracranial bleed. Patient had no
neurological symptoms throughout. CTA of the brain did not show
any signs of aneurysms >2 mm and resolution of SAH and
intraventricular bleed.
.
# ? Syncope: There was a question of whether her motor vehicle
accident was a result of syncope. Significant workup was
performed. Patient monitored on telemtry and EKG for signs
