History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 year old male with medical history only
significant for migraines initially presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital
on [**2165-9-3**] with dyspnea, right flank pain, watery diarrhea, and
low-grade fever, s/p visit to their ED 1 day prior for the same,
sent home on Augmentin and inhalers, 1 week after seeing his PCP
about [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat.  He was admitted with persistent
tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis to 16 with leftward
shift with normal blood pressure.  He was initally admitted to
the floor where a CT-PA showed RLL consolidation and small
pleural effusion, but no PE. He was continued on CTX and
azithromycin (started in the ED), later broadened to CTX and
levofloxacin out of concern for Legionella (despite negative
antigen) with non-bloody watery diarrhea.  He complained of
substernal chest pressure and EKG was mildly concerning for
isolated ST elevation in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was ruled out for MI with
serial troponins.  Work-up of his presentation included HIV
serology, [**Doctor First Name **], "collagen vascular disease panel", dsDNA, which
were all negative.  Leukocytosis worsened and imaging showed
progression of a pneumonic process to include all right lung
fields, along with evidence of volume overload with bibasilar
crackles and worsening hypoxia, requiring NRB.  He was diuresed
with furosemide 120mg IV, but patient's high oxygen requirement
continued, so he was transferred to the ICU with sat drops to
80s on NRB.

In the OSH ICU, he was unable to lay flat and antibiotics were
broadened to vanc, Zosyn, and levoflox.  Repeat chest CT showed
a large, loculated empyema with significant associated right
lung atelectasis. Thoracentesis yielded 20 cc of purulent
pleural fluid.  Following the procedure, he desatted again and
was intubated for increased WOB and hypoxia with 7.5 ETT. Chest
tube was placed with purulence initially, now serosanguinous.
Pleural fluid studies were consistent with an exudative process
with elevated LDH to 7072. To decrease the loculations of the
empyema, they had TPAing the chest tube. Drainage was a total of
1L in 3 days.  4L of IVF were given and he briefly required
peripheral norepinephrine for hypotension stopped hours prior to
transfer.  Antibiotic course is currently vanc (day 4), Zosyn
(day 3), and levoflox (day 6).  Current vent settings on
transfer were AC 450/14/5/40% (decreased from 80%).  He did not
arrive with central access, but does have 2 peripheral IVs.  He
continues to have good urine output and is neurologically intact
and following commands when awake.  He has not been fed yet.
The family requested transfer to a larger hospital for further
care.

On arrival to the MICU, he is sedated but arouses to voice and
follows commands.  Satting well on AC ventilation.

Final Report
INDICATION:

Patient with empyema, decortication, three chest tubes, one
removed,
pneumonia, additional loculation?

COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT of [**2165-9-7**] and chest
CT of
[**2165-9-11**].

TECHNIQUE:

Axial helical MDCT images were obtained from the suprasternal
notch to the
upper abdomen with administration of IV contrast and 1.25-mm
slice
collimation.  Multiplanar reformatted images in coronal and
sagittal axes were
generated.

LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:

Bilateral pneumonia consisting of left lung ground glass
opacities and right
lower lung consolidation have improved since last exam.  For
example, right
lower lobe consolidation has significantly improved.  The
airways are patent
until subsegmental levels.  Multiple bulla  are seen in the apex
and
unchanged.

MEDIASTINUM:

Surgical decortication and pericardial drainage has been done.
