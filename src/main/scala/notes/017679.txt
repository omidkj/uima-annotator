Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
shaking chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
83 year old man with coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2120**],
congestive heart failure with [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic
dysfunction (ef 35%), atrial fibrillation, BPH s/p TURP,
requiring 3x daily intermittent catheterization on chronic
keflex with multiple UTI's who presents with one day of acute
onset shaking chill.
.
Patient reports tripping over step while carrying groceries
about a week ago, fell and hit bridge of his nose and right
ribs. Went to [**Hospital **] hospital, negative CT and no rib
fractures, has had some continued nose bleeding since that time,
now minimal. (Coumadin held for past few days.)
.
Then today, reports developing shaking chills while lying next
to his wife. Says otherwise, only mild intermittent non
productive cough with eating (peanuts). Says has been
catheterizing himself about three times a day, no change
recently and has not noted change in color or odor of urine.
Also developed possible small volume hemoptysis x 1 today, says
small amount in mucous today. No other specific complaints,
generally feeling malaise since recent fall.
.
Denies chest pain, orthopnea, pnd, doe. At baseline, goes
golfing, help with care as his wife is demented and requires 24
hour assistance but he can perform all his ADL's.
.
No hematochezia, melena, other bleeding besides nose.
.
In the ED low grade fever to 99.4, hypotensive to sbp's in the
80's and initially 88% on room air. To 95% on 3 liters and bp
improved to 100's with 3 liters NS. Initially tachy to 110's in
er, now in 70's. WBC was 21 with 93% neutrophils, he received
ceftriaxone 1g IV, azithromycin 500mg IV, aspirin 325mg po, and
acetominophen 1g po.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2120**], no cath
since then.
2. Atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
3. Biventricular heart failure with an EF of 35%.
4. Mild AS, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
5. Benign Prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP x 2, now 3x
daily catheterizations and keflex chronic suppression.
6. Anemia for which he receives darbepoetin every 2 weeks.
7. Macular degeneration in left eye.
8. Multiple UTIs last culture [**2132-6-26**] showed E.coli and
corynebacterium (diphtheroid) resistant to
cipro/levo/bactrim/amp, but sensitive to ceftriaxone; UTI in
[**2130**] grew bactrim, ticarcillin and fq resistant bacteria; UTI in

[**2129**] grew pan sensitive enterobacter cloacae
9. Parkinson's disease

Social History:
Former smoker - quit 40 years ago. He drank EtOH regularly until

25 years ago, and now only drinks rarely. Lives at home with
wife. Wife with dementia-has 24 hour caretaker. Active, walks
independently and independent of ADLs plays golf. Family very

and daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97771**] is second HCP. [**Name (NI) **] used to be in
the navy, then worked in a creamery, and then owned two
restaurants and was in catering before he retired.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2133-7-2**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2133-7-2**]):
      CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing confirmed by
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Leftward axis
Left bundle branch block
Since previous tracing of [**2132-10-1**], intraventricular conduction
delay is new
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-6-30**] 7:38 AM
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2132-10-2**], the moderate left ventricular
cardiomegaly appears essentially unchanged. Status post CABG.
There is engorgement of the pulmonary vessels suggesting an
element of CHF.
Additionally, there is more confluent airspace opacity overlying
the right mid lung field, consistent with pneumonia.
.
ECHO [**2133-7-1**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right  atrial pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The
