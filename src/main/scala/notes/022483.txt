Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased output from colostomy bag and intermittent fever,
chills, and mild intermittent diffuse abdominal discomfort over
the past few days.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR placed pigtail catheter placed in deep pelvic collection.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 67M with colon CA s/p colostomy and
recurrent enterocutaneous fistula admitted with 2 days of
copious rectal drainage. Recent admission [**Date range (1) 49563**] for septic
shock from ascending cholangitis, E. Coli bacteremia c/b liver
abscesses s/p IR drainage [**9-16**], HAP, hypoxemic resp failure, ATN
requiring CVVH, rapid afib/flutter s/p DCCV and GI bleed.
Underwent ERCP and CBD stent [**9-16**] to treat obstruction in the
lower third of the biliary tree felt to be from stone or
stricture. EGD and C-scope [**10-10**] showed gastritis, duodenitis,
and a small erosion/ulceration of the skin at the anal
anastamosis with evidence of oozing. He was discharged to rehab
to complete an additional 5 weeks of Augmentin.
Presented to [**Hospital3 5097**] with 2 days of a report of increased rectal
output. CT there showed ECF. Transferred here. In the ED, triage
V/S 100.5 132 106/61 18 94%4l. Labs notable for WBC# 5.5 88%PMN
Hct 29.9 CO2 18 AG 15 lactate 2.0 Cr 2.1 (baseline ~1.6). At
0420 hypotensive to 79/50 (HR 134) despite 500 cc bolus, given
2nd liter bolus and L IJ placed. Neo gtt started. Given vanco 1
g, zosyn 4.5g IV, flagyl 500 mg IV, and tylenol. Surgery
compared OSH CT to our prior images and felt that anastamotic
leak was old with just increased output now, and recommended
conservative management given his poor surgical candidacy. V/S
prior to transfer 97.6 127 105/44 (neo 0.85 mcg/kg/min) 98%2L.
On the floor, patient has no complaints. He does endorse
intermittent fever, chills, and mild intermittent diffuse
abdominal discomfort over the past few days. He does not think
that his ostomy output or rectal drainage has changed in
quantity. He states that he was told he has a viral infection
but that a cause could not be found. He denies dizziness,
lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, cough, shortness of
breath, nausea, hematochezia, or melena.

Cardiac Echo Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
with ulceration in the descending thoracic aorta to 35 cm. The
aortic valve is functionally bicuspid with fusion of the
noncoronary and left coronary cusps; the fused cusps are not
mobile. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Functionally bicuspid
aortic valve with moderate aortic regurgitation. Ulcerated
non-mobile complex atheroma in the descending aorta at the
esophageal level of 35
