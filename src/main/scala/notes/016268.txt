CTA
INDICATION: 84-year-old man with rectal cancer, status post
surgical
resection and chemoradiation [**2145**], complicated by radiation
proctitis, now
with lower GI bleeding and dropping hematocrit from 30 to 16
status post 7
units transfusion.

COMPARISON: MR enterography [**2149-9-24**] and a CT torso with
contrast
[**2148-9-11**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT helical images were acquired through the abdomen
and pelvis
before and after administration of 150 mL of Omnipaque
intravenous contrast
using the mesenteric CTA protocol. Sagittal and coronal
reformats were
generated and reviewed.

FINDINGS: Moderate-sized bilateral simple pleural effusions with
compressive
atelectasis of the lung bases are seen. The imaged portion of
the heart
demonstrates moderate coronary arterial calcification. There is
no
pericardial effusion.

CTA: The abdominal aorta has moderate atherosclerotic
calcifications, without
evidence of aneurysmal dilation. Minimal calcifications are seen
at the
origin of the celiac, SMA and renal arteries, with normal
opacification of the
vessels distally. The inferior mesenteric artery is patent.
Incidental note
is made of a replaced right hepatic artery.

There is no evidence of active hemorrhage within the small/large
bowel loops.
Prominent vessels are seen along the wall of the cecum and
proximal ascending
colon, without evidence of active bleed.

No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is
seen.

Multiple hypodense lesions are seen in both kidneys, consistent
with simple
renal cysts, with the largest in the lower pole of the right
kidney measuring
3.9 cm and the largest exophytic cyst in the lower pole of the
left kidney
measuring 5.4 cm. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically.
Mild right hydroureteronephrosis has progressed since the prior
study and
ureter is dilated up to the level of the pelvic inlet and likely
relates to
post-radiation changes.

The spleen and pancreas are normal. The right adrenal gland is
normal.
Nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, is stable since
the earlier
study of [**2148-9-11**].

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple stones seen
along the
dependent aspect of the urinary bladder, likely relate to
chronic outlet
obstruction. Diffuse thickening of the rectal wall with
perirectal fat
stranding, likely represent post-radiation changes. Evidence of
prior
surgical anastomosis is seen in the the rectum. Small bilateral
lymph nodes
seen along the external iliac chain do not meet CT criteria for
significant
adenopathy and are stable since the prior study. There is no
pelvic free
fluid.

BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection
or
malignancy are detected. Moderate degenerative changes are seen
in the lumbar
spine, worse at L2-L3 level, with near complete reduction of
disc space and
mild retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 .

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of active gastro-intestinal bleeding.
2. Bilateral moderate simple pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis
of the lung bases.
3. Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, without
aneurysmal
dilation.
4. Bilateral simple renal cortical cysts. Mild right
hydroureteronephrosis,
possibly secondary to radiation.
5. Post-radiation changes in the pelvis. Multiple bladder
stones.

Impression:	Small hiatal hernia
Congestion and nodularity in the stomach body
Polyp in the fundus
Normal mucosa in the duodenum

Stomach:	Normal stomach.
Duodenum:	Normal duodenum.
jejunum:

ileum:	Not examined.
Other
findings:	A few pills were seen in the mid jejunum. There was no
stenosis or sticture noted in the jejumum distal to the pills.
No angioectasia or active bleeding was seen in the examined
small bowel.
Impression:	Lymphangiectasia in the mid jejunum and distal
jejunum
A few pills were seen in the mid jejunum. There was no stenosis
or sticture noted in the jejumum distal to the pills.
No angioectasia or active bleeding was seen in the examined
small bowel.
Otherwise normal single balloon small bowel enteroscopy to
