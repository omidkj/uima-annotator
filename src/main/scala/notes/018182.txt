CHIEF COMPLAINT:   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 43596**] is an 86 year old woman who was
the restrained driver rear ended in a motor vehicle crash in
[**Location (un) 3320**].  She was admitted on [**2100-9-24**] via the Trauma
system.  She had no loss of consciousness at the scene but
complained of an inability to move her lower extremities and
was found to have loss of sensation below the costal margins
bilaterally.  In the Trauma Bay, the patient became
progressively short of breath and had to be intubated by
Anesthesia.  She had a difficult intubation requiring a
straight laryngoscope blade.

A preliminary A/P chest x-ray revealed opacity in the right
hemithorax.  A right sided chest tube was placed and 500 cc.
of blood was returned.  A second chest tube was placed given
the high output.

The patient was taken to CT scan and after CT scan of her
head was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 80.  She was returned to the Trauma Bay where an
open DPL was negative.  Once stabilized, she was returned to
CT scan.  The patient received a total of three liters of
Crystalloid and two units of packed red blood cells during
her resuscitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Status post thyroid surgery [**38**] years ago.
3.  Status post left cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Fosamax.
2. Albuterol p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 98.4 F.;
heart rate 100; blood pressure 110/palpable; respiratory rate
14 with a 98% saturation on face mask.  Neurologically, she
was alert and oriented times three, following commands with
five over five grip in the upper extremities and strength
bilaterally.  Her pupils were status post cataract changes.
Tympanic membrane negative bilaterally.  Facial nerves intact
bilaterally.  No lower extremity motor strength zero out of
five bilaterally.  No sensation to light touch or pinprick
below the costal margins.  No rectal tone.  Respiratory clear
to auscultation bilaterally without crepitus or deformity
with stable sternum.  Cardiovascular is regular rhythm,
normal S1, S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Rectal guaiac negative, no tone.  Extremities:  Bilateral
pretibial effusions with a puncture wound overlying the left
tibia.  She had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white count 16, hematocrit 30,
platelets 300.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 110,
bicarbonate 21, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, blood sugar 122.  PT
normal.  Blood gas 7.37/34/364/20/minus 4.  Fibrinogen 221,
lactate 1.5.

Urinalysis nitrite positive with 11 to 20 white blood cells,
amylase 53.

12-lead EKG without ischemia.  Head CT scan negative.  CT
scan of the spine revealed a brisk fracture of T5 which was
comminuted with bony fragments in the spinal canal and T4-5
widening with T5 anterior listhesis.  The patient had left
first through third and right first through sixth rib
fractures.  CT scan of the abdomen was negative.  Head CT
scan was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred from the
Emergency Room to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was in
critical condition with paraplegia.  A pulmonary artery
catheter and arterial line was placed.  The patient was
started on Dobutamine and Levo-synephrine to optimize her
cardiac index and oxygen consumption index.  She received
aggressive resuscitation and despite a very poor prognosis
given her multiple rib fractures and spinal injury, the
patient fared well during the first 24 hours.

She had been started on steroid protocol for a spinal cord
injury in the Emergency Room on arrival.  On post-injury day
number four, she was started on a Lasix drip and ventilator
weaning was begun.  However, the patient still had a poor
long-term prognosis and faced an extended recovery.  During
ongoing discussions with her family and health care proxy, it
became clear that the patient would not opt for prolonged
medical support, particularly if she would be left paralyzed.
The patient had been quite independent and proud of this
status.

After two days of discussion, the patient was made comfort
measures only on post injury day number five and allowed to
expire.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post multi-trauma.
2.  Paraplegia.
3.  Multiple rib fractures with pulmonary insufficiency.
4.  Right hemothorax.
