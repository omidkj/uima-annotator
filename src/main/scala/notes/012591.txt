Renal U/S: :
The right kidney measures 10.4 cm.  The left kidney measures
10.1
cm.  A 3.7 x 3.4 x 3.1 cm anechoic cyst is again demonstrated in
the upper
pole of the right kidney, unchanged.  A nonobstructing calculus
is again
identified in the lower pole of the right kidney.  The kidneys
are unchanged in appearance with no hydronephrosis.  The bladder
is unremarkable.

RUE Duplex:
Duplex evaluation was performed of the right upper extremity
arterial system.  The brachial, radial and ulnar arteries are
all patent with triphasic waveforms.  There is a sizable
hematoma in the right upper forearm.  There is no evidence of AV
fistula.

TEE:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen  in the body of the left atrium and
moderate/severe SEC in the left atrial  appendage. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the
ascending  aorta, in the aortic arch, and in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic  valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the  aortic valve. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet prosthesis  is
seen in the mitral position with normal disc motion. No mass or
vegetation  is seen on the mitral valve. A small paravalvular
leak is probably present.  Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion.

TTE:

The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function  is probably grossly preserved but views are
technically suboptimal. Due to  suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully  excluded. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bileaflet  mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
transmitral gradient is normal for  this prosthesis. Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.  There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT  TOrso:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No mediastinal hematoma is
identified.  The thoracic aorta is of normal contour with
evidence of atherosclerotic disease. There is prominent
mediastinal fat as well as prominence of the
brachiocephalic vessels, which could explain the mediastinal
widening seen on the prior chest radiograph.  Small bilateral
pleural effusions are present with possible loculated components
along the major fissures bilaterally. Associated atelectasis is
seen within the dependent portions of both lungs. There is no
evidence of failure.  The airways are patent to the level of the
segmental bronchi bilaterally.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There
are calcifications within the coronary arteries as well as
evidence of prior mitral valve replacement.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  A simple cyst measuring 4.7 cm
is present at the upper pole of the right kidney.
Nonobstructing stone is seen within the lower pole of the right
kidney measuring 11 mm.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
 The adrenal glands, spleen, atrophic pancreas, and liver are
within normal limits.  There is a gallstone within the
gallbladder with no pericholecystic inflammatory change.  No
dilatation or wall thickening is seen within large or small
bowel.  The appendix is normal in appearance.  The abdominal
aorta is of normal caliber.  No periaortic stranding seen.  No
free fluid or free air is seen within the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, prostate
gland, and
rectum are within normal limits.  There is sigmoid diverticuli
with no fat
stranding or wall thickening to suggest diverticulitis.

CT head:  :  No definite evidence for acute intracranial
pathology including signs of hemorrhage or infarction.
Equivocal region of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe,
which may be artifactual.  Given that this patient has multiple
old areas of infarction and obvious areas of atherosclerosis
within the cerebral vasculature, an MRI with diffusion would be
a more sensitive test to evaluate for acute infarction.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  82 y/o male with ischemic DCM, MVR who p/w acute brachial
arterial thromoboembolic event and CHF in setting of stopping
anticoagulation.

*.  CHF:  Multifactorial.  Likely [**2-3**] diastolic dysfunction,
valvular dysfunction and NSTEMI.  Diuresed on day one for goal
I/O -1L per 24 hour.  ACE readded on day 2 based on Cr.  Started
isordil/hydral for afterload inhibition in setting of renal
failure.  Had 24 hours of nesiritide, but d/c'd [**2-3**] renal
failure.  By time of discharge, pt was euvolemic and will
continue on BB/afterload inhibitors

* HTN: Pt had continued high BP's with systolics in the 190's.
Started BB slowly (histor
