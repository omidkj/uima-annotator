HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 88-year-old right-handed woman
with past medical history of myocardial infarction,
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and poor medicine
compliance, who was admitted on [**8-24**] after falling off her
chair when trying to get up.  She notes she had weakness on

She was brought to the Emergency Room and was noted to have
slurred speech with language intact.  She had a right gaze
preference, but no gaze paresis.  She did not respond to
visual threat on the left and had a flattened left nasolabial
fold.  She was inattentive to said stimuli.  Upper and lower
extremity strength was normal on the right and was 3+ to 4-
and had an upgoing toe also on the left.

Diffusion-weighted imaging at the time showed increased
signal intensity in the left cerebellum and right hemisphere
at MCH distribution, involving the basal ganglia, insula, and
parotid lobe.

She was treated with intra-arterial TPA by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17302**], and
Interventional Radiology team, and there was successful
partial revascularization of the distal right MCA branch
(M-II).

She did well postoperatively, and began to regain strength on
the left side.  On the evening of [**8-25**], she developed
a large groin hematoma that extended to her abdominal wall.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 28.0 to 28.4, and CT scan
of the abdomen and pelvis showed no retroperitoneal bleed.
She was then transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit and
onto the Neurology Service.

Since transfer, she continued to recover function
neurologically.  She had been progressing well with physical
therapy.  She initially complained of bilateral leg pain that
has since resolved.  On Tele monitoring, she has been noted
to have episodes of intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation.
She is currently on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for this.  In regard
there is anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, Vascular
Surgery recommended to wait one week prior to starting
Coumadin.
