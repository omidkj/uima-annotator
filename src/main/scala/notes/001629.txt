Radiology:
[**2196-8-4**] CHEST (PA & LAT)
1) Right perihilar opacity/mass; it is unclear per given
history, whether this represents the site of the patient's
primary lung cancer. If not, this may represent a pneumonic
infiltrate; correlate clinically.
2) Multiple small nodules and cavitary lesions seen on the prior
chest CT are not appreciated on the current chest x-ray.
.
[**2196-8-4**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Increased right-sided
effusion.
3. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. 4. Increase in size of
multiple lung lesions, some of which again demonstrate cavitary
transformation and peripheral wedge-shaped appearance. The
overall appearance is most concerning for progression of
metastatic disease with differential diagnosis again including
typical and atypical infectious processes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 y/o M w/PMH significant for lung CA who
presented w/gradually progressing SOB, cough, fatigue and
lightheadedness over the past 3weeks w/CXR concerning for PNA or
worsening lung CA. CT performed for further eval also revealed
unilateral pleural effusion and increased pulmonary lesions
concerning for worsening CA or infection.  Differential
diagonisis on presentation included advancing malignancy, CHF,
pneumonia. The patient after admission became hypotensive and
additionally was requiring increasing oxygen support. The
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing care. In the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for possible
pneuominia, with ceftriaxone additionally added as well later.
The patient had large O2 requirements, requiring a
non-rebreather to maintain O2 sats > 90. However, as the patient
was DNR/DNI without presssors, therapies offered in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
were limited. The patient was tried on a trial of CPAP to held
decrease the associated work of breathing but found the CPAP too
uncomfortable and preferred not to use it. The patient therefore
was trasnferred back to the floor for ongoing care. The
patient's prognosis was known to be poor which the patient and
his family were aware of. Therefore, priority was shifted
towards comfort which was guided by the patient's family. As the
patient was lucid and interactive, although markedly tachypnic,
he and his family preferred not to use any narcotics for comfort
initially. However, as the patient's course progressed over a
course of days and he became more tired and confused, the
patient's family guided the use of morphine until a point when
the patient was on a morphine drip titrated to comfort. All
supportive measures including medications, fluids, and lab
checks were discontinued and the patient was allowed to pass
away with his family present. The patient passed away from
respiratory arrest on [**2196-8-13**].
