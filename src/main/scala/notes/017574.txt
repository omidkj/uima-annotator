Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NIPPV
cardiac catheterization s/p stents to L subclavian and iliac

History of Present Illness:
82 yo woman with extensive vascular history (below), breast
cancer in the past s/p L mastectomy in [**2128**], htn, high chol, and
possible diagnosis of colon cancer treated 2 yrs ago with chemo
which she self-d/c'ed, who had presented for elective
angiography for lower extremity ischemia, and had developed
nausea felt to be angina equivalent.  After heparin gtt, she
went for cardiac cath on [**4-14**] PM and was found to have patent
grafts and 3vd, though low flow to LIMA and RLE vessels, thus
s/p stenting of right CIA and L subclavian.  She developed left
sided weakness since then, unknown last well time. Heparin was
used prior to the cath, which was stopped at noon on [**4-15**]; she
did well during the procedure, although post-procedure there was
a groin hematoma and hematocrit drop requiring 2 units prbc's.
She moved well on exam last night.  This morning, there was no
neuro exam performed, but she was apparently talking, with
no facial droop and normal language (?8 or 9AM).  Cardiovascular
exam was considered to be stable.  Just after 9AM she was seen
by the nurse, who found her to be unresponsive to voice; soon
afterwards, she had returned to [**Location 213**].  At 11AM she was seen by
the resident and appeared to have, once more normal language and
speech, but she was not moving the right side of her body.
Neuro
was contact[**Name (NI) **] at 11:15 and arrived at 11:30AM.  Initial NIHSS
was unscorable because the patient was able to open eyes, but
did not speak at all, did not blink to threat on the left,
withdrew minimally to noxious stimuli (decreased on the left
upper extremity).  DTRs were [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] at the knees and toes were
mute.
She was seen ten minutes later and language function was back to
normal with normal naming and speech, but a dense homonomous
hemianopsia, extinction to double simultaneous stimulation over
the left hemibody, weakness of the left arm, NIHSS of 5.  On
further questioning later with family present, "peripheral
vision on the left" has been worse over the past month, though
she also has cararacts.

Social History:
She lives alone, is a nonsmoker, son lives nearby and is
involved with her care; daughter in [**Name2 (NI) **].

Family History:
Unknown.

Physical Exam:
Examination:
T 100.1 (had temp>101 earlier), bp 102/38, rr 18, 96%RA
General: white female, NAD
Heart: regular rate and rhythm with III/VI SEM RUSB, radiation
to
bilateral carotids vs bruits
Lungs: clear to auscultation anteriorly bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
Extremities: warm, well-perfused

Mental Status: The patient was initially not speaking at all,
staring but not following commands; ten minutes later, she was
oriented to self, [**Hospital1 **], with intact language (no errors, normal
repetition) and normal speech.  She was able to follow
multi-step
commands, and naming was intact.  There was no apraxia or
agnosia.

Cranial Nerves: PERRLB 3->2, EOMI with no nystagums, +dense left
homonomous hemianopsia.  Sensation on the face is intact to
light
touch but there is extinction on the left cheek to DSS. Facial
movements are normal and symmetrical. Hearing is intact to
finger
rub. The palate elevates in the midline. The tongue protrudes in
the midline and is of normal appearance.

Motor System: Bulk is normal; tone thought initially to be
increased x bilat arms when pt first seen but was likely flexor
tonic posturing during seizure; there is weakness in the left
arm
with 4/5 delt, and [**4-11**] triceps, [**5-12**] biceps, weak hand grasp,
left
sided pronator drift; there is also 4+/5 weakness of the
contralateral deltoid but elswhere in the right upper extremity
strength was normal.  The patient can lift both legs off the bed
and hold them for over 5 seconds.  There is no tremor.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are present, [**Month/Day (1) 19912**] in the knees
with bilaterally mute toes and normal.

Sensory: Sensation is present on the left side of the body, but
the patient has left hemibody extinction to DSS.

Coordination: There is some dysmetria of left finger to nose and
[**Doctor First Name **] in proportion to weakness.

Gait:  Gait was not assessed.

Pre-procedure CXR:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILMS: Lung volumes are at the upper limit
of normal. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. Patient is status post sternotomy.
Prominent costochondral calcifications. Lung fields demonstrates
a 7mm in the left lung fields, may be a calcified granuloma.
Right basilar nodular opacity is probably a nipple shadow. There
are no pleural effusions. There is biapical pleural
calcification.

IMPRESSION: Right upper and basilar nodules. Right basilar
nodule is probably a nipple shadow. Comparison with prior films
recommended. In the absence of prior films, chest CT recommended
for the right upper nodule.

[**4-12**]:
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE.

REASON: Bruit.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Moderate plaque is identified bilaterally. It is
somewhat calcified.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 123, 94, 253 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.3.
This is consistent with 40 to 59% stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 152, 89, 166 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.7.
This is consistent with a 60 to 69% stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Moderate plaque with a left 60 to 69% and a right 40
to 59% carotid stenosis.

VENOUS DUPLEX, UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY.

REASON: Patient in need of bypass.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both upper and
lower extremities. Left greater saphenous vein is patent with
diameters ranging from 0.17 to 0.45 cm. The saphenous vein below
the knee is somewhat diminutive.

Right cephalic vein is patent with diameters ranging from 0.24
to 0.30 cm. The right basilic vein is patent with diameters
ranging from 0.35 to 0.49 cm.

The left cephalic vein is not visualized. The left basilic vein
is patent with diameters ranging from 0.18 to 0.46 cm.

IMPRESSION: Patent left greater saphenous vein with somewhat
diminutive features below the knee. Patent bilateral basilic
veins and right cephalic veins with diameters as noted.

[**4-14**]: ABDOMINAL MRI/A

ABDOMINAL MRA: The aorta is normal in caliber. Diffuse
mild-to-moderate plaque is seen throughout the visualized
abdominal aorta including a more severe focal plaque
approximately 2 cm inferior to the renal arteries resulting in
narrowing of 50%. Celiac axis is normal. The origin of the SMA
is normal; however, multiple moderate focal stenoses are seen
within the visualized portion of the SMA. There is severe
stenosis at the origin of the left renal artery and
moderate-to-severe stenosis at the origin of th
