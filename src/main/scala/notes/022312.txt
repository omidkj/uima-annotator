Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 22583**] for worsening hypoxia, low UOP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiV ICD placement [**2114-4-4**]
Chest tube placement
Central line placement
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 80 y/o with with cardiomyopathy, increasing CHF
symptoms, here for upgrade from single chamber ICD to BiV ICD.
Pt. presented to EP lab and a VVIR BiV ICD was placed without
incident.  Had some oozing around incision site afterwards ->
pressure dressing placed.  He was given 40 mg IV Lasix -> 800 cc
UOP after dose.
.
Pt. reports that he has been having progressive DOE for several
months.  He reports he can climb 13 steps at home now, but is
very winded afterwards, while 6 months ago he did not have
difficulty with this.  He gets winded with walking from room to
room.  He also reports substernal chest pain with activity with
no radiation, that is relieved with rest.  He also had an
episode of "fainting" recently, ~1 month ago per his report (in
[**11-27**] per d/c summary from OSH), where his ICD fired.  This lead
to repeat testing of the ICD and the decision to change to a BiV
pacer per his report.  ROS negative for recent fevers, does
report chronic rhinorrhea, occ. twinges of abd pain which he
attributes to AAA, no constipation or diarrhea, no dysuria, 4
episodes of nocturia/night, chronic LE edema that waxes and
wanes, though it never fully resolves.  Reports chronic
orthopnea, sleeps with one pillow at home.


Past Medical History:
- Syncope at home in [**11-27**] -> ICD fired -> to OSH where
interrogation of ICD showed VF
- ICD placed in [**3-27**] for inducible VT on EP testing
- Ischemic CM- EF 20% in [**11-27**]
- Atrial fibrillation/Tachy-brady syndrome on Coumadin
- AAA s/p stenting in '[**11**]
- HTN
- CAD s/p CABG in '[**02**]
- MVR
- Hx Endocarditis
- BPH
- Chronically elevated LFTs


Social History:
retired, lives with wife, former heavy EtOH use, former heavy
smoker

.
CXR [**4-5**]:
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was obtained and
compared to the previous portable erect chest x-ray from [**4-4**], [**2113**].
.
New coronary sinus lead was added.  The heart size is markedly
enlarged with large amount of left pleural effusion and adjacent
lung consolidation.  No change in comparison to the previous
film is demonstrated.
.
CXR [**4-7**]:
A defibrillator is present in the left anterior chest wall with
RV and
coronary sinus leads.  An increasing effusion is present
occupying the lower two thirds of the left hemithorax.  The
right lung is clear.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate.
However, the left atrium and right ventricle appear enlarged.
Prior fractures of the left eighth and ninth ribs may relate to
prior surgery.
.
IMPRESSION:  Increasing left effusion.
.
Head CT [**4-7**]:
FINDINGS:  There is an 8-mm right-sided subdural hematoma, which
does not cause significant mass effect or shift of the normally
midline structures.  There is age-appropriate involutional
changes.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears
preserved.  There is no hydrocephalus.  The osseous structures
are unremarkable.  Mild mucosal thickening in the right ethmoid
sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small 8-mm right-sided subdural hematoma with no significant
mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
.
Head CT [**4-8**]:
FINDINGS:  Examination is limited secondary to patient motion.
There has been no change in the size or appearance of the small
right frontoparietal subdural hematoma.  This hematoma measures
7 mm, and does not cause significant mass effect or midline
shift.  The density values of the brain parenchyma are within
normal limits.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation remains
preserved.  The ventricles are normal in size.  The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses again show mild thickening in the
right ethmoid sinus.
.
IMPRESSION:  No interval change in the small right subdural
hematoma without mass effect or midline shift.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-4-13**] 2:38 AM
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images from the lung bases through the
pubic symphysis were obtained without oral or intravenous
contrast according to the referring physician's request.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate right and a
smaller left pleural effusion with adjacent bibasilar
atelectasis. Pacer wires are seen wit
