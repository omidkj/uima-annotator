MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Verapamil 60 mg q.i.d., Tylenol
350 mg every four to six hours, Depakote 250 mg b.i.d.,
calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d., albuterol inhaler p.r.n.,
sotalol, Fosamax, vitamin D.

ALLERGIES:  Amiodarone causes tremulousness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no ethanol.  She lives with her
daughter in [**Name (NI) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam she was febrile
temperature 98.6, pulse 72, blood pressure 134/54,
respirations 16, sating 97% in room air.  HEENT exam
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
Anicteric sclerae.  Neck supple without lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were clear on the left, but had fine crackles on the
right throughout.  Chest had a large right sided chest wall
defect with paradoxical motion of the chest with inspiration.
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1,
normal S2, no S3, no S4, holosystolic [**1-14**] ejection murmur
radiating to the axilla, crescendo decrescendo systolic
ejection murmur [**2-11**] radiating to the carotids, JVP 5 cm.
Abdominal exam soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  The incision site on the left hip was clean, dry and
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chem-7 139/4.2/102/27/28/0.8/191.  Cardiac
echo [**2144-3-9**] showed EF of 50%, normal LA size, mild aortic
regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation.  PT 18.2, PTT 49.8,
INR 2.2.  Sed rate on day of discharge was 79.  ALT 8, AST
18, alka phos 59, total bili 0.8, LD 160.  TSH 2.6.  LDL 37,
HDL 29, triglycerides 54.  Troponin was 10.1.  Serial CKs
were in the 400s, however, MB fraction was noted to be low at
11 to 14 with an index of 3.  Abdominal ultrasound performed
on [**2144-3-12**] showed diffuse thickening of the gallbladder with
an intraluminal stone and possible wall edema.  CT of the
abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of retroperitoneal
hematoma and a small left gluteal hematoma with high
attenuation of the gallbladder, slight thickening of
gallbladder wall.  Common bile duct was noted to be normal.
Chest CTA done on [**2144-3-8**] showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism, small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis.  There were patchy areas of sclerosis in the
mid-thoracic spine which could be related to metastatic
breast disease and a small amount of pericardial fluid.  Head
CT on [**2144-3-8**] showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage
and some sphenoid, maxillary and ethmoid sinus disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic
service on [**2144-3-7**].  The patient underwent left hip
arthroplasty on [**Last Name (LF) 1017**], [**3-8**].  The patient tolerated the
procedure well, however, the post-op course was complicated
by hypotension, followed by bradycardia while in the PACU.
The patient received atropine, dopamine and ephedrine and was
transcutaneously paced without hemodynamic response.  At this
time the patient was started on IV epinephrine with increase
in heart rate and systolic blood pressure.  The patient was
intubated for airway protection and transferred to the CCU.

The patient underwent head CT and CTA to evaluate for the
possibility of pulmonary embolism or cerebral event causing
the hypotension.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were also
cycled.  The patient was eventually weaned from IV pressors
after approximately two days.  The patient failed extubation
on two separate occasions.  It was thought this was due to
sedation and weakness.  The patient was eventually
successfully extubated.  The patient did well post extubation
and was transferred to the general medicine floor.

The patient did well on the general medicine floor.  The
patient was deemed stable and transferred to rehabilitation.
Of note, the patient required four units of packed red blood
cells over the course of her admission.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Depakote 250 mg q.i.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg q.day continue until [**3-18**].
4.  Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. continue until [**3-18**].
5.  Sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Coumadin 3 mg q.day to be continued for five weeks.
7.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d. not to be taken with
food.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg q.day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post left hip arthroplasty.
2.  Osteoporosis.
3.  History of sternectomy.
4.  History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
5.  History of breast cancer.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Asthma.
8.  Seizure disorder history.
9.  Coronary artery disease.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE:
1.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient had a positive
troponin while in the hospital.  It is planned that she will
have an outpatient stress test.
2.  Orthopaedic.  The patient is to be continued on low dose
Coumadin, target INR 1.5 to 2, for six weeks from date of
surgery.
