Brief Hospital Course:
He was found to be in chf. CXR showed bilateral effusions. After
receiving IV lasix in the ED, he was sent to the SICU.  EF was
25% with severely depressed LV function, with septal
hypokinesis/akinesis and dilated right and left atrium.  Liver
u/s showed intrahepatic fluid collection and subdiaphragmatic
fluid collection, new in the interval since [**2170-3-4**]. Abd
CT also showed large bilateral pleural effusions,persistent
stone in distal pancreatic duct with massive pancreatic ductal
dilatation and two fluid collections, one at the dome(72x34mm)
and one periportally (58x77mm). LFTs were normal.

On [**4-9**] a right thoracentesis was performed for 1.8 liters. Fluid
was sent for cell count, cytology and gram stain. RR improved to
low 20's with high O2 requirement. ABG showed worsening PaO2.
Respiratory rate increased to 36 with accessory muscle use and
O2 desat to 82%. He was tachycardic and hypotensive. Lopressor
was given and he was intubated for cardiogenic shock. Vanco and
Zosyn were started for concern for sepsis. PO Vanco was started
for c.diff (c.diff + at rehab).  Blood cultures were  negative.
On [**4-9**] rectal swab was VRE positive.

Cardiology was consulted and recommendations included diuresis
with avoidance of ace inhibitors. Cardiac cath was recommended,
but given the ARF and pulmonary condition, this was deferred. A
P-MIBI was deferred as well. Levophed was used for BP of 88/56.
Creatinine trend up and CCVHD was started on [**4-11**] for metabolic
acidosis/ARF/hyperkalemia/oliguria. Creatinine increased to as
high as 2.9 with K+ of 6. Urine demonstrated granular casts
indicative of ATN. BP improved and pressors were weaned off.
Lopressor was eventually switched to carvedilol with up
titration of dose and hydralazine was added.

On [**4-10**] a left thoracentesis was done with 1.5 liters removed.
On [**4-10**] bronchoscopy/bal was done. Cultures were negative. He
was extubated. On [**4-12**] he had an episode of afib that converted
to SR. Levophed requirements decreased with preservation of
cardiac output and cardiac index.

On [**4-14**] the pleural tube was capped and he was extubated. A
lasix drip was started with increased  urine outputs. This was
stopped on [**4-16**] for metabolic alkalosis. CVVHD was stopped.
Creatinine trended down to 1.6.

On [**4-10**] he had ultrasound-guided drainage of a large left
hepatic abscess.  Approximately 150 cc of purulent material was
aspirated. Attempt at aspiration of the right-sided
subdiaphragmatic collection revealed old hematoma, therefore a
catheter was not placed. Under CT, there was successful
placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with drainage of
approximately 200 cc of pleural fluid. This grew enterococcus
(vanco sensitive), pan [**Last Name (un) 36**] pseudomonas, staph aureus coag +
(pcn & emycin resistent), strep veridans and pan sensitive
pseudomonas.  Cultures from thoracentesis from R & L  were
negative. Meropenum, fluc and vanco were continued per ID.
Meropenum was switced to zosyn after a ten day course.

On [**4-12**] LFTs increased with ast 2439 from 109, alt 2045 from 12,
alk phos 80 from 82 and t.bili 0.6 from 0.4. INR increased to
1.8. Vitamin K was given x3 days. LFTs then slowly trended back
down. On [**4-24**] a Abd CT was showed bilateral pleural effusions
left more than right and right subdiaphragmatic collection.
Chronic pancreatitis-type picture with pancreatic duct
dilatation and calcification. Mesenteric stranding was diffuse
and also in peripancreatic area. Some mild thickening of the
antrum of the stomach appeared improved. Left hydrocele and free
fluid in pelvis. The left hepatic drain was removed without
incident on [**4-24**]. A bile duct stent was removed. Cytology was
negative for malignant cells.


On [**4-17**] bilateral upper extremity u/s was done for right arm
swelling.  Extensive, nonocclusive thrombus extended  from right
internal jugular into right cephalic veins.
There were abnormal dampened venous waveforms on the left arm.
The Right C line was removed and he had successful placement of
a 38 cm double lumen PICC into the left basilic vein with tip
terminating in the SVC. IV heparin was initiated for this as
well as for a left ventricle thrombus seen on TTE on [**4-17**] ( A
moderate sized thrombus was seen in the left ventricle (~1.3 cm
diameter). LV systolic function appeared depressed with septal
and apical akinesis/hypokinesis and basal inferior akinesis).
Coumadin was started and heparin was stopped when he became
therapeutic. Goal inr was [**2-3**]. Inr was 3.0 on [**4-27**] on coumadin
3mg qd.  Coumadin was later stopped when he became
supratherapeutic to 3.6 on [**5-8**].  Coumadin was not resumed. He
received FFP and 1 unit of PRBC for hct drop to 25.9.

Nutritionally, while intubated he received postpyloric feedings
of Nutren renal. This was stopped once he was extubated. Diet
was advanced and appetite improved dramatically. Cal counts were
excellent. He did complain of diarrhea. Stools were negative for
c.diff x 5. Imodium was started. [**Last Name (un) **] followed for
hyperglycemia adjusting insulin.

He was doing well until [**4-29**] into [**4-30**] when he developed
respiratory distress and was transferred back to the SICU.  CXR
and CT scan demonstrated moderate pleural effusion on the left
and large effusion on the right.  Therefore, after reversal of
