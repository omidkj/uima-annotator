Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Temporary HD line placement, HD line removal
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yr old woman with history of htn, chf, prior CABG in [**2144**] and
prior NSTEMI in [**2150**] and [**2152-9-20**] that was treated
conservatively presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2153-1-13**] with
10/10 chest pain associated with N/V on and off since Saturday.
The pain comes at rest, is not associated with exertion or SOB.
Denies diaphoresis. Describes it as pain and pressure. At
[**Location (un) **] her pain resolved with 3 SL nitro, and her imdur was
increased. Initial troponins were negative, but rose to peak of
1.34. On the morning of [**1-15**] she had an episode of nausea,
wretching, chest pressure. She was found to have new lateral ST
changes - 2mm STD in V4-V5. Trop of 1.34. Resolved with reglan,
NTG. She was loaded with plavix and started on heparin gtt.
Also, CXR revealed possible right lower lobe pneumonia and
question of CHF. She was treated with Levaquin (3 days of 250mg
IV) and 40 IV Lasix on day of transfer with only moderate UOP.
Vital signs at OSH: 99.4, hr 79, rr 20, 93% on 3L, 131/65.
.
On arrival to floor she was comfortable on 3L NC O2, without
chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
On the morning of transfer she developed severe chest pressure
and pain with associated N/V. An ECG showed 2-3mm depressions in
V2-6 with 2mm elevation in aVR consistent with left main
disease. She was given NTG SL x1 with resolution of her CP as
well as Zofran for nausea. She was continued on her heparin
drip, loaded with Intergrillin 12.24mg, and started on
Integrilin 1mcg/kg/min and sent emergently to the cath lab.

RADIOLOGY:
.
Cardiac Cath ([**2153-1-16**]):
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective angiography demonstrated multivessel coronary
artery
disease.  The left main demonstrated diffuse disease with a
calcifed 80%
distal lesion that extended into both the left circumflex and
left anterior descending artery.  The right coronary artery was
not engaged.
2.  Placement of a 9F 30cc IABP via the left femoral artery.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal left circumflex
artery with a Xience (3x18mm) drug eluting stent.  Final
angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout
the vessel.  (SEE PTCA comments)
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal left anterior
descending artery and distal left main with a Cypher (3.0x18mm)
drug eluting stent postdilated with a 3.5mm balloon.  Final
angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout
the vessel (See PTCA comments).
5.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a Mynx
closure device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the left main, LAD and LCX
with drug
eluting stents
3.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a Mynx
closure device.
4. Placement of an IABP

[**2153-1-23**] - chest x-ray portable - CHEST PORTABLE: Comparison is
made to prior examination of [**2153-1-16**]. There is mild
cardiomegaly. This is unchanged. There is haziness of the
pulmonary vasculature and mild blunting of the costophrenic
angles. Overall, the appearance of the lungs has improved, with
a more patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, being less
prominent. A central venous line is seen with its tip at the
multiple sternal cerclages are noted from prior cardiac surgery.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with CHF, improved compared to prior
study. No
definite evidence of pneumonia.
.
1/27.09 - chest x-ray PA/Lateral - FINDINGS: In comparison with
the study of [**2151-6-8**], bilateral pleural effusions are noted. The
prominence of markings at the bases and the pleural fluid makes
it difficult to assess for the possibility of a supervening
pneumonia.
.
[**2153-1-18**] - renal ultrasound - RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney
measures 10.8 cm. The left kidney measures 10.1 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis, stone, or solid renal mass visualized. The
bladder was empty with a Foley catheter in place. IMPRESSION: No
hydronephrosis.
.
EKG  [**2153-1-17**] - Sinus rhythm. Non-specific inferior ST-T wave
flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-1-16**] the
anterolateral ST segment depression appears less prominent.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change. Clinical correlation is
suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2 who
presented from OSH with chest pain with positive troponin, CHF
exacerbation with possible superimposed PNA.
.
# CAD - patient with extensive CAD history with 3 vessel disease
and previous CABG. Patient's troponin elevated at OSH but no
acute ECG changes. Patient started on plavix and heparin gtt at
OSH. Cardiologist note at OSH did recommend conservative
treatment given advanced age and CRI however was transferred
here for cardiac caatherization. Trop-T on transfer here was
0.36, CK 52. Lateral EKG ST depressions resolving. On the floor
