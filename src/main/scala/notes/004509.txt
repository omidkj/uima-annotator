Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-6-28**] cardiac catheterization
[**2182-7-1**]  Pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis and
Mediastinal lymph node biopsy

History of Present Illness:
66 year old female from [**Country 11150**], who was admitted to outside
hospital complaining of shortness of breath along with severe
upper back and neck pain with a leukocytosis and an ECG showing
diffuse low voltage and tachycardia consistent with pericardial
effusion. Chest CT scan done ruled out dissection and pulmonary
embolism, but a moderate pericardial effusion was noted as well
as pathologic mediastinal adenopathy. Echocardiagram confirmed
pericardial effusion. No obvious tamponade was evident on
echocardiogram.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and likely surgical intervention.

Past Medical History:
s/p hysterectomy

Pertinent Results:
[**2182-6-28**] Chest CT: . Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes lymphoma,
metastatic disease, small cell lung cancer, and granulomatous
processes such as sarcoid and granulomatous infection. 2.
Widened pericardial stripe with Hounsfield units greater than
simple fluid concerning for pericardial thickening and/or
complex pericardial effusion. Consider cardiac echo or cardiac
MRI for more complete assessment. Again, differential diagnosis
is broad and has been described above for the mediastinal lymph
nodes. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Incompletely
characterized thickening of right adrenal gland. 5. Small right
breast lesion, possibly a cyst, but correlation with mammography
recommended if the patient has not undergone this examination
recently. 6. Nonspecific lung parenchymal findings, which could
relate to hydrostatic edema or a more chronic infiltrative
process.

[**2182-6-28**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
flow limiting stenoses. The LMCA was without stenosis. The LAD
was without angiographically apparent stenosis. The Cx was
without stenosis. The RCA was without angiographically apparent
flow limiting stenosis. 2. Hemodynamic measurements revealed
equalization of end diastolic pressures and evidence of
ventricular interdependence consistent with a constrictive
pericarditis. There was elevated right and left sided filling
pressures with RVEDP of 25 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 24 mm Hg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension of 43/24 mm Hg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2 (using an assumed
oxygen consumption). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries had
no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. 2.
Constrictive pericarditis. 3. Biventricular diastolic
dysfunction. 4. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.

[**2182-7-1**] Echo: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The pericardium
appears thickened. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. The echo findings are suggestive of pericardial
constriction.
