Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy : Two clips were unsuccessfully deployed in the
area of the bleeding lesion for the purpose of hemostasis. 2
cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injection was applied for hemostasis with
success. A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year old male with h/o Barrett's s/p EGD [**2201-5-1**]
with RFA of GEJ, atrial fibrillation on coumadin who woke up at
aprox 4:30 am on [**5-21**] with hematemasis.  He did not tell anyone
and cleaned it up.  He then had a second episode of hematemasis
and then some melana.  His wife then became aware of the problem
and called an ambulance and he went to [**Hospital1 1562**] ED.
.
At falmough he had a HCT of 30 and INR of 3.3. He received 1
unit of PRBC, 2 ffp, 10 vit K.  His potassium was noted to be 7,
he was given 5 U regular insulin and 1 amp of dextrose.  He was
started on octreatide gtt at [**Hospital1 1562**].  He also recieved some
zofran.

In the ED initial vitals were: 36.4 90 114/59 18 100%.  He had
about 400cc of hematemasis and an NG lavage with frank red
blood.  He also had maroon stool/melana in ED.  Two 16g IVs and
one 18g IV were placed and he was transfused 2 U of PRBC.  He
then received another 2 of FFP for coagulopathy.  The massive
transfusion protocol was activated.  He was evaluated by GI who
felt that he needed to be scoped emergenty in the ICU.  He was
hemodynamically unstable with BP dropping to 83/50 and
tachycardic to the low 100s.  On transfer his vitals were:
97.8, 112/61, HR 90, 100% 2L.
.
On the floor, patient feels comfortable prior to EGD.  He
continues to have some bright red blood from his NG tube.  He
denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  No chest pain,
shortness of breath.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or
skin changes.

1.  CAD status post CABG in 03/84 with four grafts.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Squamous cell carcinoma 03/[**2182**].
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Cardioversion [**7-/2191**] treated with Coumadin and
cardioversion.

EGD:
Blood in the middle third of the esophagus, lower third of the
esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. There was a hiatal
hernia that contained the distal esophagus and GEJ. Within the
hernia, at the most distal tip of the JEG there was a protruding
lesion with active arterial hemorrhage. (endoclip, injection,
thermal therapy). Because of the location of the lesion (within
the hiatal hernia), intervening upon the lesion was challenging.
Blood in the stomach body. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of
the duodenum

EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with a single ventricular premature beat.
Consider
lateral myocardial infarction. Intraventricular conduction delay
of left
bundle-branch block type. Since the previous tracing probably no
significant change.

Chest X-Ray:
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior
studies
available for comparison.

Severe cardiomegaly is noted. Mediastinum is dilated, chronicity
undetermined. The patient is in moderate-to-severe pulmonary
edema, accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar
areas of atelectasis
are most likely present.  Pacemaker leads terminate in right
atrium and right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax.
