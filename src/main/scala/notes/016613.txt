ECHO [**2181-8-9**]
1. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed.
These findings are consistent with but not diagnostic of
amyloid.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Compared to the previous study of [**2177-12-1**], the LVH has
increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 77yo M w/ non-ischemia CMP, CHF (EF=15%, [**12-14**]),
AF, DM, and CKD p/w intermittent SOB and exacerbation of
non-productive cough.  He was transferred to the MICU for closer
monitoring after admission due to an increase in his oxygen
requirement. He was clearly DNR/DNI, but a trial of CPAP was
thought to be reasonable.
.
1) Respiratory distress: When transferred to the MICU, the
shortness of breath was thought to be most likely due to cardiac
pulmonary edema.  He was also started on empiric antibiotics to
cover a possible pneumonia or bronchitis.  His studies were most
consistent with CHF; a diuresis was begun.  Given the large
doses of lasix that he is on, as well as a SBP in the 90s at
baseline, a lasix drip was started.  He was also tried on CPAP
over his first night in the ICU, which he did not tolerate.  His
lasix drip was continued, with a I/O goal of 1-2L / day during
his first few days. He met this goal, and on two occassions he
required diuril in addition to the lasix drip.  His O2 sats were
initally in the high 80s on 100 NRB and 5L nc; on discharge from
the MICU, his O2 sats are 98-100% on 5L nc.  It is likely that
he will require home oxygen.  He is net a total 7L negative.  He
is currently on his home dose of lasix (160mg PO bid).  He was
also started on digoxin to aid in his forward flow; he has been
therapeutic.
His diuretics were changed to Lasix 120mg PO bid and HCTZ 12.5mg
qd to reduce toxicity of Lasix. He was kept about 300-500cc
negative per day. A work-up for potential amiodarone toxicity
with a Chest CT scan revealed a pneumomediastinum. Pulmonary
services were consulted and did not feel an intervention was
indicated. The patient did not develop respiratory distress.
During the course on the floor we were able to reduce his O2 to
three litres. Since he still has some pulmonary edema, cautious
diuresis can be continued.
Regarding a potential amiodarone toxicity we consulted the CHF
service. The recommendation was that amiodarone was initially
started for atrial flutter in the history of the patient.But the
patient was in sinus rhythm on the floor with no signs of
palpitations. CHF service felt comfortable that amiodarone could
be discontinued since there was no indication to use it at this
point. Since it was also the recommendation of the pulmonary
service not to use amiodarone anymore if not necessary, we
discontinued amiodarone before discharge. The patient is
discharged to rehab requiring oxygen at three litres and O2
saturations of 98-100%.
.
Cardiomyopathy/Heart failure: TTE [[**12-14**]] and repeated again
[[**8-9**]]demonstrated EF 15%-20%. He is followed closely by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] as an outpatient.  Given his acute decompensation (no
clear etiology), his coreg was held.  His hydralazine was also
held as his SBP would dip to the mid 80s.  On the last two days
of ICU stay, his hydralazine was restarted, and he was placed
back on his home dose of lasix. His coreg will most likely need
to be restarted as an outpatient. On the floor the patient
maintained baseline systolic pressures around 90mmHG, so we
discontinued hydralazine.
.
2) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has defibrillator, and was rate
controlled with BB and amiodarone. He remained in NSR during
most of the stay in the ICU.  His rate was well controlled with
amiodarone. Pt had INR of 6.9 2days PTA, and instructed to hold
coumadin. His INR was 4.6 on adm
