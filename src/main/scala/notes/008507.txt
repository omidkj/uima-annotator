[**2121-8-5**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Limited hemodynamics showed moderately elevated
central aortic pressure.
2. The left ventriculography at [**Doctor Last Name **] view showed severely reduced

systolic function  with predominantly anterolateral and apical
hypokinesia. The LVEDP was moderately elevated.
3. Coronary angiography revealed diffusely irregular coronary
vessels
with  the LAD and the RCA vessels showing significant
narrowings. The
LMCA had no significant lesions. The LAD was diffusely irregular
with
20-30% narrowings throughout the vessel. The mid vessel has a
70%
lesion. The diagonal branches are small calibre and short. The
LCx has
no hemodynamically significant lesions. The RCA is dominant.
There is a
proximal 70% lesion.  The vessel is subtotally occluded at the
origin of
the RV branch. There is TIMI I flow beyond. THe RV branch has an
ostial 90% lesion. The distal RCA, PDA and PLV are also
collateralised by the left system.

[**2121-8-8**] CXR
Sternal wires, skin staples, and pacemaker leads are unchanged.
There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, but no
overt CHF, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation.

[**2121-8-6**] EKG
Initially rhythm is ventricular paced at rate 90 with large
ventricular pacer spikes followed by cessation of ventricular
pacing which is then followed by A-V paced rhythm with different
pacing morphologies
Since previous tracing of [**2121-8-5**], different pacing morphologies
as described .



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23054**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac
catheterization and surgical revascularization. His cardiac
catheterization revealed a 70% stenosed left anterior descending
artery, a 70% stenosed right coronary artery, a 90% stenosed RV
branch, 2+ mitral valve regurgitation and a severely impaired
left ventricular function. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. He underwent hemodialysis the day prior to
surgery. On [**2121-8-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 23054**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three
vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one,
Mr. [**Known lastname 23054**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated.
Hemodialysis was performed. Aspirin and an ace inhibitor were
resumed. Later on postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 23054**] was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. His drains and pacing wires were removed per protocol.
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with
his postoperative strength and mobility. He resumed his routine
dialysis schedule. Mr. [**Known lastname 23054**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day five. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
