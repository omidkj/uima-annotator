Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
black tarry stools, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
J-tube replacement


History of Present Illness:
87 year old Male with history of chronic GIB, FTT with J-tube
who presents with fever, hypotension and depressed Hct. The
patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2165-10-27**] to [**2165-11-2**]
for treatment of J-tube drainage and fever. During this
admission MDR Klebsiella treated with Zosyn and Vancomycin and
weaned to Bactrim when sensitivities were obtained. His chronic
heal and sacral ulcers were debrided by plastic surgery and
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery but were not thought to be his source of fever
with all blood cx negative. He now presented on [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-19**]
with tarry stools and fever. Pt is known to have chronic GI
bleeding evaluated with colonoscopy [**2-18**] and UGI [**9-18**] with no
clear source of bleeding. In the ED he has a temp 101.6 and Hct
was 24.2 which is only 2 points below his baseline with
chronically tarry stools. He received 3L NS and 2U PRBCs and
tachycardia resolved. Ceftaz and Vancomycin were given in the
E.D. for empiric coverage. CXR and CT abd revealed no clear
source of infection but he was changed to vancomycin and
meropenem for broad coverage due to presepsis syndrome and hx of
MDR Klebsiella in the past with now a positive UA. In the MICU
urine cx revealed only yeast and Hct remained stable after
transfusion. He was seen by [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery who debrided his
foot ulcers and NP aspirate was negative for inflenza. GI saw
the patient and felt there was no role for further evaluation of
GI bleeding as there would be no intervention given his
comorbidities.

Imaging
CT Abd w/ Contrast [**11-19**]
1.  Again seen is a J-tube, with the tip positioned within the
proximal small bowel.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction
or surrounding fluid collections.
2.  Small right pleural effusion with resolution of a small left
pleural
effusion.  No other significant interval change in comparison to
the most
recent exam.
3.  Area of ill-defined low attentuation within the right lobe
of the liver with central increased density or calcification
which has been stable in comparison to the prior exams.  Further
evaluation of this with US could be obtained if indicated.
.
CXR [**11-19**] - No evidence of acute infection.
.
J tube repacement tube [**11-22**]
Exchange of a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] catheter for a 24 French MIC
catheter, serving as percutaneous jejunostomy tube.  The tube is
ready to use. It is hope that the shorter length and larger
luminal diameter of the current tube will improve both the
incidence of clogging and the degree of bile leak around the
catheter.
.
CT abd&pelvis w/ J tube contrast [**11-25**]
1.  No extravasation of contrast is seen.  No subcutaneous fluid
or abscess is demonstrated along the J-tube tract.
2.  Unchanged low attenuation lesion in the right lobe of the
liver with
associated hyperdensity that could represent calcification.
Further evaluation could be performed with MRI.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis.
.
J tube check:
No abnormalities are seen to account for the patient's
peri-J-tube leak.  Interventional Radiology options to treat
this leakage at this chronically inflamed entry site appear to
have been exhausted.  Surgical takedown and resiting are
considerations if clinically appropriate.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for GI eval of melena s/p
polypectomy and low-suspicion early sepsis and found to have
osteomyelitis.  He also has a persistently leaking and clogging
J tube that was evaluated on this hospitalization.

1. GI Bleed - Patient with known history of chronic GI bleeding,
s/p duodenal ulcer in the past. EGD performed in [**2165-9-13**]
without obvious source of UGIB. Colonoscopy in [**2165-2-13**] with
diverticulosis and Grade 1 hemorrhoids but no evidence of acute
bleeding, polyp cauterized.  Rec at that time to consider
capsule endoscopy if ongoing bleeding, deferred at that time due
to family wishes.  The patient presented with  HCT 2 points
below discharge value, not significantly below baseline, but
given recent polypectomy, the patient was sent to MICU for GI
eval. 2 PIVs were established, 2 units PRBCs transfused in the
ED, Protonix 40mg IV q12, HCT q 6 hours, held BB given relative
hypotension and NPO pending possible further GI workup.  Once
serial HCTs remained stable, GI decided not to evaluate with
invasive procedures, but rather to follow serial HCTs.  Per GI
report, a capsule endoscopy was also deferred given that a
positive or negative result would not change management.  The
patient was called out to the floor with return to baseline
values and his HCT remained stable throughout the rest of his
hospital course.
.
2. Fever w/ Hypotension - Patient from nursing home with
multiple potential infectious sources including UTI, sacral
decub, ischial and trochanteric ulcers, right heel decub/osteo,
J-tube site.  The patient had a positive UA on admission, which
was thought to be the most likely source of infection, but it
grew only yeast.  CXR was unremarkable, CT of abd/pelvis failed
to explain sx.  Given prior UTI with multi-drug resistant
Klebsiella and the fact that patient initially met SIRS criteria
given RR, HR, Temp, WBC, he was covered broadly with vancomycin
and meropenem for most osteomyelitis. Per ID service
recommendations, the patient will complete a [**4-18**] week course of
vancomycin and meropenem for presumed osteomyelitis (multiple
ulcers probe to bone).  Per [**Month/Day (3) 1106**] service, the patient is not
a candidate for amputation.  The wound nurse has recommended
detailed, [**Month/Day (3) **] change instructions for his ulcers which
allows for decreased frequency of [**Month/Day (3) **] changes (daily
changes instead of [**Hospital1 **] changes) in order to decrease frequency
of painful [**Hospital1 **] changes without compromising hygiene.
