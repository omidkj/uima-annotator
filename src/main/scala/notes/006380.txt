HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 56-year-old woman was
admitted with a COPD flare.  She has a history of asthma
since childhood, IGA deficiency, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (predominantly emphysematous) for five to
ten years.  Her most recent PFTs in [**2199-10-27**] revealed
an FEV1 of 1.5 liters (61% of predicted) and FEV1/FVC of 73%
of predicted.  She has never required intubation for her
pulmonary conditions.  She receives IV Ig q. four to six
weeks for her IgA deficiency; her latest dose was [**2200-4-8**].

She was in her usual state of health until about two weeks
ago when she developed shortness of breath, wheezing, and
cough productive of green sputum.  She saw her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **], on [**2200-5-8**] and was prescribed prednisone at
tapering doses and amoxicillin.  In the interim, she has had
continued symptoms which have necessitated her using her home
Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments q. three
hours.  She denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal
pain, and dysuria.

In the ED, the patient was noted to be tachypneic and poorly
responsive to nebulizer treatments.  An ABG on room air
returned 7.55/27/54.  The patient was placed on noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation to reduce her work of
breathing.  She received doses of methylprednisolone and
levofloxacin.  She was taken off of the noninvasive positive
pressure ventilation because of discomfort and has been
tachypneic but stable since.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  COPD.
3.  IgA deficiency.
4.  History of pneumococcal pneumonia.
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post MI times three,
catheterization in [**2198-6-27**] revealing 80% circumflex
lesion stented and 80% lesions in the first and second
diagonals.  No systolic or diastolic dysfunction (LVEF 58%).
6.  Osteoporosis complicated by vertebral compression
fracture and multiple rib fractures.
7.  Diverticulosis.
8.  Depression.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 10 mg q.d.
2.  Budesonide.
3.  Salmeterol.
4.  Albuterol.
5.  Ipratropium.
6.  Lisinopril.
7.  Atorvostatin.
8.  Calcium.
9.  Tramadol.
10. Acetaminophen.
11. Multivitamin.
12. Venlafaxine modafinil.
13. Ranitidine.
14. Potassium chloride 60 mg q.d.
15. Mylanta.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim and tetracycline.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone but is planning to
move in with her daughter in a house in two months.  She
previously smoked approximately 40 pack years but has not
smoked over the past two years.  She denied alcohol use.  She
is grieving the death of her husband and mother.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.1, heart rate 100, blood pressure 146/91, respirations 28,
oxygen saturation 93% on room air.  General:  Thin,
anxious-appearing woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  The
sclerae were anicteric.  The pupils were equal, round, 3 mm
and light reactive.  The oropharynx were somewhat dry.  Neck:
JVP not elevated.  Carotid pulses were 2+.  Lungs:  Resident
to percussion bilaterally.  Diffuse bilateral expiratory
wheezes.  Heart:  Slightly tachycardiac, regular rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Scaphoid, soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present.  Extremities:
Warm, well perfused.  No edema.  Neurologic:  Alert, speech
fluent, thought content appropriate.  Moving four extremities
spontaneously.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA: White blood count 12.1, 90%
neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 45.4, platelets
425,000.  Sodium 128, potassium 4.6, chloride 96, bicarbonate
21, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 148, anion gap 11.

Chest radiograph demonstrating hyperinflated lungs, no
infiltrates, multiple rib fractures.

EKG revealed sinus tachycardia, rate 110, isolated PVC,
inferior Q waves, left atrial enlargement, poor R wave
progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further close monitoring.  She was
treated for her COPD flare with Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV q. eight
hours, continued inhalational steroids, Salmeterol, and
p.r.n. Atrovent and Albuterol.  She was placed on a course of
azithromycin for possible underlying infection.  The patient
had subjectively improved shortness of breath, no wheezing,
and reduced cough throughout her time in the Intensive Care
Unit.  She did not require additional ventilatory support.

By day number two of admission, the patient was maintaining
oxygen saturations of 95% on room air.  Her lung examination
was improved with lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

The patient was continued on lisinopril and Atorvostatin for
her coronary artery disease.  She was restarted on aspirin at
81 mg q.d. because she did not have any contraindications to
this medication. She was notably mildly hyponatremic on
admission, a finding attributed to hypovolemia.  Her sodium
trended up to a level of 130 on hospital day number two after
she received intravenous fluids.  The patient was continued
on her outpatient medications for osteoporosis, chronic pain,
and depression.

She was discharged with instructions to complete an oral
steroid taper as well as antibiotic course for her COPD flare
and return to the Emergency Department for worsening dyspnea,
wheezing, productive cough, or fever.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

fracture and multiple rib fractures.
6.  Depression.
