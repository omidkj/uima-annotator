Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
recent fall, possible shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Difficult to obtain history due to language barrier.
.
This is an 82 yo Cantonese speaking female with a hx of CHF,
DM2, and afib who presents from rehab after an unwitnessed fall
4 days ago. Noted to right neck echymosis today, extending onto
the left side. There may have also been some dyspnea per report.
However, per her son in the [**Name (NI) **], she had no complaints but seemed
more confused on the day of admission.
.
On presentation to the ED, initial vitals were 97.9 84 156/123
24 85% on RA. However, pleth on her O2 sat was very difficult to
obtain throughout her stay and likely unreliable. CT Head was
negative and CT c-spine showed spinous process fractures. CXR
showed old cardiomegaly and questionable LLL infiltrate. U/A
showed a UTI. She received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
vancomycin to treat UTI and ? PNA. She was maintained on a NRB
and per report desatted when taken off NRB. However, her pleth
remained very irregular. Due to hypoxia requiring a NRB, she was
admitted to the ICU for further care.
.
Review of systems is not able to further be obtained due to
language.

CT head [**3-20**]:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Sinus disease, likely inflammatory in etiology.

CT C-spine [**3-20**]:
1. Transverse fractures through the spinous processes of C2
through C6. Right posterior neck hematoma, incompletely
assessed.
2. Severe multilevel degenerative disease with moderate central
canal stenosis, which predisposes this patient to spinal cord
injury with minor trauma. In the appropriate clinical context,
consider MR for further characterization.
3. Large multinodular goiter.

MRI c-spine [**3-26**]:
1. Large linear fluid collection within the epidural space,
beginning at approximately C3-C4 extending into the visualized
upper thoracic spine is most suggestive of epidural hematoma.
2. Multilevel cervical spondylosis as described above. There is
moderate-to-severe canal narrowing at the C6-C7 interspace
related to a combination of disc osteophyte complex and more
focal component of epidural hematoma at this level. No definite
cord edema is identified, although the exam is somewhat limited
on the fluid-sensitive sequences.
3. Slightly increased signal within the C7 and T1 vertebral
bodies in conjunction with mild anterior soft tissue swelling at
this level is concerning for traumatic vertebral body fractures.
No significant loss of vertebral body height or retropulsion of
bony fragments is noted at the levels.
4. Diffuse edema within the posterior spinal tissues related to
known spinous process fractures. Limited ability to assess the
anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments related to motion
artifact on current study, however, no definite discontinuity is
identified.
5. Moderate canal stenosis at the C4-C5 interspace,
predominantly related to disc osteophyte complex and focal
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at this
level.

CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked cardiac enlargement, unchanged, likely reflecting a
combination of cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion, as seen on
prior CT from [**2180-9-19**]. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
2. Retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis. An
infectious
etiotoly is not excluded and clinical correlation is
recommended.
3. No displaced fractures identified.

TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There are torn tricuspid
valve chordal structures seen prolapsing across the valve and
into the right atrium. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined due to the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation. There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe tricuspid regurgitation with evidence of
right ventricular volume overload. Markedly dilated right
ventricle with mild global hypokinesis. Preserved left
ventricular systolic function. Small circumferential pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-19**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 82F with chronic dCHF, severe TR, DM2, and CKD who presents
from rehab s/p fall with confusion, hypoxia, C-spine fractures,
pyuria

.# Cervical spine Fractures: Per trauma, no acute management
needed.  MRI also shows cervical spine epidural hematoma but
neurologically remains intact. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**], it is okay for
pt to be on coumadin as long as she is not supratherapeutic.
Plan is for soft collar x 4 weeks.  She has follow-up in spine
clinic next week with plain films ordered.

# Confusion: Initially presented with confusion s/p fall and
?hypoxia vs. UTI. The true etiology is unclear at this point as
pt got broad spectrum abx in ICU initially. Currently pt knows
she is in a hospital and thinks it is [**2180-3-14**], she recalls
recent events accurately and does not appear confused/delirious.
She likely has underlying dementia. Per family, pt is much
clearer than when she first presented to hospital

#. ? Hx of Hypoxia: Unclear if hypoxia was true or a measurement
artifact. ABGs in the ICU support good oxygenation.  Sometimes
difficult to get accurate O2 [**Location (un) 1131**] on finger; much more
reliable with a forehead monitor.  No evidence of infection.
Stable on RA now.  No clinical signs of
