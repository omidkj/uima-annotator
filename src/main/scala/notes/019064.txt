Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis, [**2129-4-13**]

History of Present Illness:
87M with h/o HTN, h/o bladder ca, who presented to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] ED on [**3-30**] with abdominal pain.  He states the pain was
located in the RLQ, acute in onset, constant, sharp, not crampy.
 It began at ~12:30pm this afternoon and has been steady since
then.  He has had some nausea and one episode of vomiting at the
OSH.  He denies diarrhea, and notes 1 small BM today.  He denies
fever and chills at home.  He has had no recent illnesses and
denies sick contacts.
.
In the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED, his VS were T 97.5, BP 160/80, HR 78, RR
20, O2sat 96% RA.  He had mild RLQ tenderness on palpation.  His
labs showed leukocytosis (13.2) and bandemia (14%), Hct 43.5,
mildly elevated LFTs including total bili 1.1, amylase 2400, and
lipase [**Numeric Identifier 2249**].  He was sent for a non-contrast CT abd/pelv which
showed (per [**Hospital1 18**] Radiology review) thickened edematous
gallbladder with surrounding fat stranding, stranding around the
head of the pancreas, grossly normal-appearing biliary and
pancreatic duct system, extensive fat stranding throughout the
abdomen.  RUQ US was also performed, unknown findings as no
documentation and report is still pending. He was given toradol
15mg IV, morphine 2mg IV x1, morphine 4mg IV x2, levofloxacin
500mg IV, Flagyl 500mg IV, and 2L NS.  He was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] MICU with a diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis.
.
Currently, he continues to complain of [**11-9**] pain.  He states
the pain has now moved to a band-like distribution in the upper
abdomen.  He denies nausea, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, headache, pain or weakness of extremities,
lightheadedness. He denies biliary colic in the past and known
history of cholelithiasis.  He denies EtOH use.  He has no
history of pancreatitis in the past.  ROS positive for some
short-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension- patient does not know the names of his BP meds
2. Bladder cancer- diagnosed 7y ago, pt unclear of treatment
(?intravesical chemo)
3. H/o pneumonia- [**11-5**], hospitalized x 7d in [**Location (un) 1110**]

Social History:

shopping, driving) but states his daughter manages his money; +

Brief Hospital Course:
initial unit stay:
A/P: 87M with HTN, h/o bladder cancer, transferred from OSH with
acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to obstructive
cholelithiasis. Brief hospital course as below, by problems:
.
# Acute pancreatitis: Patient presented with abdominal pain with
elevated pancreatic enzymes, consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Radiographic imaging demonstrated a thickened gallbladder with
pericholecystic fluid and stranding. Given his age and
hematocrit on presentation, there was concern for a high risk of
mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria. He was made NPO and given
aggressive intravenous fluid hydration. His pain and enzymes
improved somewhat and a repeat RUQ US revealed no evidence of
cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. The pt was started on tube
feeds and discharged to the floor with plan for cholecystectomy
in 2 weeks.
Pain and enzymes now improving. Currently thinking that
pancreatitis is secondary to choledolethiasis but with elevated
LFTs returning to baseline no role for ERCP. Abdomen remains
distended without stool since admission.

Respiratory Distress:
  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had been developing worsening abdominal distention
with increasing leukocytosis and increasing lethargy on the
floor and was transferred back to the MICU.  At the time of
transfer to the ICU, his ABG was consistent with respiratory
acidosis and he was intubated.  After intubation he became
hypotensive, not responding to 3L IVF and requiring levophed.
This was initially weaned off, however during his course in the
ICU he became repeatedly hypotensive requiring levophed and was
difficult to wean.  He had severe total body anasarca however
given his low blood pressure he was unable to tolerate diuresis.
 Levophed was finally weaned about three days before he was
called out of the unit and the patient's BP remained stable.
  The patient required prolonged intubation and had increased
secretions. He was treated for presumed ventilator associated
pneumonia.  Overall he was treated with vanco/zosyn for a total
21day course.  After failing two spontaneous breathing trials,
the patient was suddenly improved in terms of his
ventilation/oxygenation and passed spontaneous breathing trial.
He was successfully extubated on [**4-26**] and was weaned to nasal
cannula without event. He was then transferred to the floor and
shortly after developed persistent respiratory distress. No
intervention was made as the pt was CMO and he expired the next
day.

- ascites: Prior paracentesis had been consistent with SBP and
he had been on vanco/zosyn antibiotics. Flagyl and fluconazole
were added empirically onreturn to the unit, however these were
stopped after about 4 days as no source was discovered.  His
ascites were tapped with ultrasound guidance, however only 60cc
could be removed, thought likely due to loculation of the fluid.
Cell count was negative for SBP and culture of the fluid was
negative.

- pancreatic pseudocyst: CT abdomen obtained at the time of unit
transfer revealed large ascites and a new 6.6cmx6.7cm fluid
collection in the gastrosplenic ligament extending towards the
pancreas. Omental studding was not seen on this study.  The
peri-pancreatic fluid was not considered amenable to
percutaneous drainage and surgery was consulted.  They felt this
imaging was consistent with pancreastic pseudocyst and did not
suspect infection of this pseudocyst. They recommended repeat
imaging in 6 weeks with outpatient surgical follow up for
possible surgical drainage at that time if persistent fluid
collection.  GI was also consulted and they felt that this was
possible not a pseudocyst but rather more loculated ascites.
They recommended repeat CT in one week to assess for change in
appearance. Repeat Ct abdomen was consistent with pancreatic
pseudocyst and a slight decrease in the size of his ascites as
well as the pseudocyst.

- recurrent fevers: The patient developed recurrent fevers of
unknown origin despite greater than two weeks of vanco/zosyn.
Repeat paracentesis had been negative for SBP, blood, urine and
sputum cultures were negative. CXR showed no new pneumonia.  His
PICC as well as central line were pulled.  Despite the fevers,
his white count actually steadily decreased and his hemodynamics
improved.  It was postulated that his fevers may have been drug
fevers, and in fact after completing his 21 day course of
vanco/zosyn his fevers decreased. He was afebrile x 3 days at
the time of call out from the ICU.

- Code Status: We had several discussions with the patient's
family during his course. Initially the patient had walked in to
the hospital on his own, having lived independe
