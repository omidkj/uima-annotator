History of Present Illness:

shortness of breath today after receiving a blood x-fusion at
her oncologists office the day prior to admission.  Per her

97% on 4L, 101.4, 160/90, HR 144.  A CXR showed a stable left
pleural effusion and progression of a right pleural effusion.
She was intubated due to resp distress and given one dose of
cefepime and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Of note she had a recent
admission ([**Date range (1) 97780**]) for dyspnea which seemed to improve
without major intervention - left thoracentecis revealed an
exudative effusion with negative cytology.

Screen negative for Paraflu 1,2,3, Flu A,B, and RSV.

Imaging:
[**2-20**] CXR:
Stable left loculated effusion and progression of right pleural
effusion. Underlying consolidation cannot be fully excluded.
.
[**2-21**] Chest CT:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Increased metastatic disease within the chest with increased
moderate
bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left), slightly
increased
infiltrative soft tissue in the right hilum encasing pulmonary
vessels and
segmental bronchi, slightly increased size of several pulmonary
nodules, and opacity in the left lower lobe representing
atelectasis and/or consolidation.
3. Unchanged widespread osseous metastatic lesions.



Brief Hospital Course:
51yo F with widely metastatic breast cancer with recent history
of increasing shortness of breath admitted for dyspnea requiring
intubation.
.
# Dyspnea:
The initial DDx in the ICU included reactive airways as she
sounded wheezy on exam, fluid overload given recent transfusion,
TRALI, cardiac ischemia, progression of lymphangitic spread of
pulmonary metastastases, thromboembolic disease given fairly
acute onset of symptoms, and an atypical or community acquired
pneumonia.  A chest CT was negative for a PE but did show
progression of her metastatic disease and some areas of ground
glass opacity.  A flu test was negative and a sputum sample
showed only sparse oropharyngeal flora.  She was ruled out for
MI with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Sx were ultimately
thought to be [**1-10**] RAD [**1-10**] a viral infection + perhaps a
component of fluid overload + perhaps lymphangitic spread of
known CA.
.
She was extubated on [**2-21**] after only one day of intubation and
required minimal supplementary oxygen.  She was treated with a
course of azithromycin.  She was treated with inhalers for
symptomatic wheezing.  She was also gently diuresed.  Symptoms
improved with these interventions.
.
# Metastatic breast CA: Her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] followed
throughout her course.
Overall prognosis quite poor, there are likely few therapeutic
modalities left.  Pt. was asked to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**]
after discharge.
.
# Diabetes:
Her outpatient glipizide was continued but her avandia was held
as this has a side effect of edema and congestive heart failure.
 She was also covered with a regular insulin sliding scale.
.
# Depression:
She was continued on zoloft and wellbutrin per outpatient
regimen.
.
