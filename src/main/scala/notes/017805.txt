Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
52 y/o woman with severe systemic sarcoid, ESRD on HD (Tu, Th,
Sa), home O2 3.5L for sarcoid and pulmonary hypertension,
presents with shortness of breath. She was in her usual state of
health until 3AM this morning when she awoke from sleep with
painful leg cramp. She sat up in bed and shortly after became
suddenly short of breath. She tried increasing her oxygen to 8L
without relief. Shortness of breath persisted and she presented
to dialysis this morning, where because of respiratory distress
and hypoxia, she was transferred to the ED prior without a
dialysis session completed. She last received dialysis on
Saturday (3 days prior to admission) and today is 55.3kg
(baseline dry weight 51kg). She denies chest pain, palpitations,
cough, or shortness of breath. She had a low grade temperature
of 99F after dialysis on Saturday which resolved spontaneously.

.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.5 119 126/69 26 100% 10l. CXR
showed right pleural effusion. Labs notable for lactate 4.0, Cr
9.9, BUN 47, K 5.9, Trop 0.15. ABG 7.42/34/54. Nitroglycerin
drip was started @ 1mcq/kg/min and she received Vanco/Zosyn. On
Bipap doing well. Albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers started.
Nephrology was consulted and plans on dialysis upon admission.
Vitals prior to transfer: afebrile, HR 110, BP 121/74, RR 26 and
100% on Bipap FiO2 50%.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she states her SOB has resolved and she
oxygen saturations are 94% on 4L oxygen via nasal canula.
Nitrolgycerin gtt was stopped. Temperature is 101. She endorses
a headache, but no vision changes or neck stiffness. She has
mild nausea, but no vomitting. Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea,
melena/hematochezia. She does not make urine. Her leg cramping
has resolved. She is alert and oriented and able to detail past
medical history and events leading up to admission. She reports
a similary event with SOB happened 1.5 years ago, increased
prednisone and symptoms resolved during hospitalization.

grandchildren. Prior to being medically disabled from
her illness she was a substance abuse counselor.

Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
[**Year (4 digits) 4459**]: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: supple, no LAD
CV: RRR @100bpm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 SEM at LLSB
Lungs: decreased breath sounds on right [**1-28**] way up, coarse
crackles at left base, no wheezes or rhonchi
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no HSM
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema, fistula right upper extremity with thrill
Skin: vitiligo on lower extremities bilaterally
Neuro: 5/5 strength bilaterally, no sensory deficits, CN grossly
intact


Pertinent Results:
[**2187-10-31**] PORTABLE CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**10-30**], there are even lower lung
volumes. Extensive opacification is seen on the right in a
patient with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
pulmonary edema. Findings are consistent with layering pleural
effusion, though the possibility of developing superimposed
consolidation can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
[**2187-10-31**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure overload. The diameters of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with global hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary
hypertension. Normal left ventricular regional and global
systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo F with severe systemic sarcoidosis, ESRD on HD, home O2
3.5L for sarcoid and pulmonary hypertension, presents with
shortness of breath.

# ACUTE on CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Initially admitted with
hypoxia and dyspnea, related to pulmonary edema and pleural
effusions. She also had a 4kg weight gain up from 51kg dry
weight. Unclear what the etiology of the pulmonary edema is,
though it is possible this has been a chronic worsening
condition. She was admitted to the MICU with bipap and a nitro
drip, but nitro was quickly stopped. She underwent hemodialysis
with ultrafiltration and removal of 3+ liters. Her symptoms
resolved significantly and she was called out to the floor. On
the floor, she felt her dyspnea has improved to better than she
had been in weeks. She underwent dialysis again and then was
discharged home.
.
# FEVER: She spiked a fever to 101 in the MICU on admission. No
specific infectious source was identified. She was started on
vanc/ceftaz/azithro for coverage of a possible pneumonia, given
her fluid overloaded xray that could not rule out pna. She
remained afebrile with a normal WBC throughout her admission.
When her fluid had cleared, a repeat CXR showed no consolidation
or pneumonia. IV antibiotics were stopped. She was discharged
home with levaquin to complete a 7 day course. Blood cultures
showed no growth to date but were pending on discharge.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Hypotensive to the 80s while on dialysis. She had
received her anti-hypertensive medication the day prior, so this
was assumed to be in the setting of ultrafiltration with
lingering anti-hypertensives. The blood pressure normalized
without intervention.
.
# HYPOXIA: Overnight in the MICU she
