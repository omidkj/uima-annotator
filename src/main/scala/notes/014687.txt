Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
Epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Embolization of right internal maxillary artery
Stenting of right common carotid artery
Open gastric feeding tube placement
Pharyngeal biopsy
PICC placement.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60yo man with history of laryngeal SCC s/p XRT and
total laryngectomy and left modified neck resection, DVT (x2, on
lifelong coumadin) who presents with 2 day history of severe
epistaxis.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until last night he
began spitting up large amounts of red blood that was in his
mouth/throat.  He notes spitting out cupfulls of blood at home.
He initially thought this would pass, but it continued to occur
a total of four times prompting his presentation to the ED.
Patient denied any dizziness/LH or abdominal pain.  Of note, he
had pain in his right neck/jaw and aphasia for the past several
months.  He was recently admitted to the hospital where work-up
demonstrated esophageal stricture (s/p EGD dilation) and
pharygneal diverticulum.  There was no sign of recurrence of his
laryngeal CA.  Of note, he had a PET-CT in [**2176-8-16**] which was
concerning for recurrence in the post-laryngectomy bed and
neopharynx and esophagus.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T- 98.4, HR- 77, BP- 111/66, RR- 20,
SaO2- 99% on RA.  The patient triggered twice in ED for large
epistaxis as he was spitting out large amounts of blood.  He
also spiked a fever in the ED.  While there, ENT scoped the
patient but could not identify a bleeding vessel.  Scope
demonstarted post-radiation changes.  ENT placed a balloon for
tamponade, however, the patient bled again requiring repacking.
There was also a report of a desaturation to 80% and hypotensive
episode to SBP 80s.  He received a dose of vitamin 5 mg, 3 units
of FFP, 5L NS, 1 u pRBC, one dose of vancomycin and morphine for
pain management.  He underwent a CTA neck which demonstrated a
"large area in anterior right neck with gas and fluid (possibly
neohypopharynx from laryngectomy?), common carotid appears
involved and has pseudoaneursym 10x9mm from neck of 5mm."  He
was taken to the IR suite, where carotid was stented.  He was
admitted to the vascular service and then transferred to the
MICU given no plan for surgical intervention.
.
On arrival to the MICU, vital signs were T- 99.2, HR- 72, BP-
122/63, RR- 20, SaO2- 97% on 35% O2.  Patient denied any new
bleeding, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers or chills.


Past Medical History:
Long history of vocal cord dysplasia first identified in [**2157**].
Between [**2157**] and [**2160**] he had multiple episodes of carcinoma in
situ of the larynx that required striping. In [**2160**] he was
diagnosed with microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the
right true cord, stage I. He was treated with definitive
radiation therapy between [**11/2160**] and [**1-/2161**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31966**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]. He did well until [**6-/2171**] when he developed
stridor. An exam under anesthesia on [**2171-7-15**] revealed diffuse
edema of the supraglottic larynx with fullness of the vocal
cord. Biopsies revealed squamous cell carcinoma. He was
considered to have stage III, T3, N0 disease, likely of second
primary origin. In [**10/2171**] he underwent total laryngectomy and
left modified neck dissection. A sternocleidomastoid rotation
flap was used to cover the mediastinal vessels by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**]. Pathology revealed no evidence for regional nodal
disease. However, the laryngectomy specimen contained a 3.5cm
moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the
bilaterl true cords and extending into the subglottis. The tumor
invaded through the thyroid and tracheal cartilages and into the
surrounding soft tissues and skeletal muscles. Soft tissue
resections were negative for tumor, however the tumor was
present 1mm from the anterior and left posterior soft tissue
margins. The epiglottic and aryepiglottic proximal margins were
negative for tumor. The distal tracheal margin was negative.
There was no evidence for angiolymphatic invasion, but peroreal
invasion was observed. Pathology report considered the patient
to have T4b, stage IV squamous cell cancer of the supraglottic
larynx. Surveillance CT of the neck on [**2172-5-23**] revealed a new
left neck mass and a fine needle aspiration revealed squamous
cell carcinoma which was resected.

PERTINENT STUDIES
[**2176-10-30**] CTA Neck - IMPRESSION: 1. A new pseudoaneurysm arising
from the right common carotid artery anteriorly just before its
bifurcation. 2. Soft tissue surrounding the pseudoaneurysm with
multiple foci of gas within. This has increased since the prior
study. The foci of gas extend just below the level of the skin.
This is likely infective in etiology. 3. Soft tissue surrounding
the distal right common carotid artery causing its narrowing.
This likely represents postoperative fibrosis. 4. Thrombosis of
bilateral internal jugular veins. 4. Postoperative changes in
the form of total laryngectomy, left modified neck
dissection,reconstruction flap and tracheostomy.

[**2176-11-9**] CT neck w/ contrast - prelim read - 1. Interval
stenting of right common carotid aneurysm with interval decrease
in pseudoaneurysm. A small focus of hyperdensity (2:101) with
attenuation of the blood pool at the level of the prior
pseudoaneurysm may indicate small residual aneurysm without
connection seen to CCA. 2. Fistulization from oropharynx to the
anterior neck skin surface (2:97-2:125). No adjacent drainable
fluid collection. Resolution of soft tissue gas. 3. New surgical
clip deep to the right zygomatic arch may represent maxillary
artery embolization for epistaxis if there is history of this
(unable to find record of this in OMR). If
