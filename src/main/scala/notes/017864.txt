History of Present Illness:
62-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic
alcoholic pancreatitis, and COPD who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**5-20**] from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for worsening alcoholic hepatitis.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 1562**] from etoh detox the previous week
for lethargy and dark stools, which had evidently been ongoing
for several weeks. At the OSH, was found to have a bilirubin of
3 on admission, AST of 199, ALT of 60, alk phos of 308, GGT of
1611, plts of 68,000. sodium of 117, creatinine of 1.1, and hct
of 11.3. Exam was significant for encephalopathy, distended
abdomen, and heme positive dark stools. Patient was treated with
octreotide, PPI [**Hospital1 **], lactulose, lasix, rocephin (for presumed,
not confirmed SBP) and prednisolone in context of alcoholic
hepatitis. EGD was never performed as patient was deemed too
unstable. Patient continued to decline clinically and labs were
concerning for HRS; as such, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work-up.
.
Since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] her Cr has rapidly worsened from 1.6 to
6.9 despite midodrine, octreotide and albumin. Her renal failure
has been attributed to HRS. She was started on vancomycin and
zosyn for presumed HAP started on [**5-24**]. Vancomycin was stopped
on [**5-25**] but vanco level has been therapeutic since that time
given worsening renal function. Temp HD line was placed [**5-30**].
Plan was to initiate HD today, but patient was hypotensive with
an SBP in the 70s while at HD just prior to starting HD, so she
was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and
consideration of CVVH initiation. Prior to arrival, she received
200 ccs of NS with improved SBP to the 90s.
.
In the ICU, patient is sedated. She states that she is at [**Hospital 61**] to pick up her husband. She states the year is [**2140**]. She
is unable to provide any additional history.
.
Review of sytems:

CXR [**5-29**]:
1. Ill-defined opacities bilaterally at the lung bases, improved
since [**2148-5-23**], similar to [**2149-5-27**], possibly from
aspiration. 2. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis at the
lung bases. 3. Small left pleural effusion. 4. Stable mild
cardiomegaly.
.
RUQ u/s [**2149-5-22**]:
Patchy echogenic hepatic echotexture and reversed flow in the
portal veins and splenic vein suggesting the presence of a
splenorenal shunt. The findings are consistent with cirrhosis
and portal hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62-year-old woman with a pmhx. of alcohol abuse,
chronic pancreatitis, and COPD who presented from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with worsening alcoholic hepatitis and likely
hepato-renal syndrome. The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and progressive renal
failure with signficant uremia along with a hospital acquired
pneumonia. The patient's renal function continued to decline
despite treatment for hepato-renal syndrome. A temporary HD line
was placed in her right IJ and, on [**5-31**], the patient went to HD
where her SBPs declined to the 80s with acute worsening of her
mental status. She was transferred to the MICU. Shortly after
arriving to the MICU, the patient's HCP (daughter, [**Name (NI) **]) met
with the MICU and hepatology physicians and expressed a wish for
her mother to be comfortable without escalation of care and a
focus on comfort. The patient was made CMO. Her medications were
discontinued aside from morphine and zydis. Her HD line was
removed.
