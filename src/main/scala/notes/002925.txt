Chief Complaint:
Sepsis and hypoxia- direct admit (intubated) from ED

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF Left Femur


History of Present Illness:
77 yo M w/ CAD, HTN, AFIB on coumadin presented to ED today from
rehab when he was found roncherous in acute distress with O2
sats low 66% 2L NC and tachy to 120s. He had cough but no CP. In
the [**Name (NI) **], pt was doing well and ruled out for CTA when O2 sats
fell to 70s and SBP was low in 30s. He was started on Levophed,
intubated and started on Vanc/Flagyl/Zosyn for probable
aspiration PNA. CXR revealed mild failure. He was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], intubated, for further workup.
.
Of note, he was discharged [**12-3**] after an admission for left
Femur fracture/ 5th metatarsal fracture complicated by hypoxic
respiratory failure and a MICU stay and intubation during that
admission. He was found to have an aspiration PNA and discharged
to rehab on Levoquin to complete a 10 day course

.
CXR [**12-4**] IMPRESSION: Bibasilar patchy opacities may represent
atelectasis or aspiration. Peripheral right lung opacity appears
slightly improved, and may represent slowly resolving infectious
pneumonia or, in the appropriate setting, chronic eosinophilic
pneumonia.
.
CT Abd and CTA chest IMPRESSION:
1. New bilateral basilar airspace opacities and associated
pleural effusions. Findings may represent multifocal pneumonia
or aspiration.
2. Slight improvement in peripheral right upper lobe airspace
opacity. As mentioned on plain radiograph examination, this
could represent chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or resolving
acute pneumonia.
3. Small amount of air seen in the peripheral left lobe of the
liver of uncertain significance. There is no evidence of
ischemic bowel. There is no history of biliary intervention.
Close follow up examination is recommended.
4. Large right inguinal hernia containing nonobstructed
ascending colon.
5. Moderate-to-large hiatal hernia. The NG tube terminates
proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced.
6. Extensive soft tissue stranding as described above. These
findings correlate to ecchymoses seen in the left subcutaneous
tissues on clinical exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 77 yo M w/ CAD, HTN, AFIB on
coumadin who presented today in respiratory distress and was
intubated and found to have new bilateral basilar airspace
opacities and associated pleural effusions in setting of
hypotension.

PLAN:
.
# Sepsis: Pts SBP was in the 30s in the ED.  He was intubated
with decreased O2 sats and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was discharged
yesterday to complete a 10 day course of levaquin and flagyl for
possible aspiration pneumonia.  Started on vanco/zosyn for
possible nosocomial PNA for a total of 2 weeks, has 8 more days
at discharge. He was also evaluated by speech/swallow and felt
to have aspiration. He was recommended to continue strict
aspiration precautions, including chin tuck, crushing all large
pills, swallowing twice, and taking a sip from a straw follow
all swallows. To continue speech therapy after d/c.
.
#CAD: Hx of demand ischemia.  Continue Atorvastatin and ASA but
holding antihypertensives initially. Restarted when BP improved.
On a lower dose of metoprolol, which may need to be titrated up
at NH. He was noted to be fluid overloaded as well, and his
lasix dose was increased to 40 mg daily for continued diuresis.
.
#Afib: He was restarted on coumadin after recent surgery.  At
discharge yesterday his INR was 2.7 and his discharge coumadin
dose was 2.0.  On admit INR was 5.1 so coumadin was held, but
was then restarted after INR fell. Will need to have INR
rechecked [**12-11**] for goal INR [**2-3**].
.
#Left Femur Fracture/ 5th metatarsal fracture: S/p ORIF.
He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**
