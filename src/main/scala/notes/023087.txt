Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
56M who presented for admission for a witnessed VF arrest.  He
had recent admission in [**1-29**] for s/p NSTEMI [**1-29**] --> LAD stent.
Of note, he had been started on anticoagulation due to apical
akinesis and risk of thrombus formation.  On [**2135-3-29**] he initially
had a witnessed VF arrest and had presented to [**Hospital3 **].
Defib, intubated, tx for cath at [**Hospital1 18**]. Cath here which was
notable for spotty thrombus in the LAD stent, but normal flow.
Volume overloaded, PA sat 77%.

Cath [**2135-3-29**]:
Preliminary:
1. Hemodynamics with markedly elevated filling pressures with
preserved cardiac index, moderate v-waves in PCW tracing.
2. Left venfriculography: Extensive anterolateral, apical and
inferoapical akinesis. No mitral regurgitation. LVEF 30%.
3. Angiography: LMCA: 40% proximal. LAD: Stent pateint with
several discrete filling defects suggestive of thrombus, TIMI 3
flow. LCx: Proximal LCx arises from LM and supplies OM1 with
mild luminal irregularities. Patient also has anomalous distal
LCx which arises from proximal RCA and has tubular 60%
proximal/mid stenosis (unchanged from [**1-29**]) RCA: 60% ulcerated
proximal, immediately beyond LCx origin.

TTE [**2135-3-29**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior wall and distal half of the septum, distal anterior
wall, and distal lateral wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2135-2-23**], the
regional LV systolic dysfunction is more extensive


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: He underwent cardiac catheterization on admission
showing 60% proximal RCA disease, 60% distal circumflex, and
filling defects in LAD stents.  PTCA of the LAD stents was
performed.  His filling pressures (right and left-sided) were
markedly elevated as well, but his CO/CI were maintained.  He
was continued on ASA, BB, [**Last Name (un) **], and his statin. His coreg and
Valsartan were titrated up as his blood pressure allowed.  He
was deemed a Plavix failure (developed thrombus in his stents
while on this medication), so he was continued on Ticlid instead
while in-house.  He was started on heparin gtt for LV aneurysm
and severe hypokinesis to prevent potential blood clots.  After
extubation, he had fleeting episodes of chest pain (no EKG
changes although hard to interpret with LBBB) and these
subsequently resolved. At the time of discharge he had been
chest pain free for several days. A MIBI may be considered in
the near future if he has recurrence of this chest pain.

2. Pump:  Markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures on
catheterization, and TTE showed EF=20=25% with multiple wall
motion abnormalities.  Swan insertion was inserted but
complicated by complete heart block and torsades, requiring
temporary pacing wire and transcutaneous defibrillation.
Following this, lasix was continued as needed to maintain
euvolemia after initial diuresis on admission.  He was initially
on dobutamine for hemodynamic support but was stable off this
prior to extubation. Beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were continued, and he
remained euvolemic. He was discharged on lasix 20 daily and will
follow up to get labs checked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18693**].

3. Rhythm: He presented status post a presumed v-fib arrest with
resuscitation at home.  After the episode of complete heart
block/torsades (complication of attempt at Swan placement), he
remained in NSR with LBBB.  Per EP, he received defibrillator
when stable and extubated. He was continued on amiodarone. He
will follow up with the device clinic as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].


4. Pulmonary: He was intubated on presentation after his v-fib
arrest.  Lung CT was consistent with bilateral pneumonia (vs
CHF), and he was treated with Levo/flagyl/vanco (10 day course).
 No sputum, blood, or urine cultures were ever positive, and one
sputum sample had gpc in pairs and clusters.  He also underwent
an esophageal manometry procedure, and it was deemed that he
required a higher PEEP given his large chest diameter and lung
process.  Pulmonary was consulted and recommended treating the
?PNA, maintaining higher PEEPS, and CPAP at night
post-extubation.  He was successfully extubated after pneumonia
treatment and diuresis, and he was maintained on CPAP
nocturnally for ?OSA.  He will need to have a sleep study as an
outpatient. The pulmonary department will contact him in the
days immediately following discharge to set this up.

5.  ID/fevers: He was persistently febrile following admission
(initially afebrile), and the source was felt to be pulmonary.
He was treated with a 10 day course of antibiotics as above for
pneumonia with resolution of the fevers.

6. GI: History of GERD with ?duodenal ulcer.  He had initial
drop in hematocrit on admission (?GI bleeding with oozing around
lines), but after initial transfusions, his hematocrit remained
stable.  He was continued on a [**Hospital1 **] protonix regimen.

7.  Neuro: He was seen by neurology in-house for ?anoxic brain
injury given his out of hospital arrest.  He was evaluated pre
and post extubation and felt to have no deficits.  No brain
imaging was deemed necessary.
