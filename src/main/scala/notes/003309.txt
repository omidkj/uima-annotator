Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
post operative ST elevation myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease with past
angioplasty x2, congestive heart failure, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, s/p aortic valve replacement and mitral valve
repair for rheumatic disease, who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-11**] for infected artificial knee
hardware and sepsis. After undergoing resection arthroplasty
[**4-14**] the patient was transferred to the ICU, where she became
hypotensive (SBP 48) with 3mm ST elevations seen in inferoseptal
leads on ECG. CK was elevated >1600 and Troponin T was >50.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cardiac
catheterization. Levophed and dopamine infusions were started
and the patient was intubated upon arrival. In catheterization,
one drug eluting stent was applied to a 80% occluding right
coronary artery lesion without residual flow defect. The patient
became hypotensive and developed ventricular tachycardia during
the procedure requiring addition of a lidocaine infusion,
maximal levophed and dopamine delivery, and balloon pump
placement. She was transferred to the CCU for further management
since her cardiac output was low at 1.8 (CI 1.2 PCWP 18) and she
continued to be hypotensive. Of note, echocardiogram on [**2170-4-3**]
showed dilated LV, severe pulm HTN 70mmHg, moderate MR, mild TR,
LVH, and normally functioning porcine AV.  Ejection fraction was
normal and no wall motion abnormalities were seen.

Past Medical History:
coronary artery disease with past angioplasty x2, congestive
heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, s/p aortic valve
replacement and mitral valve repair for rheumatic disease,
chronic renal insufficiency and acute renal failure, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation (retroperitoneal bleed on coumadin [**10-2**]),
chronic anemia, COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, lacunar infarct,
cortical atrophy, facial droop, peptic ulcer disease [**1-31**] NSAIDS,
diverticulosis, short bowel syndrome, neuropathy, recurrent
UTI/pyelonephritis caused by Serratia and Klebsiella, s/p
colectomy [**2167**] for bowel ischemia, s/p ileostomy for recurrent
lower GI bleeding, s/p bilateral total knee replacement c/b
recurrent infection of the right knee (s/p incision and drainage
[**5-2**] for infection with klebsiella, proteus, e.coli),
degenerative disc diasease, s/p appendectomy, s/p
cholecystectomy, s/p hysterectomy, s/p tracheostomy

Social History:
home health services living with daughter [**Name (NI) **]

Family History:
father and brother died of MI

Physical Exam:
The patient was unresponsive and found to be breathless,
pulseless, and without heart tones, blood pressure, and corneal
reflexes.  The patient was pronounced dead at 0515  on [**2170-4-15**].
The patient's private physician and family were notified.  They
refused anatomic gifts and autopsy.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with multiple medical problems who developed
an acute myocardial infarction after orthopedic surgery at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Cardiovascular-She had known coronary disease with prior
angioplasties as well as atrial fibrillation and valvular
disease. At the OSH, the patient became hypotensive with signs
of inferoseptal myocardial infarction on ECG. At [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient received one stent that fully opened an 80% lesion in
the proximal right coronary artery. No flow limiting disease was
seen in in the LCX or LAD.  However, the patient developed
hypotension and required intubation plus pressure support with
monitoring in the ICU. In spite of aggressive care on levophed,
dobutamine, vasopressin, and lidocaine; the patient became
increasingly bradycardic and expired approximately 6 hours after
admission to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was given plavix and aggrastat. Calcium
and electrolytes were repleted.
.
Pulmonary-Intubated for airway protection. Fentanyl and versed
infusions for sedation. She developed lactic acidosis (lactate
7.9) with respiratory compensation. Bicarbonate supplementation
was given without significant improvement.
.
Renal- At baseline Cr 1.4. Medications were renally dosed.
.
Musculoskeletal- The patient was status post right knee
resection arthroplasty with drain in place for recurrent right
knee prosthetic infections. Fluid analysis identified many PMNs
but no organism on gram stain. Preliminary cultures grew gram
negative rods resembling Serratia. It was sensitive to
ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin,
imipenem, levoquin, bactrim, and augmentin. Resistant to
ampicillin, piperacilliin, tetracycline, and cefazolin.
Infectious disease consultation at the OSH had started
ceftriaxone 2g IV and vancomycin 650mg IV daily, which was
continued at [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient did not have fever but developed
a post MI leukocytosis.
.
GI-Iliostomy care.
.
FEN: NPO, albumin at OSH 2.9, hypocalcemia cCa 7.9/free Ca
1.08(Ca 9.6->7), hypomagnesemia. Repleted Ca and Mg.
Supplemented sodium bicarbonate for acidosis.
.
MRSA  and aspiration precautions.
.
Access: Femoral line and left portacath in place. Left radial
arterial line placed at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Code: Full
.
HCP is her daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39202**] W[**Telephone/Fax (1) 39203**],
who was present at the time of death.
