Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization x 2


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old male with history of type II DM, HTN,
atrial fibrillation on coumadin , s/p CABG and s/p nephrectomy
who presents for pre-hydration prior to elective cardiac
catheterization.
.
The patient states that about 6 months ago he started to have
chest pain. The pain is midline at about the level of the
sternal angle. He describes it as sometimes a heaviness and
sometimes "almost sharp." The pain is associated with shortness
of breath but he denies nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis. At
first the pain was present when doing activities that he
described as "small exertion," such as brushing teeth, getting
out of bed and shaving; however, he did not feel the pain with
activities requiring "great exertion," such as walking or
lifting 5-lb weights. Over the last several weeks, he began to
have the pain occaisionally when he was at rest. It lasted [**6-13**]
minutes and was not releived by nitroglycerin. He has not had
any pain this past week, but he attributes this to the fact that
he has not been moving around much as advised by his
cardiologist. The patient's last catheterization was at this
hospital when he was admitted for NSTEMI in [**2127**]. At that time
he had severe shortness of breath at rest. He says that the
symptoms he is having now are not reminiscent of his prior heart
attack. Recent past medical history is notable for a 5-day
hospitalization for pneumonia.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, increased ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO [**11-25**]
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the anterior septum, anterior wall and apex. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40
%). A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with
akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall and apex. The mid
inferior wall is probably mildly hypokinetic. Overall image
quality is poor and the lateral wall is not well seen. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Biatrial dilatation.

CATH [**11-28**]:
PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography revealed a long 70% proximal
lesion in the SVG-OM and a 95% stenosis in the mid-graft.  There
was
also a 80% mid RCA lesion.  We planned to treat these lesions
with PTCA
and stenting.  Bivalirudin was given prophylactically. Starting
with the
SVG, as 6F Hockey Stick guide provided good support.  A Choice
PT ES
wire was advanced without difficulty.  The anastomosis of the
SVG-OM was
predilated with a 1.5mm and then 2.5mm balloon at low pressure.
A 4.0
Spider protection device was then placed in the distal graft and
the
mid-vessel stenosis was predilated with the 2.5mm balloon.  A
4.0x15mm
Promus DES was deployed at 18atm.  A 4.0x28mm Promus DES was
then
delivered to the proximal lesion and deployed at 20atm.  At this
point,
IVUS was performed and demonstrated good stent strut apposition.

  We then turned our attention to the RCA stenosis. A 6F JR4
guide
provided good support. A Prowater wire was advanced without
difficulty.
The lesion was direct stented with 3.5x33mm Cypher DES at 10atm.
 IVUS
was again performed and demonstrated good strut apposition.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow, and no
apparent
dissection.
COMMENTS:
1. Successful PCI of the SVG-OM with a 4.0x15mm Promus DES in
the
mid-graft and 4.0x28mm Promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 55492**].
2. Successful PCI of the mid-RCA with a 3.5x33mm Cypher DES.
3. IVUS of both vessels revealed good stent strut apposition.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2117**] (LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diag)
