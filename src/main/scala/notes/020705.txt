Admission Date: [**2110-1-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-1-29**]

Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-7**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 58670**] is a 35 [**5-13**] week male infant admitted with
prenatal polyhydramnios, possible congenital heart disease,
and issues of prematurity.

The infant was born to a 33 year old gravida I, para 0 to I
mother with prenatal laboratories significant for:  Hepatitis
B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, blood type O positive, Chlamydia
negative, GC negative, unknown GBS status.

Prenatal course significant for:
1. Concern for cardiac disease.  On 17 week ultrasound on
   [**2109-8-29**] she was noted to have the cardiac right ventricle
   slightly larger in size compared with the left ventricle
   and the heart more in midline than normal.  There was also
   concern of an echogenic bright spot in the left ventricle.
   Subsequent echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1810**]
   had concerns for coarctation due to narrowing and the left
   superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus.
   There was normal function at that time with no effusion.
2. Status post betamethasone times two doses at 30 weeks
   gestation.
3. Unexplained polyhydramnios noted on ultrasound on
   [**2110-1-1**] with AFI of 37.  The prior ultrasound done at 19
   weeks had normal AFI.
4. There had been some concerns of hydrops without ascites
   noted.  There was some liver congestion observed on the
   recent ultrasound with a thickened gallbladder.  There was
   anasarca or thickened skin noted.  No pleural effusions
   with a small pericardial effusion noted on the examination
   on the day of delivery.
5. Adequate growth initially at 46 percent with most recent
   ultrasound more consistent with 60 percent.
6. Normal 46 XY amniocentesis.
7. Septum cavum pellucidum slightly more prominent on [**2110-1-1**]
   ultrasound.  Otherwise normal cerebral features.
8. Ultrasound on [**2110-1-7**] revealed more anasarca as well as
   pericardial effusion prompting delivery.

The infant was delivered by cesarean section with spinal
anesthesia on [**2110-1-7**].  Vacuum assistance was required.  The
infant was 35 6/7 weeks at the time of delivery.  Apgars were
3 at one minute, 6 at five minutes, and 7 at 10 minutes.  He
was noted to require significant pressure support in the delivery
room in order to obtain chest wall movement.  He was also noted
to have decreased activity and poor respiratory effort in the
delivery room. He was intubated and brought to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit for further care.  There was no maternal
fever.  Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery.
Mother had received no medications.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 140, respiratory
rate 50, oxygen saturation 97 percent on 50 percent FIO2 with
saturations of 25/6 at a rate of 30.  Head circumference is
37 cm which is much greater than 90th percentile.  Length of
45.5 cm which is between the 25th and 50th percentile and
weight of 2600 grams which is the 50th percentile.  Four
extremity blood pressures revealed right arm systolic blood
pressure of 78, right leg systolic blood pressure of 65, left
arm systolic blood pressure of 75 and left leg systolic blood
pressure of 60.  In general he appears macrocephalic relative
to the rest of the body.  Anterior fontanelle is open and
full.  He has decreased activity with only slight response during
examination and minimal spontaneous activity.  Eyes closed.
Nondysmorphic facial features.  Cardiac examination revealed
normal S1 and S2 with no murmur appreciated.  Pericardium
with normal activity.  Examination of the lungs revealed
coarse breath sounds.  Chest wall not binding.  Abdominal
examination was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Liver was
difficult to assess due to thickened skin but it is palpable
slightly below right costal margin and not enlarged.
Decreased perfusion of lower extremities compared with upper
extremities and femoral pulses difficult to palpate.  Skin
was slightly thickened.  Petechiae noted over the chest,
abdomen, face and arms.  Phallus appears to be normal male.
Testes descended bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. RESPIRATORY:  Patient was intubated in the delivery room
   and has remained intubated throughout his hospital course.
   Initial chest x-ray had no concerns of lung disease.  On
   day of life number 7 he developed respiratory
   acidosis with an echocardiogram showing significant
   pulmonary hypertension.  Settings were adjusted
   with subsequent improvement in the acidosis.  Follow up
   echocardiogram demonstrated no PPHN and his current
   settings are 24/6 with a rate of 38, FIO2 between 29 and
   35 percent.  His most recent gas was pH of 7.29 with a
   pCO2 of 61, pO2 132.  This was an arterial gas.  The patient
   intermittently breathed over the vent.

2. CARDIOVASCULAR:  Due to concern over biventricular
   function, the differential systolic blood pressures as
   well as differential perfusion in the upper versus lower
   extremities with a prenatal echocardiogram demonstrating
   possible coarctation, prostaglandins were started shortly
   after birth.  An echocardiogram subsequently showed
   decreased biventricular function with a large PDA and no
   coarctation visualized.  Therefore, the prostaglandins
   were stopped and pre and postductal as well as four
   extremity blood pressures were closely monitored.  Pre and
   postductal saturations as well as four extremity blood
   pressures have remained normal.  Serial echos have not
   demonstrated evidence of coarctation of the aorta.

   Due to hypotension dopamine was started on day of
   life number one.  Dobutamine was added on day of life
   number three due to persistent hypotension and follow
   up echocardiogram showing continued but decreased
   biventricular function.  The goal mean arterial pressures
   were 37 to 40.  Due to continued issues with hypotension and
   pressor requirement, digoxin was added on day of life 11
   (without digitalization). Dobutamine was able to be weaned off
   on day of life 14 and dopamine was weaned off on day of
   life 16.  The patient remains on Digoxin twice daily with
   normal blood pressures.  His most recent echocardiogram
   was on day of life 21 showed moderately depressed right
   ventricular function, borderline left ventricular function and
   small (1.8 mm) PDA with continuous left to right flow.

   The patient had an UAC and a UVC placed shortly after birth.
   On day of life seven a left saphenous PICC line was placed and
   the UVC was removed.  The UAC was also removed on day of life
   number 7.  On day of life number 8 a peripheral arterial line
   was placed which was subsequently removed on day of life
   number 20.

3. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been
   NPO for the majority of the hospital course.  Total fluids
   initially were started at 80 cc per kilo per day and
   increased to 150 cc per kilo per day over the course of
   the first week.  Fluids are currently at 140 cc per kilo
   per day due to concerns of excessive weight gain and fluid
   retention.  The patient has received intermittent doses of
   Lasix with good diuresis.  Lytes have [**Last Name (un) 26886**] been within normal
   limits.  Birth weight was 2600 grams.
   Current weight is 3045 grams.  [**Doctor First Name 4051**] was started on
   enteral feeds on day of life 19 with Special Care 20.  At
   maximum he was receiving 20 cc per kilo enterally and the
   remainder was PN/IL with goal calories of 90 per kg per day.
   He is currently NPO on 140 ml/kg/day PN/IL in preparation for
   the operating room.

4. GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 58670**] did develop an indirect
   hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin on day of life
   number four of 14.1.  Phototherapy was initiated on day of
   life number four and stopped on day of life number seven.
   Rebound bilirubin have remained normal.  He did begin
   developing a direct hyperbilirubinemia, maximum direct
   bilirubin was 2.8 on day of life number 18.  This has
   been stable.
