Weakness, abdominal discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
79yo F transferred from [**Location (un) **] ED with chief c/o weakness X
several days and abdominal pain since last night.  She is
currently living at a rehab facility following a recent
admission at [**Hospital **] hospital for pain at site of foot ulcer.
She reports ongoing weekness for the past several days and
generally feeling unwell while at rehab.  She also reports
abdominal discomfort developing last night.  She endorses N/V x1
only in the setting of drinking oral contrast for CT prep today.
 She does endorse diarrhea early this am in the setting of her
abdominal discomfort, but not prior to that.  She denies recent
antibiotics even while hospitalized recently at [**Location (un) **].  She
does also endorse mild dysuria beginning last night, however
denies hematuria.  She denies cough/SOB.  She endorses
subjective fevers/chills.  She has chronic LE ulcers which are
healing since recent peripheral stenting.  She denies
significant drainage nor foul smell from her wounds.  She was
initially transported to [**Hospital **] hospital for evaluation where
she was initially noted to be tachy to 120s (sinus) with initial
O2 sats in the 80s requiring NRB.  There she had noncontrast
abdominal CT which revealed diverticulosis, no diverticulitis
(findings o/w unknown).  At [**Location (un) **] she also had CXR which
reportedly showed ? of pneumonia with effusion.  UA at [**Location (un) **]
was also reportedly as "markedly positive" and WBC count was
30K.  She received 3g IV unasyn at [**Location (un) **] and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her presumed infectious
sources.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.6 BP: 104/64 HR: 59 RR: 22
O2sat: 96%RA.  On labs, WBC count was elevated to 25.4 with 91%
neutrophils, 4% bands.  Lactate was elevated to 4.7.  UA showed
15-20 epis, many bacteria, >50WBCs, RBCs 21-50.  CXR showed
small pleural effusion and atelectasis at the left lung base.
Her HR dipped to the 30s reportedly sinus.  She is on low dose
beta blocker as an outpatient so received glucagon 1mg IV x1 and
calcium gluconate 1g IV x1 without reported change in HR (per
nursing s/o also received atropine 0.5mg x1 however not
documented in ED paperwork).  Pacer pads were placed however HR
improved to the low 60s.  Cardiac enzymes were sent and revealed
trop T 0.19->0.21, negative CK and MB not performed (only sent
x1).  She received aspirin 325mg PO x1.  She received cefepime
2g IV x1, vancomycin 1g IV x1, and flagyl 500mg IV x1.  She
received a total of 6L IVFs.
.
ROS:  As above.  In addition, reports LH briefly in setting of
bradycardia, none currently.  No CP/SOB/palpitations.  No
rashes.  + LLE pain at site of healing ulcers.  No
numbness/tingling/localized weakness.

Social History:

[**Hospital **] hospital; prior to that lived with husband of 60 years.

that.  Very rare EtOH.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
VS:  T 96.7  BP 114/56  HR 68  RR 19 O2sat 96% 2L NC
GEN: NAD, lying in bed, alert and oriented x3, cooperative with
history and exam.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP
clear, MMM
NECK:  Supple, left scar from CEA and without bruit, positive
right sided bruit
CV: RRR, soft systolic murmur LLSB
PULM: clear anteriorly, decreased BS bibasilar, no

Pertinent Results:
Initial ED EKG:  NSR at rate of 64, nml axis, 1st degree AV
delay, QTc 470, low voltage aVL, TWI V1, j point elevation V3.
No baseline EKG with which to compare.
.
Subsequent ED EKG:  Junctional rhythm at rate of 45, biphasic
TWs V1-V3.
.
EKG on [**2186-8-1**]: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Diffuse non-specific ST-T
wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-8-1**] the
rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.
.
STUDIES:
[**2191-7-30**] CXR:  Small pleural effusion and atelectasis at the left
lung base.
.
[**2191-7-30**] Left tib/fib and ankle: No evidence of osteomyelitis.
Probable soft tissue defect at the lateral aspect of the left
ankle with probable subcutaneous gas. Recommend correlation with
site of concern.
.
[**2191-7-30**] CT chest/abd/pelvis with contrast:
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions, fissural fluid, septal
thickening and alveolar ground-glass opacities consistent with
pulmonary edema.
2. Perihepatic free fluid along with significant gallbladder
edema and trace amount of pelvic free fluid compatible with
third spacing in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.
3. Bilateral areas of renal cortical thinning, scarring with
areas of
hypoperfusion corresponding to the scarred cortex indicating
prior
ischemic/infectious insults. In the setting of chronic scarring,
superimposed acute pyelonephritis cannot be excluded and should
be correlated with laboratory/clinical findings.
4. Marked mediastinal adenopathy in the setting of sepsis, could
indicate
reactive adenopathy. However, malignancy/lymphoma cannot be
excluded and
followup CT to evaluate for resolution is recommended.
.
ECHO on [**2191-8-1**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the distal half of the septum and anterior walls and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. No mitral
regurgitation is seen [may be UNDERestimated due to mitral
annular calcification]. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic function c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Very
mild functional mitral stenosis.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND on [**2191-8-3**]
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in contour
and
echotexture without focal lesion. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The gallbladder is normal
without stones or sludge within its lumen. The spleen is not
enlarged. There is no ascites visualized. Bilateral
moderate-to-large pleural effusions are noted.
IMPRESSION: No hepatic parenchymal abnormalities or focal
lesions. Bilateral large pleural effus
