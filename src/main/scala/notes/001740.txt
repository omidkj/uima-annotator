none

History of Present Illness:
60 year old male with pmh of seizure disorder, ESRD on HD (MWF),
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF~20-30%), h/o CAD and CVA,
hepatitis B who presented with hypotension and chest pain from
HD.  Pt was receiving dialysis this am and started to c/o chest
pain.  On arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt denied chest pain, but stated that he
has a headache for 3 days.  Per patient, he fell flat on his
face on Wednesday after receiving dialysis.  He did not loose
conciousness.  Not long after arriving to ED, he was triggered
for hypotension, down to 60's systolic. He reported that he had
on/off chest pain over past 2 days.   PT also c/o non-bloody
diarrhea 4x per day, loss of appetite for 4 days, and has not
been eating, + chills.  PT denies vomiting, sweats, changes in
vision.  Pt feels he is not thinking well as he usually does,
and feels he has had decreased mental status for 2 days.
.
In ED, he was noted to have initial vitals of 96.9 100 138/105
16 100% 4L.  He was noted to have a repeated BP down to as low
as 60s, now in 90s after IVF.  EKG showed sinus @ 90, LAD, LBBB,
no scarbosa.  Exam was notable for multiple small ~1cm sq skin
ulcerations on buttocks near anus.  CT head showed no acute
pathology.   CXR was unchanged from prior.  Guaiac was noted
positive.  Nephrology was consulted and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17159**] will follow.
He was given 1 gram vancomycin, 1 gram ceftriaxone due to the
small pressure ulcer on back and hypotension.  He recieved total
of 2.25 L in 500cc boluses, good BP response to SBP of 96. He
was admitted to MICU for potential sepsis workup.  Access: left
femoral CVL triple lumen and Dilaysis Port Left Chest wall.
Precautions: MRSA and VRE.
.
On the floor, he appears to be in good spirit.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with pmh of seizure disorder, ESRD on HD (MWF),
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF~40-45%), h/o CAD and CVA,
hepatitis B admitted with chest pain and hypotension.  Chest
pain resolved after arrival to the ED and did not recurr.

#Hypotension:
The patient was hypotensive in the setting of taking off excess
fluid in HD.  His pressures responded to volume repletion with
3L IVF.  This extra net negative fluid balance was also
exacerbated by the patient's diarrhea and poor PO intake in the
4-5 days preceding presentation. He continued to have loose
bowel movements while he was in the MICU.  Stool cultures and
OVA/Parasites were sent.  Blood cultures were drawn in the ED,
given the fact that the patient has a HD line and systemic
infection needed to be ruled out in the setting of his
hypotension.  He was started on empiric Vanc and Ceftriaxone in
the unit and was continued on antibiotics until his blood
cultures were negative for 48 hours.  While on the floor the
patient's blood pressures were in the low 100s.  He was
triggered for pressures in the 60s, but it is unclear whether
these readings were accurate. He was completely asymptomatic
during this episode and was mentating normally.  He was bolused
500 cc x2, and his repeat pressures using an automated BP
machine were in the low 100s.  The patient remained in the low
100s during the rest of his admission after his antibiotics were
discontinued.  He also remained afebrile. He will follow up with
Nephrology at which time midodrine may be added if hypotension
continues to be a problem.
.
# chest pain: The patient's chest pain resolved while in the ED
and he was ruled out for MI while in MICU with negative
troponins.  The patient did not endorse chest pain during the
hospitalization.  As per the MICU admission, the patient did
have transient changes in the ED on EKG, but his chest pain has
since resolved.  Cardiology saw the patient and was not
concerned given the lack of symptoms. The patient's troponin
peaked at 0.16 and trended down to 0.14.  Of note, his recent
baseline troponin within last year was 0.12-.014.
.
# diarrhea:  While in the unit, the patient was still having
diarrhea.  Stool cultures and ova and parasite, as well as Cdiff
were all sent.  The patient was started on empiric Flagyl.  Upon
transfer to the floor, the patient was no longer having diarrhea
and his empiric Flagyl was stopped.  He was
