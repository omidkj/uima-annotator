Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 48M w/ ETOH abuse, h/o DT, seizure d/o, p/w ? seizure and
etoh intoxication.
.
#) Fall: Differential included seizure due to ETOH withdrawal
(unlikely given time course) vs underlying seizure disorder vs
non-seizure fall.  CT of head was negative for acute changes or
bleed.  His lamictal was continued for seizure prophylaxis and
Valium was given for CIWA scales greater than 10.  By [**2190-7-20**]
(>96 hrs after last drink) his CIWA scores were less than 10,
and valium was d/ced.
.
#) EtoH abuse: h/o DTs in past.  He was monitored on CIWA scales
(as above) until [**7-20**] with coverage of IV then PO valium.
Thiamine, folate, MVI were continued.  LFTs were checked.   He
was initially monitored in the ICU, then transferred to the
medical floor.
.
#) Psych: Admitted to some degree of suicidality in the
emergency room; later denying suicidality.  Has h/o suicide
attempts and h/o possible bipolar disorder.  Psychiatry followed
him during his admission.  His Adderall and Effexor were held
per psychiatry given his long history of noncompliance (and
potential of abuse of Adderall); he was repeatedly advised to
establish himself with a regular outpatient psychiatrist; he
refused offers of assistance with appointments.  A 1:1 sitter
for suicide precautions was initially used following transfer to
the floor but then D/Ced. He did not have any behavioral
problems during his admission.
.
#) DM: diagnosed during past hospital admission.  He has been
prescribed Metformin in the past but was not taking it at
admission.  Fingersticks were checked with insulin coverage;
then metformin was reinitiated.
.
# HTN: Initally ETOH withdrawal was likely a factor, but he
continued to have elevated BPs.  He was supposed to be on
Metoprolol as an outpatient.  This was reinitiated.
