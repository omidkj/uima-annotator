Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB: resolved with supportive measures. Likley hemorrhoidal
bleed as opposed to upper gi source. required several units of
packed red cells. no recurrent bleeding. can only get hla
matched platelets! tolerating regualr diet

2. MDS: refractory thrombocytopenia. Has requited HLA matched
plts in combo with IVIG on past admission. Here responded to HLA
matched plt transfusion. Hct stable (was transfused). Amicar was
initially held due to renal failure; restarted at low dose. Dose
needs to be slowly increased back to outpatient dose ogf 4 mg po
q6H as Cr improves (may increase to 2 g po q6h if Cr<2
tomorrow). danazol restrted today. We are tapering prednisone
(has been on it for 2 weeks in hope to "stabilize"
thrombocytopenia, but did not help. Needs to continue prednisone
taper

3. s/p MI: Tr 7 on admission in association with inferior T wave
inversions and new inf apical wall HK on echo (preserved EF).
could not get asa or heparin due to severe thrombocytopenia. Tr
trending down. no sxs of ischemia/ht dz. started low dose b-bl.
PT ok.

4. ARF: non-oliguric. likely combo or prerenal--> atn and
atheroembolic dz (C3 low; has eosinophils in urine). has been
getting iv bicarb since bicarb of 9 on admission; started on
bicitra; bicarb improving; Cr improving (2.1 today)

5. ID: had unexplained bandemia. was empirically on ceftriaxone.
Then developed leukocytosis, diarhea and spiked to 101; started
on IV Flagyl for C. Diff (C. diff toxin P). IV rather than po
since not sure how much absorbing po

6. fen: cardiac diet; protonix; pneumoboots

7. FULL code: agrees to be intubated for 2 days if needed8. h/o
H. Pylori; pt was treated with h. pylori with PPI;
clarithromycin and amox. abxs were stopped when pt developed
diarrhea. she completeled close to 10 days of H/pylori therepy
and we thought that risks of continuing abxs in light of C. diff
outweighed the benefits
