Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
corevalve placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2192-7-3**]  Corevalve placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91257**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo caucasian female with h/o CAD s/p LAD
stent in [**2184**] and known aortic stenosis. She reports worsening
shortness of breath after ambulating [**1-23**] block, though noteable

for limited activity due to multiple ortho procedures
necessitating cane. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, or
syncopal episodes, but admits fatigue with doing usual household

activities and shortness of breath when reaching up. She was
seen
in consultation for surgical aortic valve replacement and was
deemed not a surgical candidate due to her history of Childs A
liver disease. She has continued on medical therapy alone and
both patient and family report worsening fatigue and shortness
of
breath of late. She now also admits to chest discomfort after
walking 50 feet, and with light housework. After informed
consent, she was screened for the Corevalve/TAVR. She met all
inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria.
Warfarin was held 4 days prior to admission.
Today, she was taken to the OR and corevalve procedure was
completed under general anesthesia. She had successful placement
of the corevalve device with post-placement TEE in the OR
showing trace peri-valvular aortic regurgitation and also 1+
mild central aortic regurgitation. She recieved 3500 ml of IVF
with production of >1100 cc of urine during the case. Also
recieved 20 mEq of K repletion and 1 unit of pRBCs because of
estimated blood loss of 100 cc at the groin access sites. Was
sedated with propofol and had a muscle relaxant at the start of
the case only.
She was noted to have ST depressions on telemetry during the
case in a V5 lead and then ST elevations when the lead was
changed to V1 position. An EKG on arrival to the CCU showed new
LBBB with expected ST elevations in V1-V3 and ST depressions in
V5-6. She arrives to the CCU intubated and sedated although
opens eyes to voice. Her right femoral groin site is oozing and
left groin site still has femoral sheath in place.

IMAGING:
[**2192-7-5**] POST-COREVALVE ECHO:
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mild (non-obstructive) focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum. Small LV cavity. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI
E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Aortic CoreValve. AVR well seated, normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. [**Male First Name (un) **] of the mitral chordae (normal variant). No
resting LVOT gradient. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild
to moderate ([**1-23**]+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular
cavity is small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biatrial abnormality. Well-seated, normally
functioning aortic CoreValve. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Increased left ventricular filling pressure.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic function.
