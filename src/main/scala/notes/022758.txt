Pertinent Results:
[**2149-11-19**] Intraop TEE
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision.
.
POST-BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function.
Poor echo windows does not allow to rule out possible segmental
wall motion abnormalities.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoraic aorta.
.
[**2149-11-20**] Chest X-ray:
Removal of endotracheal tube and other support and monitoring
devices, with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath
remaining in
place. No visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are
stable in the
postoperative period, improving atelectasis in left lower lobe.
Slight
worsening minor atelectasis at right lung base. Persistent small
left pleural
effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Given Penicillin allergy, she
required Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotic coverage. For
surgical details, please see operative note. Following surgery,
she was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. She maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the cardiac SDU on postoperative day one. She continued to
progress well and worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility.  Her Lopressor and Lisinopril were increased for
better heart rate and blood pressure control. Lantus was also
titrated up for hyperglycemia. On POD5 she was ambulating with
assistance, tolerating a full oral diet and her incisions were
healing well. It was thought that she was safe for transfer to
rehab at this time.  Azathrioprine was restarted upon transfer
to [**Hospital6 **] rehab.  All follow up appointments were
advised.
