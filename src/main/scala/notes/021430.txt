Radiology
[**6-26**] CT abdomen
1. Significant small bowel pneumatosis, mesenteric gas, and
portal venous gas, consistent with small bowel ischemia and/or
necrosis. Most likely secondary to high grade small bowel
obstruction with transition point in the central right lower
abdomen, although entire picture may be secondary to ischemia
alone. Urgent surgical consultation is recommended.
2. Persistent cirrhotic liver with mildly prominent periportal
and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with large volume ascites with
possible layering hemorrhagic component.
3. Bowel wall thickening of the ascending and descending colon,
may represent ischemia, secondary inflammation, or portal
enteropathy.
.
RUQUS [**2110-6-23**]:
1.  Large amount of ascites.
2.  Shrunken cirrhotic liver. Splenomegaly.
3.  Patent portal veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56M with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis with
recent hospitalization for encephalopathy and bacteremia who
presented from rehab with 1 week of acutely worsening ascietes.


His MICU course is summarized below.

# Acute abdomen, high grade small bowel obstruction: Likely
secondary to cirrhosis; patient denied recent medication changes
and had been eating a stable, presumably healthy diet at rehab
prior to admission. There was no evidence of  SBP on diagnostic
paracentesis done in the ED, but it did [**Location (un) 381**] total protein.
The patient underwent a 3L therapeutic paracentesis on [**2110-6-24**].
He tolerated the procedure well, but shortly thereafter started
complaining of nausea.  Over the course of 24 hours, the fluid
re-accumulated, and he became increasingly nauseated, confused,
and somnolent.  His nausea was treated with IV onsansetron Q8H
and IV promethazine without relief, and his pain was treated
with IV dilaudid Q6H, also without relief. 24 hours after the
therapeutic paracentesis, the patient spiked a fever >101,
became tachycardic to the 160's, hypotensive to the 110s
systolic (baseline is 140s), and so was transferred to the ICU
and started on IV zosyn to cover for aspiration and bacterial
perotinitis secondary to the therapeutic para. Pt's nausea
persisted as well as constipation refractory to lactulose. NGT
drained almost a liter. Diagnostic tap was done which was not
consistent with SBP. CT scan revealed high grade SBO and signs
of small bowel pneumatosis, mesenteric gas, and portal venous
gas, consistent with small bowel ischemia and/or necrosis.
Patient underwent urgent ex-lap.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Volume depletion vs. hepatorenal syndrome vs. post-renal
failure.  While on the floor, the patient was found to have a
urine Na<10.  We gave 75g albumin infusion, without improvement,
and gave a second 100g albumin the next day. The patient was
transferred to the ICU before we could gauge his response to the
second infusion.  His lasix and spironolactone we
