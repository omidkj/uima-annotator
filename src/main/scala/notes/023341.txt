ST-elevation myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to LAD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 87 yo [**First Name3 (LF) 8230**] speaking m with HTN, dyslipidemia, who
began having chest pain and back pain at his nursing home at 1
pm. He had elevated CK, and abnormal EKG so he was brought to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at 2 AM. He received 2 SL ntg's prior to arrival.
.
In the ED, EKG showed anterolateral ST elevations, trop 11.3. He
was given ASA 325mg PO prior to arrrival, then plavix 600mg PO,
heparin gtt, and integrillin gtt. He was brought to the cath
lab, found to have a 95% mid LAD lesion, thrombectomy was
performed, and a BMS was placed to the LAD.
.
Pt currently has no complaints and denies CP/SOB.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations. He does have history of syncope and falls.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
[**Known firstname **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1255**] [**Known lastname 20451**] was an 87 year old man who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with an anterolateral STEMI, likely evolving for a time prior to
admission. During cardiac catheterization he was found to have
95% mid LAD thrombotic lesion, which was stented with a bare
metal stent. In the night after the procedure, he was febrile
and hypotensive,  required pressors, and having put in a right
internal jugular Cordis, his Swan numbers suggested cardiogenic
shock with septic contribution. His blood cultures remained
negative but he was treated empirically for possible
hospital-acquired pneumonia (given earlier nursing home stay)
with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. He improved
somewhat from a hemodynamic point of view, improving his
apparent forward flow, and remaining afebrile after the first
days of his admission.
.
However, his mental status waxed and waned and he did have some
problems with sundowning; as the admission went on, it became
also clear that he became less responsive and more confused when
dopamine was turned off, including agitation that was only
mildly responsive to anti-psychotic treatment (olanzapine) and
required soft restratints for a time to prevent the patient from
pulling out his lines. We pulled his Foley, dressed his RIJ line
so that he could not pull it, and restarted dopamine which had
the effect of reducing his agitation.
.
We continued to make efforts to communicate with the patient
through a [**Name (NI) 8230**] interpreter and through his family.
Additionally, several members of the medical staff (a resident
and the palliative care consulting attending, as well as a
cardiology fellow assisting with a heart failure consult) were
able to have basic communication with him by speaking some
Mandarin, which the patient appeared to be able to understand.
Unfortunately, whether in [**Name (NI) 8230**] or Mandarin, the patient was
not entirely coherent even at this best, and was not able to
communicate much in the way of history or description of current
state; his family members said they were understanding as little
as a quarter of what he was trying to say.
.
Two echocardiograms early in the admission ([**4-19**] and [**4-20**])
showed diminished ejection fraction (the second showing
LVEF=35%), and apical and mid-left ventricular akinesis, as well
as moderate-to-severe AR and mild-to-moderate MR.  It is likely
that his valvular disease decreased his forward flow more than
his LVEF would indicate, given that his cardiac output when
measured by Swan was generally quite low, and he was
dopamine-dependent for most of the admission. We found that even
when we attempted to reduce afterload in conjunction with
reducing dopamine, his mental status deteriorated and he became
barely responsive when not on dopamine during the second week of
his admission. Additionally, in consideration of the possibility
of hospice we contemplated theophylline and Sinemet as
substitutes for dopami
