Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancytopenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
61 year old man with history of Ph+ ALL s/p chemotherapy with
DVA, Gleevec and s/p MUD myeloablative allo-SCT [**2132-7-9**] c/b GVD
of liver, CMV viremia, right leg mucormycosis and aspergillus
lung infections treated with ambisome/micafungin, presenting
with persistent pancytopenia with concern for recurrence of
disease.

Patient recently admitted with RSV pneumonia treated with IVIG
and empiric antibiotics. Course was complicated by seizures
leading to encephalopathy, controlled with levetiracetam.

Patient was seen in clinic on day of admission and found to have
worsening thrombocytopenia in addition to immature cells on
peripheral smear. Patient denied worsening fatigue, shortness of
breath or fever.  He reported abdominal pain, worse with meals,
with intermittent nausea.  He also complained of cough, with
headache, but without rhinorrhea. Headache has been present for
past 3-4 weeks occurring at night from 8-9pm.  Patient denies
visual changes, numbness/weakness/tingling in extremities, or
sudden loss of bladder/bowel control.

He received 1 unit of platelets in clinic, with improvement in
counts from 12 to 57.  In addition, patient had a bone marrow
biopsy to evaluate for potential recurrence of disease.  He was
admitted for further management of pancytopenia.

Review of Systems:
Positive for occasional diarrhea (solid on day of admission).
Chills without fever or night sweats.  He denies shortness of

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smear:
The smear is adequate for evaluation. Red blood cells are
reduced in number, normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis
including occasional macroovalocytes and spherocytes seen.  A
nucleated red blood cell is seen on scan.    The white blood
cell count appears decreased.  Dysplastic h
