CT head [**2149-8-12**]
FINDINGS: Several foci of hemorrhage are present. Subarachnoid
hemorrhage
is present along the left temporal lobe, extending into the
sylvian fissure
and the adjacent parenchyma. An additional focus of subarachnoid
hemorrhage
fills the left quadrigeminal cistern, tracking along the left
tentorium
cerebelli, and the midline along the cerebellar vermis. This
obliterates the
left quadrigeminal cistern. No uncal or subfalcine herniation is
present. A
very little mass effect is seen with either focus of bleeding.

There is no edema, shift of normally midline structures, or
evidence of major
vascular territorial infarct. The suprasellar cistern is patent.
The
interpeduncular cistern is also patent. Ventricles are normal in
size and
configuration. The sulci along the insular cortex are effaced,
but otherwise,
sulci are intact.

Extensive facial fractures are present. These are better
visualized on the
concurrently obtained facial bone CT. However, fractures are
present of the
left medial, lateral and inferior orbital walls, and the left
zygomatic arch,
and both maxillary sinuses. The globes are intact, and the
extraocular
muscles appear spared. The ethmoid air cells contain extensive
aerosolized
secretion, along with the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The
right sphenoid
air cell contains a small focus of aerosolized secretion. The
left frontal
sinus contains aerosolized fluid. The right frontal sinus is
well aerated.
Mastoid air cells are well aerated.

There is no calvarial or skull base fracture.

Extensive soft tissue defect is present at the anterior vertex.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage. No associated
edema or mass
effect.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage at the left quadrigeminal cistern,
with minimal
mass effect upon the adjacent left mid brain.
3. No herniation or shift of midline structures.
4. Extensive facial fractures, better delineated on concurrently
obtained
facial bone CT. Left orbital wall fractures without involvement
of the
extraocular muscles. Bilateral maxillary sinus fractures.
Displaced left
zygomatic arch fracture.
5. No calvarial fracture.
6. Extensive soft tissue defect at the vertex.

Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2149-8-12**]
2:58 AM


[**2149-8-12**]
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in
place. There is
no fracture or malalignment involving the cervical spine. Focal
lucencies
adjacent to the base of the dens are consistent with nutrient
vessels. The
prevertebral soft tissue fat planes are preserved. The
nasopharynx and
hypopharynx are filled with aerosolized secretions and fluid,
secondary to
instrumentation and extensive facial bone fractures.

Vertebral body heights and intervertebral disc heights are
preserved. The
visualized outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable. Visualized
lung apices
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
2. Preserved prevertebral soft tissue fat planes.
3. Extensive aerosolized secretions and fluid in the hypo and
nasopharynx
consistent with extensive facial fractures, better visualized on
the facial
CT, and instrumentation.


[**2149-8-12**]
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The lungs are clear, with moderate
dependent
atelectasis and possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no lobar
consolidation or large pleural effusion. The tracheobronchial
tree is patent
to subsegmental levels. An endotracheal tube terminates in the
mid trachea.

The heart is normal in size, without pericardial effusion. The
aorta is
normal in caliber, without evidence of acute injury. The great
vessels are
unremarkable. There is no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
A
nasogastric tube is in place in the esophagus.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
spleen,
adrenal glands, stomach and duodenum are unremarkable. The
kidneys enhance
symmetrically, without hydronephrosis. A focal hypodensity in
the interpolar
region of the right kidney too small to characterize. There is
no fluid or
free air in the abdomen. There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple loops of large and small
bowel are
unremarkable. Urinary bladder is distended, and contains a Foley
catheter.
The distal ureters and prostate gland are unremarkable. There is
no free
fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No fractures are identified. Minimal
degenerative
changes are present at the lower lumbar spine. Soft tissues are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of traumatic injury to the chest, abdomen or
pelvis.
2. Moderate dependent atelectasis bilaterally.
3. Right renal hypodensity, too small to characterize.
4. Mild degenerative change in the lumbar spine.


CT Sinus/Mandible [**2149-8-14**]
FINDINGS: Again noted is opacification of the ethmoid air cells,
left frontal
