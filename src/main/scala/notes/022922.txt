EKG: ST 114, normal intervals, nl axis. no ST-T changes

CXR: NO evidence of acute cardiopulmonary pathology

CTA: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Mucous impaction
in the right upper lobe posterior subsegmental bronchus.
3. There are two (2) patchy areas of air space opacity within
the left lung as described above. These probably represent
atypical foci of inflammation or infection. However, given
slight changes or architectural distortion, CT examination is
recommended after appropriate treatment.
Chest x-ray ([**3-25**]) - early, mild congestive heart failure

chest x-ray ([**4-4**]): [**Month/Year (2) 2182**],  no change since the prior
examination.  No acute
cardiopulmonary pathology.

Chest CT ([**4-4**])-  1)  Interval progression of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities, involving all of the right lung (with some apical
sparing) and the mid portion of the left lung.  There has been
no significant interval change of the 2 patchy areas of ground
glass opacity within the superior segment of the left upper lobe
and within the lingula.  Diagnostic considerations include
atypical infectious agents, such as mycoplasma, mycobacteria,
fungus and viral etiology.
2)  The ground glass opacities of the left lung should continue
to be followed to document complete resolution and exclude
malignancy.
3)  Incidental gallstone.

[**4-13**]-
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant interval resolution of tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities
involving the right lung with only a few residual opacities
still present.
2. Nodular ground-glass opacities within the lingula and left
lower lobe are stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
*
1. Hypotension/Sepsis- Patient was briefly placed in pressors,
and were then weaned. Etiology was unclear. Perhaps related to
adrenal insufficiency and patient was placed on hydrocortisone
with improvement, she was switched to prednisone when called out
of MICU. Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
Patient ruled in for flu. Patient will need a very slow taper of
prednisone given her history of a chronic eosinophilic pna, and
perhaps outpatient [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Patient bp improved as her
underlying lung infection (see below) was treated. She was dc'ed
on beta-blocker and ace
*
2. CV/elevated troponin- Likely demand ischemia in setting of
tachycardia  Patient  was not having cp. Felt to be related to
sepsis and renal failure.
