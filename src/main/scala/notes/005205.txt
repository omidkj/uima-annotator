History of Present Illness:
Pt was recently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection on
[**2110-8-19**] and started on Ciprofloxacin. He was also was diagnosed
with C. difficile at his rehab on [**2110-8-14**] and was on Flagyl. Of
note, the patient was admitted from [**2110-7-14**] to [**2110-7-16**] for
right testicular pain consistent with epididymitis thought to be
related to repeated instrumentation of urethra and chronic
indwelling catheterization. A CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was
done due to concern for Fournier's gangrene but was negative.
His pain was managed with morphine and tylenol. He was started
on vancomycin, flagyl, and levofloxacin. His urinalysis was
"positive" and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. He was
discharged on a 14-day course of cefpodoxime that ended on
[**2110-7-28**]. Subsequently had a positive urine culture that was
that was started with treatment with Cipro. Additionally, C.
Diff assay was positive [**2110-8-14**], for which pt was started on
Flagyl. Of note, a UTI diagnosed on [**2110-8-6**] was resistent to
Levofloxacin and Bactrim. There is also a note from his Atrius
urologist that in the past 2 months he had a 3 mm calculus with
R side stent placement, with a planed ureteroscopy in the
future.

IMAGING:
[**2110-8-21**] @ 0329 - CXR - IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema though
no consolidation.
[**2110-8-21**] @ 0630 - CXR - IMPRESSION:
1.  New central venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC.
2.  Stable mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
[**2110-8-21**] @ 1309 - ABD XR - IMPRESSION:  Bowel gas pattern
consistent with ileus.  No evidence of obstruction or toxic
megacolon.
[**2110-8-21**] @ 1659 - ABD CT W/ & W/O CONTRAST - IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild colitis involving the cecum.
2.  Renal stent in proper position.
3.  There is no evidence of pyelonephritis.
4.  New bilateral pleural effusions.
5   Unchanged 1.3 cm left adrenal lesion that is indeterminate
by CT size
criteria, however, it most likely represents a lipid poor
adenoma.
6.  Foley catheter balloon in the prostate.
7.  Non-obstructing 2mm right renal calculus.
[**2110-8-22**] - ECHO - IMPRESSION: The left atrium is elongated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
[**2110-8-25**] - CXR - REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess right PICC after power
flush. Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour
earlier. Left PICC tip is difficult to visualized, can be
followed to the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.  There are no other interval changes.
