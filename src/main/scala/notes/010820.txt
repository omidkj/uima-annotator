History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with a history of HTN, CKD, anemia presents
to the ER with worsened bilateral hip pain. Apparently she fell
on Friday and was seen at [**Hospital3 **] and discharged
home after she had slipped on ice. She now has worsening

In the ER her vitals 99.5, 88, 86/62, 20, 92% RA
102/57 when seen by ER resident, then to 80s, FAST negative.
Getting a TTE being done currently. A right IJ was placed and
started on Levophed. Received 2 liters of IVF. Non operative
fractures.

She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, ASA, morphine, ativan and
was started on Levophed for hypotension. A blood cx was sent and
a non contrast CT Torso was obtained which showed a non
displaced fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus, body of
pubis and possible fracture at anterior lip of right acetabulum.


In the ICU patient looks fatigued but has no dyspnea or chest
pain. Her only complaint is pain in the hips.

TTE
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
distal anterior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40-45%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
left and right ventricular dysfunction suggestive of CAD.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2130**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CT Torso
Final Report
INDICATION: 83-year-old woman with known AAA with worsening
groin pain,
hypotension, evaluate for AAA or leak.

COMPARISON: CT of the torso from [**2131-9-3**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
down to the
pubic symphysis without IV contrast. Multiplanar reformations
were obtained
and reviewed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The thyroid gland is
unremarkable. There
is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. There is mild
biapical
scarring. Also noted are small subpleural blebs and emphysema.
There is
bilateral mild interstitial pulmonary edema evidenced by septal
prominence.
There is a pectus excavatum deformity of the chest wall.

The trachea is patent centrally. There is significant aortic
valvular, mitral
annular and coronary artery calcification. The heart size is
normal. There is
relative [**Name (NI) 33214**] of the myocardium compared to the
blood pool, likely
due to anemia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The noncontrast appearance
of the liver,
spleen, adrenals, kidneys and pancreas is unremarkable. There is
mild
nonspecific right perinephric stranding. The patient is status
post
cholecystectomy. The abdominal aorta is tortuous and dilated
measuring up to
37 x 37 mm in its largest dimension. This is essentially
unchanged in size
from prior studies and there is no evidence of aortic rupture.
No fluid
collection is present in the visualized abdomen. The small and
large bowel
are unremarkable. No free air or free fluid is present. There is
no
abdominal, mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The uterus, bladder, and
rectum are
unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy
present.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: An acute fracture of the right inferior
pubic ramus and
right pubic body. Also present is a small right superior sacral
alar non
displaced fracture. A small anterior lip fracture cannot be
excluded at the
right acetabulum (2:104). There is no significant associa
