Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69yo Female, with MMP including ESRD on HD, HIV (cd4 940
[**7-23**], on HAART), CAD s/p MI, CHF, COPD, amongst others who was
found obtunded by her family last pm. Pt was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2115-9-6**] after being admitted with shortness of
breath in the setting of missed hemodialysis secondary to a
clotted AV graft. Her course was complicated by a PEA arrest
following intubation from which she recovered. SHe was
discharged to rehab ([**Hospital3 **]) and only returned to home
three days ago.
.
FS was 265 in the evening and pt took 2 units of regular
insulin. At 10 pm last night, pt was visited by daughter, found
in bed sweating with rapid shallow breathing, foaming in her
mouth, and eyes looking down. The episode happened after pt ate
a snack and went to bed. She was found to be non-responsive
however, no abnormal movement of extremities noted. Episode
lasted 20 minutes until EMS arrived. FS was found to be 28, pt
was given 1 amp of D50 and became more responsive with FS of
260.
.
In the ED VS were: T: 96.8; BP: 110/palp; P: 78; RR: 18; with O2
sat 98% on RA. At 12:30 am, FS was 134. Pt then ate a [**Location (un) 6002**]
and had juice and FS at 1:45 am was 49. Pt was given an amp of
D50, juice, and started on a D10 gtt. BS at 3 am on D10 was 150,
4 am 236, and 5 am 201. U/A was found to be positive for a UTI
and pt was given a dose of 500 mg PO levaquin.
.
On ROS, no SOB, CP or abd pain. NO fever. Reports an upset
stomach for last week of [**Hospital3 2558**] stay. She reports good
appetite and regular po diet. Denies any diarrhea or any other
GI or GU complaints. Of note, reglan 5 tid was the only new med
started at the rehab. Per family, pt with labile blood sugars at
rehab ranging from 30-300s. She has not changed her regimen.
Also, family notes that pt's insulin is pre-drawn for her.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 69 year old female, multiple medical problems,
who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] admitted with SOB in
setting of missed HD secondary to clotted AV graft, complicated
by PEA arrest and intubation now presents w/ obtundation, found
to be hypoglycemic in the field and now transferred to MICU for
persistent hypoglycemia in the ED requiring D10 gtt and q1 FS
checks.
.
1. Hypoglycemia: Differential diagnosis includes excessive
insulin (most likely), missed meal, worsening renal failure with
resultant decrease in insulin clearance, medication induced,
sepsis, or an endocrinopathy. It is possible that the patient
mistakedly took too much of her insulin and we are still seeing
the effects of the NPH. Patient also has ESRD on HD and thus
insulin could be hanging around longer. While this is plausible,
she has been getting her regular dialysis, last yesterday.
However, she is slightly fluid overloaded. TSH on [**2115-8-27**] was
normal. Adrenal insufficiency possible, as pt on steroids
chronically for h/o eosinophilic PNA, however, no hypotension or
other symptoms. Pt is on bactrim which can cause hypoglycemia,
but no recent medication changes. Sepsis is another possible
cause. Pt with evidence of UTI, elevated lactate but does not
meet SIRS criteria. Patient was initially maintained on a D10
gtt which was later d/ced. Finger stickers were monitored q
hourly ranging from 84-225. Once her glucose went beyond 200,
RISS was restarted with good control. Patient was also started
on NHP insulin of 10 units at a reduced dose from her home
regimen of 20 units. Lactate was also monitored and remained
elevated at 2.7. Her UTI on U/A was treated with Ciprofloxacin
PO. She was also restarted on a diabetic, heart healthy, renal
diet.
.
2. Leukocytosis: Patient has a persistent leukocytosis thought
to be secondary to chronic steroids. Patient was treated with
cipro for a UTI.
.
3. Elevated Troponin: Patient noted to have a history of
elevated Troponins, on this admission 0.23->0.18->0.20 which
flat CK. Likely secondary to history of CPR and renal disease.
There were no EKG changes from previous.
.
4. ESRD on HD: Patient normally receives dialysis M,W,F. Renal
following the patient while admitted. Patient was dialysed on
[**2115-9-25**]. Calcium carbonate and Paricalcitol for secondary
hyperparathyroidism were continued.
.
5. Metabolic gap acidosis: Likely secondary to ESRD and elevated
lactate. UTI treated with ciprofloxacin, patient received
dialysis on [**2115-7-27**].
.
6. CAD s/p MI: Continued ASA, ACE, BB. Held isordil until later
this pm so can watch BPs. R/O as above.
.
7. [**Name (NI) **] Continued pt's home regimen on HAART. Last CD4 count was
940.
.
8. H/o eosinophilic pneumonia- Continued prednisone and bactrim
prophylaxis while immunosuppressed (bactrim leading to
hypoglycemia low on DDx.)
.
9. DVT- h/o DVT diagnosed in [**7-23**]. Coumadin apparently d/ced in
[**Month (only) **]/05 and then re-started in [**7-23**] for popliteal DVT, was held
initially then restarted on [**2115-9-25**]. Followed INR 1.4->1.2.
Follow up after restarting coumadin.
.
10. COPD- continued atrovent q6 hours and albuterol nebs prn.
.
11. PPx- PPI per outpt regimen, bowel regimen, pain regimen
tapered since patient no longer having chest pain from previous
CPR.
.
12. F/E/N- [**Doctor First Name **], heart healthy, renal diet.
.
13. Access-PIVs
.
14. Contact-Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42692**] is HCP. [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 101298**];
