Admission Date:  [**2186-7-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-7-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2118-3-19**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
with reportedly a recent positive exercise treadmill test who
presented to an outside hospital with severe chest pain-back
pain at approximately 5:00 a.m. on [**2186-7-4**].  The
patient reports having progressive exertional back pain.

EKG performed at the outside hospital demonstrated acute
inferior-posterior MI with frequent ectopy.  The patient was
started on heparin, Integrelin, and lidocaine, and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.
The patient was chest pain-free upon arrival and then taken
to the Catheterization Laboratory where the patient was found
to have severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The
patient's coronary angiography results showed LAD with 80%
proximal and 90% after D2 disease, and LCX with 90% proximal
subtotal large OM2 disease, and RCA with midocclusion with
LCA collaterals.  Given these findings, Cardiothoracic
Surgery was called in for intervention.

98.6, pulse 72, sinus, blood pressure 107/56, respirations
20, 92% room air saturation.  General:  The patient is an
obese male in no apparent distress at the time of discharge.
HEENT:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Sclerae
anicteric.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.  Mucous membranes
moist.  No evidence of oral ulcers.  Chest:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  [**Hospital1 30078**] incision site with no
evidence of erythema.  No evidence of drainage with
Steri-Strips intact and no evidence of click on palpation of
sternum.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No evidence of
murmur.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nondistended, nontender.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  No evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Extremities:  Lower extremities positive symmetric edema, +2.
No evidence of rash.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  As of [**2186-7-15**], white blood
cell count 9, hematocrit 26.6, platelets 323,000.  Sodium
138, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 27, BUN 39,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 117, calcium 7.6, magnesium 2.2,
phosphorus 4.2.

Chest x-ray:  ICD placement, no evidence of hemothorax,
located in the left subclavian, leads going to right
ventricle.  No evidence of pulmonary failure.  No evidence of
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68-year-old male who
presented to the [**Hospital6 256**] with
cardiac catheterization which revealed LAD with 80% proximal,
90% D2, LCX with 90% proximal, subtotal large OM2 and RCA
with midocclusion with LCA to the collaterals after having an
acute inferior MI, decreased LV ejection fraction and
intra-aortic balloon pump in place.

Given these findings, the patient underwent an uncomplicated
CABG times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to DIAG) on
[**2186-7-6**]. Postoperatively, the patient was maintained AV
paced and remained intubated and was notable for labile blood
pressure.  The patient was transfused for a hematocrit of 15
at this time.

By postoperative day number three, the patient's intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed along with chest tube.  The patient
was transfused once again.  Chest x-ray done at this time
showed mild CHF with no evidence of pneumothorax.  At this
time, the patient was also extubated, maintaining good oxygen
saturation with only supplemental nasal cannula support.

By postoperative day number four, the patient's serial crit
remained stable and Pitressin was weaned off.  Lasix was also
increased for diuresis.

By postoperative day number five, the patient was completely
weaned off pressors.  The patient was transferred to the
floor in good condition.

By postoperative day number seven, the patient's physical
therapy was discontinued because the patient achieved level V
status for discharge to home.  However, at this point, the
patient developed an episode of eight beat ventricular
tachycardia along with supraventricular tachycardia less than
30 seconds at a rate of 140 beats per minute at rest.
Electrophysiology evaluation ultimately led to ICD placement
on [**2186-7-14**].  Post ICD placement interrogation was
unremarkable and chest x-ray showed no evidence of
pneumothorax with leads in good position.  Given these
findings, the patient was discharged to home with a follow-up
at the Device Clinic in one week on [**2186-7-20**] at 11:30
a.m. and also with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in six months.  The patient
was also instructed to take p.o. Keflex for three days for
periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services (physical therapy
for exercise endurance and range of motion training) and
visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] incision check.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times seven days
while the patient is taking Lasix, 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. times
seven days.  At this time, the patient is to reduce the dose
of Lasix to 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for the next seven days and the
patient is to initiate taking potassium 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
for the following seven days along with the Lasix.
3.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Metformin 1 gram p.o. b.i.d.  The patient is to restart
this medication on [**2186-7-16**] because the patient
underwent a heavy dye load on [**2186-7-14**].
5.  Cephalexin 500 mg p.o. q. eight hours times three days
(periprocedural prophylaxis).
6.  Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Dilaudid 2 mg one to two tablets q. two hours p.r.n.
pain.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with the Device
Clinic on [**2186-7-20**] at 1:30 p.m.

The patient was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8993**] in seven days to retitrate any of the cardiac
medications as well as diuretics appropriately.

The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] in four
weeks after discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Three vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times three vessels on [**2186-7-6**], left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to diagonal.
2.  ICD placement.
3.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia times two.
4.  Supraventricular tachycardia times one.
