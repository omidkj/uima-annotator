HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year-old man with
history of severe frontal lobe dementia, hypertension, status
post PE, no previous history of CAD who presents with chest
pain.  His wife states that he has been exceedingly tired
over the last couple of weeks so much so he would stay in bed
all day if not encouraged to get out of bed. The last two
days prior to admission he was even more lethargic than usual
and on the day of admission reported some substernal chest
pain, prompting a visit to the ED.

In the ED he was noted to have 3 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**] depression
anterior leads and ruled in for a non Q MI with CK in 1700s
and Troponin of 50.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service and
treated medically overnight with Heparin,
...................., aspirin and beta-blockers.

In the A.M. his CKs had risen to 1900 and he was sent to the
cath lab.  In the cath lab he was noted to have three VD
disease but was not considered to be a surgical candidate. He
had intraaortic balloon pump placed prophylactically for
intervention and then had all three vessels intervened upon
and stented. The PA sat was 68% and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 17 in the cath lab.

The patient was initially observed on the CCU service
overnight post cath and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on
[**2134-2-18**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] is
relatively functional at home but limited by dementia. NO
tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 102.1 F,
blood pressure 116/74, pulse 96, respiratory 16, saturation
97% on two liters.  In general comfortable, elderly male in
no apparent distress.  HEENT - pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Anicteric sclerae. Oropharynx clear. Neck
- no JVD. Respiratory - clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Abdomen - benign.  Extremities - no cyanosis, erythema or
edema. Neuro - alert, disoriented at baseline per family.

The patient was guaiac negative per ED.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 15.3,
hematocrit 46.5, platelet count 189,000, sodium 139,
potassium 3.7, chloride 100, bicarb 24, BUN 14, creatinine
0.8, glucose 122.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 95, normal axis, 3 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**]
depression in V2, V3, V4; 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was initially admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] however in light of rising CKs despite medical
management was sent to the cath lab where cardiac
catheterization showed three VD and the patient had PTCA as
well as stent placed times three.  He was on an intraaortic
balloon pump for optimization rather than hemodynamic
instability.  He was in the CCU for one day.  Post
catheterization the patient was continued on Plavix, aspirin,
beta-blocker, Ace inhibitor and Lipitor. He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the course of his stay in
the hospital post catheterization.

The patient's beta-blocker and Ace inhibitors doses were
titrated up as tolerated by his blood pressure and heart
rate.

ETT post catheterization showed ejection fraction of 35%,
mild LVH, normal LV size and LV dysfunction with akinesis of
the inferior posterior wall and mild MR.  Please see
catheterization report for additional details of his coronary
artery anatomy.

2.  Infectious Disease - The patient had increased white
blood cell count and fever spike during the course of his
stay in the hospital.  The patient was pan cultured.  On
culture bottle had coag negative staph. The patient was
briefly treated with Vancomycin however it was thought to be
likely skin contaminated. The Vancomycin was subsequently
discontinued.

Chest x-ray showed developing pneumonia. The patient was
started on Levofloxacin. The patient's white blood cell count
decreased upon being started on Levofloxacin. Urine culture
was negative. Follow up blood cultures were negative.

3.  Hematology - The patient had hematocrit drop post
procedure. This was attributed to likely blood loss during
cardiac catheterization.  The patient was guaiac negative.
Lab work did not suggest hemolysis. The patient was
transfused one unit packed red blood cells. The patient's
hematocrit post transfusion remained stable throughout the
rest of his course of stay in the hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post non Q wave
myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization
which showed three VD, status post stent placement times
three.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 milligrams po bid.
2.  Levofloxacin 250 milligrams po q day times 10 days total.
3.  Captopril 25 milligrams po tid.
4.  Provigil.
5.  Lasix 20 milligrams po q day.
6.  Plavix 75 milligrams po q day.
7.  Lipitor 20 milligrams po q day.
8.  Protonix 40 milligrams po q day.
9.  Aspirin 325 milligrams po q day.
10. Detrol 4 milligrams po q day.
11. Tylenol 650 milligrams po q four to six hours prn.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to home with VNA services at
home. The patient to follow up with PCP and cardiologist in
one week.
