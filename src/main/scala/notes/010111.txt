Pertinent Results:
CT Scan of Chest/Abd/Pelvis
1. Hepatosplenomegaly and small amount of free intraperitoneal
fluid with no focal findings suggestive of septic embolus.

2. Cardiomegaly and possible decreased cardiac output based on
appearance of contrast (versus timing). Four small pulmonary
parenchymal opacities more likely to represent atelectasis as no
specific features of septic emboli.

[**2165-1-17**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular ejection fraction is normal (LVEF 70%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function may be depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There is a moderate-sized  vegetation
on the aortic valve (noncoronary cusp). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
large vegetation on the mitral valve (anterior mitral leaflet),
and a small vegetation on the posterior leaflet. There is a
moderate vegetation on the tricuspid valve (posterior leaflet).
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Impression: 3 valve endocarditis with severe aortic, mitral, and
tricuspid regurgitation; severe pulmonary hypertension; no
obvious abscess

[**2165-1-20**] Liver U/S
No evidence of focal liver lesion. Small amount of ascites.
Gallbladder sludge. The hepatic vessels are patent.

[**2165-1-30**] CXR
Tiny residual left pneumothorax, with new subcutaneous emphysema
in the left axillary region.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 70965**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-1-16**] for further
management of his endocarditis. He was evaluated by the cardiac
surgical service and preoperative workup was initiated. An echo
revealed vegetations on his mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves.
A dental consult was obtained given the plan for valve
replacement surgery. After obtaining a dental panorex, it was
suggested to extract 4 teeth prior to surgery. This was
performed without complication when his INR was within an
acceptable range on [**2165-1-24**]. The cardiology service was
consulted and diuresis was continued. No cardiac catheterization
was recommended. The infectious disease service was consulted
given his history of a positive ppd. Further tests showed that
there was no evidence of active or latent tuberculosis
infections. Ampicillin and gentamicin were continued for his
endocarditis. A left PICC line was placed for continued
antibiotics. The gastrointestinal service was consulted for his
history of guaiac positive stools although his current rectal
exams were guaiac negative. An EGD was performed which was
negative for any source of bleeding. The psychiatry service was
consulted for assistance with his depression and anxiety. Prozac
was stopped and remeron was started for depression. Seroquel was
started for anxiety. The electrophysiology service was consulted
given his long PR interval and continued to follow him given his
risk of developing heart block and needing a pacemaker. The
liver service was consulted for clearance for surgery. Vitamin K
was used for his elevated INR. No evidence of cirrhosis was
noted on ultrasound or laboratory workup however mild ascites
and gallbladder sludge was noted. The renal service was
consulted for acute renal failure and it was presumed to be
realted to his diuresis, ace inhibitor use and possible
gentamicin toxicity. As his creatinine stablized, he was cleared
for surgery. On [**2165-1-25**], Mr. [**Known lastname 70966**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent a Bentall procedure, a mitral and
tricuspid valve replacement, placement of AV pacer leads and a
pacer pericardial patch. Postoperatively he was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. He returned
to the operating room later for a reexploration for bleeding
with hemostasis acheived. He was then returned to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. The electrophysiology service
interoggated his dual chamber [**Company **] sigma pacemaker. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 70966**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and
was extubated. He began gentle diuresis. His renal function
remained stable. On postoperative day three, he was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. His gentamicin levels were closely
monitored and his dosage was appropriately adjusted.

Mr. [**Known lastname 70966**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to rehabilitation on psotoperative day 7.
