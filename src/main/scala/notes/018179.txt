Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
downsizing of trach
PEG placement
PICC


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 28 year old male with a history of alcohol
abuse who was recently discharged after an extended ICU
admission for pancreatits/hematemesis who during his hospital
stay had a cardiac arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury
(see discharge summary). MRI showed diffuse anoxic injury, and
CT showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation.  He began
having seizure activity on [**2131-5-23**] and was treated with Keppra.
He also had an EEG that was nondiagnostic, and subsequent EEG
that showed seizures in the occipital lobe.  Keppra was
increased and seizures were controlled prior to d/c.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3394**] was discharged to a rehab hospital where he was found
to have what was believed to be two siezures yesterday [**7-8**] and
one today with persistent eye deviation to the right.  He was
given ativan, after which tremors reportedly stopped, and then
transfer was arranged directly to the ICU.

Images:
.
[**2131-7-18**] CXR:
Persistent lower lung volumes. Small to moderate left pleural
effusion is unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard
position. Right PICC remains in place with tip in the upper SVC.
No evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis are
unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are also stable NG tube
tip is in the stomach.
.
[**2131-7-18**] LENI:
1. No deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa which may have
ruptured or contains hemorrhage.
.
[**2131-7-16**] CT abdomen w/ and w/o contrast:
1. Interval enlargement of the pancreatic pseudocysts in the mid
body, tail and head of the pancreas.
2. NEW - Nonocclusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein
extending to the junction of the splenic vein.
3. Interval enlargement of fluid collection lateral to the
antrum of the stomach.
4. Unchanged colonic wall thickening.
.
[**2131-7-16**] MRI head: No seizure focus identified. Diffuse volume
loss. Resolution of previously noted hypoxic changes in the
cortex. New changes in the pons and midbrain which could
represent a central pontine myelinolysis/osmotic demyelination.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia with nonspecific <1mm ST depressions
.
[**7-17**] RUQ u/s-IMPRESSION:
1. No deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa which may have
ruptured or
contains hemorrhage.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
[**7-20**]-IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy
likely secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend
MRI. Findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1255**] [**Doctor Last Name 1256**] at 9:55 a.m. on
[**2131-7-20**].
.
[**7-24**] CTA abd-IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the appearance of numerous
pancreatic
pseudocysts, replacing the tail and distal pancreatic body, and
also adjacent
to the head of the pancreas and the gastric antrum. There are no
new intra-abdominal fluid collections identified. The residual
normal pancreatic tissue again demonstrates normal enhancement.
There is no evidence for new
inflammation involving this region. Peripancreatic stranding
persists.
2. Redemonstration of diffuse hepatic steatosis.
3. Minimal, if any, residual clot in the SMV. The SMV and
splenic vein as
well as the main portal vein, are patent, though a focal
narrowing of the
splenic vein is noted.
4. Unchanged colonic wall thickening, nonspecific.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
[**7-25**] EEGIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. Routine
sampling continues to show poorly organized and low attenuation
background rhythm with frequent left occipital and posterior
temporal
discharges. Seizure detection files showed one electrographic
seizure.
There was no clinical correlate. Overall, this recording is
unchanged
compared to the previous 24 hours.
.

[**7-26**] EEG-IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. Routine
sampling continues to show a poorly organized and low
attenuation
background. However, the left occipital discharges are less
frequent
and no runs were seen on routine sampling. Seizure detection
files
showed one possible electrographic seizure with right sided body

jerking. Overall, there are less seizures on this recording
compared to
the previous 24 hours.

.
[**8-9**] CXRThe tracheostomy tip is 6.7 cm above the carina. The
right PICC line tip is
in the medial portion of right subclavian vein. There is no
change in the
high position of both hemidiaphragms and bibasilar atelectasis.
The
gastrostomy is projecting over its expected position in the left
upper
abdomen. No interval development of pneumothorax, pleural
effusion, or
pulmonary edema has been demonstrated.




Brief Hospital Course:
28 y/o male with an anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest in
the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis [**2-5**] EtOH who was
recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab/LTC.  Was seen by a
neurologist at rehab after 2 seizures who in consultation with
Epileptology at [**Hospital1 18**] decided patient to be transfered back to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation to include neurology consult and
24hr EEG.
.
# Seizure: Mr. [**Known lastname 3394**] has an anoxic brain injury and has had
seizures treated with keppra.  MRI and EEG results as above.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurology eval and presumptive 24hr EEG.
 It is possible that these seizures are from benzo withdrawal
after the decrease in dose of the valium is possible but not
probable and more likely a result of his anoxic brain injury.
He remained on Neurology service who performed a 24 hr EEG and
Keppra was continued.  After development of WBC a
