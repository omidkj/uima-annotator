HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female, a
Jehovah's Witness, who was admitted on [**2133-5-25**] with sepsis
of unknown origin.  She was hypotensive and required pressors
and her white count was 22.3.  Possible sources included:

Pulmonary:  She had a left lower lobe consolidation on chest
x-ray and her sputum cultures from [**2133-5-26**] grew MRSA and
gram-negative rods.

Urine:  She had an indwelling Foley catheter at that time and
her urine culture on [**2133-5-27**] grew greater than 100,000 gram-
negative rods, which were not further speciated for possible
fecal contamination.

A hemodialysis line, which on admission was a tunneled right
IJ catheter.  The line was changed to a left IJ catheter on
[**2133-5-27**].  Blood and line tip cultures were all negative.
She complained of abdominal pain, which was noted from
[**2133-5-26**]; on that day, she had a CT scan that was normal.
Due to persistent complaints, a CT scan was later obtained on
[**2133-5-29**] and that one was read as having a transition point
to the right lower quadrant.  There was contrast from the
previous scan in the distal small bowel and colon.  A delayed
scan was obtained on [**2133-5-30**] and showed that new contrast
still was not in the colon.  The Surgical Service evaluated
her at that point and in view of her benign exam, the fact
that she had not deteriorated over the course of days, the CT
findings of contrast from [**2133-5-27**] in the rectum, no
significant dilatation of the proximal small bowel on the
scan, and the fact that she was continuing to pass flatus, it
was decided to follow her exam and treat her conservatively
at that point.  On [**2133-6-1**], the patient demonstrated
deterioration in her clinical condition.  She became more
acidotic.  Her lactate was persistently rising.  There was
still no obvious source of sepsis that was treated.  It was,
therefore, decided to take the patient to the operating room
for an exploratory laparotomy.  The patient was explored
through a midline incision.  The bowel seemed mildly
distended, but viable throughout; and there was no point of
obstruction.  The bowels ran from the ligamentum of Treitz to
the ileocecal valve and then the colon was inspected and
looked normal throughout its course.  The patient was brought
back to the intensive care unit.  At that point, the patient
was requiring full support and had multiple organ failure.
On the morning of [**2133-6-2**], the patient developed arrhythmias
including ventricular fibrillation and asystole.  She was
initially coded with good response, but a discussion was
carried with the family and due to her grave condition and
unlikely recovery it was decided at that point to make her
comfort measures only.  The patient expired on [**2133-6-2**] at
08:33 a.m.
