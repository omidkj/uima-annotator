Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old lady with a PMH of diastolic heart
failure (EF>75%), severe lung disease and resultant pulmonary
hypertension, T2DM, obesity, who presents from home with hypoxia
and worsening somnolence.

Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on
Saturday [**11-21**], she has had persistent increased sputum which
she has difficulty coughing up.  She feels like the sputum gets
caught in her throat.  It is white-clear.  She denies fever or
chills.  She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in
her house as she hasn't been feeling well.  She endorses mild
orthopnea.  She denies worsening lower extremity edema.

Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR
findings of a LUL.  She had presented to her cardiologist one
week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening
dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or
leukocytosis.  At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was
having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her
on a one week course of levofloxacin.  A CXR was performed at
the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for
consolidation.  She followed up with the cardiologist NP one
week later, and was found to have O2Sats ranging from 68-80% on
3L NC (baseline, home oxygen).  She continued to be afebrile
without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum
production or dyspnea.  She was sent to the ER where a repeat
CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for
pneumonia.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and
admitted to the medicine service.  Antibiotics were not
continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or
leukocytosis.  Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for
DVT.  Patient was discharged home as her oxygen saturations
returned to baseline on home 3L NC.

[**Name (NI) **] son reports that patient had BCG vaccination in
[**Country 532**].  He does not know if she was ever exposed to
tuberculosis.  He does not know of anyone in his family who was
exposed to tuberculosis.

In the ED inital vitals were 97.4 70 141/47 18 100%
Non-Rebreather.
ABG 7.35/91/105/46. She was given vanc/cefepime x1.  Lung exam
c/w decreased breath sounds, tachypneic to low 30s. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were 97.6, 69, 132/56, 18 and
96% on 3LNC.  Patient was comfortable and denied any pain.

[**2139-11-24**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening multifocal opacification. Recommend clinical
correlation for
infection, and in the absence of concern for infection, CT of
the chest is
recommended to exclude the possibility of malignancy.
2. Pulmonary artery enlargement compatible with pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.

[**2139-11-30**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries
consistent with
pulmonary hypertension.
2. No consolidation. No pulmonary edema.

[**2139-11-24**] CT chest w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Three discrete new irregularly-shaped focal opacities
demonstrated within the left upper lobe that, given multiplicity
and configuration, are likely related to an active infectious or
inflammatory proces, much less likely to be synchronous
bronchogenic carcinoma. Differential also includes organizing
pneumonia or pseudolymphoma. Recommend followup to resolution
with conventional radiographs in six weeks.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly and severe pulmonary hypertension have
progressed
since [**2135**].
3. Findings compatible with the sequelae of prior granulomatous
exposure
