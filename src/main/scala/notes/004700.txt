Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting

Replacement of Tunneled Dialysis Catheter - [**7-20**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92585**] is a 63 year-old woman with history of
Goodpasture's disease on immunosupression with ESRD on HD (MWF),
HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
hospital on [**2119-7-13**] with nausea, vomiting, and chills. Patient
was in her usual state of health until Thursday morning where
she developed nausea, emesis x2, and chills at home.  She was
taken to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center by ambulance. She also
had abdominal pain and right sided pleuritic chest pain. On
arrival to ED, she was febrile to 102.2, HR 109, RR 22. Initials
labs significant of WBC of 0.1, 10% bands, plateltes of 50,000,
lactate of 5.9.  She had UA with 10 - 20 WBCs.  Patient received
gentamycin and vancomycin for possible UTI and was admitted to
medicine service.

During hospitalization, patient became progressively more
dyspnic requiring BiPAP and then a NRB.  She had a CT
abdomen/pelvis, which showed RML/RLL pneumonia. She was started
on vancomycin, meropenem, and continued on gentamycin.  She was
started on neosynephrine for hypotension.  She received
hydrocort for stress stress dose steroids given chronic high
dose prednisone use. Today she underwent dialysis for management
of volume overload and had 3L of fluid removed and her oxygen
was weaned to 4L NC (satting 98%). Following dialysis she became
more hypotensive requiring low dose levophed. However, pressors
were completely weaned off prior to transfer. Blood cultures
negative to date.  Urine cultures with GNR and alpha strep.

For neutropenia, patient was seen by hematology who felt
neutropenia may be secondary to infection.  She received GCSF
480 mcg on thursday and friday.  Course also notable for
thrombocytopenia with platelets of 50,000.  As per patient, she
had a bloody bowel movemetn at OSH and this has been going on
over the past week. She has also had bruising all over her body
for the past several weeks. She had a CT scan notable for
thrombosis of right femoral vein.  She had b/l femoral DVTs.  It
was planned for her to start on a heparin gtt, but given
thrombocytopenia and ? GI bleeding, she did not start the
heparin gtt.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports that she feels
comfortable. She thinks her breathing is much better than it was
prior to dialysis.  She continues to have intermittent cough. No
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. No fevers, chills.

Imaging:
Echo [**2119-7-15**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right heart strain. Normal regional
and global left ventricular systolic function. Trace aortic and
mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2119-7-15**]:
The right IJ central line tip in the SVC is unchanged.  There is
volume loss at both bases with obscuration of the right heart
border likely representing right middle lobe infiltrate.  There
is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and perihilar haze.  It is
difficult to assess for small effusions given overlying soft
tissues.  The overall impression is that of mild CHF with a
superimposed infiltrate in the right lower lobe given history of
pneumonia is likely.

CTA Chest [**2119-7-24**]:
1.  Acute thromboembolus in the basal trunk of the left
pulmonary artery,
extending to several segmental branches.
2.  Lack of contrast in the right atrium may simply represent
mixing artifact, however echocardiography is recommended to
exclude right atrial thrombus.
3.  Fat-density mass in the right middle lobe at location of
prior pneumonia, is likely lipoid pneumonia.  Exogenous lipoid
pneumonia secondary to aspiration of a lipid-[**Doctor First Name **] substance,
such as mineral oil supplementation, should also be considered.

EKG [**2119-7-24**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are modest
and
non-specific. Low QRS voltages in the precordial leads. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2119-7-22**] there is no significant diagnostic
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Chronologic course:

The patient is a 63 year-old woman with Goodpasture's disease
(diagnosed [**3-/2119**]) s/p plasmapheresis on prednisone and cytoxan,
who initially presented to OSH with nausea and vomiting, found
to have bilateral DVTs, and subsequently developed progressive
dyspnea and hypotension prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She
required pressors temporarily at the OSH, but pressors were
stopped prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].  Upon arrival she was noted
to have fever in the setting of neutropenia/pancyto
