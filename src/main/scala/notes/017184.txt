2.  Subtotal calcanectomy in [**2102-5-27**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old married man who lives
with his wife, is bedridden.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Remarkable for severe peripheral
neuropathy and hearing loss.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  98.9, 73,
18, blood pressure 104/68, 02 saturation 98% on room air.
General appearance:  This is a cooperative white male in no
acute distress with severe hearing deficits.  Carotids are
palpable without bruits.  The radial pulse is 1+ on the right
and nonpalpable on the left.  The abdominal aorta is
nonpalpable or prominent.  The femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  The popliteal pulses are absent.  The right DP
is Dopplerable signal.  The right PT is absent.  The left DP
is Dopplerable with an absent left PT.  Chest:  There was a
Quinton catheter in place.  The surrounding area was without
erythema.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen:  Unremarkable.
Bone/joints:  Moderate ankle edema bilaterally with ruborous
right foot changes with desquamation of the dorsal foot
epidermis.  The left foot is ruborous with visible bone at
the first toe amputation site.  There is gangrene along the
medial left foot.  The patient is status post calcanectomy.
Neurologic:  Except for the patient's deafness and blindness,
the examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 15.7, hematocrit
36.5, platelets 316,000.  BUN 42, creatinine 4.9, K 4.8.  INR
and PTT were normal.

EKG revealed a sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats,
normal axis, no acute changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted the night before
surgery.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl were
continued.  The patient underwent, on [**2104-2-18**], a left BKA
without complication.  There was good bleeding at the tissue
amputation site.  The patient was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition and then was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.  The patient was followed by
the Renal Service during his hospitalization who managed his
hemodialysis needs.

Postoperative day number one, there were no overnight events.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  Serial CKs were
obtained; the first was 8431.  His troponin levels were
unremarkable.  The physical examination was unremarkable.
The dressing was changed on postoperative day number two.
The patient remained in the VICU on bed rest.

On postoperative day number one, the resident was called to
the patient's bedside for a systolic pressure of 70-80.  The
patient was bolused with 500 cc of fluid.  The EKG was
without acute changes.  Blood gas is 7.28, 53, 64, 26, -2.
The chest x-ray was unremarkable.  A Swan line was placed.
The patient was begun on dopamine for inotropic support.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient.  The second
troponin level was 0.47.

They felt that the patient had ischemic changes secondary to
hypotension and that beta blockage would not be recommended
at this time and aspirin should be continued.  The blood
pressure should be supported and if there were EKG changes or
new symptoms to reconsult the Cardiology Service.  There was
no need for heparin at this time.  The patient was not
interested in an invasive procedure.

The patient was transferred to the SICU for continued
monitoring and care.  By postoperative day number three, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable and attempts were
made to titrate dopamine.  All antibiotics were continued.
The patient remained in the SICU.

On postoperative day number three, the patient's dopamine was
initially weaned off but the patient did have an episode of
hypotension requiring transfusion of albumin with excellent
response.  Otherwise, he remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient was weaned off dobutamine and transferred to the
VICU after hemodialysis.

By postoperative day number four, the patient's triple lumen
Swan-Ganz was converted to a PICC line.  PT was requested to
see the patient and he remained in the VICU.  Physical
Therapy recommended rehabilitation secondary to the patient
below baseline in ambulation and that he would benefit from
prosthetic training.  The patient has refused inpatient
rehabilitation.  Otherwise, the patient should do well and
will be discharged to home.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was afebrile.
Blood cultures were drawn at hemodialysis secondary to his
Quinton catheter placement. Those were so far no growth at
the time of dictation.

The remaining hospitalization was unremarkable.  The patient
received his hemodialysis as needed.  He was seen the day
before discharge by physical therapy.  The patient showed
independent functional mobility and could be discharged to
home.  Recommendations were that he would benefit from home
PT.  At the time of discharge, the patient was in stable
condition.  The wounds were clean, dry, and intact.
