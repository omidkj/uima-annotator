History of Present Illness:
46 yo M s/p cadaveric renal transplant on [**2137-8-2**] recently
discharged on [**10-3**] now back from rehab with lethargy,
?pseudomonas PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and
ARF/hyperkalemia. The patient had been previously doing well at
rehab and had been intermittently tolerated trach mask. He had
been treated for his baseline anxiety/agitation w/ MS contin,
ativan and seroquel, and had developed increasing lethargy two
days prior to admission. He had an ABG at that time on PCV 18/5
@45% that was 7.25/60/80 and was maintained on a vent since that
time. Sputum cx showed 2 species of psuedomonas, one resistent
to carbapenems and the other resitant to fluoroquinolones and
had been started on cipro/cefepime. Additionally he was noted to
have worsening creatinine, up from 1.47 to 2.04 today and a K in

Brief Hospital Course:
[**10-8**]: Directly admitted to SICU from [**Hospital1 **] for fever and
white out of left lung. Bronch here removed mucous plug on left.
 MS here more agitated and less alert than prior to discharge to
rehab ~1wk before. Has been on cipro & cefepime for pseudomonas
lung infection at rehab. Cr 2.3, UOP minimal, Foley placed
[**10-9**]: At 3am patient abruptly became hypotensive (after being
hypertensive overnight) to SBP's in 70's MAP 40, developed
rigors, chills. Neo started, right axillary a-line place, PIV
(still has LUE single lumen midline from prior admission).
Transfused 2 Units RBCs for HCT 24.9 (down from 28.5), BP
stabilized, and neo weaned off.  Next HCT 29.2. He had
self-d/c'd Dobhoff in rehab and this was replaced here by SICU
and repositioned to approximately a post-pyloric position via
IR.  TF's restarted. Agitation treated with seroquel, minimizing
benzos per psychiatry. Started vanco, cefepime, inhaled tobra,
micafungin (had received dose of fluconazole immediatly upon
arrrival).  He was continued on Cefepime (for psuedomonas
isolated from rehab inhaled) and tobraycin inhaled started for
pseudomonas aeruginosa (on sputum at sputum here [**2137-9-1**]). Cr
2.6
[**10-10**]: HCT 36.4. Held coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR 3.2.
Patient desaturated, CXR w/ R lower lung atelectasis, labs sent,
bronch done, mucus plug/pus material removed, TF's held. Repeat
bronchoscopy done over night for peak airway pressures in high
40's, thick secretions suctioned with improvement in peak
pressures to low 30's. Cr 2.7--->3.1; INR 4.0
[**10-11**]: HCT 32.3, Cr 3.2 - ? intravascularly dry - FeNa sent,
[**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim test - did not respond appropriately, started
hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h started for 7 days - blood pressure
and UOP gradually improved, vanco d/c'd based on culture and
clinical information, MMF decreased to 500 TID, Echo - poor
quality but LVEF>55% (similar to last Echo [**7-/2137**]), INR 5.1
(coumadin still held)
[**10-12**]: Flagyl restarted for GNRs in anaerobic bcx bottle at OSH.
IVF changed to D5NS. Foley d/c'd. Emesis x1, NGT coiled in
mouth, pulled back to stomach (by CXR). TFs held.
[**10-13**]: IVF down to 75, coumadin held, CMV overnight, unable to
tolerate PS
[**10-14**]: cleared by speech and swallow for diet while on low dose
CPAP. Given 80mg lasix.
[**10-15**]: Received lasix 100 IV x2 doses. Dosed coumadin 3mg for INR
1.8. Discontinued flagyl and micafungin since there were no new
cultured organisms from all cultures and no clinical evidence of
bacteremia/fungemia.
[**10-16**]: Lasix 40 PO x 2 doses. Coumadin 3 mg. Tacro [**12-29**].
Cellcept to 1000 [**Hospital1 **] from 500 TID. Hypertensive and agitated.
Clonidine 0.2 mg x 1, standing hydral. Ativan given. Small dose
haldol OK with primary team, not given however.  Cefepime,
Valcyte, MMF dosing increased accordingly secondary to
improvement of renal function w/ Cr at 1.7 and UOP ~4L the day
before.  Tolerating regular soft po intake.  Having episodes of
increased agitation w/ associated hypertension.  These were
treated medically w/ good response.
[**10-17**]: R groin HD cath removed without issue after obtaining
consent from legal guardian and pt acknowledged and agreed to
procedure.
For the past two weeks kidney function has been stable,
creatinine ranges from 1.1 - 1.4.
Immunosuppression has been followed by trough prograf levels
with dosing based on levels.
Valcyte was discontinued due to neutropenia. The CMV Viral load
was non-detectable and patient and donor were CMV Ab positive.
In addition, he was dosed x 1 with neupogen with good response
in his white count.
The patient is continuing now solely on trach collar. He
continues with thick secretions and requires suctioning and the
use of around the clock nebulizers, but has remained off the
vent > 1 week.

He is tolerating tube feeds of novasource renal. Pain management
and agitation appear under much better control with current
regimen. He is out of bed to chair and has begun working with PT
on rehab, looks forward to engaging in rehabilitation process.
