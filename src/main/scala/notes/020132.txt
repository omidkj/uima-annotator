Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain referred for emergent cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stenting of the mid-LAD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 y/o man w/ a PMH significant for CAD (s/p RCA and RPL
stenting in 04 and an MI in 95), HTN, hypothyroidism, CRF, and
COPD who presents w/ the acute onset of severe CP.  He developed
his CP acutely while helping a friend move one hour prior to his
presentation at the outside ER. His CP radiated to his L arm and
he had associated diaphoresis and dyspnea.  He states that this
pain was identical to the CP he developed during his past MI.
He denies any palpatations, nausea, recent URI, HA, dizziness,
or abdominal pain.  He has had CP since his catheterization in
[**2168**] about once a month w/ exertion but notes that it resolves
quickly w/ rest.  Of note, he stopped his aspirin and plavix one
week prior to presentation for a colonoscopy 2d ago during which
3 polyps were removed and scattered diverticula were noted.
.
In the outside ER he was noted to have an anterolateral STEMI w/
inferior reciprocal changes on the EKG.  He received ntg, asa,
heparin, morphine, and lopressor before being transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for urgent catheterization.  In the cath lab his previous
stents were patent but his LAD was acutely thrombosed and his
OM1 was 100% occluded.  During intervention on his LAD, he went
into a polymorphic VT, required cardioconversion, and was given
300mg of amiodarone.  He reverted to NSR and the his LAD was
stented w/out complication.

ECHO: [**2169-9-8**]
Conclusions:
LV systolic function appears depressed. Resting regional wall
motion
abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal/anterior and
apical akinesis and inferolateral hypokinesis (estimated
ejection fraction ?35%; views suboptimal for assessment of
regional wall motion). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
  Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2168-9-22**],
left ventricular function is now significantly impaired. Views
in the prior study were more technically suboptimal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 64 y/o man w/ a PMH significant for CAD w/ previous
stenting, HTN, and COPD who developed acute CP today while
helping a friend move.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from his
outside hospital where he was emergently cathed and received a
stent to the mid-LAD.  After his procedure he did not have any
further episodes of CP, nausea, palpatations, diaphoresis, or
arm pain.  He was restarted on toprol, lipitor, asa, and plavix
w/out event.  He was diuresed for mild SOB that resolved as his
urine output increased.  His echo showed wide spread akinesis
and hypokinesis so he was started on coumadin and maintained on
heparin until he became therapeutic.  He was also started on
hydralazine/imdur during this time w/out episodes of
hypotension.  He had one mild run of AIVR in the day after his
stent but did not have any hemodynamically significant
.
