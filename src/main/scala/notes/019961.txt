History of Present Illness:
64 yo right-handed female with hx MVR, hx hemorrhagic stroke and
subsequent seizures, and HTN, with recent hospitalization at
[**Hospital1 18**] after a fall with acute left subdural hematoma, s/p
emergent evacuation and craniotomy, discharged [**7-21**]
on heparin (for mechanical heart valve) to [**Hospital3 **] and
noted to be awake, alert, and oriented at that time.  At
appromately 10 PM on [**2112-7-22**], she was noted to be unresponsive

fosphenytoin IV.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-7-23**] for
further management and work-up.

IMAGING:
[**2112-7-23**] HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
1. Unchanged and evolved appearance to left temporoparietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and small left subdural hematoma.
2. No new focus of hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
3. Punctate hypodense focus anterior to the left lateral
ventricle has
persisted over 7 days.

[**2112-7-25**] EEG:
This is an abnormal video-EEG study due to slow theta frequency
background with left posterior sharp transients. Breech artifact
was noted in the left temporal and centroparietal regions. The
slow background suggests a encephalopathy affecting both
cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no electrographic seizures or electrographic
correlate to push-button activations.

[**2112-7-29**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
1. Large right rectus sheath hematoma extending into the
extraperitoneal
pelvis as well as the retroperitoneum.
2. Mild right renal collecting system dilatation related to mass
effect on
the right ureter from the hemorrhage.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Cardiomegaly.

[**2112-7-30**] CTA ABD/PELVIS:
1. Extensive right rectus sheath hematoma extending into the
extraperitoneal pelvis and also the retroperitoneum, not
significantly changed since examination one day prior performed
[**2112-7-29**]. No increase in size, and no evidence of active
extravasation in arterial, venous or delayed phases.
2. Persistent mild renal collecting system dilation secondary to
mass effect of the hemorrhage on the right distal ureter.
3. Cholelithiasis without secondary signs of cholecystitis.
4. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
5. Bibasilar atelectasis and cardiomegaly.
6. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2112-7-23**] CXR:
1. Probably standard position of endotracheal tube. Could
consider PA and
lateral for better definition.
2. Perihilar predominant, ill-defined airspace opacification
suggests
pulmonary edema. Underlying infection cannot be excluded. Could
consider
another film after diuresis.

[**2112-7-31**] CXR:
There is a new left lower lobe infiltrate which given history
likely represents pneumonia. There continues to be bibasilar
subsegmental
atelectasis. There is also pulmonary vascular redistribution
consistent with fluid overload.
IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe infiltrate.

[**2112-8-1**] RIGHT LE US:
No evidence of DVT

[**2112-8-2**] RIGHT ANKLE/FOOT X-RAY:
No previous images. Three views of the foot and three of the
ankle show some generalized soft-tissue prominence without
evidence of acute bone or
joint space abnormality.

[**2112-8-3**] VIDEO SWALLOW:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presents with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia
characterized by mildy reduced bolus formation, swallow delay
and incomplete epiglottic deflection. Patient was noted with one
episode of flash penetration before the swallow with consecutive
straw sips of thin liquids which cleared spontaneously. No deep
penetration or aspiration was observed. Recommend a PO diet of
thin liquids and small bites of soft solid consistencies. Please
continue 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and monitor
swallow safety. Pills may be given whole or crushed with puree.
Please continue to monitor at rehab. This swallowing pattern
correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating
of level 5, mild dysphagia.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet of thin liquids and SMALL bites of soft solids.
2. Pills whole or crushed with puree.
3. Continue 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and monitor
swallow safety.
4. Q8 oral care.
5. Patient seated upright for all meals.
6. Monitor for adequate caloric intake as indicated.
7. Please continue to monitor at rehab and recommend repeat
speech and swallow evaluation prior to upgrading diet. Patient
would also benefit from speech and language services at rehab.
