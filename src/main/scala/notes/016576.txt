History of Present Illness:
82 yo man w/HTN, hyper chol and h/o [**First Name3 (LF) **] in [**2185**] on Plavix

Studies:
[**7-12**] head CT: Large left subdural hematoma with subacute and
chronic components. Maximum thickness 3.3 cm, contralateral
midline shift of 1.6 cm. Minimal uncal herniation. No
intraparenchymal hemorrhage or CT evidence of ischemic
infarction.
.
[**7-12**] MRI/MRA head: Large left frontoparietal convexity subdural
hematoma with subacute blood products causing subfalcine
herniation. No evidence of loss of flow signal within the
vessels. No significant intracranial atherosclerotic disease nor
aneurysm.
.
[**7-14**] SDH path: Fragments of blood and fragments of granulation
tissue with organizing hemorrhage and subacute and chronic
inflammation, consistent with chronic subdural hematoma.
.
[**7-16**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-7-13**] the rhythm has
changed. Right bundle-branch block persists.

.
[**7-18**] CXR: 1. Large hiatal hernia. 2. Focal discoid left lower
lobe atelectasis.
.
[**7-18**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Probable left
ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing no
change.

.
[**7-19**] head CT: 1. Status post left frontoparietal craniotomy with
persistent rightward midline shift and sulcal effacement.
2. Improvement of pneumocephalus, however, with reaccumulation
of the left sided subdural fluid and focal areas of more acute
hemorrhage.
.
[**7-19**] B/L LENIs: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**7-20**] Abd US: 1. Gallbladder sludge without stones or biliary
ductal dilatation. 2. Bilateral renal cysts.
.
[**7-21**] MRI head: 1. Slight interval increase in size of large left
subdural hematoma, with mild increase in mass effect, but
without change in subfalcine shift. 2. New, small focus of slow
diffusion within the inferior aspect of left occipital lobe is
consistent with infarct, probably embolic. Additional
questionable tiny infarct just superior to this within the left
occipital lobe. 3. Increase in small right subdural collection.

[**7-21**] EEG:

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurological
monitoring. He was taken to the OR [**2190-7-14**] for left craniotomy
with evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma. He tolerated this
procedure and was transferred to the PACU overnight for close
monitoring. He was following commands, moving all extremeties
and oriented. He was subsequently transferred to the floor. His
diet and activity were advanced.
.
He was found to have asymptomatic atrial fibrillation on [**7-16**]
and was seen by cardiology. He was treated with lopressor and
spontaneously converted to NSR within 24 hours of onset. He was
started on aspirin. He was also transfused with 1 unit PRBC for
Hematocrit of 24.7 which rose to 26.4 and IVF resuscitated.
Electrolytes were repleted aggressively.
.
He did have LFTs and pancreatic enzymes which were mildly
elevated and was evaluated by Hepatology who felt it was related
to transient post-operative biliary sludge seen on abdominal US.
LFTs, amylase and lipase subsequently dowtrended and patient
continued to be pain free and tolerating PO.
.
His incision remained clean dry and intact. The sutures were
removed [**2190-7-22**]. He had repeat head CTs which showed
decompression of SDH. However, patient did spike fever 101.6 and
had a waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] neuro exam. Infectious workup included CXR,
UA and blood/urine cultures which were all negative. Bilateral
LENIs were negative. EEG was negative for epileptiform activity.
MRI did not show significant ischemia to explain patient's exam.
Echocardiogram showed mild left ventriclar hypertrophy, LVEF 70%
and was otherwise within normal limits. He was seen by PT and OT
and felt to be a candidate for a rehab stay. At time of
discharge, patient was ambulating with assist, taking PO and
following some commands. Patient still has some residual
expressive aphasia which will take time to improve.
