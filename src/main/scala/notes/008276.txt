Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
near syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker replacement


History of Present Illness:
86M with h/o DM2, CAD s/p CABG, carotid stenosis, CHB s/p pacer
presents after episode of near syncope at home today. Recently
he has been feeling more fatigued, although this is variable.
The morning of admission, he was able to exercise on his
eliptical bike for 18 minutes (about 1 mile), longer than is
usual for him (13 minutes). After returning to his apartment, he
felt his legs give out as he was unlocking his door. He did not
lose consciousness or hit his head, but he lacked the energy to
pick himself up. He was able to push himself inside and call for
help. There were no preceding symptoms of vision changes, chest
discomfort, shortness of breath, palpitations, recent fevers or
chills. He has not recently had vomiting or diarrhea. His PO
intake has not been as good over the course of the summer
secondary to weakness in his arms (ulnar neuropathy, followed by
neuropathy) that limits his comfort cooking for himself.

Of note, he was recently seen by his NP on [**8-21**] for c/o
dizziness and gait unsteadiness. Physical exam at that time was
notable for BP 132/60 and P82, with no focal neurologic
deficits. In addition, he had previously been seen at EP device
clinic [**2198-9-18**] at which time his pacer was functioning
properly.

Upon evaluation by EMS, his vitals were BP 140/60 P 36 RR 16 O2
100% on room air. He was decribed as pale appearing and mildly
diaphoretic, but was awake and mentating clearly. His EKG showed
complete heart block with intermittent pacer capturing. He was
administered atropine 0.5mg once, with transient rise in his
heart rate to 72, subsequently returning to 20's-30's.

At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T 98 P 28 BP 119/52 RR 18 100%
RA. His physical exam was unremarkable aside from bradycardia.
He was given 1L normal saline, pacer plads were placed, and he
was admitted to the CCU for temporary pacer wire.
.
Review of systems is positive for stroke and TIA. There is no
history of thrombosis, PE, or bleeding diathesis. He
occasionally has blood on his toilet paper without hematochezia
or melena. He has night time leg pains due to neuropathy but
denies claudications.

years sometimes heavily (3ppd). He denies drinking alcohol in 50
years. Father had stroke in his 80's. No known MI or sudden
death.

Family History:
Non-contributory


Physical Exam:
T98 P28 BP 119/52 RR 18 O2 100% room air (pre transvenous pacer)
General: Pale but well appearing elderly man in no acute
distress
HEENT: RIJ with transvenous pacer in place, moist mucous
membranes
CV: Regular rate S1 S2 no m/r/g
Pulm: Lungs with few crackles at left base that persist after
coughing
Abd: Soft, +BS, nontender
Extrem: Warm, trace ankle edema bilaterally. 2+ radial pulses,
1+DP, 2+ PT pulses
Neuro: Alert and oriented, somewhat tangential speech but
re-directable, no gross deficits, moving all extremities

Pertinent Results:
EKG
left axis,
Complete heart block with occasional pacer capture, ventricular
rate approximately 36bpm, atrial rate ~130, inverted T's

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**4-15**] demonstrated:
EF 50% mildly dilated LA, 1+ MR, 1+AR, trivial TR. PA systolic
BP could not be estimated on this study.
.
ETT performed on [**4-15**] demonstrated:
reached 77% predicted HR on [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol, stopped secondary
to fatigue, no anginal symptoms. MIBI negative
.
LABORATORY DATA:
CBC: 8.0 > 35.8 < 271
Chem: 142/4.4/105/29/18/1.6<155
INR 1.0, PTT 34.9
CK 61, MB not done, Tropn<0.01

CXR
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable and within normal limits.  The patient is status post
median sternotomy and CABG.  A dual-lead right-sided pacer is in
place with unchanged appearance of pacer wires.  A left
perihilar opacity seen on the previous exam is no longer
visualized and may have represented loculated pleural effusion.
There are small, bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis.  Otherwise, no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary
edema.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 86M with history of CAD, DM2 c/b neuropathy, and CHB s/p
pacer presented after near-syncope episode at home today and
subsequently found to have malfunctioning pacer, likely the
etiology of his symptoms.

CARDIAC
1. Rhythm, CHB:
  Upon admission patient had transvenous pacer placement without
complications.  Nodal blocking agents were held.  Permanent pace
maker battery found to be dead, and patient ultimatly brought to
cath lab for generator replacement without complication.  Pt to
follow up in device clinic 2 weeks afte d/c.
2. Pump: EF 50% with history of diastolic heart failure,
clinically euvolemic.  Did not start beta-blocker given history
of orthostatic hyoptension
3. Ischemia: Continued ASA, statin.

ENDO
1. Diabetes: patient maintained on insulin sliding scale.
Restarted on home glipizide on discharge.

NEURO
1. h/o postural hypotension, h/o neuropathy: continue outpatient
florinef
2. chronic back pain: continue neurontin, tylenol as per home

OPTHAL
1. glaucoma: continue eyedrops but hold beta blocker

Shoulder Pain:
No signs of ischemia on EKG, patient with history of neuorpathic
pain.  Neurotin dose increase with good effect.

Dispo:  After being evaluated by physical therapy, patient felt
to benefit from a short stay in rehab due to concerns for falls
and for occupational therapy rehabilitation.
