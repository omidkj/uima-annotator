History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with CAD, CHF (EF 20%), v-tach s/p ICD
placement, AFib on warfarin, s/p whipple, chronic dyspnea with
2.5L NC at baseline, presenting with fever (100.2 at home),
rigors, and altered mental status. Patient has a history of
aspiration pneumonia, with admission in [**2142-4-22**] requiring an
ICU stay and ventilation.

Patient relates that symptoms began yesterday with fevers,
shaking chills and overall malaise.  He did have a cough prior
to admission, which was not productive of sputum, but usually
brought up undigested food.  Due to constipation, the patient
took extra Colace and Senna yesterday, and he had [**3-27**] bowel
movements.  After straining during one bowel movement, he felt
short of breath and dizzy.  He denies having any chest pain
yesterday, although history in the ED had noted some chest pain
prior to admission.  At his baseline, the patient sometimes has
dyspnea on exertion (walking around his home) and sleeps on 2
pillows at night.  He denies any leg swelling.  He denies any
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia,
melena, dysuria or hematuria.

In the ED, initial vs were: 99.2 74 95/64 16 99%.  He was alert
and oriented x2, pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive to SBP 75.
Of note, from recent previous OMR records, baseline BP is
105/68.  RIJ placed, with CVP 13 and MAP ~60.  After <500 cc of
fluids and abx, pt with improved MS though still not oriented to
time.  Vanc + levoflox given.  CXR showed bilateral opacities
c/w atelectasis vs. infection.  Total IVF given ~750cc with
resolving pressures to BP 91/51.  Given no meningismus, HA, or
neck pain, LP was deferred. Vitals on transfer: 101.8, 75,
91/51, 17, 97% 2L NC and CVP 13.

In the ICU, the patient was comfortable, oriented x3 and
conversant.  He knew that he was in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, but not in
the "nice" ICU that is in the clinical center.  He was breathing
comfortably on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.  He was
able to provide details of his history.

Imaging:
CXR [**7-21**]: Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with
leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and
coronary sinus.  Abandoned leads are also noted. There are low
lung volumes. The heart size is moderately enlarged. The aortic
knob is calcified, and there is mild tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta. There is mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
present. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect
atelectasis, though infection is not excluded. There are no
acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Low lung volumes
with streaky opacities in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis,
although infection is not excluded. Repeat films with improved
inspiration may be helpful for further evaluation.

[**2142-7-21**] 6:05 pm BLOOD CULTURE   (2 bottles)
   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2142-7-22**]):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
      Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 15571**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15572**] [**2142-7-22**]
12:12PM.
   Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2142-7-22**]):    GRAM
NEGATIVE ROD(S).

[**2142-7-25**] TEE:
Pacing wires present with shaggy echodensities that could
represent presence of clot / fibrin / vegetations. No valvular
vegetations seen. Severely depressed left ventricular function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-3-14**],
there appears to be more material associated with the wires,
although less views of the wires were taken previously.
