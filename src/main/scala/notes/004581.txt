Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
garbled speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79 yo man with hx of stroke in past ([**5-26**], L anterior corona
radiata), admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**8-26**] for transient aphasia (TIA, no
TPA), as well as hx DM, CAD, high chol, AAA, prostate CA last
PSA
19, PD, Dementia, who p/w acute change in
speech noticed at 9am after last known well time 8:30am.  The
patient had been living at NH ([**Hospital 100**] Rehab) since last
admission
to medicine service [**12-29**] for falls and mental status change; he
had apparently been in USOH at NH without speech, language or
comprehension problems at 8:30 AM. At 9AM physical therapist
went
to work with him and he was apparently speaking in garbled,
incomprehensible language.  There was no apparent weakness
noted.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] by ambulance as a "code stroke" and
arrived at 10:30AM; intial finger stick BG was >300, for which
the patient received insulin.  He was noted to be speaking very
few words, with very little comprehension (considered to have
some global aphasia).  There was also an apparent right visual
field cut. NIHSS score was 6 (aphasia, field cut, unable
to answer questions about loc). He had a head CT which only
showed
an old stroke L corona radiata without hemorrhage.  He
received IV TPA. Within one hour when next seen he had a
language
production which was garbled once again, with persistently poor
comprehension and repetition, considered to be more of a
Wernicke's type aphasia.  1-2 hours after that, his repetition
had improved.

Physical Exam:
MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3003**] to TPA
MS: awake, alert, interactive but unable to following commands
efficiently, only following simple midline and appendicular
commands withvisual cues
Speech  sparse w/ paraphasic errors, cannot name, repeat, or
comprehend
No evidence fo neglect

[**Last Name (Titles) **] (1hr post TPA; please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 28511**] note for pre-TPA
exam)
Afeb  175/75  HR 80  RR 18  97% RA
General appearance: well appearing, trying to speak but not
making sense, thin white elderly male
Heart: regular rate and rhythm
Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
GU: foley in place with blood in tubing
Extremities: warm, well-perfused

Mental Status: The patient is alert and attempts to respond to
questions but speech is slightly slurred and language is
frequently garbled with about 50% real words and 50% errors
(both
semantic and phonemic).  He could name some simple items (watch)
and could follow simple commands "point to the ceiling," "raise
your hand" and "open your eyes," but not "point to the exit."
He
said "[**Last Name (LF) 46536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] day" for "today is a [**First Name3 (LF) **] day" and said
gibberish when asked to repeat "in the dining room on the
table."
Read "baseball maysball" for "baseball player," and could not
read sentences.

Cranial Nerves: Visual acuity is intact. The visual field on the
right may be impaired to confrontation (assessed with blink to
threat). Eye movements are normal spontaneously, with no
nystagmus, though he did not follow directions to follow moving
finger.  Pupils react equally to light, both directly and
consensually.  Sensation was difficult to assess due to
comprehension problems.  Facial movements are normal and
symmetrical. Hearing is intact to voice. The palate elevates in
the midline. The tongue protrudes in the midline and is of
normal
appearance.

Motor System: Appearance, tone, power are normal in all 4 limbs,
including shoulder abductors, and extensors and flexors of the
arms, wrists, fingers, hips, knees, feet and toes.  There is no
tremor, drift, or abnormal movements.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are present, symmetric and normal.
The plantar reflexes are flexor on the left, extensor on the
right.

Sensory: The patient does not seem to have DSS when asked to
raise the hand being touched (raises both) but could not
comprehend more detailed sensory testing.  W/d to any stimuli
bilat ue/le.

Coordination: There is no ataxia. The finger/nose test is
normal.

Gait:  Gait could not be assessed.

Head CT [**2149-2-6**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  There is no evidence of acute
intracranial
hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline structures.  The
ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with involutional
change.  There is
hypodensity of the cerebral periventricular white matter,
consistent with
chronic microvascular infarction.  A chronic infarct is again
noted in the region of the left internal capsule.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
There are calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged
appearance of the brain compared to [**2148-12-25**].

[**2-6**] CT C-spine
INDICATIONS:  Assess for metal foreign body.
Coronal and lateral radiographs of the cervical spine were
obtained.
Comparison is made to a scout from a CT of the head from
[**2146-9-14**] (prior to brain MRI from later the same day).  Two
metallic fragments overly the lateral aspect of the left
cervical spine, anterior to the facet at C5.  An additional
metallic density overlies the right lung apex on the AP view.

[**2-6**] Chest X-ray
AP SEMI-ERECT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  No significant interval
change is
noted.  Again seen is a tortuous aorta.  The heart size is
within normal
limits.  The hilar regions appear unremarkable.  There is no
evidence for
consolidations.  No pleural effusions are seen.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.

ECHO - Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
