nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with Type I diabetes x 30 years complicated by
retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy who presents
with hyperglycemia. Per patient's son, the day prior to
presentation BS was >600. His son thought that he forgot to take
his lantus since there was no blood sugar registered on his
meter that am. He got 18 U humalog and still high at lunch time.
He then received 18 units then at 3:00 pm = 296, BS = 84 at
dinner. Patient then had dinner and had 4U humalog. At bedtime
BS = 121. At 5:10 am he was awoken by a dog barking. He then
called out to his dad to remind him to take his insulin. He
heard him vomiting and surmised that his BS was elevated which
it was. He then called the covering doctor [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 32033**] him to
bring him to the ED. In ED found to have glucose in urine with
ketones and sugar of 630. Received 4L NS, 10 units insulin IV,
started insulin gtt at 7units/hr, increased to 8 units. Also
received azithromycin and ceftriaxone x 1 for ? pulmonary
opacity. Also noted to have acute on chronic renal failure with
Cr 4.2

Pertinent Results:
Laboratory studies on admission
WBC-9.7 RBC-3.73 HCT-32.2 MCV-86 RDW-14.4 PLT COUNT-189
NEUTS-82.3 LYMPHS-13.8 MONOS-1.7 EOS-1.6 BASOS-0.5

CHLORIDE-91  CK(CPK)-78 CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-0.03

[**6-11**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Slight ST-T wave changes with borderline
prolonged QTc interval are non-specific, but clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2142-6-10**]
there is no suggestion of prior inferior wall myocardial
infarction.

Radiology
[**6-10**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload. Focal hazy
opacity posterior chest, likely representing confluence of
shadows, but early infiltrate cannot be excluded. Background
COPD

[**6-11**] CXR: There is persistent mild enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. Slighly improved interstitial pulmonary edema,
bibasilar ateletasis.

[**6-12**] Lumbar MRI: Acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra,
unchanged in configuration since [**2141-6-7**] but new since
[**2141-5-28**]. Status post L4 through S1 laminectomy and fusion
procedure with marked enhancing scar tissue at the laminectomy
site and circumferentially within the canal.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old male with Type I DM, mod AS, HTN admitted w/ DKA
secondary to med non-compliance. He was initially admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on an insulin gtt, and was rapidy transitioned back to
lantus and transferred to the general floor for further
management. Summary of hospital course by problem:

1) Diabetic ketoacidosis: Likely secondary to medication
noncompliance, given he had missed a lantus dose. No evidence of
infection (U/A neg, repeat CXR w/o infiltrate). [**Last Name (un) **] followed
the patient throughout his hospital stay, and he was discharged
on his home dose of lantus with an adjusted humalog sliding
scale. His hospital course was notable for a.m. hypoglycemia (FS
60s), asymptomatic. [**Last Name (un) **] felt that this was most likely to
enhanced dietary compliance while in-house, and did not
recommend further changes in his lantus dose. His most recent
HgbA1C was 8.3 [**2142-4-5**]. He will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] within 1
week. He will have VNA for further diabetic teaching. His son
agreed to monitor the patient's insulin administration. His last
eye exam was ~ 4 months ago. Given gradually worsening vision
over the last 2-3 months, he will need an outpatient
ophthalmology evaluation.

2) ARF: The patient's Creatinine trended down to  3.4 from 4.2
on admit with hydration, indicating likely pre-renal etiology in
the setting of osmotic diuresis. His baseline Creatinine was the
mid 2s until the last 4 mos when it rose to 3-3.3 (likely
progresion of diabetic nephropathy). His ACEI was held
throughout his hospital stay and will be restarted at the
discretion of his outpatient physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] furosemide was
initially held, and then restarted at 1/2 his home dose.

4) HTN: As mentioned above, given acute renal failure, the
patient's ACEI was held. He was continued on a beta-blocker and
amlodipine.
.
5) Anemia: HCT 27.8 on discharge from 34.7 on admit (likely
hemoconcentrated on admission, baseline 28-30). [**3-31**] iron
studies were not consistent iron deficiency, and vitamin B12 and
folate were within normal limits. Given his chronic renal
insufficiency, he would likely benefit from epogen as an
outpatient. He also should have an outpatient colonoscopy.

7) systolic CHF: EF 50-55%, mild pulm edema on CXR. The patient
remainded stable on room air throughout his hospital course. As
mentioned above, his ACEI was held; if his renal failure
presents this from being resumed as an outpatient,
hydralazine/nitrate may be considered.

8) Sciatica: Given reports of sciatica and compression fracture
visualized on recent plain films, his PCP had ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lumbar
MRI, which he had while in-house/ This showed an
acute-to-subacute compression fracture of L1 vertebra, unchanged
in configuration since [**2141-6-7**] but new since [**2141-5-28**].
It also showed marked enhancing scar tissue at L4 through S1
laminectomy/fusion site. He was started continued on calcium and
vitamin D. He was able to ambulate without difficulty and denied
back pain at discharge.
