Mr. [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 64 year-old man with HIV, ESRD on HD, Hep C, Dm
II and other multiple medical problems presented to the [**Name (NI) **] with

site but looked well, he received a dose of vanco empirically
and cultures were taken from the wound.
.
On [**1-31**], he received vancomycin and ceftaz (ceftaz added due to

morganella, ESBL, MRSA, B-hemolytic strep (only growing in the
broth).  On this day, blood cultures were also drawn.

organism noted on swab).  Blood cultures were noted to have no
growth. At this time SBP was noted to be approx 70, but 4kg
removed; at the end of dialysis, his blood pressure was noted to
be 94/50.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo M w/ HIV, ESRD on HD, Hep C, Dm II and other multiple
medical problems here with hypotension and somnolence.
.
# Sepsis: Patient presented with history of hypotension and
likely mental status change.  After IVF, his mental status has
improved greatly.  He had a normal WBC, and has been afebrile.
Of note, he has been receiving vancomycin since [**1-29**] and he may
be partially treated at the time of presentation.  Patient was
admitted to the ICU and treated with vanc and meropenem.  Blood
cultures at the hospital have not shown any growth.  The source
of this possible infection is not clear and there are multiple
possibilities: left dialysis site, left groin fluid collection,
right chest wound. Patient patient had I&D of chest wound at
bedside. Culture from chest wound without growth. Stopped ABX
per ID recs because of concern that we were just selecting for
resistent organisms that colonize him chronically.  Patient
remained afebrile and his WBC was normal throughout
hospitalization.  Repeat ultrasound of the groin fluid
collection did not show any fluid to be drained.  It is not
entirely clear if the patient ever really had a true bacteremia.
 He was not discharged with any abx.
.
#Hypoxia - Patient was on oxygen during his stay.  Per patient
he usually uses oxygen only at night.  However, it is not clear
if this is because the patient does not need oxygen or he
refuses it as he would refuse to wear his oxygen at times during
his hospital stay.  He refused to get out of bed despite daily
attempts by both the house staff and the nursing staff.  The
oxygen requirement is likley from atelectasis and should improve
if he gets out of bed back at rehab.
.
#Congestive heart failure - Recently admitted (late [**Month (only) **]
[**2125**]) for CHF (SOB requiring intubation), most recent echo
showed a low normal EF 50-55%, likely diastolic component.
Patient initially recieved a large amount of fluids in the
emergency room.  He had fluids removed at dialysis during the
hospitalization and volume status should be controlled at
dialysis as an outpatient.  He was restarted on his BB and [**Last Name (un) **].

.
ESRD - On HD T, [**Doctor First Name **], Sat at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital.  He recieved
dialysis while in the hospital to remove fluids.  He tolerated
dialysis well.  He was continued on his home renal meds.  PTH
level was checked, noted to be elevated.  He was started on
calcitriol every other day.
.
Diabetes:  Since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, last A1c 6.3 in [**2124-11-8**]
charcot foot, nephropathy.  During hospitalization, he has had
problems with low blood sugars.  He was not recieving insulin
and an insulin blood level checked was low.  [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes was
consulted.  Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out.  He was eating
and was confirmed to have a snack before bedtime.  His sugars
were usually low overnight.  The etiology is unclear with
possible difficulties with gluconeogenesis.  He was started on
diazoxide to help support his sugars.  This should be titrated
as needed.  He will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] after discharge.
.
Coagulopathy: History of multiple clots in grafts and IVC in
past, so is now on chronic coumadin.  He was also noted to have
swelling in his legs r>l but DVT was ruled out with ultrasound.
He coumadin was held in house for the draining procedure and was
restarted at discharge.
.
Anemia:  Currently baseline appears to be 26-28. Has chronic
anemia and had been on epogen.  His HCT was stable during the
hospitalization.
.
HIV/HCV: Last CD4 count 331 ([**12-15**]) nadir was 60 in [**2118**]. HCV
VL 4,290 IU/mL [**2125-11-19**].  Continued current outpatient
medications (ritonavir, stavudine and indinivir).  No need for
OI ppx as CD4>200
.
Hypertesion:  Home regimen consists of valsartan, atenolol and
norvasc. Me
