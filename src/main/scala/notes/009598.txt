ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Albuterol.
2. Atrovent.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide.
4. Aspirin.
5. Levoxyl.
6. Singulair.
7. Lipitor.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient has a temperature of 97.1,
heart rate 98, blood pressure 130/66, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 96 percent.  She is currently on a Esmolol
drip.  She is alert in no acute distress.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Neck is supple.  She has a regular
rate and rhythm.  She has a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
She is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is
nondistended.  She has bowel sounds.  It is soft.  There is

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratories include a white
blood cell count of 15.0, hematocrit 28.8, and INR of 1.6.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, right bundle
branch block, no ST elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service on [**2127-2-27**].  She received a cardiac surgery
consultation.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
received invasive monitoring including a central line for
central venous pressure monitoring and an arterial line for
blood pressure monitoring.  She received an Esmolol drip for
blood pressure control to keep her systolic below 120.  Her
pain was controlled with a Morphine drip.  After extensive
discussion between the attending surgeon, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
and senior vascular surgeons in house, it was decided that an
operation would be extraordinarily risky for the patient and
likely fatal.  After discussion with the family, it was
decided not to undergo surgery.  The patient was made DNR/DNI
by the family.  At approximately 7:00 p.m. on [**2127-2-28**], the
patient became acutely hypotensive and tachycardic.
Hematocrit was sent which showed a hematocrit of 24.6.  It
was assumed that the patient was then bleeding.  The patient
was declared dead at 8:10 p.m. on [**2127-2-28**].
