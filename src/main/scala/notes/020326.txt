HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  The infant was readmitted on
[**2158-2-6**], status post lung biopsy at [**Hospital3 18242**].  Lung biopsy results revealed chronic lung disease.
Infant was started on a 42 day course of dexamethasone on
[**2-8**], which completed on [**2158-3-27**].  He initially had a
nice response of dexamethasone, weaning to his lowest
settings of 25/6 with a rate of 20 and 60 to 70% oxygen.  He
then slowly escalated back to current settings of 38/7, a
rate of 35, 90 to 100% oxygen requirements.  On [**2-12**],
he started Aldactone and [**Month (only) **] and his current dosing is
Aldactone of 2 mg/kg/day and [**Month (only) **] 40 mg/kg/day. He started
Combivent 3 puffs q12 and Flovent 2 puffs q12 alternating.  He
also started Lasix q. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Infant, [**Known lastname **],
also was being treated with inhaled TobraDex ([**Female First Name (un) **]) secondary to
a sputum culture which was positive for Klebsiella enterobacter.
This was discontinued on [**3-21**] secondary to intolerance
requiring increased respiratory support with inhalation.

Baby continues to be followed closely by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**],
Pulmonary.
Scheduled for tracheostomy on [**2158-3-28**] because of anticipated need
for very long term mechanical ventilation.  His current
respiratory support is 38 for PIP, PEEP of 7, rate of 35,
requiring 95 to 100% oxygen with an inspiratory time of 0.6.  His
most recent blood gas was a capillary gas; pH was 7.29, PC02 94,
P02 41, total C02 was 47 and base excess was 13.

Surfactant B genetic testing is pending at [**Hospital 13**] Medical
Center.  If this were abnormal, [**Known lastname **] could become a candidate for
lung transplantation.  Parents are aware of this and have had
several discussions with us and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37305**] regarding his
prognosis.

Cardiovascular:  Infant has been cardiovascularly stable.
Audible intermittent murmur.  An echocardiogram was obtained
on [**2158-3-21**] to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension. Study was
limited to assess for right ventricular pressure, biseptal
position, systolic right ventricular pressure is less than
[**1-30**] systemic with qualitatively good biventricular function.
Infant also noted to have a patent foramen ovale with left to
right shunting, otherwise within normal limits.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  His current weight was
2.835 kg.  He is receiving 140 ml/kg/day of premature Enfamil

04:30 secondary for surgery of G tube placement and
tracheotomy. Infant was started on electrolyte supplement
secondary to hyperchloremic metabolic alkalosis. His chloride
nadir was 82 and that was on [**3-18**].  His most recent set of
electrolytes on [**3-26**] had a sodium of 136; potassium of 4.3;
chloride of 91; total C02 of 39.  His current
supplementations include sodium chloride of 3.5 meq/pg/q. 8
hours, approximately 4 meq/kg/day.  Potassium chloride 6
meq/pg/q. 8 hours, approximately 6.7 meq/pg/day.

Gastrointestinal:  In light of his significant respiratory
support needs, infant will be having a G tube placed on
[**2158-3-28**].  Infant noted to have a right inguinal hernia which
is present and reducible and is being followed by surgery.

Hematology:  Blood type is 0 positive. He has received 2

wbc 11,200.

Infectious disease:  On [**2158-2-7**], he completed a 7
day course of cefotaxime, status post lung biopsy. Evaluation
on [**2-8**], prior to starting dexamethasone, the infant
had some temperature instability and lethargy, requiring 48
hours of vancomycin and gentamicin. Cultures remained
negative and antibiotics were discontinued.  On [**2158-3-6**],
infant was started on Nystatin suspension for oral thrush
which was later discontinued on [**2158-3-13**].  On [**3-7**], a tracheal
aspirate was obtained which came back positive for Klebsiella
enterobacter.  Infant was started on cefotaxime and
gentamicin for a total of 14 days.  He also received
