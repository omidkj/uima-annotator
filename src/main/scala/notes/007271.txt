cardiac arrest today. Pt went to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (ENT) as an
outpatient today, who did CO2 laser for stenosis and downsized
her trach. Pt reportedly did well during the outpatient
procedure and went home. While at home, pt was able to climb
stairs by herself, then shortly afterwards she sat in a chair
and suddenly had a resp arrest. EMS was called, and pt's trach
was taken out due to occlusion, and ETT was placed in trach site
(she could not be intubated by mouth due to vocal cord
adhesions). While en route to [**Hospital6 302**], pt had
asystolic arrest. She was resuscitated with epi, and then
received dopamine for low BP while in the [**Hospital3 **] ED. She was
reportedly "down" for approx 15 min. She was stabilized on a
ventilator. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on a dopamine gtt.
On arrival to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**], pt was unresponsive and had
intermittent myoclonic jerks. Neurology service was consulted.
She then had a tonic-clonic seizure, and was given 1.5g Dilantin
and 2mg Ativan. Of note, pt's seizure and myoclonic jerks ceased
prior to receiving Dilantin or Ativan.
.
Pt's family reportedly said that pt was "not feeling well for
the past several weeks".
