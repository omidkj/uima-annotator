History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 -year-old female with history of left hip fracture
s/p ORIF [**4-23**], and subsequent admission from [**4-29**] to [**5-5**] for
NSTEMI treated medically, who was transferred to the ED today
from her nursing home where she was noted to have SBPs in the
70s.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
.
In the ED, initial VS were  60 76/52 20 99.  She triggered for
hypotension and received 2LIVF in the ED.  UA showed >180 wbc
and many bacteria and she was given zosyn for UTI.  Bloodwork
was significant for Hct of 23.0, down from 37.6 on discharge
[**5-5**].  She was given 2 U PRBC with improvement to 29.9.  Concern
was for variceal bleed, and she was loaded with protonix and
placed on ggt.  She was intubated for airway protection and
liver was consulted and did an upper endsocopy (once in the
MICU) which showed no concern for bleed.  Rectal showed brown
stool and G+.  BPs came up to SBPs in the 90s with fluids/blood,
though she did require push of norepinepherine for low systolics
peri-intubation

Of note, trop was elevated at 0.3 but this is actually
downtrending from her prior level of 0.41 during last admission
and imrpoved to 0.26 on recheck.  Given her history of SBP,
diagnostic para was done showing only 65 wbc.  Renal saw the pt
in the ED is following though felt no need for dialysis tonight
(MWF at baseline).
.
On arrival to the MICU, VS are 97.3  69  100/51  100% on AC
450/14/5/80%.  She is intubated and sedated, not answering
questions
.

Imaging:
CT abd/pelvix [**5-7**]-
1. Large hematoma measuring approximately 4.4 x 10.3 (TRV) x 8.4
(CC) cm in the medial left thigh with adjacent left femoral
metallic hardware, placed after prior study.
2. Large volume non-hemorrhagic ascites, slightly decreased from
previous study.
3. Stable bilateral pleural effusion with associated bibasilar
atelectasis.  Possible area of new consolidation in the left
lower lobe.
4. Dialysis catheter terminates within the inferior right atrium
as before.

TTE [**5-10**]- The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied left ventricle with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Lower extremity venous doppler [**5-11**]-
1. No evidence of DVT in the visualized veins
2. Subcutaneous edema of the calf, but calf veins not
visualized.
3. Loculated fluid in the left groin proably represents seroma
after hip surgery.

RUQ ultrasound [**5-12**]-
1. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly consistent with portal
hypertension.
Moderate-to-large ascites.
2. Patent portal vein.
3. Sludge in the gallbladder without evidence of gallstones. No
biliary obstruction. Gallbladder wall edema is noted, but
compatible with underlying liver disease and third spacing.

HIDA scan [**5-13**]- Acute cholecystitis is unlikely given
gallbladder filling. Delayed gallbladder filling only after
morphine administration may indicate a chronic cholecystis.

CT abd/pelvis [**5-15**]-
1. Stable hematoma in the left adductor muscles at the level of
the ischial tuberosity. Please note that the previously noted
hematoma in the left thigh at the level of the inferior aspect
of the plate in the femur is not depicted on this examination.
2. There is no evidence for retroperitoneal hematoma or
intraperitoneal
hemorrhage. A large volume ascites is non-hemorrhagic.
3. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
5. 1.3 cm hypodense lesion in the tail of the pancreas most
likely represents an IPMN. In the patient's age group, no
further followup is necessary.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yof with history of HepC cirrhosis, with known varices,
recent admissions for for hip fracture s/p ORIF and NSTEMI
treated medically, admitted from rehab for hypotension, found to
have significant Hct drop.

# Hypotension/Hct drop: Hct down from 37.6 to 23.0. Initial
concern was for variceal bleed given her history of varices.
However, she was scoped by hepatology with EGD showing no bleed.
CT showed 4x10cm hematoma over the left medial aspect of the
thigh/groin, likely source of acute blood loss, thought to be
exacerbate
