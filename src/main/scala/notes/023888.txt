HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for type 1
diabetes mellitus with Tri-Opathy, CHF, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and three episodes of pneumonia within
the last year who presents to the ED with three days of
chills, fever, nausea and vomiting.

On Wednesday this week, he began to have a cough with some
chills and production of yellow, blood-tinged sputum.  On
Thursday, the patient had a temperature of 101.5.  He had
nausea and vomiting throughout the three day course of his
illness.  He describes multiple episodes of vomiting each day
which were nonbloody.  The patient did notice some dyspnea on
exertion while he was climbing his stairs.  The patient
noticed that his appetite has been very poor during the past
week.  The patient also notes that he occasionally had very
bad "tremors".  He denied diarrhea, dysuria, chest pain,
headache, bright red blood per rectum.  He denied any recent
sick contacts or recent travel.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was given levofloxacin 250
mg, and Furosemide 60 mg by IV.  The patient was given 4 mg
of Zofran.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed in [**2081**]
with a history of DKA and retinopathy, nephropathy, and
neuropathy.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine trending
between 2.7 in [**2109**] as his baseline.
3.  Anemia, low epo secondary to chronic renal disease.
4.  CAD.  Echocardiogram in [**2107**] revealed trace AR, mild
concentric LVH, EF of 25%, and severe diffuse hypokinesis of
the left ventricle.  Catheterization in [**2108-5-22**] revealed
small vessel disease with LAD 50% to 60% stenosis.  No
intervention was necessary at that time.

sensitive to oxacillin.  The inciting wound was prepatellar
bursa injury that required debridement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives at home
with his wife in [**Name (NI) **].  He smoked two packs per day for
about 20 years, quitting in [**2086**].  History of alcohol abuse,
quit in [**2082**] after diagnosis of diabetes.  No history of IV
drug abuse.  The patient lives at home with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a daughter, grandmother and
brother with diabetes.  One of his siblings also has
esophageal cancer.  His father died of colon cancer.  His
mother died at 87 of CHF.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.8, heart
rate 88, regular, blood pressure 166/80, respiratory rate 20,
02 saturation 92% on room air.  In general, the patient was a
thin appearing male in moderate distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes moist.
The neck revealed no JVD.  The chest revealed bibasilar
crackles.  No accessory muscle use.  No parasternal
tenderness.  No CVA tenderness.  Cardiac:  Normal S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was benign.  The
extremities revealed 1+ tibial ankle edema, DP pulses 1+.
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was
alert and oriented times three, grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES:  White blood cell count 11.5,
hematocrit 32.3, platelet count 134,000.  Sodium 134,
potassium 5.0, chloride 97, bicarbonate 18, BUN 97,
creatinine 4.7, glucose 329, amylase 66, lipase 2, AST 22,
ALT 3, alkaline phosphatase 90, total bilirubin 0.9, total
protein 5.7, albumin 2.9, globulin 2.8.

The chest x-ray revealed bibasilar parenchymal opacities,
with marked increase in consolidation of left lower lobe
since [**2111-9-25**].  Residual loculated right effusion.

The U/A was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Doctor Last Name **]
Service where he was continued on his Levaquin and had sputum
cultures sent for his pneumonia.  The patient was diuresed,
given the possibility of CHF in addition to his pneumonia.
The patient continued to have a very high oxygen requirement
with 02 saturations running 93% on 100% nonrebreather.

The patient was electively sent to the MICU during which time
he was diuresed and followed very closely by Pulmonology and
Nephrology.  The nephrologist believed that the patient was
euvolemic at the time of discharge from the MICU and advised
no further Lasix use.

The pulmonologist believed that the patient was possibly
mucous plugging and the patient had two serial chest x-rays
which revealed the loculated pleural effusion.  The
pulmonologists were quite concerned that given his recurrent
pneumoniae and the chest x-ray that this may actually have
been due to postobstructive pneumonia secondary to a mass.

The patient was discharged from the MICU and sent to the
floor.  The patient remained quite tachypneic with a high 02
saturation on 93% on [**8-1**] liters 02 by nasal cannula. The
patient was seen again by Pulmonary who advised a noncontrast
CT given the patient's poor renal function.

After the CT, the pulmonologist recommended a tap of the
loculated pleural effusion.  The patient had 1.7 liters of
fluid removed from the left side.  Once the fluid was
removed, the patient's tachypnea and 02 saturation improved
dramatically.  The patient's 02 requirement decreased to 3
liters by nasal cannula.

The patient's BUN continued to rise to 136 and his creatinine
continued to rise to 6.6.  The patient was not thought to be
uremic at that time since his mental status continued to be
clear, but the Renal Team believed that it would beneficial
to place a Perma-Cath on [**2111-11-9**] and hemodialyze
the patient.

The patient was to have a peritoneal dialysis catheter placed
on the upcoming Friday since the patient's wish was to
continue peritoneal dialysis.  The patient was to have a
repeat chest CT at the time of this dictation.  After the
result of the chest CT, the patient was possibly to have a
bronchoscopy and a tissue biopsy that would be sent for
analysis to see if this was in fact a malignancy.  There was
also discussion about a repeat pleural effusion drainage by
Pulmonary.  This issue had not been resolved at the end of
this dictation.

This dictation covers the dates including and up to [**2111-11-8**].  The co-intern picking up the service after me will
dictate from [**2111-11-9**] onwards.  My pager number is
39-529.  If you have any questions, please feel free to page
