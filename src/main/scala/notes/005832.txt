History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] is a 75 yo M with a history of atrial fibrillation
(on coumadin), CHF, and metastatic bladder cancer, who presented
with progressive fatigue over 2 weeks prior to his admission,
and dark/black stool for one week prior to admission.  He denied
any other GI symptoms except mild nausea, but no vomiting.  In
his PCP's office, he was found to have a 12 point Hct drop since
[**7-23**] and admitted to the MICU for observation.  Of note, his NG
lavage was clear.  During his MICU stay, his coumadin was
stopped and he was transfused FFP and Vitamin K.  He also
received 3units PRBC.  An EGD was performed in the MICU which
was essentially negative for bleeding or varices, but he was
noted to have a tortuous esophagus.
*
On transfer to the floor, his hematocrit was stable (since
admission), and he had not had further dark stools.  He denied
CP/SOB, N/V, dizziness, fatigue, or abdominal pain.
*
Of note, the patient had a previous episode of GI bleeding in
[**10-21**].  He was treated at [**Hospital6 1708**], and at
that time had an EGD which showed and AVM in the second portion
of the duodenum.

EGD ([**2107-9-30**])
Tortous esophagus consistent with presbyesophagus was noted.  No
evidence of bleeding noted up to 2nd portion of duodenum.
Gastroscope could not be advanced beyond this area due to loop
foprmation in the stoamch. Procedure was repeated with a
pediatric colonsocope. Due to tortuosity of the stomach, pylorus
could not be intubated despite multiple attempts, repositioning.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2107-10-1**] 9:24 PM
No evidence of failure. Slight improvement from [**9-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with h/o Atrial fib (on coumadin) and metastatic
bladder cancer, who presented with progressive fatigue and GI
bleeding (black stool).
*
1) UPPER GI BLEED -  In the emergency department, an NG lavage
was performed which was clear.  The patient was admitted to the
MICU and was given FFP, and Vitamin K because he was on coumadin
as an outpatient.   He was also given 3 units of PRBCs and an IV
proton pump inhibitor.  An EGD was also performed in MICU, which
was essentially negative for bleeding or varices but showed a
tortuous esophagus.  After stabilizing, the patient was
transferred to the floor for further observation.  His
hematocrit remained stable and he had no further episodes of
melena.  Repeat endoscopy was deferred because the patient's
hematocrit was stable, and the diagnostic yield from a repeat
procedure was thought to be low.
*
2) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] was taken off of his
coumadin on admission due to his bleeding.  Overall, he was rate
controlled, but intermittently tacycardic to the 140's.  This
was thought due to hypovolemia.  He was continued on carvedilol
and digoxin for rate control.   He was not restarted on his
coumadin at the time of discharge since this was the patient's
second GI bleed in the last year while on coumadin.
*
3) CAD - The patient had angina briefly in ED with rate related
ST depressions in the lateral and inferior leads.  The changes
resolved with IVF volume replacement. He was ruled out with
three sets of cardiac enzymes.  Serial EKG's were obtained.  His
aspirin was held due to his GI bleeding.
*
4) CHF - Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] has a h/o CHF and was given Lasix following
his transfusion. After he was hemodynamically stable, his
zestril and coreg were all restarted with conservative hold
parameters.
*
5) FEN - The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
*
6) CODE STATUS: The patient was DNR/DNI during this admission.
*
