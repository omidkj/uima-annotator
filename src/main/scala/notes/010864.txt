History of Present Illness:
HPI:  [**Age over 90 **] year old lady with COPD, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], dementia
presented to [**Hospital3 **] for respiratory distress from a
Nursing Home.  She was noted to be hypoxic to 70s after liquid
dinner (history of aspiration).  Patient was placed on BiPAP and
saturation improved to 100s per record.  She received zosyn
3.375 gram IV and Vancomycin 500 mg IV once for Pneumonia and ?

CXR: [**12-19**]: Several opacities are seen in the left lower lung as
well as in the right
upper and right lower lung that might represent multifocal
pneumonia or areas
of aspiration. There is no evidence of failure. There is no
pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable except for
tortuous and prominent aorta and the aneurysmatic dilatation of
the aorta
cannot be excluded based on single projection radiograph.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old lady with COPD, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], dementia
presented with respiratory distress and hypernatremia.
.
# Hypernatremia:  Most likely secondary to dehydration.
Pneumonia, UTI and hyperglycemia are contributing to this.
Started d5 1/2 NS to correct it slowly , in first 24 hrs
decreased from 170 to 158. Overnight the pace of correction has
slowed, now plateaued in low 150s. Clinically much improved,
less obtunded.  Patient was then transferred from the MICU to
the floor, with sodium of 152.  We did q12 hour Na+ checks and
increased her fluid to 200/hr and the sodium continued to trend
down slowly.  Her mental status remained unchanged.
.
# Pneumonia:  Leukocytosis and bandemia.  Elevated lactate.
Aspiration vs. Nursing home acquired PNA. CXR consistant with
aspiration PNA. Blood cultures were negative. Respiratory status
greatly improved, oxygen requirement decreased with vanco and
zyosyn.  On transfer from the MICU to the floor the patient had
02 sats >96% on 2L.  02 was weaned and vanc/zosyn was continued
for planned 14 day course.  Given her quickly changing renal
function, vanc was dosed based on trough level after each dose.
.
# UTI: UA consistent with UTI.  Urine culture grew Providencia
Stuartii. This was sensitive to Zosyn which she was already on
for pneumonia, so this was continued.  The patient's foley was
dc'd on arrival to the floor.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Unclear baseline creatinine.  Most likely
prerenal. UOP increasing and Cr steadally improving to 3.0.  On
arrival to the floor, her creatinine improved to 2.0 with
continued IV fluids.
.
# COPD:  History of COPD. Was originally on solumedrol 125 IV
and titrated down yesterday. Discontinued  solumedrol ( 40  IV
daily) as COPD exacerbation unlikely, not wheezing.  On the
floor she was continued on albuterol and ipatropium nebs.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  Known DM2.  Most likely in the setting of
stress (infection, respiratory distress) and steroids.  On the
floor her blood sugars were in the high 200s, we increased her
glargine and continued sliding scale insulin.
.
# lower extremity dry gangrene:  Patient has neuropathy and DM2.
 Long term problem per family.  On the floor, her foot was noted
to be odorous and have slight drainage.  We spoke to the family
who re-iterated that they did not want amputation at this point
as the patient would not likely survive the surgery.  We
continued wound care.
.
# FEN:  NPO for now as high aspiration risk, replete lytes prn.
Disucussed  with family option to feed with known aspiration
risk vs no further nutrition. Family responsable and had started
hospice care discussion prior to this hospitalization. Would
benefit from palliative care, SW after transferred out of ICU.
On the floor, the patient was continued on PO meds, had a repeat
swallow study which showed chronic aspiration.  There was a
family meeting planned to discuss issues of eating on the day
that the patient was transferred back to the MICU.
.
# GI Bleeding: On day 2 on the floor, the patient was noted by
nursing to have upper extremity swelling.  An upper extremity
doppler ultrasound showed evidence of DVT.  The patient was
started on a heparin gtt.  Later that night she was noted to be
hypotensive.  A stat hematocrit was checked and was 18.  The
heparin was stopped and she was transferred to the MICU. Upon
arrival to the ICU, per family's wishes EJ access x2 and a-line
were established. On arrival SBP in 60s. She was aggressively
repleted with IVF and blood. Heparin was reversed with
protamine. BP was supported with levophed. After further
discussion with the family the pt was made CMO and started on a
morphine gtt. The died on the morning of [**12-25**].
