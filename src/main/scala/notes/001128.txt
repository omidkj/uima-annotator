Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematochezia, Abdominal Distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Colonoscopy with biopsies
Ultrasound guided paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
47F with PMH of chronic depression, hemorrhoids x 20+ years
presents with BRBPR for past 2 weeks.  Patient states that 2
weeks ago, she drank tap water, which she normally does not do,
and began to have diarrhea.  Since then, she has been going to
the bathroom every hour, with small amounts of loose stool,
until two days ago, when she became more constipated.  She has
noticed her hemorrhoids more recently, in the sense that when
she uses the bathroom, she can feel them popping out from her
sphincter, and finds blood on the toilet paper when she wipes.
There is no pain associated with her hemorrhoids.  At the same
time, she has noticed worsened abdominal distension and her
clothes no longer fit.  She denies abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting.  Yesterday, she had a fever of 100F with some sweats,
but has not noticed any fevers since.  She was also complaining
of reflux symptoms over the past three days for which she had
been taking an over the counter anti-acid.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8, 106, 116/80, 18, 100% RA.
Labs were notable for an HCT of 24.5 with an MCV of 122, Plt of
109, AP of 204, t-bili of 3, AST of 62, ALT of 18, amylase of
219, lipase of 123, INR of 1.7 and negative serum/urine tox
screens.  A CT of her abdomen/pelvis with contrast was notable
for a thickened colonic wall consistent with colitis and a
moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis/paracolic gutters.
She was given levofloxacin, with plans to start flagyl but did
not receive this in the ER.  She was given 4g of Mg and 40meq of
potassium.  GI was consulted with possible plans for a
colonoscopy on Monday, she had two 18 gauge IV's placed but was
not transfused any PRBC's in the ER.  She was admitted to the
ICU for frequent HCT monitoring.  VS on transfer were: T 98.4,
BP 118/86, RR 17, O2 sat 100% RA.

On arrival to the ICU her initial VS were: T98, Hr99, BP129/88,
RR20, Sat 100% (RA).  She looks comfortable with no abdominal
pain, nausea/vomiting.  She does feel somewhat lightheaded, but
no chest pain or SOB.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
ECG [**2123-8-21**]:
Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression with low QRS voltage in
the precordial leads and the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2112-8-9**] the QRS voltage has decreased and
there is poor R wave progression.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/ Contrast [**2123-8-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneously enhancing liver with a gastroesophageal varix
and ascites; consider an acute inflammatory process of the
liver. Correlate for clinical presence of hepatitis.
2. Thickened right colonic wall, with lesser thickening of the
left colon wall and transverse colon sparing; this finding may
be nonspecific in the setting of ascites; another consideration
is colitis (infectious versus inflammatory etiologies).

Liver/ GB U/S [**2123-8-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous liver with patchy areas of increased
echogenicity, finding
suggestive of steatosis or possibly acute inflammation. No
definite hepatic
lesion is identified.
2. Diffuse gallbladder wall edema, likely secondary to edema
and/or
underlying liver disease. No signs of acute cholecystitis.
3. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
4. Moderate ascites, largest pocket in the right lower quadrant.



Brief Hospital Course:
47F with PMH of chronic depression, hypothyroidism, and alcohol
abuse presenting with hematochezia and abdominal distension and
signs of acute liver injury with secondary portal
hypertension/ascites.

1) Portal hypertension complicated by ascites due to acute or
chronic hepatitis:  Pt presented with thromobocytopenia,
increased transaminases with AST>ALT, elevated bilirubin, and
elevated INR that did not normalize with vitamin K.  She also
had ascites that was eventually revealed to have a SAAG of 1.3
suggestive of being due to portal hypertension.  Imaging
revealed heterogeneous liver.  Overall picture is somewhat
confusing.  Possible patient has chronic portal hypertension due
to cirrhosis (most likely due to previous alcohol abuse) but
imaging not strictly typical and though SAAG met criteria for
being due to portal hypertension ascites albumin was relatively
high.  Other possibility w
