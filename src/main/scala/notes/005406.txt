Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity "oozing"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal Echocardiogram
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF
20%with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, newly
diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
with right leg edema and weeping.

Per discharge summary from [**Hospital1 **], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2123-9-13**] for increasing shortness of breath.  Per
report, a chest xray at [**Hospital1 **] showed COPD, a left lower lobe
infiltrate, and no evidence of CHF.  BNP was 1510.  He was
started on IV Levaquin and he had symptomatic improvement in his
dyspnea.  He was given Lasix for diuresis and had an echo that
showed his EF had decreased from 40 to 20%.  He was also noted
to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on
Coumadin (although per patient report, has not taken it) and
continued on Toprol XL 25mg po daily.  He remained
rate-controlled.  He was not started on an ACE-I due to
hypotension.  He also had some asymptomatic hypoglycemic
episodes.  He has known renal insufficiency and his creatinine
stabilized at the OSH at 1.7.  He was discharged home on
[**2123-9-15**] and completed a course of Levaquin.

Per signout, he then returned to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2123-9-22**] with "right
foot pain."  He was transferred for evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].

Per patient history, about one month ago his son was diagnosed
with prostate cancer.  Since that time, he has had difficulty
eating and sleeping.  He denies any changes in breathing and
states that he didn't know he had been diagnosed with pneumonia.
 He also denies being given any Coumadin.  He does endorse
increasing lower extremity edema with weeping of clear fluid.
He denies any lower extremity pain but does have some pain with
walking that has been stable for him since his prior bypass
surgeries in his leg.  He denies any shortness of breath and
states he can walk multiple football fields without getting
short of breath as long as he does it slowly.  He denies
orthopnea, PND, cough.  He walks with a cane or walker.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

DISCHARGE LABS:

[**2123-9-22**] ECG:
Baseline artifact precludes definite assessment of the atrial
mechanism which could be atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter
with block. There is a single ventricular premature beat.
Intraventricular conduction delay with underlying inferior and
probable anterolateral myocardial infarction. Low limb and
lateral precordial lead voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2117-7-2**] atrial tachy-arrhythmia is new with previous
tracing showing sinus rhythm. Clinical correlation is suggested.


[**2123-9-22**] Chest Xray: No evidence of pulmonary edema, unchanged
moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.

[**2123-9-23**] Transthoracic Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferoseptum,
inferior, and inferolateral walls. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF =
10 %. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:Severe biventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate
mitral regurgitation.

CT/CTA abd/chest [**9-27**]:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. Significant
atheromatous
disease along the aorta and its major branches.
2. Prolonged presence of IV contrast in the right-sided
circulation,
resulting in suboptimal evaluation of CTA abdomen in the
arterial phase.
3. No discrete thrombus or stenosis in the SMA, SMV or celiac
trunk.
4. Non-specific mild colonic mucosal enhancement without colonic
wall
thickening. No pneumatosis or portal venous gas. No definite
evidence of
bowel ischemia.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
6. Diffuse body wall anasarca.
7. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

CT head [**9-27**]:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or vascular territorial infarct.
2. Overall, no change when compared to the recent study.

TEE [**9-28**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A thrombus is seen at
