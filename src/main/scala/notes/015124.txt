History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG [**2180**], AVR [**2200-3-24**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve, HTN, AFIB, DM2, transferred from
[**Hospital 5871**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for workup of acute GIB. Admitted
to [**Location (un) 5871**] on [**1-11**] considering replacing his mechanical with
porcine valve, but there he had CP and dizziness per GI consult
note there, but was found to have INR 5 and Hct 18. Over 2
weeks, he received 14 U RBC, Hct up to 30s but then drifted
down. Did capsule limited by food but possibly melena, EGD
negative, bleeding scan negative, found blood trickling down
from terminal ileum. Patient did not notice any blood, but blind
in R eye and mostly blind in L eye. Patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and potential replacement of
metallic aortic valves with porcine valve that would not require
anti-coagulation.

Imaging:
[**2201-1-29**]: Chest xray: The patient has had median sternotomy. Mild
cardiomegaly has been present without change since [**2193**]. Also
unchanged is a prominent left upper lobe pulmonary artery which
should not be mistaken for juxtahilar nodule. Lungs are
essentially clear. Left posterior healed rib fractures are
longstanding. No pleural abnormality or evidence of central
adenopathy.

Endoscopy:
[**2201-1-30**]: EGD/Enteroscopy: Normal mucosa in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the upto mid jejunum
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to mid jejunum
.
[**2201-2-6**]: EGD: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Mild gastritis in the stomach
Gastric nodule.
[**2201-2-6**]: Capsule Endoscopy: 1. Angioectasia (nonbleeding) in the
distal duodenum or proximal jejunum 2. Angioectasias in the
jejunum that are not bleeding 3. Phlebectasia 4. nonbleeding
Angioectasias in the distal jejunum

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 64 M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG [**2180**] and
drug-eluting stent to SVG in [**1-/2200**], AVR [**2200-3-24**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve, HTN, AFIB, DM2, transferred from [**Hospital 5871**]
Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for workup of acute GIB.
.
1. Acute Blood Loss anemia from GI bleed: The patient initially
presented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital with shortness of breath and chest
pain; he was found to have a marked anemia, bloody stools, and a
supratherapeutic INR.  He was transfused with pRBCs and
stabilized. Evaluation there pointed to a GI source but could
not localize a lesion. During his stay there his home regimen of
aspirin, Plavix, and coumadin was discontinued due to the risk
of exacerbating the GI bleed.  He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on a heparin
drip.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. He
was first admitted to the Cardio-Thoracic surgery service for
consideration for replacing the metallic aortic valve with a
porcine valve that would not require anti-coagulation.  However,
given that he had already undergone a re-do sternotomy; it was
not felt safe to open the chest again. After several attempts at
localizing a lesion, small angioectasias were found in multiple
sections of the small bowel.  Also, mild gastritis was found.
However, no active bleeding was indentified.  Given the
dispersed location of the angioectasias included some very
distal lesions, an endoscopic therapeutic option was not
feasible.  His hematocrit was stabilized by the time of
discharge for ~2 weeks as the evaluation continued.  He will be
discharged on a PPI at twice daily dosing to complete 1 month
afterwhich he will decrease the dose to daily.  He will be
anti-coagulated with coumadin with INR target of 2.5-3.5.  His
INR and hematocrit should be closely monitored weekly for 1
month.  Strict attention should be made to maintain his INR in a
therapeutic range to decrease the likelihood of re-bleeding. His
anti-platelet agents were not restarted during this hospital
stay due to the risk of re-bleeding would likely outweigh the
risk of in-stent thombosis now 13 months since the placement of
the most recent stent. These medications could be re-considered
as an outpatient. His hematocrit at discharge was 28.9 and his
INR was 2.7.
.
2. AV replacement: The patient continued on anti-coagulation
with heparin drip monotherapy while the GI bleed evaluation
continued.  He was discharged with coumadin as above.
.
3. CAD, CHF - The patient has an extensive history of coronary
disease including a CABG in [**2180**] and subsequent
re-vascularizations.  Given his risk of life-threatening GI
bleeding his anti-platelet agents were discontinued.  He
remained chest pain free during his hospital stay.  He was
well-compensated from his CHF.  He remained on carvedilol with
adequate heart rate and blood pressure control. He remained on a
statin.  Aspirin and plavix were held as above. If his blood
pressure would tolerate it, he would be a good candidate for
adding [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] to his heart failure regimen.
.
4. Itch: The patient complained of intense itchiness of his
lateral forearms. In talking with the patient's wife this has
been a chronic problem for him and gets adequate control of the
symptoms with over-the-counter remedies.  The area of concern
was without appreciable skin changes or rash.  He was discharged
with anti-histamines and topical therapies for symptomatic
relief.  An evaluation by an allergist may be of benefit as an
outpatient.

5. Diabetes Mellitus
