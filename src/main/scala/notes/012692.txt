History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 y.o. male with h/o rheumatic heart disease s/p
mechanical mvr/avr, afib (s/p VVI PPM); CAD s/p x 2 with
stenting of RCA and LAD; h/o CHF with preserved EF 55%; 2+MR
around [**Location (un) 31820**] leakage around mechanical valve, recently
discharged for severe CHF
requiring natrecor, lasix and dopamine drips, chronic anemia,
MDS, and more recent d/c for fall and ARF admitted to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital on [**2-10**].
*
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 882**] with hypoxia and change in mental
status from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, pt with a 7 lb weight
gain over week prior to admission, with attempted increase in
Bumex to compensate for weight gain. On day of admission, pt
with increasing somnolence and O2 sat 80s on room air --> 92% on
2L. +SOB. Also, in the week prior to admission, pt's Remeron was
doubled secondary to depression. Additionally, pt's daughter
said that pt had slurred speech week PTA and called her saying
nonsensicle things, which is unusual for him (of note remeron
doubled around that time).
*
At [**Name (NI) 882**] Hospital pt found to be in hypercarbic respiratory
failure with PCO2 71. Pt placed on BiPAP and transferred to ICU.
He was maintained on BIPAP, and diuresed on a natrecor drip,
lasix drip, and dopamine for BP support . Pt ruled out by
cardiac enzymes and EKG for MI. Repeat echo done to rule out
[**Name (NI) 31820**] [**Name (NI) 3564**] showed EF 60% and functioning mechanical
valves. On CXR pt with loculated effusion that was tapped on
[**2129-2-14**] c/w transudative process per D/C summary. He was started
to be treated to a CAP but this was stopped secondary to
decreased suspicion with Abx d/cd [**2129-2-14**] (do not know which
abx). Pt presented with ARF to 2.4 peak but down to 1.2 upon
transfer. Additionally, pt's coumadin was held there as pt got
thoracentesis and he was bridged on a heparin gtt. Pt also found
to be c. diff positive and started on flagyl [**2129-2-15**]. Pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
*
Today, pt feels well. No SOB or CP. Breathing "is pretty good."
Pt tells team that he has been compliant with low sodium diet
and there have been no recent medication changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF- On the floor, he failed to diurese to natrecor and
lasix, with dopamine for BP support.  He was still fluid
overloaded on exam, but was becoming hypotensive to low
70s-upper 60s.  He was transferred to the CCU for invasive
hemodynamic monitoring.  Initially, his PA pressures were
70s/30s, with a wedge of 23.  His CO was 7 with an SVR of 469.
He was placed on natrecor, vasopressin, lasix, and dopamine.
This was changed in the AM to vasopressin, lasix, and levophed,
as given his low SVR and low-grade temp it was felt he had some
septic physiology.  Since he was also clearly volume overloaded,
he was given diuril to augment diuresis with Lasix, which was
effective.  He had a large pleural effusion, which was tapped on
[**2-19**] and was c/w transudate.

The patient was ultimately controlled with levophed and a lasix
drip alone which were both successfully weaned off. His
management was optimized with diuril 250 mg daily, lasix 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **], digoxin 0.125 mg QOD given his renal dysfunction, and
spironolactone 50 mg daily. He was not placed on an ACE-I or
beta-blocker given his relative hypotension with systolic blood
pressures in the high 80s and 90s - which is his baseline blood
pressure.

2. CAD- The patient was continued on a statin, plavix and ASA.
The patient ruled out at OSH by enzymes.  He was not placed on a
beta-blocker given his low blood pressure.
*
3. Rhythm- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and
was monitored on telemetry with no issues. Given his initial
rate in the 120s, digoxin was initiated for better rate control
and he remained stable thereafter. He was placed on coumadin
after his swan was discontinued and a heparin drip to bridge to
coumadin. His goal INR is 2.5 to 3.5 as he also has 2 prosthetic
valves.

*
4. C. diff- The patient was diagnosed with C. diff at the OSH.
He was continued on metronidazole 500 tid for 10 days treatment
([**2129-2-15**] 1st dose).  He had no further episodes of diarrhea.
*
4. CRI- Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.7. His creatinine ranged from
1.7-1.9 during his stay.
*
5. Anemia- Secondary to mechanical hemolysis MDS and anemia of
chronic disease. He was continue on iron/folate and transfused
one unit during his stay. The patient was restarted on epoetin
20,000 MWF. His baseline Hct is 29-30. He is also guaiac
negative. Our goal Hct for him is to transfuse for Hct <27 as
his hematocrit drops within a few days post transfusion
regardless. His hematocrit remained stable otherwise throughout
his stay.
*
6. Nosocomial pneumonia
- The patient was presumed to have a nosocomial pneumonia and
placed on Zosyn for a 7 day course. He remained afebrile
thereafter.

7. CO2 retention
- The patient's CO2 remained in the 40s. Pulmonary followed the
patient and believed the patient would benefit from an
outpatient sleep study and PFTs to assess for obstructive sleep
apnea. He was at first treated with diamox which had little
effect on his serum bicarbonate and was thus, discontinued. It
is important that his potassium is checked frequently and
maintained above 4.0 to ensure his bicarbonate does not rise
further.
