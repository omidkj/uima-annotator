[**2181-7-23**]:CXR: Left sixth and seventh rib fractures.
[**2181-7-23**]:CT torso Left 6 and 7 lateral rib fractures. Otherwise
no findings of acute trauma
[**2181-7-23**]:CT Head: no traumatic injury
[**2181-7-23**]:CT Cspine: No definite fracture seen.
Mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 which is likely on a
degenerative basis,
however, if there is strong clinical suspicion for ligamentous
injury, MRI
would be more sensitive.

[**2181-7-25**]:CT Abd/Pelvis
1. Large subcapsular splenic hematoma (involving greater than
>50% of the splenic capsular surface) with no evidence of active
bleeding, however there has been intermittent bleeding with
blood of varying densities within the hematoma. There has been
recent hemorrhage with high- density blood within this hematoma.
In addition hemoperitoneum is present.
2. Non-displaced fractures of the left fifth and sixth lateral
ribs with no evidence of pneumothorax.
3. Other solid organs are normal.

[**2181-7-25**]:CT head:
IMPRESSION: Mild bifrontal effacement of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation, could be technical, however, in the setting of
trauma, cerebral edema is a differential consideration and
short-term interval followup is recommended.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
  ATTENDING NOTE: The frontal abnormality is likely due to
motion

[**2181-7-31**] CXR: A new round 2 cm wide opacity projects lateral to
the right hilus, and was not present on torso CT on [**7-23**]. If
this is genuinely a lung nodule, it would have to be infectious,
likely a septic embolus. Reticulation at the right lung base
medially is probably mild residual edema, but could be due to
aspiration. There are no findings to suggest pneumonia
elsewhere. The heart is normal size and there is no appreciable
pleural effusion. Vascular deficiency in the upper lungs is
probably a function of centrilobular emphysema. Previous
atelectasis or small pneumonia in the left upper lobe seen on
the torso CT has resolved over the past eight days. Heart size
is normal.

[**2181-8-1**]:CT Abd/Pelv:
1. New right lower lung opacities most likely represent acute
infectious
process or aspiration. Small left lower lung opacity may
represent atelectasis but acute infectious process can not be
excluded
2. Decrease in size of large subcapsular splenic hematoma and
hemoperitoneum.
3. Stable nondisplaced left rib fractures.

[**2181-8-2**]:ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: no vegetations or shunt seen

[**2181-8-4**]: CXR:  Two views of the chest are compared to the prior
study from [**2181-7-31**]. There is a nodular density in the right mid
lung zone seen on the prior study. There is patchy airspace
consolidation of the right mid and lower lung zones,
superimposed on interstitial disease. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma service in the trauma ICU
after initial evaluation and appropriate imaging studies were
performed in the ED.  She remained hemodynamically stable
throughout. She was extubated hospital day #2 and transferred to
the surgical floor.  She remained well initially, was tolerating
a regular diet, oxygen saturations were maintained and her pain
was controlled for her rib fractures.  On the morning of
hospital day #3 however she began complaining of acute and
severe left abdominal pain and was tender to palpation in the
LUQ.  A hematocrit at that time revealed acute blood loss anemia
at 16.5.  A stat CT revealed a splenic laceration that had not
been evident on her admission imaging.  She remained
hemodynamically stable at this time.  She was transferred to the
ICU and appropriately transfused.  Serial HCTs and abdominal
exams were performed and after an initial transfusion
requirement for 24 hours her HCT stabilized.  A total of 3 units
of PRBCs were transfused.  The patient was observed on bedrest
in the ICU for another 2 days and then transferred to the floor.
 Her diet was advanced and she was allowed to ambulate with
assistance.

She became febrile on [**7-31**] in the p.m. Urine cultures were
obtained, and eventually noted to grow group B Streptococcus. A
CXR on the same day demonstated densities c/w septic emboli
(absent on chest CT done [**7-23**]). She remained intermittently
febrile to as high as 102.6 [**8-1**], and was started on levofloxacin
[**8-1**] p.m.  A CT showed patchy opacities as well as a more dense
stellate opacity concerning for a septic embolus.  An ID consult
was obtained as she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Sputum cultures eventually grew gram negative rods and yeast.
An echocardiogram to rule out valve endocarditis was negative.
Blood cultures were negative ultimately as well. Infectious
disease recommended changing broad spectrum antibiotis to
levofloxacin and flagyl on discharge until [**8-14**].

She failed multiple voiding trials during the hospitalization
and had to have her foley replaced 3
