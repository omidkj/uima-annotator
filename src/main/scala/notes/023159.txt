Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the MICU for hypercapneic
respiratory failure upon admission.  While in the ICU, she was
diuresed and placed back on her home BiPAP regimen with a sleep
medicine consult.  Her mental status and respiratory status
improved quickly back to her baseline requirement of 4-6L nc
with sats in high 80s-low 90s.  She was transferred out to the
floor where she was put back on her home diuretic regimen and
was continued on her chronic CHF, COPD, and pulmonary
hypertension regimen.  The sleep medicine service recommended
that she have an autoset BIPAP machine with 4-6L home O2 at home
with new settings of 18cm/15cm; they arranged for her to have
this delivered home on the day of discharge.  She was given the
influenza vaccine and Pneumovax prior to discharge.
