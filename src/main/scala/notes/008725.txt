Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia, R sided weakness

History of Present Illness:
69 yo male w/ PMHx sig for breast ca s/p mastectomy,

difficulties. History was obtained from his wife and limited
amount from patient due to speech problems. [**Name (NI) **] was in his USOH
the evening prior to admission. The morning of admission he woke
up and was watching TV when wife saw patient appearing normal at
~ 9:45am.  She said "good morning" and he replied "good morning"
back. His wife then entered the kitchen and came back out to ask
the patient a question but he could no longer answer her. She
also noted that patient's right side was weak. She called her
daughter and they brought the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. Code stroke was called at 11:30a.

Radiology:
CT head - There is some motion artifact on the examination.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of midline
structures. There is no hydrocephalus. Hypodensities in the
subcortical white matter as described on the earlier studies are
unchanged as are hypodensities in the basal ganglia. The
posterior fossa and midbrain are not well evaluated due to
motion artifact. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears to
still be preserved with no new clear area of acute infarction.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Questionable loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter differentiation in the
left frontal lobe (on image 22), may present an evolving
infarct.

MRI OF THE BRAIN: The study is markedly degraded due to patient
motion artifact. There is an acute infarction in the left middle
cerebral artery territory with focal areas of restricted
diffusion seen peripherally in the left MCA distribution near
the cranial vertex. Additionally, there is a more wedge-shaped
area of restricted diffusion in the far posterior left parietal
lobe. The areas of restricted diffusion are not confluent in
nature. There is some increased FLAIR signal intensity
corresponding to areas of restricted diffusion. No obvious
susceptibility artifacts are identified to suggest hemorrhagic
transformation. T2-weighted images are markedly degraded due to
motion artifact. However, there is circumferential mucosal
thickening, mild in the right and moderate in the left maxillary
sinuses. There is also a small amount of fluid seen in the
sphenoid sinus. Perfusion series images were acquired and are to
be processed separately, by the Neurology service.

MR ANGIOGRAM: There is irregularity and thickening seen of the
extracranial left internal carotid artery at the skull base with
narrowing of signal intensity in the center of the artery. This
continues to involve the pre- petrous portion. The petrous left
internal carotid artery is normal in appearance. The M1 segments
of the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally appears somewhat
irregular to their bifurcations, but there is symmetric signal
intensity. Normal signal intensity is seen in the right internal
carotid artery, both vertebral, and the basilar arteries,
anterior cerebral, and posterior cerebral arteries. Evaluation
for aneurysm is not possible due to the motion artifact.

IMPRESSION:
Limited examination due to patient motion artifact.
1. Acute infarction of left middle cerebral artery territory as
described above. Given the multifocal, non-confluent areas of
restricted diffusion, this suggests an embolic event.
2. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
3. MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] irregularity and thickening of the
extracranial left internal carotid artery at the skull base.
There is signal intensity seen throughout the intracranial
arterial circulation suggesting no significant stenosis.

Carotid u/s: No evidence of carotid stenosis bilaterally.

Repeat HCT [**10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Unchanged
appearance of probable old infarcts in the frontal lobes, basal
ganglia, and pons as described.

HCT [**10-22**]: Increased hypodensity along the left frontal and
parietal regions, consistent with the evolving left MCA stroke.
New approximately 1.6 x 0.9 cm hyperdensity is seen within the
subcortical region of the left parietal lobe, consistent with
blood. This could represent petechial he
