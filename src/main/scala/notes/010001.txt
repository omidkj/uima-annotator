Service: MED

Allergies:
Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Flank pain and epistaxis with dropping Hct, SOB, worsening
edema.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis started [**2181-10-4**] with tunneled catheter placement in
right subclavian on [**2181-10-3**].


History of Present Illness:
83yo F with history of hypertension, chronic renal
insufficiency, and right renal cystic mass, initially treated at
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital (admitted [**9-1**], dicharged [**9-3**] and readmitted
on [**2181-9-4**]) for congestive heart failure, renal failure, and
left upper lobe pneumonia with the chief complaint of shortness
of breath, increasing pedal edema, and increasing fatigue. She
was treated for congestive heart and worsening renal failure
(baseline creatinine 2.0 in [**2179**]). At rehab, her hct dropped
37-->27 over 4-5 days. On [**2181-9-23**], she was noted to have had
dark stool and significant epistaxis. On [**2181-9-24**], she was found
to have a Hct of 16 which continued to drop despite multiple
blood transfusions. She also began to complain of right flank
pain. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a right-sided
retroperitoneal hematoma displacing the right renal artery
anteriorly. At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient received 10 units of packed
RBCs, 2 units of FFP, and 2 doses ddAVP. She was started on
dopamine IV drip .625 for renal insufficiency and was continued
on lasix IV 80 tid and zaroxylyn. At the outside hospital, she
was also being treated for a enterococcal pan-senstivie urinary
tract infection. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2181-9-29**] for the
management of acute renal failure and retroperitoneal bleed. She
was transferred from the MICU to the floor service on [**2181-9-30**].


Past Medical History:
HTN, hypothyroid, gout, CRI (baseline Cr 2.0), diastolic
dysfunction (EF 55% 7/04), 4 cm right renal mass (cystic RCC vs
multiloculated cyst, seen on CT on [**11-11**], followed),
hysterectomy, arthritis

ECG: Normal sinus rhythm
Possible anterior infarct - age undetermined
Leftward axis - ? inferior myocardial infarction
No previous tracing

ECHO: ([**10-2**]): Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There
are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly
thickened but not stenotic. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: small left ventricular cavity with severe concentric
left
ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction

CXR: ([**9-29**]) Rotated positioning. There are
moderate-to-moderately large bilateral layering pleural
effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. A right
IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax
is identified. There is no upper zone redistribution to suggest
CHF.

Abd CT: ([**10-3**]) 1. Large retroperitoneal hematomas as described.
2. Gallstones.
3. Multiple buttock calcifications secondary to prior
injections.
4. Anasarca/pleural effusions/ascites consistent with third
spacing.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 83 year old female with retroperitoneal bleed
likely secondary to right-sided renal mass, acute on chronic
renal failure with anasarca, now HD dependent.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

1. RETROPERITONEAL BLEED, likely [**3-12**] renal mass given proximity
to R hematoma.
- No further enlargement of retroperitoneal bleed during
admission. Hct remained stable, no furhter transfusions
required.
- Coagulopathy reversed with FFP and Vit K suggestiong
nutritional etiology.
- Mixing studies performed at [**Hospital1 2025**] showed reversal of
coagulopathy with the addition of factors, [**Last Name (un) 7162**] suggesting a
nutritional etiology.

2. VOLUME OVERLOAD - CVP 15, tense edema to abd, pleural
effusions on CXR
- Overload most likely [**3-12**] RF and not cardiogenic (no ischemia
on EKG, EF 55%-although does have known diastolic dysfunction)
- Pt was taken off od dopamine on arrival from OSH and d/c'd all
diuretics.
- Pt started on dialysis for fluid removal and ultrafiltration
on [**2181-10-4**]. Dialysis was successful and able to removel large
amounts of fluid without change in BP. Beta blockers held. Much
of the edema has resolved but not completely by the tiem of
discharege and pt will most likely need lifelong HD.

3. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
- CT, MRI and U/S performed with ruled out obstruction and IVC
thrombus. Renal mass could not be fully appreciated on imaging
and would require bx for diagnosis. Pt does not want surgery and
therefore refused bx.
- Sent [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, C3, C4 studied whcih were negative.
- Urine studies initially showed achanthocytes, but nephritis
later ruled out by follow-up analysis. 24 hr protien was 2.5,
not nephrotic syndrome.
- Final diagnosis is that pt had substantial chronic renal
failure woth creat of 2.0 and had a second insult that placed
her in acute renal failure.
- Pt followed by Reanl team throughout admission.

4. RENAL MASS - Appears cystic on imaging. Has not increased in
size since dx [**11-11**]. Supportive care only.

5. ENTEROCOCCUS UTI - Put on renally dosed amox 500 q24. D/c'd
after 2 weeks course. No further + cx's for enterococcus. Pt did
ahve yeast in urine and was treated for 3 days with Fluconazole.


6. RECENT PNA? - CXR with large bilateral pleural effusions.
Difficult to assess for PNA. Most likely not a pna. Probable
combination of colapsed lung within the pleural effusion and
atelectasis. Pt did not spike fever and did not have a cough.
O2sats improved with diuresis.

7: CV: Pt's Bp meds held initially while trying to take off
large amounts of fluid. Pt then became hypertensive and was
placed back
