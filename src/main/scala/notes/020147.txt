Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy
left cataract removal, endocyclophotocoagulation, vitrectomy,
membranectomy, and retinal endolaser


History of Present Illness:
47 year old male with poorly controlled type I diabetes, HTN,
sarcoidosis and substance abuse who presents with chest pain
associated with swallowing liquids, nausea and nonbloody emesis.
 He reports he was in his usual state of health until 2 days ago
when he began having nonradiating chest pain associated with
drinking fluids.  He has not eaten solid foods in 2 days
secondary to the pain.  He denies associated SOB or diaphoresis.
 He denies pain with activity.  He denies a h/o GERD but is on
protonix daily. In the emergency department, he was found to be
in DKA (glucose of 1199, AG of 25, 7.29/34/60).  Of note, pt had
3 prior admissions this month for DKA and intermittent chest
pain.  During a prior admission pt had normal cath ([**2143-11-28**]).
In the ER, his EKG showed TWI in the inferior and V5-V6 leads
and ST elevation in V2-V3, unchanged from prior.  His troponin
was elevated at 0.47 in the setting of an elevated Creat to 4.9
(baseline 2.5).  Vitals were significant for a BP of 204/79.
CXR was c/w CHF.  He received 4 liters of NS, 12 units of
Regular Insulin and then was started on an insulin gtt.  Given
initial concern for ACS he received ASA 325 mg, Lopressor 5 mg
IV x3, and was started on a heparin and nitro gtt. He was then
admitted to the medical ICU for further management.

ECG [**12-5**]:  NSR, rate 96, nl axis and intervals, S1Q3T3, normal
R wave progression, new TWI II,[**Month/Year (2) 1105**],AVF,V5,V6. Minimal ST
elevations in V2-V3 (unchanged from prior).

Radiology
CXR [**12-5**]: Interval development of bilateral small layering
pleural effusions, as well as increased perihilar haziness and
mild prominence of azygos vein, consistent with mild
failure/fluid overload. Stable hilar prominence, most consistent
with hilar lymphadenopathy.

[**12-11**] MRI/MRA brain:  MRI demonstrates mild findings consistent
with small vessel ischemic changes. No acute infarction. MR
angiogram with questionable irregularity of the left M1 segment
which may be artifactual, but may be due to a fenestration.
There is also irregularity of the proximal left anterior
cerebral artery near its origin, which also may be artifactual.

[**12-12**] V/Q scan: Matched defect in right lower lobe. Low
likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.

Pathology/cytology
[**12-12**] esophageal brushings: Negative for malignanct cells.
Reactive squamous cells, inflammatory cells and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.


[**12-12**] esophageal biopsy: Ulceration with granulation tissue.
Special stain (methenamine silver) is negative for fungi, with
satisfactory control.

[**12-12**] antral biopsy: Chronic inactive inflammation, with focal
intestinal metaplasia. [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain is negative for H. pylori,
with satisfactory control.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old male presents with chest pain, nausea/vomiting,
found to be in DKA.

1) DKA/Type I diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled: The patient
was initially maintained on an insulin drip in the MICU,
subsequently transitioned to lantus with a humalog insulin
sliding scale. The [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted, and his insulin
regimen was adjusted accordingly. It was difficult to engage Mr.
[**Known lastname 1683**] in his care, and he required significant urging in order
to participate in his diabetes management (fingersticks, insulin
administration). At time of discharge, he demonstrated ability
to check his fingersticks and was provided with a magnifying
device to attach to the insulin syringe in order to adequtely
draw up his insulin. He was discharged with VNA for
diabetes/medication teaching. If he is unable to comply with
this insulin regimen, transition to NPH/humalog mix twice a day
may be considered. He will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] following
discharge.

2) Chest pain/esophageal candidiasis: The patient's elevated
troponin on admission was attributed to poor renal clearance in
the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Myocardial
ischemia was concerned unlikely, particularly given recent
negative cardiac catheterization. He received relief from
maalox/viscous lidocaine, raising the suspicion that his chest
pain was gastrointestinal in etiology. He underwent an EGD
[**2143-12-12**], which showed esophageal candidiasis (although brushing
fungal stain was negative), gastritis (biopsy with areas of
Barrett's esophagus), and erosions at the duodenal bulb. His
pantoprazole was increased to twice a day dosing and he began a
14 day course of fluconazole. He should follow-up with the
gastroenterology service as an outpatient given evidence of
Barrett's esophagus.

3) Lethargy: Given the patient's initial lethargy, a work-up was
pursued, which included TSH, RPR, folate, and vitamin B12, all
of which were normal. The patient declined a HIV test A head MRI
was within normal limits, not consistent with neurosarcoid. A
head MR angiogram showed a possible irregularity of the left M1
segment and the left anterior cerebral artery near its origin,
both of which the neurology service felt were artifactual. The
patient's mental status improved, although he remained difficult
to engage in his medical care. Depression is a likely
contributor, however, he declined initiation of an
anti-depressant. This can be re-addressed by his PCP as an
outpatient.

4) Acute angle glaucoma: On ophthalmology consult was obtained,
who found hiw left eye pressure was 42 (normal <21) with 20/70
vision. He underwe
