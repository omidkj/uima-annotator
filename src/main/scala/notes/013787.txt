HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted initially to the CICU
service for anaphylaxis thought to be secondary to Keflex.
However, it was later stated that the patient had taken the
Keflex in an attempted overdose and suicide attempt.  In the
VICU she was extubated on the first day and received
epinephrine and continued steroids, H1 and H2 blockers and
had some difficulty talking.  There was no rash or pruritus.
She was started on a Prednisone taper.  She spiked early in
her admission.  This was thought to be secondary to
ventilator associated pneumonia at which point she was
started on Levaquin.  Her fever defervesced and she
clinically improved. On the 14th she again went into
respiratory distress.  She had trouble with throat "closing."
 Her gas at this time showed a PO2 of 60, therefore she was
transferred back to the CICU for closer observation, however,
it was felt that a large majority of this is due to a
psychologic component.  She was given intravenous Solu-Medrol
and intravenous Famotidine and clinically improved not
requiring intubation.  Psychiatry was following her
throughout her hospitalization.  She was section 12 and upon
discharge was to go to an inpatient facility.

She was seen by ENT who recommended humidified air and voice
rest as well as increasing her antireflux medications.  She
was switched to oral medications and maintained on a
Prednisone taper.  She is to complete a course of Levaquin.
She was started on Serevent for long acting agents for
bronchospasm and clinically improved at which point she was
determined medically stable for discharge and was evaluated
by the psychiatry team and transferred to an inpatient
facility.
