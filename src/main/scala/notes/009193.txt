Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endoscopy
2. Intubation, extubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 yo man with h/o Hep C cirrhosis who
presented from home with abdominal pain. The patient reportedly
is cared for at [**Hospital1 2177**]. In brief, the patient presented with
diffuse abdominal pain with N/V/D with coffee ground emesis. His
symptoms reportedly started after heroin and cocaine use.
.
In ED, his vitals were T 98.4, P 68, BP 148/66, R 20, O2 97% on
RA. He had a CXR, which showed no acute process and abominal
U/S, which showed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis and
moderate ascites. As he was complaining of coffee-ground emesis,
a NG lavage was attempted, but the patient was too agitated to
cooperate. He was given Morphine and Ativan and was started on
protonix and octreotide gtts. He was also given CTX IV,
ciprofloxacin and flagyl. He was also found to have an elevated
creatinine of 3.2. Given his acute GI bleed and agitation, he
was admitted to ET for further evaluation. He was also noted to
have an elevated lactate of 5.1, and a CT of his abdomen showed
evidence of colitis.
.
On the floor, the patient was somlenent with significant
asterixis. He was oriented to place but not time, and was unable
to provide a coherent history. He denied abdominal pain or
bleeding at the time of interview, which was not consistent with
what he had said prior in the emergency room. He denied recent
drug use initially, but later admitted to current use to the IV
nurse.
.
The day after admission, the patient dropped his hematocrit to
20.7 and was admitted to the ICU. He underwent EGD which found
that he had acute duodenitis likely related to ischemia
secondary to cocaine ingestion and intoxication.
.
The patient received 2U of blood and his hematocrit has been
stable in the ICU; however he has continued to be quite altered
after extubation on [**5-7**] in the ICU for which he has been
receiving lactulose. He was also started on vancomycin while in
the ICU for a positive blood culture and has been receiving
ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of SBP.

STUDIES:
CT abd&pelvis w/o contrast [**2155-5-5**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Shrunken nodular liver with a moderate amount of ascites is
consistent with cirrhosis. Areas of hypodensity within the liver
not all of which were seen on ultrasound earlier today. Given
the presence of cirrhosis, further evaluation with an outpatient
MRI or ultrasound could be performed. Today's ultrasound did not
focus on these abnormalities as they were discovered
subsequently on the present study.

2. Focal wall thickening of the duodenum at the junction of the
second and third portions is not fully evaluated due to the lack
of intravenous contrast, although underlying duodenitis cannot
be excluded.

3. Likely mild wall thickening throughout the ascending,
transverse, and the descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**], particularly affecting the
descending [**Last Name (LF) 499**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] in part relate to ascites and portal
colopathy, although underlying colitis is also of concern.

4. Non-obstructing punctate stone in the right kidney.
.
Chest x-ray [**2155-5-5**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
process.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2155-5-5**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal examination due to lack of patient cooperation and
patient motion during the study.
2. Nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis. Multiple small
subcentimeter hypoechoic structures with posterior acoustic
enhancement in the right lobe of the liver, most likely
representing cysts.
3. Main portal vein not well seen; no color flow is seen in the
main portal vein. However, bidirectional venous flow is seen in
the region of porta hepatis may be bidirectional flow within the
portal vein. Consider further evaluation with CT/MRV.
4. Moderate ascites.

CT HEAD W/O [**2155-5-9**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. No hemorrhage, edema, or evidence of acute process.
2. Right frontal lobe hypodensity is consistent with prior
infarction.

CXR [**2155-5-11**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2155-5-9**].

There is a new opacity within the right lower lobe which is
suggestive of
pneumonia given the patient's clinical
