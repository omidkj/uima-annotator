[**2107-9-21**] CT Chest/Abd/pelvis : 1. L1 vertebral body compression
fracture with an 8-mm retropulsion of indeterminate age,
although no surround hematoma or soft tissue swelling.
Retropulsion causes severe spinal canal narrowing at this level,
which increases risk of spinal cord injury. If clinical concern,
MRI is more sensitive in evaluation of spinal cord injury.
  2. Multiple bilateral rib fractures as above, with underlying
left chest
wall/mediastinal contusion/hematoma. Multiple old-healing
fractures, as
detailed above.
  3. Cholelithiasis.

[**2107-9-21**] C Spine CT :
1. No acute fracture or subluxation.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes including osteophytes with
mild spinal
canal narrowing at C3-C4, increasing risk of spinal cord injury.
If clinical concern for spinal cord or ligamentous injury, MRI
is more sensitive.

[**2107-9-21**] Head CT :
Fracture of nasal spine of the maxilla, age indeterminate.
Lucency in the anterior left maxilla, of indeterminate age.
Findings may be periapical and dental related, although while
felt less likely, traumatic injury is not excluded

[**2107-9-21**] Right hip and knee :
No evidence of acute fracture involving the right hip, right
femur, or right knee.

[**2107-9-22**] Carotid studies : On the right,likely carotid occlsuion
with recanalization. On the left, there has been progression in
the plaque, now with 70-79% carotid stenosis. Clinical
correlation MRA or CTA evaluation is warranted.

[**2107-9-22**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and
inferolateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2106-5-5**], a focal wall motion abnormality can be
seen on the current study. This may have been present on the
prior but image quality precluded certainty. Mild symmetric LVH
is seen on the current study.

[**2107-9-24**] CXR : Left lower lobe opacity has minimally increased;
this could be due to atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be totally
excluded but less likely. There are low lung volumes.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Atelectasis in the right base is
stable. There are no enlarging pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.

[**2107-9-24**] KUB :
  The ascending colon has a large amount of stool. The
transverse colon is
slightly distended measuring 8.5 cm in maximal diameter. There
are no air-
fluid levels. The visualized sigmoid colon is of normal caliber.
Haziness of the abdomen could be due to patient body habitus
and/or ascites. There are degenerative changes in the lumbar
spine.

[**2107-9-26**] Video swallow :
There is penetration and aspiration with thin consistency. There

is also penetration with nectar consistency, but no evidence of
aspiration.  For further details, please refer to full speech
and swallow division note in OMR.
  FINDINGS: Penetration with thin and nectar consistencies.
Aspiration with thin consistency.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78277**] was evaluated in the ER by the Trauma Service and
Ct scans of the C Spine, Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis were notable
for multiple rib fractures and an old L1 compression fracture.
He was admitted to the Trauma floor for pain control, pulmonary
toilet and a syncopal work up.  It was difficult to fully
explain the mechanism of his fall despite the help of the
Italian interpreter and on exam he seemed to have no vision in
the left eye.  Eventually his daughter explained that his visual
problems were old secondary to a detached retina.

He had carotid studies which showed a string sign on the right
and 70-79% occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.  The
vascular surgery service was consulted and recommended an MRA of
the neck however this was not obtained as the family felt that
surgery was not an option due to his age and comorbidities.

His pain was partially controlled with a PCA but language
barrier limited more instruction therefore he was changed to
Tylenol around the clock and prn oxycodone.
Unfortunately despite resuming his pre admission inhalers and
pulmonary toilet he desaturated to the mid 80's on 2 liters and
was tachypneic prompting transfer to the ICU. A chest Xray
revealed a left lower lobe density and he was placed on IV
Vancomycin and Zosyn.  After a 48 hour stay in the ICU for
pulmonary toilet he was transferred back to the Trauma floor and
 was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service. Due to his age
and deconditioned state as well as his pulmonary compromise he
was transferred to rehab to further help increase his mobility
and contine pulmonary toilet.

He remained afebrile with  a normal WBC and was changed to oral
Cipro in [**2107-9-27**] which will continue thru [**2107-10-1**].  His
cultures were negative but the antibiotic was for Xray findings.
 His main complaint of left sided rib pain was controlled with
Tylenol and prn Oxycodone.
