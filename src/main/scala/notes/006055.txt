Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o GERD and hiatal hernia, here with
upper GIB, hemodynamically stable, also with chest pain

# GIB: Evidence on slow ongoing bleed with falling HCT.
Received 1 additional unit for HCT of 27 with appropriate bump
after to 31 after unit. EGD was performed and EGD showed large
hiatal hernia and severe esophagitis with adherent clot and
oozing blood.  showed High risk for rebleed as ulcerations were
not cauterized.

Per GI, patient will not benefit from re-scoping/further
intervention given her age and co-morbidities. (HCT was stable
at around 30 for 3 days. Patient had 1-2 episodes of dark stools
but GI did not feel the benefit of performing an EGD).
Recommended 40 mg Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and Hematocrit check in 2 days

patient would have to come back to ED.
