Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-6-7**] Thoracentesis
[**2160-6-9**] Intubation
[**2160-6-9**] Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
58 year old female with advanced cholangiocarcinoma, Hepatitis
B/C/EtOH cirrhosis, and chronic alcohol abuse who presents from
clinic with shortness of breath after a routine CT showed new
right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary infiltrates.
She was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in [**11/2159**] and has
been evaluated by surgery but not deemed a surgical candidate.
The attempt at giving chemotherapy has been difficult due to
ongoing substance abuse and poor medical compliance.

She was admitted [**Date range (1) 35539**] for pain control due to abdominal
pain. She was on the medicine service and restarted on her home
medications with improvement in her pain. She also completed a
course of Keflex for cellulitis.
She reports the onset of dyspnea on exertion 2 days ago that has
progressively worsened. Also reports fever to 100.0 yetserday,
as well as chills. Has had cough x 1 week. Also reports nausea
without vomiting, and poor appetite. Has chronic abdominal pain,
but feels it is worse in the last few days. Has baseline
peripheral edema, but also feels this is worse in the last week.
Has had regular BM, no blood in stool. Also describes chest
soreness with palpation and with coughing on the right side over
the last week.
She was seen in clinic today and complained of shortness of
breath. She had a routine staging CT this AM which showed
pulmonary infiltrate and pleural effusion and is therefore being
directly admitted from clinic.

Past Medical History:
Cholangiocarcinoma
- Ms. [**Known lastname 4587**] admitted on [**2159-11-19**] to [**2159-11-23**] when she presented
to the emergency room with abdominal pain. While in the
hospital, she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which showed
increase in size of the common bile duct, suspicious for an
obstructive process.
- ERCP was performed on [**2159-11-20**] with brushings of the common
bile duct which were positive for malignant cells consistent
with adenocarcinoma. She underwent abdominal MRI on [**2159-11-22**],
which showed a segment VIII hepatic lesion which was compatible
with cholangiocarcinoma. The lesion is approximately 2.0 x 1.5
cm in size.
- She was evaluated for surgical resection and was deemed a
surgical candidate if she could remain abstinent from alcohol
consumption given the high risk of complications with liver
resection in patients who are actively abusing alcohol. She has
been unable to remain sober for any significant duration since
that evaluation, and continues to abuse EtOH chronically.
- She recieved her first cycle of gemcitabine and cisplatin
