Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and wheezing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Replacement of Y stent into cervical trachea performed by
Interventional Pulmonary
-flexible laryngoscopy

History of Present Illness:
63 year old woman with h/o stage I lung cancer, GERD, HTN,
thromboembolic disease, ex-smoker, admitted for worsening
dyspnea in background of traceobronchomalacia.

The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] recently after placement
of endobronchial Y stent on [**2157-6-13**].  She was discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] to rehab and eventually admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**7-4**]
with worsening dyspnea and possible mucus plugging of stent. The
patient was subsequently sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
since this is where she had the stent placed.
.
Currently, the patient feels well, though she admits that she
has not had a nebulizer in several hours and is starting to feel
somewhat short of breath.  She also notes an occasional cough.
Otherwise, the patient feels well, with no CP, abdominal pain,
change in bowel habits, fevers, chills or sweats.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea/Hypoxia/wheeze ??????
The patient is a 63 year old woman with h/o stage I lung cancer,
GERD, HTN, thromboembolic disease, ex-smoker, admitted for
worsening dyspnea in background of traceobronchomalacia. The
patient was transferred to the MICU on [**7-6**] for acute respiratory
distress requiring BiPap. The patient presented with paroxysms
of dyspnea associated with audible stridorous respiration during
which she was in acute distress, but maintained normal oxygen
saturations. She reported subjective relief with use of bipap,
which was hypothesized to provide some component of upper airway
stenting.  Evaluation by interventional pulmonology revealed
concern for significant cervicomalacia. The patient underwent
removal of Y-stent and placement of a new longer stent reaching
up into cervical trachea. However, the patient remained
symptomatic with paroxysms of acute wheezing/stridor despite
stenting of cervical trachea, making her a poor candidate for
surgical intervention as the cause of these paroxysms are less
likely to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia in the
absence of improvement with stent placement. In addition, she
had an episode of significant respiratory distress requiring
bedside bronchoscopy, revealing significant mucous plugging
along the length of the stent and at carina. She was started on
mucomyst therapy, continued albuterol, ipratropium, mucinex,
hypertonic saline nebulizer treatments, and BiPAP, and was able
subsequently to tolerate the stent with no subsequent episodes
concerning for mucous plugging.  ENT was consulted for
evaluation of potential vocal cord dysfunction as etiology of
symptoms, and found no evidence to support this diagnosis. They
did, however, note a Left true / false vocal fold mass, likely
granulation but given h/o smoking could not rule out neoplastic
process. Thus, she should follow up with ENT for future biopsy.
The patient will be discharged to pulmonary rehab for two week
trial with the new Y stent. She will follow up with
Interventional pulmonology within two weeks of discharge.
.
#Vocal cord dysfunction - The patient was evaluated by ENT for
potential vocal cord dysfunction.  Flexible laryngoscopy
demonstrated a left true/false vocal fold mass.  Given the
patient's smoking history, this mass was thought to be
attributed to be either granulation or a neoplastic process.
The patient was recommended to follow-up with ENT following
discharge for observation of this mass.

# Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBCs was most likely [**3-3**]
steroid use.  Her white count at admission was 17.5 and
downtrended to 11.3 at the time if discharge. The patient was
otherwise stable with no signs of infection during this
hospitalization.
.
# Hyperglycemia - The patient has diabetes, managed with
glyburide at home, and was maintained on an insulin sliding
scale during this hospitalization.
.
# GERD - The patient was continued on her home omeprazole,
simethicone, and TUMS. Her regimen was enhanced with [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
addition of H2 blocker given risk of increased reflux with
tracheal stent.
.
# Hypertension - The patient's blood pressures were maintained
with metoprolol.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home
simvastatin.
.
# Depression - The patient was treated with her home citalopram.
