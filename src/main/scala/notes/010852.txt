[**2169-7-10**] Head CT : 1. Thin acute left subdural hematoma and
possible small focus of left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage, as
above.
2. Extensive left sided skull and skull base fractures,
including left
temporal bone fracture with extension through the petrous apex
adjacent to the expected course of the internal carotid artery.
Further evaluation with CTA is recommended to exclude vascular
injury. Right maxillary sinus fracture.

[**2169-7-10**] CT Torso : 1. Extensive pelvic fractures including a
wide diastasis of the symphysis pubis and a longitudinal
fracture traversing the sacrum, coccyx and L5 vertebral bodies.
The sacral fracture abuts the central canal raising concern for
possible nerve root/cord injury. Bladder injury can not be
excluded on this study. Recommend delayed views through the
bladder to further assess with more contrast excreted, may
demonstrate evidence of a bladder rupture, although if none
seen, can not be excluded. No Foley catheter in place for CT
cystogram currently. Retrograde urethrogram can also be
considered.
2. Extensive hematoma involving the perineum and base of the
urethra as well as a foci of pelvic hyperdensity, raising
concern for vascular injury.
3. Numerous left rib fractures as detailed above.

[**2169-7-10**] Left elbow :
Note is made of fragmentation at the olecranon
process, which may be chronic or alternatively reflect acute
injury.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of additional fracture or
dislocation. There are no radiopaque foreign bodies or soft
tissue calcifications.

[**2169-7-10**] CTA Neck : 1. Mild narrowing of the petrous segment of
the left internal carotid artery compared to the right, may
relate to vasospasm/some material within the carotid canal.
There is decreased enhancement of the left cavernous sinus, in
addition. Further evaluation with head and neck MR, with axial
fat sat sequences to exclude intramural hematoma/dissection can
be considered for better assessment. No flow limitation noted
distally.
2. Diffuse narrowed caliber of the left vertebral artery, likely
due to
hypoplasia. However, evaluation at the level of C2 and C3 is
limited due to prominent adjacent venous plexus.
3. Fluid in the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells on
the left side as described above. Please see the prior CT study,
for details regarding the osseous and the soft tissue injuries.

[**2169-7-10**] CT Pelvis :
1. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture.
2. Increased dense material in the right medial thigh as well as
anterior
subcutaneous tissues and rectus abdominal musculature, new from
the previous study and reflecting interval bleeding since the
preceding scan.

[**2169-7-11**] CT Cystogram:
1. Extraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder, with contrast

extravasating into the extraperitoneal pelvic cavity and
extending to the
right inguinal canal layering into the scrotum and along soft
tissue of the anterior lower abdominal wall and right thigh. Fat
stranding and hyperdense material along the right thigh and
anterior subcutaneous tissues could be a combination of
hematoma, urine and contrast.
2. Interval increase in size of the scrotum, with hyperdense
fluid filling
the scrotal sac, with increase amount compared to prior, likely
mixed urine and contrast; however, cannot exclude hematoscrotum.

3. Severe pelvic fracture including wide diastasis of symphysis
pubis and
longitudinal fracture traversing L5 vertebral body and entire
sacrum with
distraction of fracture fragments at the sacrum of 1.3cm.

[**2169-7-15**] MR L spine :
1. Anterior epidural hematoma, from L4-5 intervertebral disc
level to S2,
with displacement and deformity of the thecal sac along with
crowding of the roots of the cauda equina and moderate-canal
stenosis as described above.
2. Edema/contusion of the L5 vertebral body, spinous process as
well as the L4-5 intervertebral disc space.
3. Degenerative changes at L4-5 level resulting in bilateral
moderate neural foraminal narrowing and mild impingement on the
L5 nerves on both sides.  Other details as above. Evaluation at
the level of the lower L5 and the sacrum is limited due to
artifacts, from the hardware

[**2169-7-22**] Liver US :
1. No source for elevated bilirubin identified with no intra- or

extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Distended gallbladder without secondary signs of
cholecystitis.
3. Moderate right pleural effusion with associated right lung
atelectasis.

[**2169-7-29**] EEG : This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the
presence of
sharply contoured th
