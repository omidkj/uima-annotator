Chief Complaint:
Bilateral foot pain and hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2491**] is an 80 year old man with DJD, ? gout, kidney
disease, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (?amio toxicity),
dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% s/p ICD placement
presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks. The
patient believes his symptoms began suddenly, and progressed
over a 2 week time. He noted increasing pain, swelling in his
ankle and 1st MTP joints bilaterally. Today, he got up out of
bed felt light headed and nearly fell but quickly sat down
without trma. He also noticed slightly worsening dyspnea on
exertion and generalized weakness. He denied recent foot/leg
trauma, fevers, chills, sweats, rash, other joint pains, recent
travel, tick or insect exposure, sick contacts. Of note, he was
recently admitted to an OSH for "dehydration" after steroid dose
reduction. He was recently seen in pulmonology clinic on [**2189-8-5**]
and had his steroids reduced from 10mg daily to 5mg daily in the
setting of higher doses before this. After his fall, he decided
to come to the ED after talking with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.2 97/65 76 24 98%RA. He denied
SOB but looked dyspneic and upon further questioning admitted to
dyspnea. He was noted to have increased pain and swelling of his
ankles and MCP joints bilaterally and was given cefazolin 1gm IV
ONCE for suspected septic arthritis. He was given 1 5/325 tab of
percocet for his pain. He was subsequently noted to be
hypotensive to 82/43. He was given 1L of NS wide open.
Subsequently his saturation dropped to 94% on RA and he was
placed on 2LNC. For the low blood pressure he was broadened to
vancomycin 1gm IV ONCE. His pressures rose to 92/50 with his
last vitals 99.3 61 18 99%2L.
.
On the floor, he remained asymptomatic but continued to be
transiently hypotensive occasionally to the 80s, and at one
point down to the 60s, and fortunately responded to a 250cc
bolus of NS. He was given dexamethasone 4mg IV ONCE for presumed
adrenal crisis. Ortho was consulted who recommended rheumatology
consultation. Podiatry was consulted who offered to tap the
joint, which a small amount of serosanguinous fluid was sent to
the lab. The patient was subsequently started on
vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin.

Past Medical History:
1) ILD/NSIP ? in setting of prior amiodarone use
-[**2189-8-5**] outpatient PFTs: FVC of 2.86 liters, which is 73%
predicted, an FEV1 of 1.96 liters to 79% predicted with an
FEV1/FVC ratio of 68, which is 108% predicted. Compared to his
last testing two and a half weeks ago there is a marked decline
in both his forced vital capacity (about 400 mL) and a drop in
his FEV1 by about 400 mL as well

2) Idiopathic DCM, chronic LBBB, sp ICD implantation for primary


3) Hypothyroidism

4) Bilateral TKR

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old man with DJD, ? gout, kidney disease, chronic
pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of
20-25% and ICD placement for primary prevention and chronic
pneumonitis presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3
weeks with hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **], leukocytosis, worsening intestitial
infiltrates.
.
#) Hypotension: Given low grade fever, leukocytosis, left shift,
persistent pressures, chief concern was initially sepsis;
however sx resolved rapidly after only 1 day on abx so infection
was less likely. Cardiogenic shock due to CHF exacerbation/MI
was also considered but EKG and physical exam ___and echo?___
made this less likely. CXR showing increased interstitial
infiltrate density in setting of steroid-induced
immunosuppression made atypical PNA a concern, and numerous
studies for legionalla,PCP,[**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**],beta galactoman,glucan were
all negative.
Given increasing density of interstitial infiltrates on CXR and
dyspnea, would be concerned about a an atypical pulmonary
infection, although patient arrived with normal rest
saturations. Ultimately, because pt presented with hyponatremia,
hyperkalemia and recent steroid dose reduction, and because sx
resolved rapidly after IV dexamethasone, it was concluded that
adrenal crisis was most likely etiology of hypotension. On Day
#2 he was transferred from MICU to floors where he received
prednisone PO and remained afebrile with stable VS. Cortisol
stim test and random cortisol both were elevated but this is
because pt was being treated with steroids during test.
.
#) Arthritis: Given podagra in left MTP in setting of elevated
serum uric acid, acout gout was diagnosed. There was also
concern for septic arthritis given fever, white count etc so pt
was initially started on broad spectrum abx but synovial fluid
cx were negative. Sample was too sm
