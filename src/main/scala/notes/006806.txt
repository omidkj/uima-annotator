Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 year old male with history of DM, recent neck
surgery, history of heroin abuse; now admit after found altered
and cyanotic in car likely due to heroin overdose.

# Overdose (OD): Admits to heroin, vicodin, and valium use
without other abuses. No EtOH, sedatives, OTC meds, other
illicits. This is supported by toxicology screen. Some concern
initially of APAP OD if possible Vicodin use, however this was
negative on tox and not supported by history. Mental status
significantly improved on Narcan gtt which was weaned and
discontinued on the morning of [**2106-2-24**]. Patient was seen by
social work and was given the contact information for substance
abuse rehabilitation programs.

# Hyperglycemia. History of DM with poor medicine compliance.
The hyperglycemia was likely related to stress response from
hypoxia/respiratory acidosis plus poor baseline control. No
evidence of ketones, metabolic acidosis. He was managed with
insulin sliding scale, with Metformin held on admission.

# Leukocytosis. Also likely stress response from acute hypoxia
and acidosis. Other possibilities include infection (aspiration
pneumonia or CAP but CXR negative; UA clean; no evidence of
surgical site infection; denies h/o IVDU), alcoholic hepatitis.
This improved dramatically the morning following admission.  His
vlood cultures turned positive for peptostreptococcus and we
felt this was likley due to tooth surgery.  HIs cultures cleared
on antibiotics.

# Respiratory acidosis/hypercarbic respiratory failure. Likely
overmedication effect from heroin. Improved on Narcan gtt.

# Tachycardia. Sinus with normal ECG otherwise, and improved
with minimal IV fluids. This was likely related to above
episode.

# Wheezes. History of asthma; poor air entry and mild wheezing
on exam. He was started on flovent MDI (patient unsure of name
of inhaled steroid) and albuterol nebulizers.

# Heroin abuse. The patient denied any suicidal ideation and
expressed clearly that this was an accidental overdose. He
stated that he was amenable to a discussion with social
work/addiction specialists.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with heroin overdose. You were treated with a
medication, narcan, in the intensive care unit to counteract the
effects of the overdose.
.
You were found to have bacteria growing in your bloodstream and
you were treated with intravenous antibiotics. An MRI of your
neck was done to look for a source of infection. A small amount
of fluid was seen around the C-7 neck bone, the site of your
surgery and this was sampled. This fluid did not show signs of
infection. A syphillis t
