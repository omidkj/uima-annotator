Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2137-8-6**] to the SICU hypotensive and
having fevers.  It was felt that this was due to line sepsis.
Brief Hospital Course by system:
1. Neuro: She was at her baseline on the day of admission but
was sedated and intubated on HD for most of this admission.
Psych was called to assist with medication management of her
anti-psycotics. Remeron, Ropinirole and clonazepam were stopped
given excessive sedation. Fluphenazine continued. Mental status
improved as infections cleared.

2. Respiratory: On HD 1 she developed acute respiratory distress
and she became stridous. This was after she recieved 2 liter
boluses for hypotension. She was intubated. She continued to
spike temperatures and  sputum was sent and grew pseudomonas and
morganella on [**8-7**]. IV cefepime and amakacin were given for 10
days. Due to laryngeal swelling from IV fluids she developed
laryngeal edema and given h/o tracheomalacia, a trache was
performed on [**8-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17109**]. She was extubated and
recovered well post trache. The trache was down sized to a # 7
cuffless, fenestrated trache. This was well tolerated. A passy
muir valve was applied and well tolerated.

3. Cardiovascular: HD 1 she was hypotensive due to sepsis from
her line which grew MRSA. IV vancomycin was started. She
initially responded to boluses of fluid, but  then started
phenylephrine when she was intubated. She initially received
CVVHD then was converted to HD. Pressors were stopped and she
maintained a SBP of 100/63.

4. Renal: Hemodialysis was initially performed through a
transhepatic hemodialysis catheter which was felt to be
infected. HD 3 she had the line removed and replaced with a new
hemodialysis line.  Once the hemodialysis line was replaced she
was started on CVVHD to remove fluid.  After she was weaned from
her sedation and she was on trach mask, her blood pressure
improved and she was started on her normal hemodialysis regimen
of Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday which she has tolerated. Midodrine
was used post HD.

5. ID-MRSA was cultured from the hemodialysis line and blood
from [**8-6**] & [**8-8**]. She was kept on Vancomycin and with a prolonged
course of 6 plus weeks were recommended with weekly trough vanco
levels. Trough goals are 15-20. She will follow up with ID and
at that time a stop date will be determined.
She continued to spike fevers and a previously placed central
line was removed and grew . Sputum was grew pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Cefepime was started and ID recommended a 7 day
course. Last dose should be given on [**9-3**] and then the central
line in her neck should be removed.

6. Heme-INR was initally 4.2. Coumadin was held. (for
prophylaxis to prevent transhepatic hemodialysis line from
clotting). Of note, she experienced some emesis on [**8-18**] and was
lavaged. Hematocrits had trended down to 20.7 on [**8-22**] from 28.9
on [**8-15**]. She was transfused with several units of PRBC. Epogen
was given during HD. GI was consulted and recommended IV
protonix which was given as a drip in the SICU. This was
switched to po protonix when she was tolerating a soft diet.

7. GI-GI did not feel that an EGD was necessary. Protonix was
recommended. Bloody emesis resolved. Hematocrits stabilized. She
was cleared by speech and swallow for a soft diet.

She remained afebrile prior to discharge with stable vital
signs. She was able to get out of bed with assist to sit in the
chair. The trache and transhepatic catheter site remained c/d/i.
PT evaluated and recommended rehab. She will be transferred to
[**Hospital **] Rehab.
