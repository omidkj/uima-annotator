History of Present Illness:
78 F with ESRD, CAD, h/o CVA, COPD admitted from NH to [**Hospital 7912**] with epistaxis in the setting of ASA, Plavix,

Micro:
Blood Cx [**2-15**]: No growth to date (not finalized)
.
Imaging/Studies:
CXR [**2119-2-14**]: Mild cardiomegaly may be smaller. No pulmonary
edema, pulmonary vascular engorgement. A flame-shaped opacity
projecting over the right first rib anteriorly is probably
calcification, better appreciated on the [**2117-3-26**]
radiograph. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural
effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.
Vascular stent and clips project over the left axilla.
.
TTE [**2119-2-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No aortic valve mass seen. If indicated, a TEE would
be better to assess aortic valve structure.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F with PAF on coumadin, dementia, ESRD on HD, CAD who
presents with posterior nasal bleed.  Pt was initially admitted
to OSH last Friday for epistaxis in the setting of elevated INR
3.2 and taking ASA, Plavix and coumadin. She received 3 units
PRBC and 4 units FFP. She was stable until rebleeding on [**2-14**] at
dialysis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# Epistaxis: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for epistaxis
requiring multiple transfusions.  She was initially admitted to
the MICU, where ENT placed balloon in left nostril for posterior
bleed. Her hematocrit remained stable while in MICU and she did
not require further transfusion.  She remained hemodynamically
stable and the nasal balloon was removed from her left nostril
on [**2-19**] without complication.  Per ENT, if the patient has any
additional epistaxis, use afrin in each nostril, lean head
forward, pinch nostrils closed for 20 minutes.  Patient should
return to the hospital for any bleeding that does not resolve
with these measures.  Coumadin should continue to be held for
two weeks, and restarted thereafter.  ASA should be held for an
additionally week, and restarted at 81 mg daily thereafter.
Plavix should be discontinued permanently.
.
# ESRD: Pt on TTS schedule, last HD [**2-18**].  Next dialysis planned
for Tuesday, [**2119-2-21**].  She should continue nephrocaps and
sevelamer.  She will also continue to receive epogen with
dialysis.  Additionally, patient should continue to receive
fluconazole with dialysis for a total four week course.
.
# HTN: Antihypertensive medications were additionally, held and
gradually restarted for goal systolic BP of 110.  She should
continue home anti-hypertensive regimen with amlodipine,
metoprolol, hydralazine and Imdur at discharge.
.
# Dementia/ Hx of embolic CVA: Coumadin and antiplatelet agents
were held during this admission, given significant nasal bleed.
The patient should resume anticoagulation with coumadin 2 weeks
after discharge, and should restart ASA 81 mg 1 week after
discharge.
.
# CAD: S/p PCI with stent placement [**1-14**]. All antiplatelet
agents were held on this admission. She was continued on statin
and antihypertensive regimen.  Given that last PCI was greater
than one year ago, the patient may discontinue plavix completely
at discharge.  She should restart ASA 81 mg one week after
discharge for coronary artery protection.
.
# Hx COPD: Continued on inhalers prn.
.
# Hx childhood seizures: The patient was continued on home dose
keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
.

for elective intubation for procedure or airway protection)
