History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] presents with her daughter with 3 month
history
of worsening nausea, weight loss and decreased appetite. She was
initially evaluated and admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital [**Date range (1) 39208**]
after she fell on her back after slipping on a wet surface. On
arrival, she was also found to have nausea and abdominal pain at
which time a pelvic mass was discovered on exam. She underwent
CT
evaluation and received IVF and pain meds. Her abdominal and
back
pain improved with vicodin and darvocet. Following her discharge
on [**9-13**], she was informed by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] that this was
likely an ovarian malignancy but that she should undergo
colonoscopic evaluation. She started the prep with Golytely but
felt so awful during this, that she declined to actually undergo
colonoscopy.
.
Patient came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Continues to experience
abdominal pain, confirmed to have a large pelvic mass, 16cm, and
small lesions in liver (cannot characterize) and uncinate
process. Pathology consistent with either GYN primary (ovarian)
vs Renal.
.
Per Med consult, she has a history of angina (but has not had to
use NTG for the past few months). She is able to do all ADLs and
walk around a mall without CP or SOB. Denied any recent RVR
episodes or CHF hospitalizations (maintained on 40mg [**Hospital1 **] of
lasix). Previous cardiac catheterization >2 yrs ago, but no
interventions were done.
No Hx of MI. No DM.
.
Per family, prior to admission had lost some weight w/ decreased
energy. Also, no bowel movement in 10 days. Otherwise ROS neg.


Past Medical History:
CHF (EF 55% on echo several years ago)
Mitral regurgitation
Afib on pacemaker
osteoporosis
hypothyroid

PSH: TAH-BSO (40 years ago for unclear reasons and daughters
were
not entirely sure whether both ovaries were removed at the
time),
pacemaker placement in [**2112**]

PATHOLOGY: Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date
Diagnosed by
[**2115-10-2**] [**2115-10-2**] [**2115-10-10**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/lo??????
Previous biopsies:    [**-6/3848**]  ABDOMEN BX.

DIAGNOSIS:
Pelvic mass resection:
I.  Pelvic mass (A-E):
Epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (see note).
II.  Lymph node, left external iliac (F-H):
No malignancy identified (0/2) nodes.
III.  Segment of bladder dome (I and Z):
Malignant mesothelioma involving bladder wall and undermining
the mucosa.
The tumor does not appear to arise from bladder mucosa and no
in-situ carcinoma is seen.
IV.  Peritoneal tumor (J):
Malignant mesothelioma in adipose tissue.
V.  Bladder, vagina, and pelvic mass (K-R, X-Y):
Malignant mesothelioma extending into vagina and bladder walls.
 The tumor does not appear to arise from the vaginal or bladder
mucosa and no precursor lesion is seen.
VI.  Segment of small bowel (S-T):
Malignant mesothelioma involving serosa of small intestine of
bowel.
The tumor does not arise from the bowel mucosa and no precursor
lesion is seen.
VII.  Omentum (U-W):
Malignant mesothelioma.

[**10-11**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema. Patient S/P surgery.
Comparison is made with prior studies including most recent one
dated [**2115-10-10**].
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Right transvenous
pacemaker leads terminate in standard position in the right
atrium and right ventricle. There is no CHF. There is minimal
vascular engorgement which is stable. Blunting of the left
lateral costophrenic angle with adjacent lung opacity is
unchanged, due to small pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.

[**10-10**]: LENIs
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed
bilaterally. Normal compressibility, flow, waveform, and
augmentation is demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**10-8**] LENIs
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins were performed. Normal compressibility,
augmentation, flow, and waveforms were demonstrated. There is no
evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
.
CT [**2115-10-9**]
IMPRESSION:

1. New small bilateral pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis (left greater than right).
2. Small amount of ascites which has slightly increased in size
since the prior study.
3. Pelvic loculated fluid collection that may represent an
organizing postoperative fluid collection/ hematoma.
Alternatively, less likely, this may reflect residual
tumor.There is a 3.7 x 4.2 cm cystic collection in the left
aspect of the pelvis (series 2, image 6 and 7). This collection
has a faint peripheral hyperdense rim that may reflect an
organizing postoperative fluid/hematoma. Although no frank
pocket of gas are seen within the fluid collection, a
superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Alternatively, this
may be related to residual tumor.
4. No evidence of colitis, free air, pneumatosis or bowel
obstruction.

CT Scan Pelvis [**2115-9-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large heterogeneous, lobulated pelvic mass seen, most likely
of gynecological origin. Patient recalls history of TAH/BSO,
however, prior records not available at time of dictation. Less
likely considerations include lymphoma (although very unlikely
given no lymphadenopathy identified elsewhere), or bladder
origin.
2. Marked extrinsic compression of sigmoid colon, without
evidence of obstruction.
3. Right sided hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter.
4. Small hypoattenuating lesions seen within the liver.
Metastases cannot be excluded.
6. Compression fracture of L1, of [**Last Name (un) 5487**] chronicity.
7. Poorly defined low attenuation lesion in uncinate process of
pancreas, incompletely evaluated on this study. Primary versus
secondary neoplasm suspected.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Pelvic Mass:  On [**2115-9-19**] the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 61**] to be evaluated by surgical and gynecological services.
Abdominal CT scan showed - 15.9 x 14.2 x 15.9 cm mass ,
incompletely encasing sigmoid colon. Small amount of oral
contrast seen passing through sigmoid colon.
