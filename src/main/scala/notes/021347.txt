Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for IVC filter placement and management of
hemorrhagic cyst

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 41 year old woman with a PMHx significant for
DM2, SLE, antiphospholipid AB, and prior PEs; who was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 **] [**2165-2-9**] with a saddle PE and a recommendation
for lifelong anticoagulation. After discharge, she had more
arthralgias, so her prednisone dose was increased to 20 mg po
bid. She went to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital with LLQ pain and was
found to have a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. She was seen by GYN
there and they advised conservative management. Her hemoglobin
trended down from 9's to 8's. Her SBP, which is normally in
100s, drifted down to the 90s. Her last bp 98/56. She is not
tachycardic and patient not symptomatic. On [**2165-2-26**], she
developed right lower quadrant pain. An U/S showed a NEW right
ovarian cyst, but also enlargement of her left ovarian cyst from
3.7 to 4.8 cm and development of large adjacent hematoma 13x11x7
cm. Her last warfarin dose of 6mg was given last night. Her AM
hct was 25.5, AM INR 2.5, serum creatinine 0.8 and BUN 18. She
was transferred here for further management of her hemorrhagic
cysts and
hematoma, which developed while on anticoagulation for recently
diagnosed saddle
PE.

She reports having two LE u/s, which were negative for DVT at
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5678**] (last was 2 days ago).

Upon review of OMR, on her last admission here on [**2165-2-9**], her
urine grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae for which she was
sent out with a prescription of macrobid for 2 more days at
discharge.

[**2165-2-22**]: Pelvic U/S:
Findings: A 13 x 11 x 7 cm hematoma of mixed echogenicity has
appeared in the left addnexal region immediately adjacent to the
left ovary which contains an enlarging hemorrhagic cyst
measuring up to 4.8 cm. The transvaginal view demonstgrate a 2.5
cm complex right ovarian cyst, likely containing hemorrhagic
material, not demonstrable on current and past transabdominal
views. There is intact color and spectral Doppler flow within
each ovary.
The uterus is unremarkable with a length of 7.7 cm and an
endometrial stripe thickness of 4.3 mm.
Impression:
1. New 13 cm organizing hematoma in the left adnexal region
immediately adjacent to an enlarging 4.8 cm hemorrhagic left
ovarian cyst.
2. 2.5 cm complex right ovarian cyst, likely containing
hemorrhagic material.
3. Unremarkable uterus.

[**2165-2-28**]: Pelvic U/S:
IMPRESSION: Large pelvic mass posterior to uterus extending
towards the left greater than the right. This is felt to
represent hematoma/clot rather than an ovarian lesion. The
ovaries not seen. If clinically warranted, cross-sectional
imaging may be considered to evaluate extent of blood in the
abdomen/pelvis and possible acute
