History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old woman was recently discharged to rehab
after an admission for her newly diagnosed Pemphigus Foliaceus.
She was started on prednisone on that admission and was
scheduled to follow up with dermatology clinic today.  At
clinic, she was found to have worsening skin lesions and
functional status.  Prior to discharge, she was able to ambulate
down the hallway, but currently is bedbound. She reports that
her lesions worsened over the weekend and began having
difficulty walking.  She denies any fevers, chills, night
sweats, headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea,
constipations.  She reports pain on her abdomen, back, neck,
legs.  She rates her pain as a [**10-7**] in these areas.

In dermatology clinic, she was evaluated and was sent directly
to the floor for further management.

CXR [**2164-5-5**]: There is cardiomegaly and minimal upper zone
redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is some patchy increased
retrocardiac density, which is probably unchanged compared with
[**2164-5-3**]. The right subclavian line has been removed in the
interim. No pneumothorax is detected. No gross effusions are
seen. The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
film.

[**2164-5-18**]**

   CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2164-5-18**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      119 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


   CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2164-5-18**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may
reactivate
      when immunity is compromised.
      If current infection is suspected, submit follow-up serum
in [**2-1**]
      weeks interference with CMV IgM results.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2153**] mg/dl
may cause
      interference with CMV IgM results.

SKIN BX PATHOLOGY [**2164-5-4**]:
Comment/interpretation: While the biopsies for H&E staining are
dominated by herpes virus changes, the presence of
interkeratinocytic IgG suggests background pemphigus foliaceus
(complicated by herpes simplex virus infection).

SKIN BX PATHOLOGY [**2164-5-14**]: DIAGNOSIS:



Skin, right anterior pannus, biopsy:

- Superficial perivascular lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with
vasculopathy, fibrin microthrombi, and viral cytopathic effects
of endothelial cells consistent with infection with
cytomegalovirus (CMV), see note.

- Focal subcorneal mild acantholysis, see note.

Note: The sections show some residual and focal split of the
keratinocytes at the uppermost epidermal layers, consistent with
resolving pemphigus foliaceus. The upper papillary dermis,
however, shows a predominantly perivascular plasmacytic
infiltrate, damaged capillaries with fibrin microthrombi, and a
few large endothelial cells with marked cytopathic effects
consistent with CMV infection.  No viral cytopathic effects of
HSV seen on H&E or immunostains for HSV-1 and 2, and immunostain
for CMV is non-contributory. Findings are consistent with CMV
infection in the setting of resolving pemphigus foliaceus.
Clinical correlation is recommended.  Multiple levels have been
examined.

The results were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on [**2164-5-16**].
