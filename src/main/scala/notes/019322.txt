increased urinary frequency but otherwise feels well. He denies
visual changes or headache.

EKG: Ventricular paced rhythm at 55 beats per minute. Atrial
mechanism is
unclear but appears to be atrial fibrillation. One natively
conducted
QRS complex. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-3-24**] no
major change
is apparent.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Medication overdose: Per the patient's [**Date Range 802**] she states he
only took one day's worth of medications all at one time.
Toxicology was consulted in the ED.  The patient's was given
glucagon in the ED for possible BBlockers inotxication.  The
patient was not started on Digibind because he had a AICD and
pacemaker inplace.  The patient did not exhibit worsening
ventricular ectopy or arrhythmias. The patient's initial digoxin
level was 2.4 and returned to 1.9 the following day. He was
restarted on Digoxin when he arrived at floor. The patient was
back to his baseline mental status when he arrived in the ICU.
The rest of the patient's medications were held including his
BBlockers and diuretics and the patient was monitored for
adverse effects. The potassium level was elevated initially at
5.1, but reduced to 4.8 in the morning. His medications were
restarted gradually.  Due to ongoing renal failure (improving),
diuretics were held at discharge; to be evaluated at PCP follow
up.
.
# Altered mental status: The patient's family states that he is
usually very responsible about taking his medications as
directed. The patient may have become confused prior to taking
medications.  Unclear etiology of confusion; pt was given 2 days
of levofloxacin for concern of possible respiratory infection,
however, the evidence for this was limited and was subsequently
discontinued.  Pt was found to have a urinary tract infection
with >100k enterococcus; unclear if this was initial infection
that caused pt to be ill, or if this was a complication of a
foley catheter that he had in ICU (appears to have been d/c'd
[**11-23**]).  Treated with Augmentin, and switched to Ampicillin per
ID on discharge.
.
# Urinary tract infection; as above.
.
# Anemia: The patient's Hct was 26.3 on admission. Hct was
stable during his admission.  However, his baseline Hct is
usually around 30-32. Hemolysis labs were checked and negative.
Pt does have a h/o GI bleed in the past. The patient has been on
Fe supplementation and Fe studies were consistent with Fe
deficiency.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine on
admission was 2.7; Cr 1.7 at time of discharge, which appears
worse than baseline. Diuretics held at discharge; will need PCP
reevaluation within 1 week to evaluate for restarting diuretics.
.
# CHF: Most recent EF was <20% in [**2187**]. Patient's medications
were held secondary to potential overdose. SBP in 90-100s.
Medications restarted gradually; diuretics continued to be held
.
# Atrial fibrillation: On Coumadin. V-paced in 50s INR 2.4. he
was placed back on coumadin.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
