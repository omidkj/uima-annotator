Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-2-14**]
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 to left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, bypass from the
ascending aorta to the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex
artery using reverse
autologous saphenous vein graft and bypass from ascending aorta

History of Present Illness:
55 year old [**Country **] Rican male who emigrated to US in
[**2099**]-primarily spanish speaking but understands and speaks
english relatively well. He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today from
[**Hospital6 **] after a positive stress test in the
setting of increasing episodes of chest pain over the last month
with minimal activity. The patient has a family history
significant for premature coronary artery disease. The cath was
done with Plavix at LGH.  The cath showed that the patient has
left main coronary artery disease.  The patient
was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center.
Since the patient had Plavix, a decision was made to postpone
the procedure until the Plavix is washed out.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
Conclusions:
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.

Radiology Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-2-19**]
12:42 PM
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval RUL nodule, eval for source of
infection
Wet Read: JKSd [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2132-2-19**] 5:10 PM
Final Report
FINDINGS: A 5-mm nodule at the right lung apex (4:37)
corresponds with the
nodule seen on the prior chest x-rays. An additional 3-mm
pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe is also present
(4:84). There is paraseptal emphysema, predominantly in the
upper lobes bilaterally, with prominent apical bullae.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection. Linear
atelectasis is noted within the lingula. The airways are clear.

Patient is status post CABG. There are small retrosternal fluid
collections, many of which contain small air-fluid levels. Other
than expected mild stranding within the subcutaneous fat, the
chest wall subcutaneous fat remains preserved. There is no
presternal fluid collection.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. A small
calcified granuloma is noted within the right lobe of the liver.
Otherwise, the non-contrast appearance of the upper abdomen is
within normal limits.
BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post recent sternotomy. There is
no evidence of dehiscence or sternal wire fractures. There is no
erosion of the bone.  There are no osseous lesions concerning
for metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. 5-mm right apical and 3-mm right middle lobe pulmonary
nodules. Six-month followup chest CT is recommended.
2. Moderate paraseptal emphysema with prominent apical bullae.
3. No evidence of pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with adjacent atelectasis.
4. Multiple small retrosternal fluid collections, some with
air-fluid levels, not unexpected in this recently post-surgical
patient. No sternal dehiscence or evidence of sternal wire
fracture. No presternal fluid collection.

Final Report
The right IJ line has been removed.
The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD, with
prominent
bullous change in the upper lobes bilaterally.
There are multiple sternal wires, similar in configuration to
[**2132-2-17**]. No
obvious break in the sternal wires is identified. Mediastinal
clips
consistent with CABG are present. he cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable compared with one day earlier, with
mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and an unfolded aorta.
Slight patchy opacity at the left base is overall unchanged.
Left pleural
effusion is smaller. Doubt CHF.
Again seen is the nodular opacity at
