Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea with fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD extraction

History of Present Illness:
61M hx iCM EF 15-20%, CAD with AMI [**2167**], VFib arrest from IST
[**2167**] s/p ICD implantation, COPD on 2L O2 baseline, DM, [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for ICD explantation.
.
Recently admitted to [**Hospital1 46**] from [**Date range (1) 98806**] for respiratory
failure secondary to CHF and COPD exacerbation. Patient with
chronic exertional dyspnea with mild-moderate activity,
minimally ambulatory, lives in a Nursing Home due to his medical
comorbidities. The staff at his NH noted that he was tachypneic
(RR 28) and requiring additional oxygen supplementation. His
temperature at the time was 100.2F and he was transferred to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He remained febrile (temp 100.5-104F as per report)
and his SBP was noted to be 80-90s. Blood cultures were obtained
and he was given ceftazidime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. At
[**Hospital1 46**] he grew MRSA from the bloodstream. Over the course of his
hospitalization there, his ICD pocket became erythematous, warm
and swollen. It had increased to baseball sized by the time of
transfer, and was fluctuant and warm. TEE was negative for
vegetations there, and blood cultures have since been negative
or NGTD per report (not included in OSH transfer records).
.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICD explantation.  On arrival, he
was in mild respiratory distress and was found to have bibasilar
crackles and a swollen ~4 inch fluctuant mass over the ICD
implant that was erythematous, warm, and tender.  Vitals were T
98.2, BP 105/73, HR 87, RR 20, and SpO2 97% on 3LNC.  He was
continued on Vancomycin for MRSA infection, and diuresed
overnight using Furosemide 40 mg IV followed by 5 mg/hr drip.
He had good urine output and fluid balance negative 1500 ml
overnight.

He was taken to the OR morning of [**2170-7-27**].  His ICD was removed
with purulent material in the pocket.  After explantation, there
was continued oozing from the site and a drain was left in
place.  He remained intubated following the procedure, and was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition.

STUDIES:
(CXR [**2170-7-27**]) Moderate-to-large right greater than left pleural
effusions.  The additional presence of pneumonia cannot be
excluded
.
(ECHO [**2170-7-28**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid or
pulmonic valves. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
61M with history of CAD, MI, sCHF EF 15-20%, VFib arrest s/p ICD
placement in [**2167**], COPD on 2L home O2, who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with MRSA bacteremia and ICD pocket infection.
.
# MRSA ICD INFECTION with Bacteremia: MRSA bacteremia found at
OSH, Positive growth of Staph aureus from ICD pocket, blood cx
negative since admission here. Pocket has appeared infected over
the past few days, culminating in a ~4 inch fluctuant mass that
was erythematous, warm, and tender over the ICD implant.  S/P
ICD explantation and pocket washout with placement of drain. Pt
required temporary phenylephrine, and epinephrine. He had a
drain placed which was pulled on [**2170-8-2**].  He had a transient
decrease in HCT with oozing around pocket, and was 26.7 on day
of discharge.  He will require monitoring of his CBC at rehab.
ID was consulted who recommended 6 weeks of Vancomycin. Pt has
PICC line in right basilic vein for Vancomycin 750mg q12 (stop
date [**2170-8-27**]).
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Initially hypoxic beyond
baseline (3L on admission, 2L at home) with bibasilar rales and
bilateral effusions, JVP elevation, peripheral edema.  Likely
due to iatrogenic causes in setting of MRSA bacteremia and
initial presentation of sepsis.  Pt initially on pressors,
weaned on the first day. [**Name (NI) 98807**], Pt was started on Lasix
drip fluid status improved and we continued PRN Lasix to goal of
-1L/day. Lisinopril and Spironolactone were initially held due
to SBPs 80s-90s, Lisinopril restarted several days prior to
discharge, and Spirolactone will need to be added on as an
outpatient with better SBPs. Pt discharged on Metop Succinate XL
25mg Daily, Lisinopril 2.5mg daily, Dig .25mg/day, and
Furosemide 80mg TID.  His BPs were in the 80-90s on d/c but
patient was asymptomatic with no orthostasis on exam.  In
addition, he wa
