History of Present Illness:
75-yr-old male with PAF (on amio), HTN, AAA, CRI (Cr baseline
1.4), SCLC with brain and spinal mets (diagnosed in [**7-19**],
treated with five cycles of carboplatin/Taxol + chest XRT) s/p
recent whole brain radiation, who presented to the ED with LE
swelling but was found to have hypotension and fever.
.
Pt noted mild b/l LE swelling over the last two days which he
has never experienced before. He denies any CP, SOB but noted
some dizziness and lightheadedness over the last few days. He
continued to take his BP meds despite these symptoms. Per his
report, he developed the LE swelling after his last whole brain
radiation on Friday and was told by his radiation-oncologist
that it might be related to that and the steroids he is
currently receiving. However, he was concerned and called his
daughter in [**Name (NI) 108**] who came up to [**Name (NI) 86**] and brought him to the
ED.
.
In the ED, his BP was found to be 65/40. He was tachy to the
120s and had a Temp of 100.6. Lactate of 2.1. A UA was negative.
However, a CXR revealed an infiltrate below his lung mass in
line with post-obstructive pneumonia. He received 4L IVF with
only transient effect on his BP. He was started on Levo and
Clindamycin for presumed postobstructive pneumonia. Code Sepsis
was called and a right IJ was placed. Levophed was started given
hypotension that was resistant to fluid resuscitation. His
Levophed drip was at 0.75 mcg/kg on transfer to the ICU.
.
On ROS, he endorsed a mildly productive cough over the last two
weeks. Sputum has only been whitish to clear. No F/C/N noted. No
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] CP or SOB as above. No urinary symptoms or
abnormal bowel movements. No blood in stool or urine noted. No
nosebleeds but easy bruising. Chronic back pain from spinal mets
with no change in severity.
.
Oncologic History (per onc notes from [**6-25**] and [**7-13**]): Dx in
8/[**2104**]. Initially presentation with bulky disease and near
complete tracheal obstruction s/p Y stenting (removed again in
10/[**2104**]). S/p chemo with carboplatin and etoposide on
[**2105-8-11**]. His first cycle of chemotherapy was complicated by
S. bovis endocarditis; completed 4 weeks of IV penicillin in
early [**Month (only) 359**]. Initially, believed to have extensive stage
disease, with metastases in the left adrenal gland and liver.
However, follow-up CT scans revealed no change in the adrenal
lesion while his pulmonary lesions decreased in size. In
addition, the hepatic lesions seen on his initial CT were not
seen on later exams were felt to be an artifact and not
metastatic spread. Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] completed five cycles of
chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest.


Past Medical History:
- PAF, on Amio, not on anticoagulation (has been on coumadin
prior to his first round of chemo in [**2104**]); followed by Dr.

- Hyperlipidemia
- CRI, Cr baseline 1.4
- PVD
- AAA S/P repair over one year ago
- ? Etoh abuse
- H/o S. bovis endocarditis (during first cycle of chemo); s/p 4
wks of penicillin in [**9-/2105**]
- Colonoscopy on [**2105-9-1**]: fragments of adenoma with high grade
dysplasia and focal intramucosal carcinoma but no invasive
carcinoma.
- SCLC as above


Social History:
Lives alone. Family lives in [**State 38104**] and [**State 108**]. Has five kids and
many grandchildren. Divorced. Quit smoking over two years ago.
Smoked 1 pack per week for 50 years. Remote EtOH use in the past
(1-2 drinks per month). No drug use.

Imaging:
CXR [**2106-7-25**]: Comparison was made with a prior chest radiograph
dated [**2106-3-9**]. Again note is made of opacity in the right
upper lobe extending from the right hilum, representing
post-radiation change
as seen on prior torso CT dated [**2106-5-27**]. Thoracic aorta is
tortuous. Cardiac contour is unchanged. Linear atelectasis in
right upper lobe with pleural thickening is again noted. There
is atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Overall appearance of
the chest is unchanged. Left lung is clear. IMPRESSION: Overall
unchanged appearance of the chest with post-radiation change and
volume loss of the right lung.
.
MRI spine [**2106-7-19**]: Diffuse leptomeningeal metastases involving
the lower thoracic cord, the conus medullaris, and the cauda
equina.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm just above the aortic bifurcation
measuring
approximately 3.1 cm in size.
Mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with multilevel
mild bilateral foraminal stenoses, but without canal stenosis.
.
MRI brain [**2106-6-25**]: Multiple, new metastatic lesions (left
parietal;
left medial temporal lobe; met extending from the pituitary
infundibulum into the hypothalamus; right lateral pons; left
cerebellar tonsil and the left cerebellar hemisphere; right
frontal leptomeningeal metastasis).


Brief Hospital Course:
75-yr-old male with PAF (on amio), HTN, AAA, CRI (Cr baseline
1.4), SCLC with brain and spinal mets (diagnosed in [**7-19**],
treated with five cycles of carboplatin/Taxol + chest XRT) s/p
recent whole brain radiation, who presented to the ED with LE
swelling but was found to have hypotension, fever and RLL
infiltrate.

.
# Fever/hypotension: Met SIRS criteria given BP, HR and temp.
Lactate of 2.1 in the ED. Normal AG. Left-shift on differential
with 2% bands. Likely source is lungs given RLL infiltrate on
CXR, which was confirmed on CT. UA was negative and no urinary
symptoms. No lines as entry sites. No open wounds on skin or
mucosa. No abdominal tenderness and LFTs wnl. Thus, no other
obvious sources making pneumonia most likely reason for his
fever/hypotension. Pt received 4L IVF in the ED and was started
on Levophed after CVL placement. Antihypertensive meds were
held. Levophed was weaned off, as well as supplemental O2.
Received Levo/Clinda x1 in the ED. Started Vanc/Zosyn in ICU.
Hemodynamically stable off pressors. Likely component of
dehydration contributing to hypotension as out of proportion of
other clinical picture.
  Patient was transfered to the oncology floor when he was
stabilized.  Was stepwise titrated down off antibiotics to levo,
and patient completed [**9-26**] day course.  He remained off
suppelmental oxygen and was afebrile with normal WBC.  Patients
blood pressure's returned to [**Location 213**] normal, and patient returned
to baseline hypertension.  HTN meds were restarted, and patient
was well controlled.  Towards the end of hospitalization,
patient developed presumed herpetic oral ulcers.  Patient had
continued hypotension, HTN meds held, believed to be due to poor
PO intake.  Pressures maintained w/ IVF.  Patient should have PO
intake enouraged, and IVF if necessary.  Patients SBP has ranged
from 90-105 at time of discharge, and patient is asymptomatic.
.
# Thrombocytopenia, now leukocytopenia: Plt of 58 on admission.
H/o easy bruising but no overt bleeding. Last Plt count was 214
one month ago. Baseline around 100-200 indicating chronic
thrombocytopenia, likely due to
