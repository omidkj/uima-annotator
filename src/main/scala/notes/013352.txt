Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is an 84F with a suspicious RUL nodule who presented
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy
2. Right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy, mediastinal
lymph node dissection
3. Serial bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet
4. Picc line placement

Flexible bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy
and right upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection
serial bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet
Picc line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is an 84F with a suspicious dominant right upper lobe
mass, which is just over 3cm.  Her mediastinal staging is
negative.  The smaller smooth bordered nodules in the left lower
lobe were indeterminate, but bear further watching on followup
CT scanning.  Her pulmonary function test today does show some
degree of impairment of her lung function consistent with her
emphysema.  Her DLCO is most concerning with only 43% of
predicted value.  She appears to have some likelihood of
respiratory failure or worsening oxygen requirement following
this operation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed this at length with
Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] and her family and they agree to proceed with the
operation.

Past Medical History:
1. s/p diagnostic bronch and med ([**7-10**])
2. COPD
3. Hypothyroidism
4. GERD
5. s/p hip replacements '[**34**], '[**35**], '[**54**], '[**55**]
6. s/p CCY
7. throat cancer s/p local radiation '[**61**]

Social History:
A 35-pack-year ex-smoker, discontinued in [**2154**]. Retired nanny
and homemaker.  She lives with her husband.  Denies alcohol use
or exposure history.


Family History:
Mother had a brain tumor.  Her father had heart failure.  She
has a sister with ovarian cancer, and she has three healthy
children.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ON ADMISSION [**2171-7-18**]
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.9, pulse 79, blood pressure 137/69,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
GENERAL:  Well-nourished, well-developed elderly woman in no
apparent distress.
NECK:  The neck incision is clean, dry, and intact and healing
well without fluctuance, purulence, or erythema.
LUNGS:  Distant breath sounds with some coarse left lower lung
field and right upper lung field rales.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ON DISCHARGE [**2171-8-16**]
Gen: no acute distress
CV: RRR, no murmurs
Pulm: distant coars breath sounds in the R lung fields, clear
breath sounds in the L lung fields
Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended

Pertinent Results:
PICC XRAY [**2171-8-14**]
Uncomplicated ultrasound of fluoroscopically-guided single lumen
PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
Final internal length is 34 cm, with the tip positioned in the
SVC. The line is ready to use.

CXR
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman s/p RUL lobectomy, now s/p bronchoscopy and
PEG, repeat bronchoscopy for right lung collapse done.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate interval change
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Followup right lung collapse, s/p right upper
lobectomy.

Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including most
recent one performed a day before at 1540 hours.

There is complete white-out of the right hemithorax consistent
with total collapse of the remaining right lung. Patient has
known loculated right pleural effusion. There has been interval
increase in shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the right
side, otherwise no changes in interstitial opacities in the left
lung due to pulmonary edema.

PATHOLOGY
1.  Lung right upper lobe, wedge resection (A-F):
Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, see synoptic
report.
2.  L10 (G-H):
Lymph node(s) with non-necrotizing granulomas; no malignancy
identified.
3.  L12 (I):
One lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomas; no malignancy
identified.
4.  L11 (J):
Lymph node(s); no malignancy identified.
5.  Right upper lobe (K-Q):
No malignancy identified.

Specimen Type:  Lobectomy.
Laterality:  Right.
Tumor Site:  Upper lobe.
Tumor Size
    Greatest dimension:  2.5 cm.
MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Type:  Squamous cell carcinoma.
Histologic Grade:  G3:  Poorly differentiated.

EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension,
surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic
evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie,
not in the main bronchus).

Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.

Margins:
    Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Venous invasion (V):  Absent.
Comments:  Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomas.  Special
stains will be issued in an addendum.

ADDENDUM:
Stains for fungi and acid fast bacilli are negative with
satisfactory controls.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and taken to the OR on [**2171-7-19**] for Flexible
bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy, right
upper lobectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection
complicated by an avulsion injury to the posterior recurrent
branch of the pulmonary artery which was repaired. Post
operatively, pt was admitted to the SICU for hemodynamic
monitoring which stabilized quickly.

The pt's initial post operative course was complicated by
ongoing respiratory compromise requiring re-intubation x2, BIPAP
support and pulmonary tiolet via almost daily bronchoscopies for
pulmonary tiolet. She had several mucus plugs that were removed
by bronchoscopy, and her BAL grew out pseudomonas; ID was
consulted and continued to follow the pt thru-out her hospital
course. Presently she is on vancomycin and meropenem (started
[**8-11**] x 7days).

She had intermittant confusion and occasionally refused
interventions. She was seen by psychiatry and her family and
health care proxy (daughter [**Name2 (NI) **]) were responsible for
treatment decisions when pt was unable.

An open J-tube was placed [**8-9**] for feeding after pt failed
bedside and video swallow. Since this surgery, pt has had a
complete white out of her right lung which has required daily
bronchoscopies and aggressive pulmonary toilet with little to no
improvement on CXR. Her oxygen sats are currently 95% on 4
liters. Pt has refused intubation and requested to be made DNI.
Her family was in agreement with her decision.

On [**2171-8-15**] she received a R US-guided chest tap by
interventional pulmonology which yielded no fluid.  Her and her
family are in agreement to discharge her to a rehabilitation
facility.  She is currently tolerating tube feeds via her
J-tube.
