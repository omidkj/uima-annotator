STAT DISCHARGE ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**], as stated in previous discharge
summary, was admitted on [**2168-2-25**] with respiratory distress,
treated initially but unsuccessfully with diuresis.  The patient
was noted to have increasing renal failure with creatinine rising
to 4.8.  The patient was seen by renal service and felt to have
ATN.  On [**2168-3-11**], the patient had episode of respiratory
distress and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for emergent intubation.  She was dialyzed that day and
transferred back to the floor on [**2168-3-15**].  Since transfer,
issues have been the following:

currently on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Her renal
function has not improved and her urine output is minimal.
The renal service believes that kidney function may still improve
and thus ACE inhibitors have been held.  She has been treated
with Tums for hyperphosphatemia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does occasionally have
increasing oxygen requirement secondary to fluid overload.
However, she is unresponsive to Lasix and does well with
dialysis.  ACE inhibitor was held, but hydralazine and Isordil
were restarted and titrated up slowly.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] has a history of atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone.  She was anticoagulated with
Coumadin, but Coumadin was held on [**2168-3-19**] and [**2168-3-20**] for
super-therapeutic INR.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] does have occasional
leukocytosis with a white cell count of 20 without left shift.
She had been started on levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**2168-3-11**] for
aspiration pneumonia.  She completed a 10 day course for this.
She was also started on vancomycin on [**2168-3-13**] for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum.  She will need
to continue this until a 14 day course is completed.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was placed on NPH 6 mg subcutaneous
[**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale insulin at transfer.  However, on [**2168-3-19**],
blood sugars were noted to be up in the 500s which were
unresponsive to sliding scale insulin.  On [**2168-3-20**], she was
started on an insulin drip with good results.  NPH was increased
to 20 units in the morning and 15 units at night with good
results.  She has been off insulin since the nighttime.

6.  NEUROLOGIC:  On [**2168-3-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] was noted to have
seizure activity, including lateral gaze bilaterally to the left
and seizure activity of the left eye and mouth.  This continued
for almost one and a half hours with occasional breaks in
seasonal activity with return to baseline in between.  She was
given a total of 10 mg intravenous Valium and loaded on
intravenous phenytoin.  She will need to continue phenytoin for
at least one week.  Neurology was consulted and thought this was
likely secondary to toxic metabolic fluids from renal dialysis
versus hyperglycemia.  Meningitis cannot be ruled out at that
time.  LP was considered but it was unlikely that bacterial
meningitis was present, as she had been on broad spectrum
antibiotics for some time, and had no further seizure activity.
CT of the head was also obtained which showed old right frontal
cerebrovascular accident and enlarged ventricles, which could
have served as a seizure focus.

7.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As stated in previous discharge summary,
Ms. [**Known lastname 106040**] had coffee ground emesis from nasogastric tube on
[**2168-3-11**], but had no further episodes.  She will need
gastrointestinal evaluation at a later time.
