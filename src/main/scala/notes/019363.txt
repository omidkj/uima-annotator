Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

CXR [**4-25**]: Unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions & mild
failure

Feeding tube [**4-24**]: An 8 French [**Location (un) 2174**]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**] nasointestinal
tube was passed through the nose into the fourth portion of the
duodenum under fluoroscopic guidance. A spot film after
administration of approximately 5 cc of Conray contrast was
obtained to document proper position.

Echo [**4-13**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial
effusion. The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.

Doppler U/S UE and LE [**4-13**]: No evidence of DVT

CTA of chest [**4-12**]: Small acute bilateral pulmonary emboli within
segmental/subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches to the lower
lobes. Left greater than right pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.

CT pelvis [**4-9**]: A non-contrast enhanced CT scan was obtained of
the pelvis which again confirms the presence of several fluid
collections in the peritoneal cavity and pelvis.
CT GUIDANCE: CT fluoroscopy was used to identify the cutaneous
site overlying an approximately 5.5 x 5.3 cm fluid collection in
the left lower quadrant.

CT abd [**4-6**]:
1. Interval development of multiple enhancing fluid collections
throughout the abdomen and pelvis, as described above.
2. Pulmonary consolidations in both lower lobes with bilateral
pleural effusions.
3. Interval development of expansion of the right gluteal
muscle, which may reflect a large underlying hematoma. Please
correlate clinically.
4. Bilateral inguinal hernias containing nonobstructed loops of
small bowel with fluid tracking along the right inguinal canal.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
6. Diffuse mesenteric stranding of unclear etiology.

UE U/S [**4-5**]: Findings consistent with bilateral non-occlusive
internal jugular venous disease, right more than left

CT abd/pelvis [**3-25**]:
1. Mild left hydronephrosis versus extra-renal pelvis
2. Findings suggestive of ileus.
3. Small bilateral inguinal hernias containing loops of small
bowel, without evidence of bowel obstruction.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
4. Small amount of ascites.
5. Pulmonary consolidations in both lower lobes. Nodular
opacities in the left lower lobe, which are likely related to
infection or aspiration, but follow-up is recommended to ensure
resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2170-3-25**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was transferred to the surgery service
at [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. At the time of his
transfer he was POD 6 from a cystectomy with ileal loop conduit.
At the outside hospital he was intubate, febrile, hypotensive,
oliguric, with an elevated troponin, and in critical condition.
He was placed on Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, and Flagyl secondary
to his daily fevers. Due to a rising WBC count and a worsening
abdominal exam, Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was taken to the OR on [**2170-3-29**]. He
was found to have a small bowel anastamotic leak that was
resected and repaired. For details of the procedure, please see
Dr.[**Name (NI) 6433**] operative report. Post-operatively he remained
febrile with copious amounts of sputum production. He was placed
on TPN for nutritional support. His antibiotic regimen was
changed, with the addition of Meropenem. Sputum cultures grew
Enterobacter. Urine cultures grew yeast. Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was also
started on tube feeds via an NGT tube. On [**2170-4-9**] a repeat CT of
his abdomen and pelvis was obtained. It showed an intraabdominal
abscess that was subsequently drained by CT guidance. On [**2170-4-12**]
Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] experienced some increased tachycardia and an
episode on hypoxia. A CTA of his chest revealed small bilateral
PE's. He was started on heparin and transitioned to coumadin.
Due to the inability to wean him off the ventilator, Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21110**] a percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2170-4-16**]. He tolerated
the procedure well and was slowly weaned off the ventilator over
the next 2 days. His tube feeds were gradually increased to goal
while his TPN was discontinued. At the time of discharge, Mr.
[**Known lastname 3075**] was on goal tube feeds via a post-pyloric Dobhoff. He
had a bedside swallow exam that he failed. This can be repeated
in the near future when he gets stronger. He has been maintained
on 5 mg coumadin QHS with a goal INR between [**2-16**]. His
antibiotics were discontinued after a 14 day course of treating
his pneumonia. He was discharged to rehab with instructions to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-15**] weeks.
