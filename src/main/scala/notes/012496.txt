[**9-14**] CXR
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours
appear stable, with persistent enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits. No focal
consolidations are seen within the lungs. No evidence of pleural
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or
significant change from prior.
.
[**9-16**] CXR
FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the frontal
view when compared to prior. The lateral projection shows some
pleural thickening which could be some loculated fluid
posteriorly and some discoid atelectasis as well.

IMPRESSION: No change from prior. No new consolidation.

[**9-20**] CXR
PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2109-9-20**] and
compared with the prior radiograph of [**2109-9-16**]. There is
cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the aorta. The right lung
appears clear. There is some patchy increase in density in the
left lower lung field, probably in the lingula, which is
unchanged from prior examination and likely represents
subsegmental atelectasis. No frank consolidation is seen.

IMPRESSION:
No significant change in the appearances since the study of
[**2111-9-17**] with atelectasis/airspace disease in the left lower lung
zone.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old female with a history of fibromyalgia, possible
lupus, significant marcotic abuse history, and hypothyroidism
presents with recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

#. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 107155**] and, with
aggressive hydration, trended down to 1080 on discharge.
Orthopedics followed her throughout her hospital stay given
concern that she might develop compartment syndrome; serial
exams were without evidence of this. The patient has a history
of recurrent rhabdomyolysis with extensive prior work-up. In the
past, rheumatology has suspected narcotic-related myotoxicity
(prolonged treatment with high dose opioids for chronic pain),
although adult-onset metabolic myopathy was an another unlikely
possibility. 2 prior muscle biopsies were not consistent with
polymyositis. Per patient, she was only taking MS contin,
discussion with her pharmacy revealed she was also filling
scripts for percocet and oxycodone. She has been reluctant to
taper off MSContin, but now agrees to do so. Over the course of
her hospital stay, she was tapered from MSContin 150 mg PO BID
to 90 mg PO BID. This should continued to be tapered as an
outpatient when she follows up with her new PCP.

#. Acute renal failure: Creatinine peaked at 2.1 from a baseline
Cr 0.5, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Urine electrolytes
were consistent with a renal etiology (FENA 11 %) and the renal
service followed her throughout her hospital course. At time of
discharge, her creatinine was stable at 1.9. This will need to
continue to
