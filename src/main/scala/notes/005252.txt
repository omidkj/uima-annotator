viral load 15,000, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(three liters oxygen at home), cardiomyopathy, hepatitis B
hemodialysis, now admitted on [**2178-9-3**], with an episode of
bright red blood per rectum.  Workup done in [**5-24**], revealed
grade I known bleeding internal hemorrhoids and local erosions
thought to be due to enema use..

liters which improved to 93% on 100% nonrebreather.  He was
in extremis.  A long discussion of code status was initiated. The
decline was thought to be due to an infection (aspiration
pneumonitis) or a flare of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  Because of the respiratory distress, the
patient was initially admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit
where he was started on Levofloxacin and steroids and placed on
bipap.

ALLERGIES:  Haldol developing rash.  Thorazine producing
anaphylaxis.  H2 blockers producing thrombocytopenia.
Clindamycin and Codeine and Stelazine rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.2,
heart rate 110, blood pressure 100/62, low 90s% sat on NRB.
The patient was in acute distress, tachpneic and disoriented.
Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat - pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation, mild esotropia, no oral thrush.  The neck
is supple, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac - S1 and S2, regular
rate and rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur.  The lungs
revealed bilateral rhonchi, no dullness.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, mildly distended.  Extremities - chronic
venous stasis, no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 58 year old man with history of
autoimmune deficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cardiomyopathy, hepatitis B and C, polysubstance
abuse, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, now admitted
with an episode of bright red blood per rectum due to
hemorrhoidal bleeding and flare of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

Gastrointestinal - The patient has a history of bright red
blood per rectum for which had previous workup in [**5-24**],
which reveled grade I nonbleeding hemorrhoids.  His
colonoscopy also revealed rectal ulcer and surgery who
followed the patient previously felt that ulcer is cause for
his bleed.  This hospitalization the patient did not have
further episodes of bleeding and his hematocrit remained
stable.  It was therefore decided not to pursue further
workup.

Pulmonary - The patient was admitted with worsening oxygen
saturation requiring BIPAP and this was believed to be due to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  Labs showed an
acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, possible chronic
metablic acidosis (renal failure).  The patient was
started on Levofloxacin on [**2178-9-5**], and steroid taper with
significant improvement of oxygen saturation.  Because there
was also believed to be a component of aspiration, the
patient had also swallowing study, which showed only mild
abnormalities.

Renal - The patient has a history of end stage renal disease
on hemodialysis.  He continued to have hemodialysis during
hospitalization.  There were no active issues.

Infectious disease - The patient was on Levaquin for flare of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, continues on Bactrim
DS q.i.d. as prophylaxis of PCP and is also on antiretroviral
medications.

Cardiovascular - The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy
secondary to HIV.  He continues to be on ace inhibitor and
beta blockers.  There were no active issues regarding
cardiomyopathy during this hospitalization.

hematocrit 32.1, platelet count 87,000.  Partial
thromboplastin time 33.6, INR 1.3. Granulocyte count 1280.

Chest x-ray reveals no evidence of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.
