CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Coughing up blood

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old Caucasian
female with a history of diabetes, who presents with five
days of "coughing up blood."  The patient describes her blood
as red, fresh and voluminous.  The patient says that she was
coughing in general for about five days prior to admission,
and intermittently bringing up blood.  On the night prior to
admission, she said she had a lot of coughing, with blood
each time.  The patient also states that she has felt "cold"
for the past four days, with a temperature of up to 103 per
patient report.  The patient states that she has never
coughed up blood in the past.  The patient denies any chest
pain or any kind of prodromal symptoms.  The patient denies
any black, tarry stool or bright red blood per rectum.  Of
note, the patient has a history of warm autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, for which she takes 5 mg of prednisone a day, and 400
mg by mouth twice a day of danazol.  She said that her last
transfusion was one year ago.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had a nasogastric
lavage, which showed coffee grounds that cleared after one
liter.  Her vitals there were a temperature of 98.1, pulse
106, blood pressure 182/81, and oxygen saturation of 92% on
face mask.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at the [**Hospital3 2732**]
Home in [**Location (un) 55**].  The patient is a 20 to 30 pack year
smoker, quit ten years ago.  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 12272**] with 24 hour help.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient states that she has lost nine
siblings to cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature afebrile, pulse 116, blood
pressure 191/57, oxygen saturation 92% on nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient is a talkative, elderly woman, hard of
hearing, in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination:  A small amount of dried crusted blood on
lips.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation on the left, right
side with significant decreased breath sounds throughout,
with some inspiratory wheeze.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic,
normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur and fainter
holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x 3, no
focal signs.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.5, with a
differential of 77.7 neutrophils, 0% bands, and 15.1%
lymphocytes.  Hematocrit 35.6, platelets 218 . Sodium 143,
potassium 4.3, chloride 111, bicarbonate 22, BUN 21,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 155.  PT 14, PTT 25, INR 1.3.

STUDIES:  Chest x-ray from [**2170-1-13**] showed right lower lobe
and right upper lobe opacity which could represent
atelectasis or consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 86-year-old female with a
history of diabetes, who presents with five days of
hemoptysis.  Because the patient had voluminous hemoptysis,
and new oxygen requirement, she was immediately brought to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Repeat nasogastric lavage
was clear.  The patient received a chest CT, which was
notable for a right lower lobe mass, read as concerning for
malignancy vs pneumonia.  In addition, there was significant
volume loss in the right lung, and atelectasis throughout the
right lung.  Given that the patient gave a history of about a
30 pound weight loss over the past year, and new night
sweats, the finding of a right lower lobe is quite ominous.

The patient received a rigid bronchoscopy on [**1-13**].  This did
not show any clear central endobronchial lesions that could
explain the hemoptysis, but did show complete obstruction of
the right main stem bronchus secondary to blood clots.  After
the clots were evacuated, it was noted that the right lower
lobe was being compressed by a process outside of the
bronchial tree.  Endobronchial biopsy was performed, as well
as lymph node sampling.  Given that the patient presented
with this new mass in conjunction with fever, and given that
an obstructive process was present with multiple blood clots,
it is very likely that the patient developed a
post-obstructive pneumonia.  The patient was placed on a two
week course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient has not had any further
hemoptysis since admission.  The patient's transbronchial
biopsy results showed only inflammatory changes with atypia,
and no signs of neoplasm.  However, given that the patient is
a smoker, with a one year history of weight loss and new
night sweats, there is still much concern for a neoplastic
process.  Of note, the patient had a negative PPD to rule out
tuberculosis.  Because the transbronchial biopsy is not
always effective in picking up lesions, the patient will need
to be rescanned within one month's time.  If the mass is the
same size or has gotten larger, it will be necessary to do a
more invasive sampling, such as a VATS procedure.  Otherwise,
if the mass shows some regression in size, it may be mostly
attributed to an ill-defined pneumonia.

On [**2170-1-17**], the patient developed increasing shortness of
breath, even though her oxygenation was steadily improving.
The patient was being weaned from the oxygen nasal cannula.
Chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe process, consistent
with effusion and potential mild congestive heart failure,
and/or atelectasis.  The patient's fluids were stopped, and
she was given 40 mg of oral lasix.  The patient did not have
any symptomatic improvement, nor did the chest x-ray change
with the lasix.  Part of the patient's general shortness of
breath was also attributed to her resolving pneumonia.  The
patient continued to saturate well off of oxygen.

2.  Infectious Disease:  As already noted, the patient was
suspected to have a post-obstructive pneumonia, and was
treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient has been
afebrile since admission, and her white blood cell count has
decreased.  The plan is to continue levofloxacin and Flagyl
for a total of 14 days.

3.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable,
after a small dip at the time of bleeding.  The patient has a
history of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, for which she
takes prednisone and danazol.  These medications were
continued.

4.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, for which she is
preload and rate dependent.  The patient was successfully
kept on a regimen of Verapamil.
