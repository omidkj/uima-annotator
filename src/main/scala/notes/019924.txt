Admission Date:  [**2186-1-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-1-10**]


Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
male with coronary artery disease.  He is status post
catheterization at which time the results showed a severe
greater then 95% mid left anterior descending coronary artery
stenosis, left circumflex, diffuse mild disease with obtuse
marginal probably the graft target, showed a total mid right
coronary artery occlusion with bridging collaterals. Due to
the extensive coronary artery disease the decision was made
to proceed with coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient
was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit at time intraaortic
balloon pump was placed in the patient as a bridge to the
coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient was also placed on
nitro and heparin drips.  On [**2186-1-5**] a coronary
artery bypass graft times three vessels was completed with
saphenous vein graft to distal left anterior descending
coronary artery, left internal mammary coronary artery to
obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which
time the IABP was discontinued as well as the Swan-Ganz
catheter on postoperative day one.

The patient did quite well and was transferred to the
Surgical floor where he continued to do well and engage in
physical therapy.  His epicardial wires and chest tubes were
removed without incident and the patient's course was
complicated by some early morning confusion, which was unlike
anything encountered at baseline.  Urinalysis,
electrocardiogram and neurological examinations were without
significant findings.  Geratology consult was asked for by
the family and they were kind enough to see the patient and
give their recommendations, but their diagnosis as well as
ours was acute delirium.  On postoperative day five the
patient was discharged to rehab in good condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Unstable angina secondary to coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Sorbitol 15 cc po q day, Lopressor 25

po q day, aspirin 325 mg po q day, Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d.
