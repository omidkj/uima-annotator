On the morning of this admission, patient was complaining of

elevated troponin. Her EKG showed TWI in V3-V6 and lateral ST
depressions. She was given vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone. A CT
abd/pelvis was performed which showed colitis.
.
She was intitially taken to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] where her vitals were
T 100.1 rectal, HR 87, BP 70/30, RR 18-20, 83% on RA. She was
given 4L of IVF. She became more tachypneic, so was intubated.
Her stool was found to be C. diff positive. She was given IV
vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone. A CT abd/pelvis showed pancolitis. A
right IJ was placed and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her vitals were T 97.8, BP 108/47, HR 78,
RR 18, 100%, intubated. Her blood pressure fell to 78/34, so she
was given ?3L of IVF. She was started on levophed and dopamine.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old female with history of type 2 diabetes and dementia
transferred from an outside hospital with sepsis from C.
difficile colitis initially requiring pressors.  She was treated
with flagyl IV and vancomycin PO.  She developed hypoxic
respiratory failure in the setting of aggressive fluid
rescucitation and was intubated prior to transfer.  Her course
was complicated by NSTEMI in the setting of demand ischemia,
acute renal failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Extubation was attempted [**2129-12-24**], however, the patient
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure after one and a half
hours.  She was reintubated at that time.  Her respiratory
failure was thought due to muscle weakness.  She continued to
require pressure support ventilation.  After discussion with her
son, the decision was made not to pursue tracheostomy.  The
patient was terminally intubated [**2130-1-3**] and expired 22:13.
Autopsy was declined.
