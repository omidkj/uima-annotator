[**2174-5-4**] CXR: - IMPRESSION: 1) Worsening asymmetrical alveolar
pattern, most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. 2)
Moderate to large loculated left pleural effusion. 3) Stable
abnormal appearance of left hilum and perihilar region, in
keeping with history of lung cancer."
.
[**2174-5-5**] TTE: Conclusions: The left atrium is dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include basal to mid
inferior/inferolaterlal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (tape
reviewed) of [**2172-9-29**], left ventricular systolic function
appears similar and mitral regurgitation appears similar."
.
[**2174-5-6**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Doppler US:
"No DVTs bilaterally.
.
[**2174-5-6**] Non-contrast Chest CT - IMPRESSION: 1. Left lower lobe
consolidation, with air fluid levels concerning for an empyema
vs recent procedure. Clinical correlation is requested. 2.
Moderate sized right-sided pleural effusion. 3. Loculated left
pleural effusion at prior chest tube insertion site. 4. Diffuse
paraseptal emphysematous change bilaterally. 5. Honeycombing and
interstitial air space disease, predominantly within right upper
lobe. Given the acute increase, this most likely represents a
pneumonic infiltrate. Given the asymmetry, congestive heart
failure is less likely. Clinical correlation is requested.
6. Diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with the
patient's history of lung cancer. 7. Atherosclerotic disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
72yo M with squamous cell lung CA s/p chemo, XRT, and
photodynamic therapy, recurrent left pleural effusion s/p
pleurodiesis, CHF, HTN, Afib, Emphysema, who presents with
progressively worsening DOE and hypoxia.
.
PULMONARY - The etiology of the patient's hypoxia was somewhat
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] had evidence of both pulmonary edema as well as a
primary pulmonary process. Multiple CT scans noted evidence of
PNA, and possible multilobar PNA. He completed a 10 day course
of Levofloxacin for this. He was admitted to CCU intially for
diuresis, and then to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further w/u of his pulmonary
process. He was briefly intubated for hypoxia/respiratory
distress s/p extubation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He thorough w/u for
infectious etiology of his pulmonary process including right
thoracentesis and brochoscopy which did not show etiology of
these findings. All viral and bacterial cultures returned
negative. PE was felt less likely given his CT findings,
negative LE U/S, and therapeutic INR on Coumadin.
    Attempts at aggressive diuresis with IV diuretics were
unsuccessfull given his Cr in the 3's and known renal disease.
His creatinine began to rise with IV diuretics, and he begun on
hemodialysis because of his volume overload and continued
hypoxia. His oxygen requirement continued to decrease to room
air currently.
.
CARDIOVASCULAR:
    Coronaries - the patient c/o some atypical chest discomfort
on admission, and was noted to have flat CK's but positive
Troponins as high as 0.5 in setting of ARF. He had new EKG's
with lat STD's and TWI's at low rates, which became more diffuse
at higher heart rates. He has likely CAD based on focal WMA's on
previous and current TTE's. Cardiology was consulted and
recommended medical management of CAD at this time. Pt was
continued on ASA, statin, BB.
    Pump - repeat TTE noted stable EF. Pt required hemodialysis
for adequate diuresis. Pt was thought to have a component of
diastolic dysfunction in setting of CAD, as well as Afib when in
RVR.
    [**Name (NI) **] - pt presented on Amiodarone but clearly continued to
be in Afib. His rate was slighly elevated in high 90's on
admission, which was controlled with BB. His Amiodarone was
d/c's given his ongoing pulmonary infiltrates and continued Afib
despite Amio. He was anticoagulated with Heparin and then
restarted on coumadin. Goal INR [**2-24**].
.
ARF: The patient has very poor basline renal function, with
significant renal damage by recent renal biopsy. This is thought
be secondary to nephrotic syndrome b/o diabetes. After he was
started on hemodialysis, it was felt that he would likely
require long-term dialysis given his poor baseline. He had an
IR-guided permacath placed for access.
.
ONCOLOGY: After discuss with pt's primary Oncologist Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], it was felt that the status of the patient's lung Ca
was unknown. He likely has local recurrence in the location of
his previous treatments, but there is no evidence of current
metastasis. Since his has had an indolent course of tumor
progression and since his mortality is unknown, it was decided
that his lung cancer not preclude treatment of his other medical
issues.
.
DM: patient was placed on ISS. Glipizide was discontinued given
his renal failure.
.
ANEMIA: ane
