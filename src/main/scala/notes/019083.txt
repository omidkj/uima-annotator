Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
post EGD bronchospasm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92011**] is a 39 year old woman with a significant PMH of TBM,
asthma and presumed hypersensitivity pneumonitis requiring
multiple past intubations, who presents intubated from the GI
suite following bronchospasm following outpatient EGD procedure.


Ms. [**Known lastname 92011**] was recently admitted from [**6-5**] to [**6-8**] for shortness
of breath, when CT neck revealed new diagnosis of severe TBM.
She is followed extensively for her pulmonary disease with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She underwent elective EGD today to
evaluate possible role of GERD in her newly diagnosied TBM with
plan for potential airway stent to be placed in the near future.
Following EGD, where she received only propofol for sedation,
she developed severe intractable coughing and tachypnea. She
initially received 1 treatment of albuterol and ipratroprium
nebulizer without relief. Further treatments with nebulized
lidocaine, continous lidocaine, and heliox were not successful.
She received 4mg IV midazolam for severe anxiety. She did not
tolerate BiPAP and she was subsequently intubated and sedated
with propofol and midazolam and fentanyl boluses. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of presumed
bronchospasm.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 125 132/76, RR 21, O2
95% on PSV 8/5 with 50%FiO2. Reveiw of systems was unable to be
obtained as patient was intubated and sedated.


Past Medical History:
1. Asthma, multiple prior intubations
2. Tracheobronchomalacia, diagnosed on CT trachea [**2119-6-7**]
3. Possible inflammatory lung process such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. (Had open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was reviewed

by [**Hospital1 18**] pathologists and showed undefined inflammatory process
superimposed on normal lung,and poorly formed granulomas that
seemed to be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis).
Most recent CT trachea showed no evidence of hypersensitity
pneumonitis.
4. History of positive PPD (the patient reports that it was
borderline degree of induration for many years and has not
received INH. She states the reason for no INH was a clear CXR
5. PCOS
6. Postpartum depression requiring psychiatric hospitalization
7. Multiple miscarriages requiring D and C
8. Status post multiple colposcopies and cervical LEEP procedure

9. Meningitis in [**2118-12-11**]
10. Status post tonsillectomy


Social History:
The patient is divorced and lives in a home with her 3 children.
Works as a business analyst. Occasional etoh. Prior 1-1/2 pack
per day smoking for 15 years, quit in [**2106**]. High likelihood of
asbestos exposure according to the patient as she was a
volunteer firefighter in the past. History of positive PPD. Has
a dog, cat, a lizard and a hamster at home.


Family History:
Father alcoholic. [**Name2 (NI) **] family history of lung disease or DVTs

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92011**] is a 39 year old woman with a significant PMH of TBM,
asthma and presumed hypersensitivity pneumonitis requiring
multiple past intubations, who presents intubated from the GI
suite following bronchospasm following outpatient EGD procedure.

# Respiratory failure: Patient intubated in the setting of
intractable coughing and tachypnea following EGD. Etiology
likely vocal cord dysfunction vs. possible post procedure
bronchospasm complicated by severe TBM.  Wheezing
post-intubation has improved which goes against bronchospasm.
Pt extubated the same day as being intubated given immediate
improvement after intubation; consistent with a diagnosis of
vocal cord dysfunction rather than severe bronhospasm.  S/p
extubation, patient was continually coughing, which was believed
to be [**1-12**] to intermittent vocal cord dysfunction.  Her coughing
improved with ativan.

# Asthma: Home regimen includes symbicort, ciclenoside,
terbuliline, albuterol and ipratroprium. Patient also may have
some element of undlerlying inflammatory pulmonary disease such
as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, although this diagnosis is
unclear. Based on how quickly she improved once intubated,
asthma exacerbation seemed to be an unlikely cause.  Therefore,
she steroids were held.  Of note, before intubation pt reported
she has h/o steroid induced psychosis.  She was continued on her
home meds.

# TBM: Likely exacerbating respiratory symptoms.  Patient is
planned for tracheal stent placement in the future.  Will
consult IP to assess whether this should be done sooner.
.
# Depression: continue home citalopram

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92011**],

You were admitted to the ICU and required intubation after
having breathing difficulties. We think that this is likely due
to problems with your vocal cords rather than your asthma since
it improved so quickly.

You should discuss your medications with your physicians at the
next visit. In particular, it is likely that methotrexate and
terbutaline can be tapered or stopped.
