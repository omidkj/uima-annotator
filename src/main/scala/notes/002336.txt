initiated by a bystander, continued for about 10 minutes. EMS
arrived found him in asystole and epix5 /atropinex2 were
administered, he went into a wide complex rhythm, administered
amiodarone 50mg bolus at 1626 then 0.5mg/hr , rhythm progressed
to afib/then sinus tachycardia, in addition he was on a dopamine
IV infusion at 10mg weaned to 5mg. He was given 40mg of lasix
and started on a heparin drip.
Initial VS in ED was 98 101 99/24 13 97, bagged, WBC
17/11.1/33.9/197, K 5.6, glucose 311, intubated AC 700x12 100%
abg 7.03/80/100/21 CXR with CHF pulmonary edema. CK 128 MB 6
Trop I 0.04. PT 13.6 PTT 26.2, INR 1.2 Tox screen negative.
His EKG had ST depression in the anterior/lateral leads. His
initial labs was with hyperkalemia at 5.6 and he was given
insulin/D50. He was intubated for airway protection and his
first ABG was 7.03/80/100/21, a repeat was 7.25/52/89.

On arrival to CCU, he is unresponsive to vigorous sternal rub,
only response that can be elicited is a startle response to
forehead tapping, no posturing, [**Location (un) 2611**] 3.

On Hx from daughter, patient requires home o2 at night, does not
ambulate, uses wheelchair, baseline can only ambulate a few
feet. Recent hospitalizations to [**Hospital1 **] in [**Month (only) **]/06, and B/W [**2-4**]
years ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 YO M with extensive past medical history presenting s/p
witnessed pulseless arrest with questionable bystandard CPR.
His cardiac enzymes were positive and it is possible that his
arrest was secondary to myocardial infarction; or equally
possible that he had a primary arrhthmic event.  Upon arrival to
the CCU he had signs of very severe neurologic injury with GSC
of [**3-5**] off of sedation with absolutely no response to pain, no
gag reflex, abnormal doll's eyes, no corneal reflex.  His only
sign of brainstem function were sluggish pupil response.  He was
intubated for airway protection; neurology was consulted.  He
was also acidotic/hyperkalemic which was treated with dextrose,
insulin, bicarbonate, and kayexalate to good effect.  He was
mechanically ventilated on assist control mode.  At the
suggestion of Neurology his sedation was weaned to off and his
neurologic status was re-evaluated with no clinical change.  He
demonstrated significant autonomic with periods of severe
hypertension/tachycardia with alternating hypotension.  He also
had [**Location (un) **] respirations with hyperventilation leading to a
primary respiratory alkalosis.  At this point his family
expressed his (and their wishes) to ony pursue aggressive
measures if he was sure to have a good neurologic outcome.
Because of his very poor neurologic prognosis the family met
with the primary team and the neurology attending, discussed the
case in detail and all aggreed that they wanted to withdraw
care.  He was extubated at 6:55pm on [**2141-8-6**] and he died of
respiratory failure a few minutes later.  The family denied
autopsy.
