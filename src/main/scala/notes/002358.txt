Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Garbled speech, Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87838**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of several
strokes, DM, CAD, and possible pAFib not on coumadin who
developed garbled speech and right sided weakness at her
[**Hospital3 **] facility.
.
She was in her usual state of health until she rang the call
button at her [**Hospital3 **] stating she was feeling poorly.
When help arrived, she was confused and unable to speak.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial VS were 102.4 97 176/95 23 100%
BS 147. Code stroke was called. She was noted to have right
sided weakness. Although she was initially aphasic, she was
later described as dysarthric during her time in the ED. Stat
MRI showed no diffusion abnormalities, so no tPA was given. The
stroke team felt that her symptoms were most likely due to
recrudescence in the setting of infection vs seizure activity at
her old stroke site. Of note, she received a dose of ativan
while the ED team was attempting to obtain an LP but they were
unable to get the LP because of intense rigors.
.
She received vancomycin and ceftriaxone. She had an episode of
brown bilious emesis for which she was given 4mg zofran; there
was concern for aspiration during the MRI ([**Name8 (MD) **] RN report, the
MRI was stopped early as she became cyanotic and was vomiting).
A total of 1300cc of IV fluids were given.
.
These symptoms were identical to her stroke in 5/[**2152**]. As
described in the excellent Neuro consult note:
"Of note, she also presented as a CODE STROKE to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2153-4-19**]
with similar symptoms of garbled speech, right sided weakness,
and left gaze preference. Her NIHSS was 17. Temp was 102 on
admission, but blood and urine culture showed no growth. CTP
showed area of abnormal perfusion in the left posterior cerebral

artery distribution with no definite vascular stenosis
identified
and no CT evidence of completed infarction. MRI/MRA showed no
evidence of acute ischemia or infarction in the left MCA
territory, major intracranial vessels including left MCA appear

patent on MRA. EEG showed intermittent brief bursts of moderate

amplitude mixed theta and delta frequency slowing in a
generalized distribution, no epileptiform features. She was seen

by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] in follow up on [**2153-6-26**], and was found to
have no residual limb weakness or numbness, but minor residual
language impairments."

[**9-4**] MRA NECK W/CONTRAST:
1. Carotid arteries appear normal.
2. The vertebral artery origins are not visualized on the right
and poorly
visualized on the left, which may be related to technical
limitations. The
remainder of the vertebral arteries are patent. However, a
high-grade stenosis at the right vertebral artery origin and a
mild stenosis at the left vertebral artery origin cannot be
excluded.

[**9-3**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-2**], there is little
overall
change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with diffuse
interstitial pattern that could reflect vascular congestion,
congestive
failure, or both. The interstitial changes would be consistent
with the
apparent patient history of scleroderma. Specifically, no acute
focal pneumonia.

[**9-3**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The rig
