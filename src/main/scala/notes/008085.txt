Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On admission, the patient is an
86[**Hospital 4622**] nursing home resident who reports recent fevers
and coughs productive of white sputum as well as right sided
chest pain.  She developed dyspnea saying that her breathing
is all right.  She denied chest pain and abdominal pain.  At
her nursing home, she was diagnosed with pneumonia, was given
Zithromax on [**6-26**], initially 500 per day, then 250 mg
thereafter.  Yesterday she continued to spike fevers.  She
was given ceftriaxone 1 gm.  Her fevers curtailed throughout
the day.  Her blood pressure was recorded to be 84/40 and was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further evaluation.  At [**Hospital3 **], she was given fluid to
support her blood pressure.  Her cultures were drawn and was
given levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed pneumonia.  The
Medical Intensive Care Unit was called to evaluate the
patient for low blood pressure and after 4 liters of fluid,
her blood pressures did not significantly improve.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  On admission, her temperature was 101.8??????.  Her
heart rate was 103.  Her blood pressure was measured on the
left and noted to be systolic pressures 70s to 80s in the
left arm and systolically 90s to 100s in her right arm with a
diastolic ranging in the 40s.
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Alert, pleasant, tachypneic with a
respiratory rate of 30, mentating well, no accessory muscle
use.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  He has anicteric sclera,
moist mucous membranes.  Her oropharynx is clear.
THORAX:  She had bibasilar rales with bibasilar egophony.
CARDIAC:  She had a radial pulse on the left side, but was
diminished on the right, S1, S2 tachypneic with no gallops
appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  She had multiple flexion contractures with
subluxations.  No edema, warm extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, pupils equal, speech fluent.

ADMISSION LABS:  Her sodium was 3.4.  Her initial potassium
was 6.0.  The blood sample was hemolyzed, re-tested and found
to be 3.6.  Her chloride was 100, bicarbonate 21, BUN 26,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 105.  White blood cell count was
17.7, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35.8, platelets 276.  The
differential was 88 neutrophils, 6 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 1
monocyte.  Her urinalysis specific gravity is 1.025 with
small leukocyte esterase, large blood, on nitrites, 30
protein, no glucose, negative for ketones, greater than 50
red blood cells, 21 to 50 white blood cells with moderate
bacteria with 3 to 5 bacteria seen per field.  Her chest
x-ray showed bilateral lobar opacities with air bronchograms
on the right.  Her electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia,
no ischemic ST-T changes.

IMPRESSION:  An 86-year-old with fever, cough, chest x-ray
with lower lobe infiltrates started on azithromycin and
ceftriaxone at nursing home over the last one to two days for
pneumonia.  Exam and chest x-ray consistent with a pneumonia,
possible aspiration pneumonia, given lower lobe infiltrates
versus community nursing home acquired pneumonia.  Patient
with tachycardia and tenuous blood pressures.  She is
mentation, has no anion gap.  Urine output is poor.  She does
not want mechanical ventilation or CPR due to form.  She
would accept pressors to support her.  She likely sepsis
secondary to underlying pneumonia as the cause of her low
blood pressures and poor urine output.  At the time, the
patient was given intravenous antibiotics for pneumonia,
Levaquin and clindamycin, sputum cultures drawn, ............
drawn, nebulizer given.  O2 saturations were followed.  As
far as her blood pressure, blood sugar mean arterial pressure
is in the high 50s, low 60s.  The patient received multiple
liters of fluid with poor urine output suggestive of renal
hypoperfusion.  She was aggressively treated with intravenous
fluids and was carefully monitored for a possibility of need
for pressors and patient developed systolic blood pressures
in the 70s, mean arterial pressure of 49 and was given
Neo-Synephrine.

The patient's PT/PTT were closely followed and the patient
was started on appropriate prophylactic treatment of
subcutaneous heparin and Protonix.  Overnight, the patient's
blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids and was off
Neo-Synephrine.  Her urine output as improving.  The patient
remained tachycardic with low voltage on electrocardiogram
and an echocardiogram was performed to rule out effusion.
That echocardiogram was negative for effusion.  The patient
was maintaining adequate oxygenation and was then transferred
to the floor.

At this time, the patient maintained an adequate blood
pressure of 121/60, but was still tachycardic with a pulse of
120 and was, at times, also tachypneic.  Electrocardiogram at
this time showed sinus tachycardia as well as T-waves.  Her
chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with small
pleural effusions and interstitial pulmonary edema.  She was
continued on levofloxacin.  Flagyl was started, although
discontinued a day later because the patient is edentulous.
It was found Flagyl was not providing any needed coverage.
At 6:25 in the morning, the night resident was called, as the
patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 124 and a
respiratory rate of 40.  At the time, the patient denied
shortness of breath, chest pain or any type of distress.  On
exam, she is found to have no jugular venous distention with
bilateral rales.  Chest x-ray was ordered with no significant
changes from previous x-ray and was consistent with bibasilar
consolidations with effusion.  Lasix 20 mg intravenous was
given later that morning.

The patient continued to remain tachycardic with a pulse of
112 on [**6-29**] and was called that evening.  The patient
remained tachypneic and tachycardic throughout the day,
though her tachypnea was markedly improved as her respiratory
rate was down to 24.  Early in the morning on [**6-30**], the
overnight resident was called again to see the patient for
tachypnea.  Again, the patient denied any shortness of
breath, chest pain or abdominal pain.  Her respiratory rate
was 36 at the time and she is resting comfortably.  Another
repeat chest x-ray was done to evaluate for failure; 20 mg of
Lasix was given intravenous.  The patient's findings was
............. the day with Lasix with a high urine output and
the patient's condition continued to improve throughout [**6-30**].

On [**7-1**], early in the evening, the resident was called
to see the patient again for low urine output.  She put out
60 cc of urine over the nighttime shift and was started on
gentle hydration to attempt to improve output so that
intravenous fluid was discontinued thereafter and the patient
was given another 20 mg of Lasix with improved urine.  The
patient also spiked a temperature to 101.6?????? that evening and
her urinalysis, UC and blood culture were drawn.  The urine
culture and blood culture with no growth to date at this time
and the urinalysis was negative for nitrites, glucose,
ketones, leukocyte esterase and no microbes seen.

Secondary sources of infection were considered with the
resolving pneumonia.  The patient was inspected for any
decubiti ulcers and liver function tests were drawn on the
morning of [**7-2**] to see if the gallbladder was present as a
source of infection.  The patient's condition continued to
improve and we decreased her O2 supplementation and is
preparing to be discharged this
