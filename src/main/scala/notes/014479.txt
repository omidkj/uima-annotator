History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical
spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7
discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and
leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an
infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco
on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day
course on [**2-28**]. He initially did well after discharge, but for
the past 5-6 weeks he has been complaining of neck pain and
restricted movement. His symptoms have worsened over the past ~
10 days, with difficulty swallowing, decreased PO intake, rigors
and possibly fevers. On [**4-13**] his symptoms worsened further, with
[**10-13**] pain and inability to move his right side. He was referred
to the emergency room early in the morning on [**4-14**] where an MRI
revealed an epidural abscess from C2-C4, with spinal cord
compression.

upper and right lower extremity, full on left. Unable to test
for sensory deficits, gait not tested.
PSYCH: Mumbles, inappropriate affect


Pertinent Results:
[**2192-4-14**] ECG: Baseline artifact. Rhythm is probably an ectopic
atrial rhythm, although this cannot be confirmed on the basis of
this study. Otherwise, normal tracing. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2192-2-14**] poor R wave progression is not seen on the
current tracing.
.
[**2192-4-14**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process. If there is
further clinical concern for acute stroke, an MR is more
sensitive.
.
[**2192-4-14**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2192-4-14**] MR [**First Name (Titles) 11598**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1093**]: 1. Fluid collection in the epidural
space from C2 to C4 level with compression of the spinal cord.
The fluid collection could represent an epidural abscess or
hematoma. Contrast gadolinium-enhanced MRI can help for further
assessment. 2. Spinal cord edema at C2 level. 3. Prevertebral
soft tissue swelling, which could be due to combination of
abscess or hematoma or inflammatory changes. Again,
contrast-enhanced MRI can help for further assessment. 4. Low
signal is identified on T1-weighted images in the T1 vertebra
which could be due to marrow edema.
.
[**2192-4-14**] Spine film: 1) Status post laminectomy, with marked
prominence of soft tissues both anterior and posterior to the
cervical spine, with small locules of air as described. 2)
Alignment from C1 through C6 is preserved, without listhesis. 3)
The cortical surfaces of the C4, C5, and C6 levels are not well
demonstrated in part this likely relates to degenerative
changes. However, review of prior studies suggests that there
has been prior instrumentation and intervertebral fusion devices
at these levels and this may represent residua from that.
Possibility of superimposed osteolysis due to infection cannot
be excluded.
.
[**2192-4-15**] Tissue: Intervertebral disc, C3-C4, excision:
Fibrocartilage and bone with acute inflammation and fibrin,
consistent with abscess formation.
.
[**2192-4-15**] CXR: ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above the carina. There is
mild cardiomegaly. Aside from atelectasis in the right base the
lungs are clear. There is pneumothorax. Small right pleural
effusion is unchanged.
.
[**2192-4-15**] C-spine MRI: Progression of abnormality since the
cervical spine MR of [**2192-4-14**]. Markedly increased spinal cord
edema. Enlarged anterior epidural fluid collection. Increased
abnormal signal in the C7-T1 intervertebral disc, worrisome for
discitis. Extensive epidural and leptomeningeal enhancement
compatible with epidural abscess as well as meningitis.
.
[**2192-4-16**] CXR: Small left pleural effusion and pulmonary and
mediastinal
vascular congestion suggest volume overload and/or cardiac
decompensation,
increased since [**4-15**]. ET tube in standard placement. No
pneumothorax.
Heart size normal, unchanged. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10752**] paged to report
these findings at the time of dictation.
.
[**2192-4-16**] Left upper extremity ultrasound: No left upper extremity
DVT.
.
[**2192-4-17**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**4-16**], the hemidiaphragm
on the left is more sharply seen, suggesting some decrease in
the left pleural effusion.  However, some of this difference may
reflect the semi-erect position of the patient. Again, there is
no evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Endotracheal tube remains
in place.
.
[**2192-4-18**] CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. New
opacification of the ethmoidal sinus and sphenoid sinuses and
decreased opacification of the mastoid air cells. Correlate
clinically. This may relate to intubation.
.
[**2192-4-18**] CT C-spine: 1. Extensive post-surgical changes as
described above with no findings to suggest hardware failure
status post recent corpectomy with C3-C5 anterior fusion. 2.
Marked continued swelling involving the
retropharyngeal/prevertebral soft tissues. Air pocket with
simple-appearing fluid collection noted adjacent to the right
hyoid, also likely postoperative. 3. Poor visualization of
remaining epidural phlegmon/fluid collection which is better
depicted on recently performed [**2192-4-17**], C-spine MRI.
.
[**2192-4-18**] CT L-spine: 1. No definite findings of infection
identified. Equivocal small epidural
