Brief Hospital Course:
1.  COPD/Respiratory failure - Pt was restarted on prednisone
and azithromycin (the latter for anti-inflammatory properties,
not for antibiotic properties).  Initial concern was for simply
progression of disease, as pt has severe COPD.  Pt was continued
on his nebs prn, which was increased to about q2hours.  He
continued to have pursed lips breathing and was in mild
respiratory distress.  An ABG the day after admission was not
terribly concerning; however, in the next day, pt declined
dramatically with severe CO2 retention.  Pt was therefore
intubated for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and
transferred to the intensive care unit. Pt was continued to be
treated for COPD flare with nebs and steroid taper. Atrovent was
switched to spiriva. Steroids were increased back to IV on
several occasions for increased respiratory distress. Pt was
treated for pneumonia with vanco/oxacillin, levofloxacin,
flagyl. CXR showed consolidation in right lung consistent with
pneumonia. Pt was weaned off the ventilator and extubated
([**1-8**]). He remained extubated for several days during which he
continued to be in mild respiratory distress requiring high
amounts of oxygen. Code status was addressed several times by
the team as well as the pt's PCP and he stated that he wished to
be re-intubated and trached if necessary. Pt then decided he
didn't want to be trached but would still want to be
re-intubated, but only for a short period of time. Pt then
developed acute respiratory distress requiring re-intubation
([**1-12**]). ABG was unremarkable. Pt was intubated for several days
without any clinical improvement. CXR showed worsening
consolidation in the right lung, consistent with evolving
pneumonia on broad spectrum antibiotics. Well-circumscribed
masses were seen in the RLL c/w hemorrhage within bullae vs.
amiodarone lung toxicity. Given pt's severe cardio-pulmonary
disease processes and little hope for being extubated
successfully a family meeting was held and a decision was made
to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**]. The pt was extubated and expired within a
few hours.
.
2.  CV:
a. Ischemia - On the floor the pt was continued on his home
regimen of aspirin, beta blocker, statin, Plavix, and nitrates.
He has stable chest pain, and continued to have mild chest pain
while in the hospital.  His outpatient cardiologist recommended
to continue medical management, and to decrease his lipitor as
is also on azithromycin, as well as to decrease the Toprol XL in
the setting of decompensated COPD.  Pt developed chest pain in
the setting of respiratory failure and AF and the pt was found
to have a NSTEMI. Pt was started on a heparin drip for his ACS
and AF. Cardiology was consulted who recommended cardiac cath
once pt was stable from a respiratory standpoint and/or had
improved mental status.  Pt was continued on asa, statin,
plavix, calcium-channel blocker, nitrates. Pt continued to have
intermittent chest pain resolved with nitrates, rate-related
ischemia, and recurrent episodes NSTEMI. Pt was never stable
enough for cardiac cath.
.
b. Rhythm: Pt went into AF in the setting of respiratory
failure. Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is new onset AF. Pt was started on
heparin for anticoagulation. Pt was continued on beta-blocker
and loaded on amiodarone for rate control. Diltiazem was added
for additional rate control. Beta-blocker was then discontinued
because of its potential effects of bronchospasm. Pt remained in
AF.
.
c. pump: Echo was performed prior to transfer to CCU showed
normal EF. Pt was continued on beta blocker and/or CCB for
control of hypertension. Pt was diuresed for volume overload.
.
3. ID: Pt was treated for pneumonia (right consolidation) with
vanco, levo, flagyl. Pt grew out MSSA in sputum cx. Vanco was
switched to oxacillin, then switched back with development of
fever. During the last 5 days of hospitalization, pt was noted
to have significant leukocytosis to 40s with worsening
hemodynamics requiring pressor, concerning for sepsis. Pt was
found to be positive for C diff with dilated colon on CT. Pt was
already on po flagyl for the past several weeks; he was started
on po vanco and IV flagyl. Pt remained septic on pressors and
broad spectrum abx until date of expiration.
.
4. Renal/Electrolyes: Pt developed acute renal failure and
rapidly progressive lactic acidosis during his last 2 days.
.
5. Anemia: Pt was noted to be anemic requiring intermittent
transfusions, likely secondary bleeding secondary to heparin. He
had a large right abdominal subcutaneous bleed in the area of
insulin shots. He pulled out his A-line on a few occasions with
significant blood loss. He was found to have a left iliacus
bleed on CT. He then developed hematuria. Heparin was
discontinued near the end of the hospitalization.
