Mr. [**Known lastname 76780**] is a 34 YOM who presented for colostomy takedown after
initially receiving a colostomy in [**1-/2198**] secondary to
fournier's gangrene.  Colostomy reversal preformed with out
complications.  On POD 1 patient was triggered for hypotension
and was treated with fluid boluses.  Patient then developed some
anxiety and agitation and received a psychiatric consult.  On
POD 3 patient was triggered for tachypnea and was initially
placed on NRB.  He continued to desat to 70s and was intubated
and transferred to ICU where it was presumed Mr. [**Known lastname 76780**] had a PE.
 Unfortunately given his IV contrast allergy and his size, team
was unable to obtain radiographic evidence.  He was then placed
on a Heparin drip.  His condition improved, he was extubated and
started on a course of Coumadin for anticoagulation.  On POD 11
Patient became culture positive for Coag+ S. Aureus and was
