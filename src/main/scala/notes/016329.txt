[**8-21**]- flexible bronchoscopy
[**8-23**]-rigid bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old woman
who had had a previous thyroidectomy and tracheostomy for
tracheal stenosis. She was transferred from [**Hospital6 42638**] last night with the question of an obstructing
lesion at the end of her tracheostomy tube.


Past Medical History:
1. thyroid cancer dx in [**3-/2173**]- Papillary cancer with positive
nodes

found unresponsive at home on [**2173-4-6**]. Prior to this,
the
patient had neck swelling for 2 days which occurred in
conjunction with administration of Actos for newly diagnosed
diabetes. Laryngoscopy was performed revealing airway edema.
A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway
compression. TSH was elevated at 7.13. Path showed the patient

invasion and nodal involvement, status post rigid
bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status
post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post
bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
placement on [**2173-5-3**].
2. s/p trach for tracheal stenosis
3. Acinetobacter in sputum [**4-18**], MDR
4. Pansensitive enterococcus in urine [**4-12**]
5. Diastolic dysfcn, echo [**4-12**], EF >75%

RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2173-8-25**] 9:37 AM
Reason: eval for swallowing efficiency
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old woman with s/p tracheostomy, s/p thryoidectomy. now
w/ fair video swallow- needs video
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for swallowing efficiency
INDICATIONS: 69-year-old woman status post tracheostomy and
thyroidectomy with bronchomalacia, with swallowing difficulty.

TECHNIQUE: Videotaped oropharyngeal swallowing study.

FINDINGS: The study was performed in conjunction with the speech
and swallow pathologist. Various consistencies of barium were
administered orally. With all consistencies, the patient showed
limited laryngeal elevation and a lack of epiglottic deflection.
There was some spill-over with all consistencies as well,
including delayed aspiration of residue, to a trace to mild
extent, of both thin liquids and pudding. Although spontaneous
cough was present, clearance was ineffective. Because of
aspiration, the study was discontinued, suctioning performed via
the tracheostomy tube by the Radiology nursing staff. The oxygen
saturation was checked at the end of the study, found to be 98%.

IMPRESSION: Trace-to-mild aspiration with multiple
consistencies, with ineffective cough clearance. Please see the
report of the speech and swallow pathologist for further
details.

DEFERRED PASSY MUIR VALVE CONSULT

Thank you for referring this 69 y/o Cambodian speaking female
with recent h/o thyroid goiter, thyroidectomy, trach and PEG
placement. Pt was admitted to OSH with worsening SOB and
increased upper airway secretions, thought to have URI. Pt was
transferred here on [**2173-8-20**] for further management.  PMH
includes thyroid CA, tracheal stenosis with trach, UTI, PNA, DM,
HTN, possible hypoxic brain injury, CVA, asthma, B-cell lymphoma
s/p chemo, hiatal hernia.

Pt was seen by our service during the previous admission for a
PMV and swallow evaluation. Pt was unable to tolerate placement
of the Passy Muir Valve due to severe upper airway obstruction
which prohibited her from being able to exhale adequately via
the
upper airway (nose and mouth) around the tracheostomy tube. With
regards to swallowing, the pt had FEES exam completed on [**2173-5-31**]
that revealed "moderate pharyngeal dysphagia at with overt
aspiration of secretions, thin and nectar thick liquids. While
aspiration of puree material could not be confirmed due to
limited appreciated of the trachea and vocal cords, there was
frank penetration of purees, indicative of risk for aspiration
with this consistency as well. The pt's
