At time of d/c:  patient complained of some abdominal discomfort
a.m. of d/c and the KUB was done which on preliminary read
showed no acute process.  A portable cxray showed pleural
effusions (as before).


Brief Hospital Course:
86M with COPD on home O2, IDDM, Afib on coumadin, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, initially admitted to Vascular Surgery service
for hemoperitoneum and consideration of surgery.  Pt remained
hemodynamically stable and hemoperitoneum was thought to be most
likely secondary to leaking bowel hematoma (seen on CT scan) and
less likely to be from AAA.  Given the high risk for surgical
repair of AAA, pt & family decided against any attempt at repair
of AAA. Pt was transferred to Medicine service for management of
multiple medical problems, including Afib with intermittently
rapid ventricular rate. During hospitalization, pt found to be
in clinical heart failure (echo revealed slightly low EF) and
had marginal blood pressures, precluding aggressive diuresis.
Pt's pulmonary status remained poor but at baseline. Pt's renal
function remained poor but close to baseline. At a family
meeting on [**4-16**], pt was made DNR/I with plan to discharge
patient to facility closer to family's home.

#1 AFIB/CHF
In [**Name (NI) 10115**] pt. entered into AF w/RVR and was successfully
controlled with diltiazem and a beta-blocker. He was transferred
to the medical service where he was maintained on metoprolol and
put on telemetry. We continued to hold his Coumadin due to his
recent INR >12 and internal bleeding from a leaking AAA vs. from
infarcted small bowel vs. from bowel wall hematoma. Discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] from vascular surgery; while he felt that the
intraperitoneal bleeding was likely secondary to bowel wall
rather than a leaking AAA, the coumadin was held ultimately on
high fall risk.

Atrial fibrillation was intially controlled with IV lopressor,
then po Toprol XL once he was tolerating po meds.  Several
episodes of a. fib with rvr throughout hospital course, which
was controlled with prn IV lopressor.  He was also started on
digoxin 0.125 qD.

Concerning his CHF, he had a TTE while in house, showing a
hypokinetic LV with EF of 35%.  His volume status was tenuous at
times. Diuresis was held with his relative intravascular volume
depletion and hypotension - this resolved with NS fluid boluses.
He remained grossly total body volume overloaded, though.
- He was continued on toprol xl; Ace-I was attempted, but was
precluded by hypotension.  Once blood pressure was normalized
patient was started on hydralazine for afterload reduction (at
this time patient was in renal failure).
- Patient was gently diuresed (with low-dose lasix) as needed
for fluid overload, as his blood pressure would tolerate.  He
should get low dose lasix periodically to help with diuresis as
renal function will allow.

#2 HEMOPERITONEUM/AAA/ABDOMINAL PAIN

Pt. initially presented to an OSH w/complaints of abdominal
pain/pressure in his LLQ and N/V. There was also a report that
he had fallen at home shortly before presentation. As noted in
HPI, pt. was found to have hemoperitoneum, thickened small
bowel, and INR of 13, prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. In [**Name (NI) 10115**] pt.
received 2 bags of FFP and 1 unit of pRBC's. After transfer to
medical service for his afib, Coumadin and ASA were held. 1 u of
pRBC's was given due to dropping HCt. HCt then stabilized for
remainder of his course.

Also, pt. had swallow evaluation which he failed and so was made
NPO. However, through discussion w/pt. and his family it was
determined that he had been eating PO and taking meds PO at home
for a long time so NPO order was removed and pt. was switched to
PO meds, which he tolerated along with soft solids.

It became clear that his po intake was totally inadequate; after
discussion/consent from family, a PEG tube was placed, and he
started on tube feeding.

Completed 2 week empiric course of levo/flagyl for small bowel
thickening/hemoperitoneum.

#3 CRI (diabetic vs hypertensive)
As noted in HPI, initial creatinine of 3.4 was judged to be from
hypovolemia and not from pathology a/w pt's AAA. He was hydrated
w/IV fluid and creatinine improved to 1.7, which is thought to
be near his baseline. His creatinine increased to 2.5 on [**4-17**]
and then 2.4 on day of discharge.  This was thought to be from
intravascular volume depletion since fena<1 and bun was
increasing as well.  However, patient was total body overloaded
with fluids with 2+ pitting edema in LE.  Patient was started on
hydral for afterload reduction with good result.  The thought is
to get the patient to be euvolemic and then diurese off all his
extravascular fluid.

#4 COPD
This was managed adequately with albuterol,
fluticasone-salmeterol, and ipratropium and pt. maintained O2
sat >94% on low flow O2 throughout his stay.

#5 MRSA
Nasal swab, Urine cultures, and blood cultures grew out MRSA,
which delayed plans for d/c to rehab facility. He was treated
with vancomycin IV, then changed over
to po linezolid for a po alternative for MRSA coverage.  Blood
cultures remained no growth throughout. In total, had 8 days of
coverage (vanco
