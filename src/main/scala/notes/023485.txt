History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo man with PMH of tobacco use, ?hyperlipidemia,
does not see doctor regularly, initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]
with respiratory symptoms today AM, treated for COPD, then found
to have new LBBB and + troponin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.  Per notes and d/w family, patient was
in his USOH until 3 weeks prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 **], when he began to experience upper respiratory symptoms
described as cough, productive of yellow-colored sputum, no
blood, denied fevers, SOB initially.  Then night PTA, pt c/o
some associated SOB with his cough.  Then morning of admission,
pt was at grocery store and returned home b/c he "just wasn't
feeling well", per his wife had increased SOB, so called
ambulance and went to [**Hospital3 **].  Of note, per patient's
wife, she states that the patient had been experiencing L
shoulder pain with exertion, such as raking the leaves, and that
it would resolve with rest after about 10 minutes.  Denies LE
edema, orthopnea, PND, snoring.
At [**Hospital3 **], pt with temp=99.9, HR=123, BP=153/81, O2 at
94% on 100% O2.  His WBC=8.7, Hct=48.3, AG=7, Glucose=261,
BNP=260, ABG=7.36/47/65 on 4L O2.  CXR demonstrated bilateral
increased interstitial markings c/w CHF vs diffuse infiltrate.
He was treated for COPD exacerbation with combivent neb x 1,
solumedrol 125mg IV x 1, albuterol neb x 1.  Later, patient was
noted to have trop I elevation to 0.53 and ?new LBBB on EKG and
therefore was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

During transfer, patient developed worsening respiratory
distress and on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED was intubated for presumed
flash pulmonary edema prior to transfer to cath lab for urgent
PCI.
In cath lab, pt was found to have 50% mid and proximal LAD
disease, subtotal occlusion of L Cx from origin to mid vessel w/
severe disease extending into LPDA and OM2, slow flow in LPDA,
80% ostial/proximal OM1 lesion, 80% proximal RCA lesion (RCA
noted to be small, non-dominant).  Patient had 3 x overlapping
Cypher stents place in L Cx from proximal to mid, LPDA and OM2.
Cardiac cath course was c/b persistent hypotension and pt was
started on dopamine gtt and dobutamine gtt, and had IABP placed
for presumed cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **].  Intra-cath ECHO prelim
demonstrates good LV fxn (EF>55%), no WMA (although could not
exclude inferlateral hypokinesis).  Hemodynamics were measured
and demonstrated C.O.=6.1, C.I.=3.0, PCWP=17, RA=14, PA=43/19,
RV=43/12.

100% FiO2, prior to wean)

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is a 65 yo man with PMH
hypercholesteromia, presented to [**Hospital1 **] with c/o URI and SOB,
found to have [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], en route developed
respiratory distress requiring intubation, now in [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Respiratory:  Patient intubated, initially requiring fairly
high FiO2.  Initially, as above, though [**2-2**] COPD, then thought
[**2-2**] CHF, but due to clinical picture above, now think likely [**2-2**]
infection, as pt appeared w/ septic picture (as above).  Pt
successfully extubated on [**2147-3-20**], but had some post-extubation
respiratory distress, HTN, tachycardia.  HTN and tachycardia
treated with nitro gtt and lopressor PRN.  Pt placed on bi-pap
temporarily.  Had increased labored breathing on [**3-22**] therefore
re-intubated.  Also thoracentesis [**3-22**] with 1.5L negative,
transudative fluid.  Patient re-extubated [**3-25**] without
complication.  Completed 10d course of Vanc/Zosyn for nosocomial
pna.  Weaned to room air with adequate ambulatory saturations.
He was continued on a long steroid taper for his presumed COPD
flare with atrovent MDI's prn.  He was started on standing lasix
for diastolic heart failure and diuresed well.  This dose may
need to be adjusted as an outpatient.

# Anemia: Patient w/ elevated Hct on initial presentation to
54.5, thought hemoconcentrated from dehydration.  Since that
time, trended downward, initially thought secondary to IVF
rehydration.  Was stable [**3-18**] in low 30's.  Then [**3-19**] AM dropped
from 31 -> 24.  Pt received 3 units pRBC on [**3-19**]//[**3-20**], with Hct
24 -> 30.1.  Hemolysis labs (prior to tfn) negative.  Hct
continued to trend down.  CT scan, neg for RP bleed.  EGD by GI
on [**3-24**] - healed gastric ulcers (not source of bleeding), H.
pylori negative.  Had epistaxis, ENT repacked nasal cavity on
[**3-20**], no recurrence since then.  Hematocrit remained stable at
time of discharge.  He will need colonoscopy as an outpatient.

# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  As outpt prior to presentation, reports ? anginal
sxs w/ exertional L shoulder pain - did not seek medical
attention.  Then, after presentation to [**Hospital1 **] for URI/SOB,
patient r/i for NSTEMI with + Trop 0.53 at OSH, on presentation
here, CK=188, MB=28, Index=14.9, Trop=0.3.  Intra cath, pt found
to have diffuse disease with LAD lesion (50%), L cx/LPDA/OM2
lesions, OM1 lesion, RCA lesion, s/p 3 x stent to L Cx/LPDA/OM2.
 Initially thought cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **] as pt hypotensive, but
hemodynamics measured (C.O.=6.1, C.I.=3.0, PCWP=17, RA=14,
PA=43/19, RV=43/12).  In setting of sepsis, would expect higher
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not fully compensated initially.  However, was able to be
weaned off balloon pump and pressors.  Cardiac enzymes trended
down.  He was continued on aspirin, plavix, toprol, lipitor, and
lisinopril as an outpatient.  Lisinopril and lopressor doses can
be increased and titrated as necessary as an outpatient.

B. Pump:  Patient w/ respiratory distress that brought him to
[**Hospital1 **].  Initially thought COPD.  Then acute resp decompensation
en route to [**Hospital1 18**], thought flash pulm edema.  CXR c/w edema vs
diffuse infiltrate.  However, intra-cath ECHO demonstrates good
LV systolic fxn (EF>55%).  Appeared intravascularly dry in
setting of possible sepsis with hypotension, but now BP
stabilizing.  Pleural effusion also c/w transudate/CHF.  He was
started on standing lasix and lisinopril for his presumed
diastolic dysfunction with good volume management.  His volume
