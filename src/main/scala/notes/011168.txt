Brief Hospital Course:
51yoM with h/o likely Crohns disease, PE tx'd from OSH with ?
intra-abd abscess.

Initial assessment:

1. Crohn's Disease/intra-abd abscess: will review films from OSH
with radiologists to determine if this finding is true
collection or just diseased bowel.
-- c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add Vancomycin for MRSA coverage and continue
Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage (needs ID approval in am)
-- c/s GI
-- c/s surgery/IR based on CT review (if abscess with need OR or
percutaneous drainage)
-- c/w outpt Crohns rx with 6MP, cyclosporine and prednisone,
will check cyclosporine levels
-- pain control with dilaudid
.
2. h/o PE:
- continue coumadin for now with goal INR [**1-14**], will need
transition to hep gtt if planned for surgical or IR
intervention.
.
3. Psych: ? depression
- continue Lexapro 20 qday (started here), Remeron qhs (per
patient's request as he was on this at OSH).
.
4. FEN: will hold TF and TPN for now and give NS bolus initially
then maintenance until abscess issue resolved.
-- will need nutrition c/s

5. PPX: PPI, coumadin

[**2134-11-8**]: Mr. [**Known lastname 3068**] was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy, small bowel resection x 2, and revision of his
ileostomy that was obstructed. For details of the operation
please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 10946**] operative report.
Post-operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname 3068**] had a very rough course. Pain
control remained difficult, and he continued to have persistent
nausea/emesis. TPN was continued during his entire postoperative
course. Multiple attempt were made to wean him from his
steroids. Each time he became febrile, tachycardic, and
hypotensive resulting in increase his steroids once again.

On POD 3 he was transferred to the ICU for a decreasing Hct and
sustained SVT. Once stabilized he was transferred back to the
floor the following day.

On POD 11, due to increasing RUQ pain, Mr. [**Known lastname 3068**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a RUQ
US that showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and a dilated
gallbladder. He [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] ERCP and stenet placement and slowly
improved.

On POD 16, Mr. [**Known lastname 3068**] had a long run of sustained SVT. Cardiology
was consulted and he was given adenosine which returned him to
sinus tachycardia. Cardiology will do an EP study once he is
healthier. He also spiked a fever on this day and a CT revealed
a medium sized collection inferior to the liver that was drained
by interventional radiology.

On POD 22, medicine was consulted to help with management of his
multiple medical problems. [**Name (NI) **] also had increasing RUQ pain once
again, and a HIDA scan was performed. This revealed a nonfilling
gallbaldder, and a RUQ US showed evidence of acute
cholecystitis. He was then taken to IR for a percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube.
The following day, Mr. [**Known lastname 3068**] became hypotensive and tachycardic
on the floor, once again requiring a transfer to the ICU. Bile
and blood cultures grew Enterococcus resistant to
ampicillin/PCN, sensitive to Linezolid and Chloramphenicol. The
patient was started on Linezolid IV, stabilized, and was
transferred back to the floor.

On POD 28, TPN was discontinued and tube feedings initiated. He
tolerated tube feeds well. He returned for ERCP and stent
replacement on POD 29. There were no complications from this
procedure. He continued to tolerate advancing tube feeds and
also increased his PO intake without problems. Calorie counts
were intitiated to assess his overall nutritional status. His
tube feeds were advanced to full strength Promote with fiber at
80cc/hr, which he will continue at home. By the time of
discharge, he was consistently taking in over 1000 calories by
mouth per day. He was maintained on Prednisone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] and will
slowly taper per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Given his long steroid course,
he was started on Bactrim q Mon/Wed/Fri for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. He
completed a 14 day course of Fluconazole, Linezolid, and 10 days
of Levofloxacin. His pain was well-controlled on oral
medications. Physical therapy worked with him and determined he
was fit to be discharged home with continued PT at home. He will
also receive VNA care for his drain, G tube, and tube feeds. He
will follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week, as well as
Gastroenterology.
