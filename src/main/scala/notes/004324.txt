CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed, transfer from [**Hospital3 4527**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
woman with a history of Sjogren syndrome with sicca syndrome
and also CREST with predominant Raynaud's, history of GI
bleed in the past thought secondary to gastritis and
arteriovenous malformations, status post left gastric and
left gastroduodenal artery embolizations in [**7-18**] and [**6-18**]
respectively.  She presented to [**Hospital3 4527**] in mid-[**2196-4-17**] with bright red blood per rectum and an hematocrit drop
from 34 to 28.  Her work-up at that time consisted of an
abdominal CT that revealed a pancolitis, increased
splenomegaly, and new ascites.  She was transfused two units
and discharged to rehabilitation on [**2196-5-7**], and then two to
three days prior to admission the patient noted dark stools
and on the morning prior to admission the patient had nausea,
decreased appetite, and an episode of vomiting bright red
blood.  She subsequently went to [**Hospital3 4527**] on [**2196-5-12**]
in the morning.  In the emergency room there her systolic was
in the 90s, hematocrit was 18, down from 28 on discharge.
Her INR was 1.7.  She had a left IJ triple-lumen catheter
placed, a right EJ peripheral line, and she subsequently
underwent EGD which revealed grade 0-1 esophageal varices,
portal gastropathy, gastric varices, but no active bleed,
although there were multiple blood clots in the stomach.  She
was treated with IV Protonix and was started an octreotide
drip.  She was transfused several units, which improved her
hematocrit from 18 to 28, and then on the morning of the 27th
around 1 AM she had a repeat episode of hematemesis, and
nasogastric lavage did not clear after two liters of saline.
An emergency EGD was performed that revealed a large varix at
the gastroesophageal junction, and there was blood in the
fundus.  Sclerotherapy was attempted, which resulted in an
initial blood spurt, however the bleeding subsequently
stabilized and overall during the resuscitative efforts, she
was given six units of red cells and four units of fresh
frozen plasma, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation of emerging TIPS.

Here in the intensive care unit the patient was comfortable
with no nausea or vomiting, no further hematemesis.  She
denied any abdominal pain.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Octreotide drip at 50 mcg per minute.  2.
Protonix 40 IV b.i.d.  3. Ativan p.r.n.  4. Atrovent,
albuterol nebulizers.  5. Vitamin K subcutaneous x 3.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa and penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location (un) 4528**] skilled
nursing facility.  Her son lives locally, daughter is on the
west coast.  Minimal alcohol history and remote tobacco.  The
patient has a son with [**Name (NI) 4522**] disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival her temperature was 98,
blood pressure 160/80, heart rate 80s, respiratory rate 16,
saturating 95% on two liters.  General:  She was a
well-appearing, elderly, frail woman.  HEENT:  She had
crusted blood in her oropharynx.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Sclerae anicteric.  Neck:  Supple, with
no lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Examination revealed decreased
breath sounds at the left base and bronchial breath sounds at
the right base.  Cardiac:  There was a [**12-24**]
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border without radiation.  Abdomen:  Benign, positive
bowel sounds, nontender.  There was no fluid wave.  No liver
edge was appreciated.  Extremities:  There was no peripheral
edema.  Skin:  There was no jaundice notable.  Neurologic:
The patient was alert and oriented x 3, otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On the morning of admission white count was
10.8, hematocrit 31.9, which had been up from 22 earlier in
the morning, platelet count 68, which was around her
baseline, SMA-7 was unremarkable.  BUN and creatinine were
normal.  INR was 1.3.  PT 14.1, PTT 32.8, fibrinogen was 161,
albumin 3.2.  ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase were within
normal limits.  Total bilirubin was 2.1.  Urinalysis on the
morning of arrival had been negative.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 4529**] depressions in 2,
3, aVF, V4 to V6, but no acute change compared to old.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Upper GI bleed/variceal bleed:  Patient
was thought to have cirrhosis of unclear etiology with new
ascites and new splenomegaly on recent abdominal CT, and on
endoscopy at the outside hospital, portal gastropathy and
esophageal varices were found.  The patient was initially
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
evaluation for emerging TIPS.  The patient had a type and
cross with four units of red cells and fresh frozen plasma on
hold.  She had a central line in her left neck as well as a
right EJ.  She was continued on octreotide drip at 50 mcg per
hour.  She was continued on Protonix 40 IV b.i.d.  Her
coagulopathy, her hematocrit and platelet count were
corrected with products as needed.  The patient was evaluated
by the liver team, who felt that given her comfortable status
and high risk of precipitating encephalopathy, TIPS would not
be the best strategy; rather the patient was observed on
octreotide drip.  Her daughter and son were available as well
as the patient during this conversation and agreed that
conservative management of her varices was the best route.
The patient was continued on octreotide drip for the plan of
five days, and was continued on Protonix IV b.i.d.  She was
started on nadolol for further decrease of her portal
hypertension, and a work-up was initiated for her etiology of
cirrhosis including hepatitis panel, [**Doctor First Name **], SPEP, and
antimitochondrial antibody.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that revealed
no evidence of portal vein thrombus and a cirrhotic liver.
The patient had no further episodes of hematemesis during her
hospitalization.  Her hematocrit remained stable throughout
her hospitalization.

2. Mental status change:  The patient initially was alert and
oriented upon arrival, however became delirious within 24
hours of her hospitalization.  Further work-up revealed a
positive urinalysis consistent with a urinary tract
infection, probably catheter related.  The patient also had
4/4 bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters in
her blood, which were drawn off a left IJ, consistent with a
line infection with sepsis.  The patient had already been
DNR, however now the patient's code status after discussion
with her daughter and son, was changed to DNR/DNI, and made
comfort measures.  No antibiotics were given for her line
infection.  The line was not changed due to the morbidity
involved in a central line procedure, and unfortunately, the
passed away likely due to overwhelming sepsis both from line
infection and urinary tract infection.

The patient was pronounced at 10:20 PM on [**2196-5-16**].  Daughter
and son were present at the bedside.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Line infection/sepsis.
2. Urinary tract infection.
3. Variceal bleed/hemorrhage.
4. New diagnosis of cirrhosis in addition to her diagnoses on
arrival.
