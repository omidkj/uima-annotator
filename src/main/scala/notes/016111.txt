Hypoxia, dyspnea

None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old female with past medical history notable
for amiodarone induced restrictive lung disease, asthma, chronic
systolic CHF and atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker who
presented with progressive dyspnea.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] reported that
she had been dealing with chronic cough for the past year as
well as intermittent dyspnea on exertion.  She was admitted from
[**2146-3-15**] to [**2146-3-18**] for pneumonia in the context of worsening
cough, dyspnea, and sputum production.  She was treated with
levofloxacin for pneumonia, albuterol for asthma, and diuretics
for some overlying CHF.  Steroids were considered but deferred
given concern for infection and the patient's concerns about the
side effects of steroids.   At discharge she had an ambulatory
sat of 89-97% on room air and she completed a ten day course of
levofloxacin.   At home she reported some improvement but that
her symptoms never completely resolved and at best she returned
to her chronic productive cough, which is productive of clear to
yellow-green sputum.  Overall, she reported that she felt she
was not clearing secretions adequately with her cough and that
she had a sense something remained stuck in her throat.  Over
the past week prior to presentation she once again developed
increased shortness of breath, particularly on exertion,
wheezing, and productive cough.

On the day prior to presentation, she presented to her PCP with
an O2 sat 84%RA and was tachypneic and audibly wheezing so she
was sent to the ED. In ED VS T 98.8, P 71, BP 124/41, RR 16, O2
Sat 87%RA.  Her O2 sat improved on NRB.  Chest radiograph showed
possible improvement in her previous infiltrate, EKG was
unchanged, and labs were notable for slightly worsened Cr (1.6
from 1.2-1.4 at baseline).  She received
vancomycin/pipercillin-tazobactam and albuterol/ipratroprium
nebs with improvement in her O2 sat to 97% on 6L.  She had brief
hypotension to SBP's of the 80's which improved with 1L IVF.

OTHER RESULTS
=============
Chest Radiograph [**2146-4-25**]:
Mildly improving opacities within the right upper and left lung
base compatible with improving multifocal pneumonia. No new
areas of consolidation present.

Chest Radiograph [**2146-4-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Mildly improving opacities within the right upper
and left lung base compatible with improving multifocal
pneumonia. No new areas of consolidation present.

TTE [**2146-4-27**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. A right ventricular mass cannot be
excluded at the apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-2-27**], the
right ventricle seems to be depressed. The detected pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension has increased.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2146-4-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Extensive multifocal pulmonary consolidation, with a
component of volume loss suggesting this is an organizing
pneumonia either post-infectious or cryptogenic. Because there
is a one-year interval since the most recent earlier radiographs
bronchial or alveolar cell carcinoma is not excluded, but it is
unlikely. Central adenopathy is probably reactive.  Severe
cardiomegaly. Aortic valvular calcification could be
hemodynamically significant.
paced, with underlying AFIB, unchanged from prior [**3-15**].
