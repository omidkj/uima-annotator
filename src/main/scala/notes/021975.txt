CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o pneumothorax

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o pneumothorax
CLINICAL HISTORY: 78-year-old female, referred to rule out
pneumothorax.

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy, right PIC
catheter, median sternotomy wires are all unchanged. Again
identified is unchanged lucency in the right lung apex and upper
lobe corresponding to the large cystic lesion with calcified
peripheries. There is persistent bibasilar opacity likely
representing atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Otherwise stable chest.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST-BYPASS: A prosthetic aortic valve is in place, with no AI,
no leak. Normal biventricular systolic fxn. MR remains 3+. Aorta
intact. Other parameters as pre bypass.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-10-14**] 4:15 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o plugging, effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with COPD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o plugging, effusions
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with COPD after
aortic valve replacement.

COMPARISON: Chest CT from [**2120-10-4**].

TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced MDCT of the chest from thoracic inlet to
upper abdomen was obtained with subsequent 1.25 and 5 mm
collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal
reformats.

FINDINGS:

New anterior mediastinum collection 5 cm in width and about 9 cm
in length is located immediately retrosternally and might
represent post- surgical hematoma giving it relatevely high
density of up to 32 [**Doctor Last Name **]. The replaced aortic valve is
demonstrated, as well as post- CABG sutures. The heart size is
mildly enlarged but stable. There is no sizable pericardial
effusion.

The patient is intubated with the ET tube tip about 3 cm above
the carina. The trachea contains a large amount of secretions,
especially in its distal portion, continue toward the right main
bronchus, bronchus intermedius, and right lower lobe bronchi.
The appearence of the tracheal lumen suggest tracheomalacia. The
known right upper lobe cavity is unchanged as well as previously
mentioned dense nodular calcified opacities in the right lower
lobe and right middle lobes. Severe emphysema involving the left
upper lobe and superior segment of left lower lobe is again
noted, unchanged. There is no evidence of congestive heart
failure.

Bilateral pleural effusions are new, layering and
non-hemorrhagic, left more than right, moderate in size.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. The NG
tube tip terminates in the stomach. Small right paracardiac
lymph node, 6 mm, 2:47 is new and might be reactive to recent
surgery.

There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy. No sternal
dehiscence is demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:

1. New retrosternal collection might represe
