HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old male
with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2,
hypercholesterolemia, who presented to his primary care
physician with complaints of chronic nonproductive cough
times the past seven months, coinciding with initiation of
ACE inhibitor therapy.  He also complained of dizziness,
fatigue, and occasional diaphoresis, not related to exertion.
He reports that he can walk up two flights of stairs and ride
a bike without any shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion,
chest pain, chest pressure.  Additionally, he denies edema,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope, presyncope.

He was recently on antibiotics for cough with some relief.
He had a recent admission in [**2128-4-8**] for a laminectomy.
Patient's primary care physician ordered an exercise
tolerance test/Myoview to rule out cardiac cause of his
cough.  He exercised 18 minutes per standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.
He had a blunted heart rate response and got 0.5 mg of
atropine at 16.5 minutes.  He had no complaints of chest
pain.  He achieved 74% maximal heart rate.  Myoview imaging
revealed anterior ischemia.  Therefore, the patient was sent
for cardiac catheterization on [**2128-7-15**].

Catheterization revealed severe diffuse LAD disease with
proximal tandem 70% stenosis, subtotally occluded mid vessel,
very small apical LAD.  Left ventricular ejection fraction
was preserved at 65%.  He underwent successful PTCA, stenting
of the LAD with two overlapping Cypher stents.  Additionally,
the left main coronary artery was noted to be nonobstructed.
Left circumflex was nonobstructed.  OM-1 was large vessel
with an eccentric mid 40% stenosis.  RCA showed a 50% mid
stenosis.

Initially, the patient tolerated coronary catheterization
well.  He was transferred to the holding area.  He then
developed episode of hypotension to BP of 70s after femoral
sheath removal.  He received IV fluid therapy, Integrilin was
discontinued, and dopamine drip was started.  He was taken to
CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal hematoma.  CT scan
revealed a psoas hematoma.

in the region of the right psoas muscle.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  Patient with three vessel
disease on cardiac catheterization and status post PCI with
two Cypher stents placed in his left anterior descending
artery.  Plan was to continue aspirin, Plavix, statin, and
beta blocker/ACE inhibitor, if the patient's blood pressure
tolerated.  Namely, the patient should be on aspirin and
Plavix for nine months post-stent.  As he had complications,
hematoma development, Integrilin was discontinued.

He was managed and monitored for symptoms of chest pain or
dyspnea, and this was of concern for possible stent
thrombosis.  He remained chest pain free throughout the
remainder of his hospital course, and cardiac enzymes were
ruled out for myocardial infarction.

Ventriculogram performed during coronary catheterization
showed an ejection fraction of 65%.  Therefore, the patient's
cardiac decompensation was likely secondary to diastolic
dysfunction secondary to a longstanding history of
hypertension.  Initially, plan was made to continue ACE
inhibitor and beta blocker therapy if the patient's blood
pressure tolerated.  However, he arrived to the floor in need
of pressor support on a dopamine drip.  He was weaned off the
dopamine slowly as the blood pressure tolerated, and atenolol
50 mg po q day, and Valsartan 240 mg po q day were added to
his medication regimen.  Please note, that the patient had
been on an ACE inhibitor prior to admission, however, it was
felt that the side-effects from the ACE inhibitor therapy
could be contributing to his complaint of cough, and
therefore an angiotensin receptor blocker was substituted in
place of the ACE inhibitor.

2. Right psoas muscle hematoma:  Vascular Surgery was
consulted.  They recommended serial hematocrit values,
hemodynamic monitoring, and serial peripheral pulse checks.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
for a drop in his hematocrit from 37 to 27.  He tolerated
this well.  Additionally, Heparin and Integrilin were
discontinued as this is felt to be contributed to bleeding
complications.  At time of discharge, the patient's
hematocrit value had been stable for greater than 24 hours.
Value at discharge was 36.3.

3. Diabetes mellitus:  Patient's outpatient metformin dose
was held after receiving an intravenous contrast load during
cardiac catheterization, out of concern for possible acute
tubular necrosis, exacerbat
