History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107508**] is a 65 year old patient with history of cirrhosis,
CKD, HTN, DM, CAD s/p stenting, prior ICD, right sided heart

evaluation for liver transplantation. Pt is admitted for
pre-cath hydration in setting of renal failure. Pt's most recent
Cr 3.2 from [**5-8**]. Pt and his wife state that his decompensation
began back in [**Month (only) 359**] when he started getting more [**Location (un) **]. He began
to feel DOE back then. He has felt that this SOB has become
progressively worse. For the last 4-5 months, he states that he
can still walk a flight of stairs, but has to rest for several
minutes afterwards to catch his breath. He has had severe edema,
btu is unsure how much weight he has gained. He was on lasix,
but her his wife, this was stopped two weeks ago by his kidney
doctor given his worsening kidney function. He has had a recent
ear infection and has had a poor appetite. Otherwise, he denies
any chest pain, chest pressure, or dyspnea at rest.

Cardiac Catherization ([**2184-5-13**]):
1. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension not improved with oxygen
or NO.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

CXR ([**2184-5-14**]): There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Transvenous pacer leads are in standard position. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
There is mild pulmonary edema.

Renal US ([**2184-5-15**]):
1. No evidence of stones, masses or hydronephrosis within the
kidneys.
2. Nodular liver contour, splenomegaly and ascites; findings
consistent with cirrhosis.

EGD ([**2184-5-21**]):
-Ulcers in the lower third of the esophagus
-No evidence of varices or Barretts
-Mosaic appearance in the stomach body compatible with Mild
portal gastropathy
-No evidence of gastric varices, ulcers or masses
-Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part
of the duodenum
-Erythema and superficial erosions in the antrum
-Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part
of the duodenum
-Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

EEG ([**2184-5-28**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring
study because of the presence of a moderately severe to severe
diffuse encephalopathy with paroxysmal frontal triphasic slow
and sharp slow discharges compatible with a severe metabolic
encephalopathy. While some of the sharp transients were
epileptiform in appearance, they did not appear to have any
evolution. No seizure discharges were identified.

CT head ([**2184-5-29**]): No acute intracranial process.

Abd US with doppler ([**2184-6-1**]):
1. Nodular echogenic liver compatible with cirrhosis.
2. Moderate ascites.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Patent portal veins and hepatic vasculature

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107508**] is a 65 year old patient with history of cirrhosis,
CKD stage III, HTN, DM, CAD s/p stenting, prior ICD, right sided
heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter s/p ablation,
undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation. Pt was admitted
for pre-cath hydration for diagnostic cath for evaluation prior
to liver transplant.

# AMS: Patient had intermittent episodes of confusion this
admission, thought to be from hepatic encephalopathy and his
mental status improved with lactulose.  He was briefly admitted
to the ICU when his mental status acutely changed.  Head CT was
negative and EEG showed evidence of encephalopathy without
seizure activity.  He was started on an aggressive dose of
lactulose, 60mL every 2 hours.  A rectal tube was placed and his
mental status improved after he was receiving enough lactuose to
produce 1-2L of stool per day.  At the time of discharge, he
remains A&Ox3 with somewhat slow speech and mild asterixis on
exam, however this appears to be his recent baseline mental
status.  He will continue on lactulose titrated to [**4-5**] bowel
movements per day as an outpatient.

# CORONARIES: Pt has history of CAD with previous stenting
