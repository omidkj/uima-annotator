Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 101537**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective repair of both a
colocutaneous fistula and ventral hernia on [**2174-12-22**].  Pt
underwent surgery repair of her colocutaneous fistula and
ventral hernia on the same day, by a combined effort between the
general surgery service led by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], and the plastic surgery
service led by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  The pt tolerated the procedure well.
 After recovery in the [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt was transferred to the floor in
stable condition.  Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 101537**] was noted to
have worsening SOB.  CXR revealed worsening opacity of RLL
consistent w/ pneumonia with some component of fluid overload.
She was started on levaquin.  Diuresis was initiated with lasix.
 However, she continued to be dyspneic, and on POD 3, it was
noted that she was increasingly somnolent.  ABG obtained
revealed a pCO2 of 72.  She was transferred to the ICU, and she
intubated for respiratory failure.  Ms.  [**Known lastname 101537**] would remain
intubated in the unit for several more days on antibiotics for
pneumonia. Sputum cultures from [**12-30**] grew out MRSA, and she was
started on Vancomycin. She also was aggressively diuresed for
volume overload.  However, throughout her ICU stay, she remained
clinically stable.  On POD 16, she was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated, which she tolerated well.  She
remained clinically stable following extubation. She continued
working with physical therapy.  Her wound area continued to
remain well-healing, with the exception of a small area of
necrosis along the inferior portion of her wound, which should
slough and heal well. She was discharged to rehab for further
care on [**1-10**], in stable condition.
