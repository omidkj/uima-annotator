Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripheral catheterization- abdominal aorta and bilateral distal
extremity run-offf, bilateral limb angiography, PTA/stent left
iliac


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 52yo male with history of PVD, COPD, DM and
hyperlipidemia admitted to the CCU after undergoing left iliac
stent placement x 2 for total occlusion of said vessel.
Post-procedure saturations were noted to be in the mid-80s so he
was sent to the CCU for further care.
.
The patient reported a recent history of worsened left lower
extremity claudication.  Per recent cardiology note, he states
after walking his son to the bus stop which is [**2139**] yards from
home he has to stop and rest in the middle of the walk due to
left leg pain.  He states both of legs hurt, left > right and
after resting for 10 minutes the pain will go away. Patient
states he has to stop multiple times on his way to his son's bus
stop every morning.  This pain has been occurring for the past
ten years.
.
He underwent a CT angio of his abdomen and bilateral lower
extremities on [**2149-9-16**], which demonstrated "lower abdominal
aorta irregularity and vascular consultation.  Left side of the
common iliac artery 4-cm total occlusion with the distal portion
reconstitution.  Right sided common iliac artery distal portion
calcification with mild narrowing mid-portion of right sided
superficial femoral artery focal calcification with 50% focal
narrowing is also noted."
.
The patient has COPD most likely secondary to extensive tobacco
history.  Per his wife, he has a poor baseline secondary to
dyspnea and leg claudication.  His baseline oxygen saturations
are in the high 80s/low 90s at rest.  He uses 2L NC oxygen
during exertion.  He also has a history of OSA but did not
complete sleep study.
.
After the procedure this evening, he oxygen saturations were
noted to be in the mid-80s.  Patient denied shortness of
breath/chest pain/dizziness/light-headedness.  He was otherwise
hemodynamically stable.  There were no post-procedure
complications.  Given his low saturations, he was sent to the
CCU for closer monitoring and possible positive pressure
ventilation.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  Positive for
exertional buttock and calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
He denies chest pain, worsened dyspnea, edema, orthopnea, PND,
lightheadedness, or syncope.  Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR [**2149-10-16**]: The lungs are clear. Heart size is within normal

vascular as there is prservation of the right paratracheal
stripe. No concerning bone findings.

Bilateral access and stenting with 2 stents. Perclose to both

Brief Hospital Course:
# HYPOXIA- Patient with known COPD (baseline sats in the
mid-high 80s/low 90s) who was found to have sat of 85%
post-procedure.  He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or
lightheadedness.  Etiology seems to be COPD.  Given body
habitus, he most likely has some degree of OSA also but is not
on CPAP at home.  Most recent ABG consistent with CO2 retaining-
7.30/67/51, consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis.
Patient sat'ed in low 90s on 2L NC throughout admission; prior
to discharge his O2 sat at rest was 85% off O2 but the patient
was completely asymptomatic and said that he felt like he was at
his baseline. Of note the patient has home O2 2L which he will
continue using prn at home. Patient was continued on home
inhalers.
.
# CORONARIES:  Patient with known DM, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension.  He denies chest pain or shortness of breath at
this time and EKG was normal.  Given his risk factors and known
PVD, patient most likely has some degree of CAD but is currently
asymptomatic.  Remained hemodynamically stable throughout
hospitalization. Patient started on Plavix 75mg daily for iliac
stent placement and continued on home aspirin and simvastatin.
.
# PUMP:  Patient had ETT in [**2149-1-17**] demonstrating EF of
70%.  Patient is not showing signs of fluid overload on exam-
normal JVD, no peripheral edema, chest clear to ausculatation
bilaterally. CXR was normal.
.
# RHYTHM:  Patient in normal sinus rhythm throughout admission.
.
#  Left iliac occlusion s/p stent- Site was clean and dry with
no signs of bleed.  Patient started on plavix 75mg daily,
continued on aspirin 325 mg daily.
.
#  DM- Patient instructed to hold Metformin and re-start 48
hours after procedure.
