Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**]
Chief Complaint:
left pelvic sarcoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left pelvic sarcoma removal,
2. Exploration of left iliac artery and vein.
3. Excision of left external iliac artery and vein.
4. Ligation of left external iliac vein.
5. Left iliofemoral bypass graft.
6. rectus flap closure on [**2139-9-11**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 44-year-old
gentleman who presented with a left groin mass this past
[**Month (only) 547**] and was diagnosed with a large intermediate grade
synovial sarcoma of the left pelvis extending through the
femoral canal into the left groin. The mass measured up to 17
cm in size and appeared to nearly encase the external iliac
artery and vein. Given the size, grade and vascular
encasement of the tumor, I advised up-front neoadjuvant
chemoradiation therapy to a total radiation dose of 5000 Gy
with low-dose Adriamycin as a radiosensitizer. He had no
evidence of metastatic disease on cross sectional imaging. He
completed his treatment in early [**Month (only) **] and follow-up staging
scans showed a decrease in size of the mass, but continued
short-segment encasement of the external iliac artery and
vein. I advised radical resection of the mass and asked Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery to assist with possible resection
of the left external iliac and common femoral artery and
vein. In addition, I asked Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery to be
available for likely myocutaneous flap reconstruction of the
defect in the left groin. The patient understood the risks
and benefits of the procedure and consented to proceed.


Past Medical History:
Synovial sarcoma:
Approximately six months ago when he noted the development of
increase in left leg swelling and a lump in his left groin.
These symptoms have been intermittent but evolving over that
time, with associated numbness on the lateral left thigh, mild
weakness in hip flexion. His symptoms progressed and the patient
presented at an outside emergency department on [**2139-4-17**]. He
had significant left leg swelling at that time, and ultrasound
revealed no clot. He then saw his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2139-4-24**]. He underwent MRI of the lumbar spine on [**2139-4-30**],
which revealed a complex pelvic mass within the left side of the
pelvis, partially visualized on the umbar spine study measuring
approximately 8 cm. The mass is inseparable from the left psoas
muscle. Further visualization was recommended. He underwent a
pelvic ultrasound on [**2139-4-30**], which revealed an
extraperitoneal 15.6 cm x 8 cm x 12.8 cm complex cystic and
solid mass, which demonstrates internal vascularity in the
pelvis. He then underwent biopsy of the left groin mass on
[**2139-5-7**]. Pathology revealed a malignant spindle cell
neoplasm, intermediate grade, most consistent with synovial
sarcoma, predominantly monophasic type. The immunohistochemical
stain for EMA is positive, while actin, desmin, cytokeratin
cocktail, MNF-116, CD34 and S100 are negative.
.
Staging scans were obtained. CT of the head on [**2139-5-19**]
revealed no evidence for metastatic disease. CT of the torso on
[**2139-5-19**] revealed a large psoas mass extending in the upper
mid to lower pelvis to the femoral triangle measuring
approximately 10 x 17 cm and encasing the external iliac artery
and vein, but with no other direct bone or organ invasion, local
pelvic or distal metastasis.
.
He underwent his first 2 cycles of low-dose adriamycin and 5
sessions each week of XRT on [**4-8**], and [**Date range (1) 19159**]. Given the
[**Hospital1 **] day holiday he underwent 4 sessions of XRT and a cycle
of low-dose adriamycin on [**6-30**] - [**7-3**]. He completed his most
recent cycle rom [**7-6**] to [**2139-7-10**] without complications.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy - (? steroid induced. Pt took
steroids for bodybuilding). EF 30-35%, however most recent
cardiac MRI showed improvement in heart structure and function
with an EF of 50%.
2. Depression/anxiety
3. GERD
4. Chronic Sinusitis s/p minimal invasive endoscopic sinus
surgery with middle meatal antrostomy and anterior ethmoidectomy
([**2131**])
5. Asthma-exercise induced, wheezing worse w/cold weather, never
been hospitalized for asthma
6. History of MRSA folliculitis with several I&Ds
7. Latent syphilis with initial RPR titer 1:2
8. HSV labialis
.


Social History:
The patient lives with his parents in [**Hospital1 1559**] and is single.
Denies smoking or alcohol use.  He previously had used meth, no
current drug use.  He is currently unemployed.


Family History:
The patient's maternal grandmother died of colon cancer in her
60s.  There are no other known cancers in the family.
