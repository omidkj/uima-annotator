Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  4.9 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  2.8 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with XXX. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2175-4-3**] at 1400.

Post revascularization
LV function globally depressed- LVEF= 35%. RV function mildly
depressed. 2+ mitral regurgitation present. LVEF improved with
time. LVEF= 45% at the time of chest closure.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2175-4-3**] where the patient underwent an off-pump
coronary artery bypass graft x2; left internal mammary artery to
very proximal diagonal artery close to the left anterior
descending artery and saphenous vein graft obtuse marginal
artery and endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
See operative note for full details. She was treated with
Macrodantin for a UTI preoperatively. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  She
did develop copius serosanginous sternal drainage at lower
sternal pole which grew out Pseudomonas on wound culture. A PICC
line was inserted a
