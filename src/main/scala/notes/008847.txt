Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness/fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement for milrinone infusion
PICC line removal

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82yo M with PMHx of Stage 4 systolic heart
failure, EF 15%; s/p BiV ICD downgrade to BiV pacemaker; s/p
CABG times 2 who presents after BiV pacemaker downgrade for
management of heart failure.

Patient was last hospitalized for a heart failure exacerbation
at [**Hospital3 24768**] in [**2161-12-15**]. He was diuresed; his wife
reports that since this admission, the patient has steadily
gained weight, particularly in his legs and abdomen. [**Name (NI) **]
wife describes a basketball appearing belly with measured
increases in his abdominal girth- 35inches (at baseline) to
40inches recently. The patient's wife denies poor appetite in
the patient, but reports small portion sizes for meals.

The patient has been taking 80mg po lasix twice daily; however,
given the increased abdominal girth, the patient's outpatient
Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**], tried xiroxalin once weekly. However,
the addition of xiroxalin resulted in decreased SBP, as low as
85/55. This augmentation to diuresis was then discontinued.

The patient has orthopnea requiring an elevated head of bed in
addition to 2 pillows. He will have SOB with exertion and with
limited activity (ie walking to the bathroom).

On arrival to the floor, patient denies chest pain and shortness
of breath.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

On review of systems, patient has no history of any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. [**Name (NI) **]
wife denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Imaging:
Chest X-ray [**2162-5-3**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
now shows
massive cardiomegaly and perihilar vascular congestion,
pulmonary edema and mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
There is unchanged evidence of a left pectoral pacemaker, the
generator has been replaced in the interval.
.
TTE [**2162-5-4**]
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %)
secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and
severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. The right
ventricle was poorly visualized but appears dilated and
profoundly hypokinetic on very limited imaging (primarily of the
infundibulum/outflow tract). The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] At least moderate [2+] tricuspid r
