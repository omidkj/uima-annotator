Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for tracheostomy in setting of
tracheobronchomalacia, prolonged intubation.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-10-1**]
1. Open tracheostomy (#8 Portex cuffed, non-fenestrated).
2. Therapeutic bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
55/F with hx. tracheobronchomalacia, hx. of prolonged intubation
presents from OSH following treatment for bilateral pneumonia
requiring mechanical ventilation.   The patient presents today
as a transfer for tracheostomy.  She initially was diagnosed
with tracheobronchomalacia following prolonged
intubation for encephalitis in [**2164**] and is known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
from Interventional Pulmonology.  Patient has history of
significant suprglottic edema, severe GERD, right vocal cord
paralysis and aspiration pneumonia.

She presented to [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital on [**2188-9-13**] with SOB, cough,
wheezing and increased sputum production.  She was intubated
soon after admission for respiratory distress.  The intubation
was difficult.  Bronchoscopy on [**2188-9-15**] indicated easily
collapsible trachea and significant pus bilaterally and she was
treated with Zosyn for CAP.    Course was complicated by
bilateral maxillary
sinusitis.  On vent. day 8 the patient was extubated despite
strong indication for tracheostomy as per family's wishes, and
required immediate reintubation, which was accomplished using a
Cook catheter as a guide for #7 ETT.

Presently, the patient's pneumonia is significantly improved and
patient presents for long-term airway management

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-9-27**] L PICC terminates in mid SVC, ETT about 6 cm above the
carina, and NGT terminates in stomach, patchy bibasilar
opacities, additional linear focus of atelectasis is present in
the periphery of the R base.
[**2188-9-28**] Airway CT - Bilateral pansinus opacification,
obliteration of the nasopharynx and oropharynx space with b/l
soft tissue density, no def hematoma,tracheomalacia
[**2188-9-28**] Chest CT Enlarged LN w/in the mediastinum; Bibasilar
consolidations
[**2188-9-29**] CXR ETT standard placement, NG tube passes below the
diaphragm, out of view. R>L opacification more likely PNA on R
side could be B atelectasis. Probably no change. Upper lungs are
clear. Heart size top normal. L CVL in mid SVC. Severe
bronchomalacia torso CT scan.
[**2188-10-1**] CXR tracheostomy placed, RLL atelectasis
[**2188-10-2**] KUB paucity of gas in the abdomen, no bowel dilatation.
Retained stool in the colon and rectum
[**2188-10-7**] AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Evaluation is made in direct
comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 10
hours earlier during the same date. During the interval a
Dobbhoff line has been placed seen to reach well below the
diaphragm and the fundus of the stomach. Chest findings remain
unaltered in this patient with tracheotomy cannula in place. No
pneumothorax has developed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 37032**] was was transfered from an outside hospital on
[**2188-9-27**] for history of tracheobronchomalacia, and pneumonia.
Please review HPI for full details on previous hospitalization.
The patient underwent tracheostomy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2188-10-1**].
Please see operative report for details. The patient had
significant supraglottic swelling thought initially to be
consistent with angioedema, however this was ruled out with lab
testing. It was thought possibly the swelling may have been due
to traumatic intubation at the outside hospital. The patient was
given decadron taper, benadryl, and an FFP trial. The pt was
eventually weaned off the ventilator and placed on trach collar
which she is tolerating 6 hours a day and resting on pressure
support ventilation with PEEP of 15 due to cuff leak. The pt had
a swallow evaluation [**2188-10-7**] clearing her for honey thick liquid
and puree, but with supplemental tube feeding for nutrition
(Boost glucose control at goal of 55cc/hr), and further eval and
treatment by speech therapy. A nasogastric dobhoff was placed on
[**10-7**] and confirmed in the stomach. The patient was evaluated by
PT/OT and is able to get out of bed with assistance twice a day.
The patient also had quite labile blood sugars, and [**Last Name (un) **]
diabetic consultation recommended changing the insulin sliding
scale to q 6 hours. The patient is alert and oriented and has
normal WBC count without fevers. She completed her antibiotic
course. She has been cleared to transfer to vent rehab, and is
aware of the transfer, with attending approval.
