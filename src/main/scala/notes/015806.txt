[**8-15**] PORTABLE CXR:

IMPRESSION: Study limited due to motion. Airspace opacities
bilaterally at
the lung bases, which could be due to motion blur, however fluid
overload
/edema are strongly suspected. Pneumonia cannot be excluded. No
evidence of pneumothorax.

CTA Chest [**2162-8-17**]:
1. No sign of pulmonary embolus.
2. Slightly increasing right hilar mass and small increase in
the mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Otherwise, no evidence of new
metastatic disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with PMH of NSCLC s/p wedge resection x 2, COPD on home
O2, hypertension presents with acute onset SOB and worsening
failure to thrive over 3 weeks.

1. SOB: Was thought to be primarily due to acute on chronic
diastolic CHF with concominant COPD exacerbation. In the ICU,
patient was given BIPAP with good response. Was started on
emperic lovenox and abx, these were both discontinued once CTA
chest confirmed no PE or no pneumonia. The patient improved
significantly with diureses and standing nebs and steroid taper,
however, patient eventually plateaud and continued to complain
of SOB and wheezing. This was most likely secondary to excess
fluid remaining. Patient had a small cardiac enzyme leak, likely
demand related during his acute hypoxic and tachypnic episode.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommended further diuresis. The
patient was diuresed with good response in his symptoms. The
patient still has room to go for diuresis (still has 1+ pitting
pedal edema), and will need to continue high dose PO Lasix
(120mg PO BID) for 7 days until titrated back down to a
maintanaince regimen.

2. Hoarse voice/? Aspiration: Per daughter's report, coughing
with food.  S&S was obtained at bedside, which patient passed.
Per S&S, if more concern, can attempt a video S&S. Started on
regular diet and maintained aspiration precautions. This was not
a significant issue.

3. NSCLC: He was receiving carboplatin and gemcitabine for third
line palliative chemotherapy with signs of some response. Repeat
CT scan did not show significant change in disease progression.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his oncologist, was made aware of pt's admission and
will f/u with him as an outpatient to discuss continuing his
chemo regimen.

4. COPD: Noted wheezes and rhonchi on exam on admission. Wheezes
persisted on thought to be likely secondary to diastolic CHF.
Placed on standing nebulizers and outpatient regimen. Patient
was placed on a steroid taper. Pulmonology was consulted and
recommended Spiriva, advair, and placing PRN albuterol and
ipratropium.

5. HTN: continue ACE and bblocker for afterload reduction.
Started Carvedolol for patient's heart failure.

6. Aminitis: Patient had a mild transaminitis, the slightly
worsened but remained otherwise stable. Patient denied RUQ pain.
Labs were not c/w obstructive etiology. Labs should be followed
up by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] persistently elevated or worsened, may need
further work-up. Patient is scheduled to see PCP in [**Month (only) 359**].
Also has just been scheduled for [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 1944**] clinic to
check lytes and adjust lasix dose.

7. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin

8. Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

CODE: DNR/DNI  (confirmed with patient and daughters in room
through translator)
