History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108855**] is an 84yo male with
history of CAD s/p stenting, CHF (EF 55%), Afib, prior cardiac
arrest and heart block s/p pacer/AICD placement, chronic trach,
and recent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin who presents from rehab
with a one day history of fevers and vomiting, as well as AMS.
Patient has had several recent admissions, including admission
from [**Date range (1) 105469**] for PNA and MRSA bacteremia/sepsis.  Was
discharged to rehab on vanco, readmitted [**Date range (1) 20211**] for hematuria
and GI bleed (blood in ostomy bag), and again readmitted
[**Date range (1) 108857**] with persistent fevers and positive MRSA blood
cultures.  Source of MRSA bacteremia was unclear, and work-up
during that time included TTE/TEE negative for vegetations on
valves and cardiac pacer leads, and negative tagged WBC scan.
PICC was removed and replaced.  Patient discharged on planned 6
week course of vanco through [**2163-11-2**].  Hospital course also
notable for pseudomonas and klebsiella UTI, treated with 7 day
courses of cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient had Foley changed
during that admission.  Was discharged back to [**Hospital1 100**] Senior
Rehab.
.
Since discharge, has been noted to have worsening renal function
requiring nephrology consult, and in this setting his diuretic
regimen was held.  Also had increasing SOB requiring pulmonary
consult, with change in vent settings from pressure support to
AC mode.  Has had recurrent GI bleed requiring transfusion of 2
units pRBCs on [**2163-10-12**], and has been continued on PPI,
sucralfate, and iron supplementation.  Per report, usually
responds to wife, but was less responsive over past 1-2 days.
On day of admission had several episodes of vomiting, and per
wife was febrile to 101.  Sent to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 69 106/51 20 95% assist
control.  Labs notable for leukocytosis (WBC 14.2) with
neutrophil predominance, Hct 26.3 (stable), Na 127, Cr 3.5
(baseline 1.4), lactate 1.2.  UA suggestive of recurrent UTI.
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural
effusions, and was similar to recent prior studies.  Given LUE
edema, ultrasound obtained which was negative for DVT.  Patient
received vancomycin and cefepime.  Also got ASA given elevated
trop of 0.2.  ECG showed paced rhythm.  Patient had 1L NS hung
prior to transfer.  VS prior to transfer 100.0 70, 112/82, 15,
99%.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient nods yes when asked if he is in
pain, but he cannot localize the pain.  Appears comfortable when
resting in bed, though uncomfortable when examined.
