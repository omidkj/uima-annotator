PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On examination, her
temperature was 98.1, blood pressure was 126/44, and heart
rate was in the 80s.  In general, she was a thin elderly
woman in no apparent distress.  She appeared slightly
uncomfortable and anxious.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the oropharynx was dry.  No blood
was visible.  Chest examination revealed breath sounds were
distant.  She had no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
No murmurs.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm
and well perfused.  No edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed her white blood cell count was 8.3,
hematocrit was 27.1 (repeat hematocrit was 25.7 three hours
later), and platelets were 250.  Differential with 71%
neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.  Her
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable other than an elevated blood
urea nitrogen of 61 and a creatinine of 0.9.  Creatine kinase
was 79.  Troponin was less than 0.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no
infiltrates.  No pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**5-21**] to [**5-24**].

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  On the evening of admission,
she had emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed an
active pumping arterial bleeding vessel in the fundus 5 cm
distal to the gastroesophageal junction.  Epinephrine and
electrocautery were attempted to stop the bleed, but this
failed.

She was then subsequently sent to Interventional Radiology
who injected the celiac axis to localize the bleed, but no
bleed was found.  They attempted to embolize the left gastric
artery but failed secondary to its tortuosity.  The bleed
appeared to have stopped.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she received 48 hours of
octreotide, given intravenous Protonix 40 mg twice per day
(which was changed to 40 mg p.o. twice per day), and her diet
was advanced to clears.  She had received 4 units of packed
red blood cells and one bag of platelets while on the Unit.
The platelets were given because the patient had been on
aspirin, but she was not thrombocytopenic.

She was then transferred out to the floor after her
hematocrit had been stable on [**2151-5-24**].  Her hematocrit
was 36 status post transfusion and remained at this level
over a 72-hour period.

Her diet was continually advanced, and she had brown stools
by the time she left the hospital.  She was to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2151-7-5**] for a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

2.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE ISSUES:  She was
stable on home oxygen.  She was continued on her inhalers.

3.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction given her dyspnea.  Her
antihypertensives were held given the possibility of becoming
hypotensive, and her aspirin was also discontinued given her
risk of bleeding.  She was to follow up with her primary care
physician; at which point he will decide on restarting her
antihypertensives.

She also has congestive heart failure which was stable.
Previously on Lasix 20 mg p.o. once per day; but this has
also been held and was to be restarted by her primary care
physician.

4.  BACK PAIN ISSUES:  She has chronic back pain.  She was to
continue on her home medications including her Soma and
Darvocet.

5.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was worked up as an
outpatient including a bone marrow biopsy which was normal.
Her hematocrit was stable for 72 hours status post
transfusion on [**5-21**].

6.  CODE STATUS:  Her code status is do not resuscitate/do
not intubate.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
[**Hospital6 407**] for blood pressure monitoring.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: (Her discharge diagnoses included)
 1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
 2.  Status post transfusion of four units of packed red
blood cells and one bag of platelets.
 3.  Gastric ulcer with arterial bleed.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Coronary artery disease.
 6.  Peptic ulcer disease.

MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES:
1.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with electrocautery.
2.  Epinephrine injection.
3.  Interventional Radiology embolectomy attempt.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was discharged to home with [**Hospital6 1587**] to continue blood pressure monitoring.
2.  The patient was advised to return to the hospital right
away with any signs of bleeding; including bright red blood
