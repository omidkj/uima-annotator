Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, dysuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
patient is a 54-year-old woman with history of type I diabetes,
ESRD s/p kidney and pancreas transplant in [**2137**] on chronic
immunosuppression (prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine),
now with chronic CKD (baseline creatinine ~1.6), and history of
E coli bacteremia in [**2160-7-24**]. She presented tonight to the
emergency room with 1 day of fever, dysuria, and urinary
urgency.
.
She was in her usual state of health until yesterday when she
started having chills and fevers all day. Her daughter gave her
a UTI test kit, and she came out positive so she called her
doctor, who recommended she take cipro. She took that for 2
doses. However, her fevers worsened and her daughter then took
her to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **].
.
She denined any sick contacts, and endorsed recent change in
meds to carvedilol and captopril dose adjustments only.
.
Per patient she c/o of some low back pain, but endorsed increase
in urinary frequency. ROS negative for CP/SOB, headache,
photophobia, neck stiffness, or diarrhea (last BM yesterday,
normal). She denied new joint pain or rashes.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 105.4, HR 110, BP 120/57, RR
18, satting 100% RA. Labs were notable for hct of 31 (at
baseline) with white count of 3.2 (slightly lower than
baseline), 92.9% polys with no bands. Electrolytes were notable
for BUN 31, creat 1.5 (both at baseline). Glucose was 270.
Lactate was 1.6. UA showed [**12-13**] whites, few bacteria, and trace
LE. CXR showed no infiltrate. Blood cultures were drawn and
urine culture sent. Patient was given Tylenol, solumedrol 125 mg
IV (for concern of adrenal insufficiency), vancomycin 1 gm IV
x1, and Zosyn. In addition, she was given 3L intravenous fluids.
Renal transplant service was contact[**Name (NI) **]; they recommended
aggressive IVF and renal transplant ultrasound; this showed
thick-walled bladder "in keeping with cystitis". She was
admitted to the ICU given persistent tachycardia and concern of
sepsis.
.
Once in the ICU, the patient remained stable, with heart rate in
high 80s and stable blood pressure. She was satting well on room
air.
.
Of note, patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 20550**]/[**2160**] with fevers
and chills; during this admission she was found to have E.coli
bacteremia from urinary source. She was initially admitted to
MICU with possible sepsis. She was febrile to 105.8 and was
hypotensive transiently requiring levaphed. She was treated
empirically with Vanc/Zosyn/Levo for infection of unclear source
while cultures were pending. She was placed on stress-dose
steroids. Ultimately her urine and blood grew E-coli sensitive
to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. She was started on a
14-day course of intravenous Ciprofloxacin. Also of note during
that admission, patient had labile BPs presumed from autonomic
instability from her diabetes. She was asymptomatic during these
episodes and was treated with carvedilol for HTN and midodrone
for low BP.

Radiology:
CXR PA/Lat [**11-9**]:
FINDINGS: A left PICC has been removed. The lateral view shows
increased
radiodensity projecting over the lower thoracic spine that,
correlated with
asymmetric basal density on the frontal view, suggests left
lower lobe
pneumonia. Pleural surfaces are smooth. Pulmonary vasculature is
normal in
caliber and distribution. There is no pulmonary edema. Hilar and
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, without cardiomegaly.
A radiopaque object projecting over the posterior mediastinum on
the lateral view is external to the patient, as no correlate is
seen on frontal view. Surgical clips in the RUQ are compatible
with prior cholecystectomy.

IMPRESSION: Suggest oblique views to investigate possible left
lower
pneumonia.
.
Oblique CXR [**11-10**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. No pneumonia.
.
Renal U/S [**11-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Thick-walled bladder, in keeping with history of cystitis.
2. Fullness of the ureter and renal pelvis likely reflects
post-surgical
status. No frank hydronephrosis. This appears unchanged from
[**2160-8-19**].
3. No renal abscess or perinephric fluid collections identified.

4. Patent main renal artery and main renal vein, with stable RIs
compared to [**2157**].

Brief Hospital Course:
ID:
54yoF with history of type I diabetes, ESRD s/p kidney and
pancreas transplant in [**2137**] on chronic immunosuppression
(prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine), now with chronic
CKD (baseline creatinine ~1.6), and history of E coli bacteremia
in [**2160-7-24**] from urosepsis. Pt started having changed urinary
symptoms recently (increased frequency) along with fevers and
PCP empirically [**Name9 (PRE) 20551**] ciprofloxacin. Pt took only one dose
of cipro 500mg but fevers worsened so presented to ED.
.
# Fevers and leukopenia:
Likely infectious in etiology, with most likely source being
urinary (given borderline positive UA, cystitis on ultrasound,
and patient's symptom of urinary urgency). CXR initially raised
concern for a possible LLL infiltrate; oblique films were
requested for better definition and showed no evidence of PNA.
LFTs and lipase were wnl.  Her lactate was 1.6. Vancomycin and
cefepime were started.  Blood cultures were drawn.  She remained
normotensive and her tachycardia resolved and she received a
dose of steroids in the ED over concerns for adrenal
insufficiency.  Her WBC increased from 3.2 to 5.8 and she was
transferred to the floor on the evening after admission. She
became afebrile and abx were changed to IV cipro and then PO
cipro when urine culture came back negative. Pt stayed afe
