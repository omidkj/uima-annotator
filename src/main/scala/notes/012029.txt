Brief Hospital Course:
55yo with ETOH cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome with UGIB,
coagulopathy.
.
MICU COURSE: Pt admitted to MICU and underwent EGD, showing
portal hypertensive gastropathy with diffuse bleed. He received
total of 4uPRBC, 4uFFP, and 3 bag of PLT. His bleeding slowed,
though still some dark stools & small amount of BRB on toilet
paper post-procedure. He was weaned off the octreotide per liver
team recs.
Fever to 102.1 on [**2157-12-5**]. Blood cx's from [**12-5**] (2/2 bottles)
growing enterococcus. Pt started on vancomycin and transferred
out of MICU given HD stability & hct stability.
.
FLOOR COURSE:
.
# GI bleed
Patient underwent EGD which showed portal hypertensive
gastropathy with diffuse bleed (as above).  On the floor his
blood pressure and hematocrit had stabilized.  After > 1 week on
the medical floor his hematocrit slowly declined but remained >
22.  He was continued on nadolol until he became progressively
more hypotensive (see below).
.
# Enterococcus Bacteremia
Patient was found to have two enterococcus species in his blood.
 The source of this infection was sought; TTE / TEE were
negative for endocarditis, but CT abdomen did show thickened
colon consistent with colitis.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy was
performed which showed diverticula but no colitis.  He was
treated w/ ampicillin for the enterococcus and flagyl for
colitis, which may have been low grade diverticuliits.  Serial
blood cultures remained negative after the initial enterococcus
isolate.
.
# E Coli UTI
Patient grew E coli from his urine, although UA was negative for
inflammation.  Treatment was deferred and UA / UCx was repeated.
 Then sent to the MICU.
.
# ETOH induced cirrhosis / ESLD
On the medical floor the patient's MELD score and liver
dysfunction worsened daily.  His bilirubin, INR, and creatinine
all increased.  He was listed as first on the transplant list.
He was continued on lactulose / rifaximin as well as
spironalactone / lasix.  The diuretics were d/c'd on [**12-16**] given
his worsened renal function.  As part of pre-transplant workup
he underwent R heart catheterization (which showed moderately
elevated left sided pressures but no PA hypertension).  He also
had several infectious studies sent to ensure lack of infection
/ evaluate baseline before transplant (CMV, Blastomycosis, HSV 1
+2, EBV).
.
# Pulmonary: Sarcoidosis/hepatopulmonary/COPD:
Patient has previously diagnosed hepatopulmonary syndrome.  At
baseline he was using 2L of NC, however as time progressed he
was requiring 4 L NC on [**12-20**].
.
# ARF
Patient on the floor developed ARF in the setting of worsened
liver dysfunction.  Initially creatinine was stable, however
after 2 days of doubled lasix dose, his creatine climbed.  This
was also in the setting of IV contrast for a CT scan.  His
diuretics were withheld, however creatinine kept climbing.
Albumin and IVFs trial did not improve creatinine.  Urine
eosinophils were negative.  Renal was consulted; hepatorenal was
not considered the most likely diagnosis.  He was then
transferred for further evaluation in the MICU.
.
# Volume overload
Given low albumin and cirrhosis patient had increasing LE edema.
 He was initially on lasix / aldactone.  The lasix dose was
increased to 80 mg daily x 2 days.  Her creatinine then
increased and diuretics were witheld.  Stockings were applied to
LE's bilaterally to assist in reduction of edema.
.
MICU COURSE:
The patient was readmitted to the MICU on [**2157-12-20**] for worsening
hypotension, renal failure and hepatic failure. He required
pressor support to maintain his BP and mechamical ventilation
for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The pt's renal failure
worsened and he was treated with CVVH and a Lasix gtt
intermittently. On [**2157-12-25**], the patient complained of chest
discomfort and an ECG revealed 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions V4-V6,
isolated ST elevation V2, TWI II, III, AVF. No therapy beyond
pain control could be provided for this given the patient's
underlying coagulopathy and hypotension. Over the coming two
weeks, the patient's condition failed to improve. On [**2158-1-4**],
in consultation with the patient's family and the liver service,
it was decided to change the goals of his care to comfort only,
as it was felt the patient was highly unlikely to ever receive a
liver transplant. Pressor and ventilatory support were
withdrawn, and on the [**1-9**] the patient expired.
