Allergies:
Levofloxacin / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
# Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
85F h/o [**8-29**] [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear and grade I esophagitis per
[**2148-8-29**] EGD, paraesophageal hernia s/p repair [**5-/2147**], GERD,
admitted from NH (Tawerhill, [**Location (un) 2624**] MA) with Hct = 23.8
(baseline >30) on routine lab check.  Pt described vomiting an
unknown quantity of blood x [**2-10**] the previous night, which she
did not report to NH staff.  Pt noted she remained asymptomatic
during those episodes besides chronic SOB and chronic B ankle
edema.  Because of [**8-29**] EGD revealing M-W tear, pt was admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for observation and repeat [**9-6**] EGD, which
demonstrated old clotted blood in the stomach.  Pt's Hct
remained stable in the MICU and she was transferred to the
floor.
.
ROS:
(+) Left neck/shoulder pain x few weeks, chronic SOB, chronic
groin rash, chronic B ankle edema
(-) Changes in bowel/urinary habits, f/c, n, HA, sensory changes
.
ED: VS T99.0, HR 78, BP 101/33, RR 18, O2Sat 100%.  NGTube was
placed with 500 cc coffee-ground emesis removed.  Pt received 1L
NS, pantoprazole drip, Percocet for lower back and neck pain,
and O2 NC for mild SOB.

================================================
Studies:
.
# ECG Study Date of [**2148-9-5**]  4:13:16 PM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. P-R interval 210 milliseconds which
is prolonged. Left axis deviation. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing no significant change.
.
# UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2148-9-7**] 12:09 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the right
common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins are
performed. A venous catheter is identified within the right
common femoral vein and evaluation for compression of this vein
is limited. The superficial femoral and popliteal veins compress
normally. Venous flow and waveforms are normal and there is no
evidence of intraluminal thrombus. There are diffuse arterial
atherosclerotic calcifications.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-9-7**] 11:44 AM
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or
shift of normally midline structures or evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarct. There is ventricular and sulcal
prominence consistent with age- related atrophy. A 3mm low
density region above the body of the left lateral ventricle is
consistent with a chronic lacunar infarct. Atherosclerotic
calcification of the cavernous carotid and vertebral arteries
are noted bilaterally.
.
Osseous structures are unremarkable. A 1cm lucent region in the
left frontal bone at the vertex is likely a pacchionian
granulation. Fluid within sphenoid air cells is observed. The
imaged portions of the maxillary, frontal, ethmoid sinuses and
mastoid air cells are well aerated.
.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.  Sphenoid sinus
fluid, possibly representing an acute inflammatory process.
.
# CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-9-7**] 11:44 AM
ADDENDUM
On the most caudal axial scans, there appears to be few bubbles
of gas anterior to the right second rib. These findings could
represent a tiny amount of soft tissue emphysema, as opposed to
gas within a vein. Given that they are in the most caudal axial
sections, their full extent may not have been imaged.
.
This finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16011**], MICU
resident, this evening.
NON-CONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE: There is no fracture or evidence of
an acute alignment abnormality. The atlanto-occipital and
atlantoaxial articulations are maintained, aside from
approximately 1mm rightward shift of C1 relative to [**Name (NI) 12952**], likely
related to extensive degenerative changes of the left C1/2
articulation.
.
There is moderate- to- severe multilevel cervical spondylosis
with grade I anterolisthesis of C3 onto C4 likely related to
degenerative facet changes. Cervical spondylosis is most
prominent at C4/5 and C5/6 where there is moderate-to-severe
central spinal canal stenosis secondary to posterior osteophytes
and disc disease. Narrowing of the neural foramina at these
levels is most severe at C4/5 on the right.
.
There is diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid
systems bilaterally, with near midline position of an ectactic,
heavily calcified common carotid artery indenting the posterior
aspect of the supraglottic larynx.
.
A coarse round calcification is noted within the right lobe of
the thyroid-further evaluation with son[**Name (NI) 867**] is suggested. A
small amount of fluid thickening is noted within several
sphenoid air cells, which could represent an acute inflammatory
process.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or acute alignment abnormality.
2. Moderate-to-severe cervical spondylosis as described with
grade I anterolisthesis of C3 onto C4.
.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a mixed gas/soft tissue
density region along the posterior wall of the supraglottic
space- it is unclear whether this finding is some sort of
retained secretions, or an actual mass. Correlation by direct
visualization by ENT would be helpful.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2148-9-7**] 1:48 AM
FINDINGS:
There is no pneumothorax on the right. There is biapical pleural
thickening. The heart is enlarged. The patient is status post
median sternotomy with multiple clips in the mediastinum. Since
the prior study, there is some development of bibasilar
atelectasis. The upper lung zones are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax on the right in the area of line placement.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis, new since the prior study.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2148-9-8**] 9:07 PM
No pneumothorax identified. There is a small amount of air seen
in the left side of the neck in the soft tissues. There is
biapical pleural thickening. There is diffuse underlying
interstitial lung dise
