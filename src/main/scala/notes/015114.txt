Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2181-2-25**]:
1. Extra-axial hemorrhage as described above, likely increased
in total
volume.
2. Large subgaleal hematoma with small subcutaneous foreign
bodies, likely
glass shards.
3. Extra-axial lesion over the right frontal lobe, likely
meningioma.
4. Fracture through the base of the dens.

CTA Neck:
1. Limited examination demonstrates irregularity of the left
vertebral artery at the level of the C2 fracture, much of which
is thought to represent vessel tortuosity, though there are at
least two concerning static images which could represent focal
intimal injury with flap, without complete occlusion.
Attenuation of the V3 and V4 segments may be on a congenital or
posttraumatic basis. A follow-up examination is suggested to
exclude the possibility of a minor vertebral artery injury.
2. Unchanged appearance of the comminuted Type [**3-21**] fracture of
C2, with what likely represent disc herniations, largest
essentially at C2-3, moderately narrowing the canal.
3. Endotracheal tube tip terminating approximately 15 mm
superior to the
carina.

Ct C-spine [**2181-2-26**]:
1. Fracture to the base of dens extending through the left
transverse foramen and into the left superior articular facet,
with interval increase in craniocaudal distraction of
approximately 2 mm and minimal leftward angulation of the dens.
2. Possible rotary subluxation at the C1-C2 level, unchanged.
3. Large central disc herniation with narrowing of the spinal
cord at the C2 to C3 level.
4. Moderate left-sided intervertebral disc herniation at the C5
to C6 level with associated narrowing of the central canal.

MRA/MRI Brain [**2181-3-1**]:
1. Evolving multi-compartmental hemorrhage and subdural
collections, mild
mass effect and no evidence for interval bleeding given
differences in
technique.
2. Multifocal regions of abnormal slow diffusion, much of which
likely
relates to the blood products, though the presence of
superimposed infarcts cannot be excluded, particularly within
the left centrum semiovale.
3. Extensive diffuse scalp edema with paranasal sinus and
mastoid air cell
disease.
4. Bilateral globe deformities.
5. _____at the level of the C2 fracture within the left
vertebral artery is identified by MRA as suggested on the
preceding CTA.

Abd X-ray [**2181-3-6**]:
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. No definite obstruction or ileus.



Chest X-ray [**2181-3-7**]:
In comparison with the study of [**3-5**], there has been substantial

clearing of the volume loss at the left base with sharp
definition of the
hemidiaphragm. Mild atelectatic streaks persists. Some
indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
pressure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7741**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**2181-2-25**]. An ICP monitor
was placed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. She was put on Ancef for infection
prophylaxis. She was in a cervical collar due to her unstable C2
fracture. Her ICP's were well controlled. She was on
intermittent sedation. Her Chest X-rays consistently showed
changed consistent with atelectasis/aspiration
pneumonia/contusion. She remained intubated. She was transferred
to the Neurosurgery on [**2-27**] and the trauma service [**Female First Name (un) **] doff on
[**2-28**].
Repeat CTA and CT on [**2-28**] showed no change in hemorrhage but
suggestion of tortuosity of Left vertebral artery.  Neurology
was consulted to comment on this scan and potential need for
anticoagulation and reason for lack of cognitive improvement.

The ICP monitoring device was removed on [**2181-2-28**]. CT head after
removal showed no new hemorrhage. A family meeting was held with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2181-3-1**]. Trach/Peg placement was discussed and this
was performed on [**2181-3-2**].

She was transferred to the SDU on [**2181-3-4**]. The patient had a
fever of 101.5 and was pancultured. Her WBC was elevated to 13.9
on [**2181-3-6**]. Her sputum culture revealed pseudomonas and she was
started on ciprofloxacin. Neurology department follow up was
performed. They felt that her lack of improvement was due to
diffuse axonal injury. Additionally she had abdominal distention
and the KUB revealed no ileus or obstruction. With the help of a
bowel regimen she has 2 bowel movements overnight. tube feeds
were restarted.

She was afebrile on [**2181-3-7**]. Urine and blood cultures were
pending. CT head was performed for interval assessment. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] of the Neurology department regarding the CT
head. They felt that the hypo densities were likely related to
edema/contusion while infarct cannot be excluded.  The findings
were reviewed with the family.

Rehab screening was in place and she was transferred on [**2181-3-7**].
