CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, status post pacemaker
placement, history of seizure disorder, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and numerous surgeries for his upper
airway, who presented with hypoxia leading to generalized
tonoclonic seizure.  The patient has a history of tracheal
stenosis malacia resulting from prolonged intubation between
[**12-19**] through [**2122-3-3**] and placement of
tracheostomy after triple layer repair complicated by
grafting section and revisions.  In [**2122-11-1**] the
patient was found to have tracheal carcinoma in-situ and
underwent multiple bronchoscopies with dilation and laser
resection, as well as bronchial stent placements.  Most
recently he underwent T tube placement in [**2124-1-1**] and
was scheduled to be replaced due to inadequate length.   On
the day of the admission, the patient presented with
respiratory failure.

Per wife, on the day of admission, the patient had come to
see his primary care physician and had come home without
event, was resting in bed and she heard him call out her
name.  He was subsequently found in bed gasping for air and
semi responsive.  He became fully unresponsive within
minutes.  EMS was called and size 4 EET was placed in the
field.  Per patient's wife he did not arouse with
intervention but his breathing became "more normal".  Per
wife, the patient had identical episode two months ago in
which he fell badly, had lied down in bed and began gasping
for air and turning [**Doctor Last Name 352**].  The patient's wife could not
report outcome of that episode with diagnosis or
intervention.

The patient was brought to Emergency Room where he was found
to be more alert, able to follow commands, however,
dysarthric, seen by Pulmonary consult fellow who recommended
transfer to Operating Room for rigid bronchoscopy.  While
awaiting Operating Room, the patient had weakness generalized
tonoclonic seizure.  The patient was treated with Ativan and
Dilantin load.  The patient has history of seizure disorder
but most recent seizure was numerous years ago.  He was taken
to the Operating Room for removal of his tracheal stents and
placement of that trach.  During the surgical exploration,
the patient had episode of desaturation to 30% despite
ventilation which lead to removal of the ET and T-tube and
placement of tracheostomy.  The patient stabilized and was
transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired pilot, has 150 pack
year smoking history, quit three years ago, and lives with
his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission revealed vital signs of
98.6, temperature of 74, blood pressure 113/64, respiratory
rate 25, O2 sat 100% on 70% face [**Year (4 digits) **].  Generally, the
patient was alert, attempting to communicate with trach [**Name2 (NI) **]
in place.  HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive to light.  Neck
was supple with no jugular venous distention, no left
anterior descending.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Examination
was significant secondary to breath sounds.  There was no
murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.  There
were normotensive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no edema.
Neurological; the patient was able to ask questions, cranial
nerves II-XII were intact, 5/5 strength in upper extremities,
[**5-5**] hip flexion plantar and dorsiflexors.

LABORATORY:  On admission revealed a white count of 12.6 with
differential of 81.4 neutrophils, 13.3 lymphocytes,
hematocrit 41.2, platelet count 291.  Sodium 143, potassium
3.9, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 31, creatinine 1.3,
blood glucose 203.  ALT 40, AST 46, alkaline phosphatase 104,

0.3.  He had negative tox screen, calcium was 9.3, phosphate
4.2, magnesium 1.8.  His urinalysis and urine cultures were
pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 65 year old
gentleman with extensive past medical history currently with
bronchial stents and tracheotomy who presented with
respiratory failure complicated by seizure.  His stent was
removed and trach was placed in the Operating Room on the
night of admission.

During this hospitalization, the patient's issues included;
1.  Neurological.  The patient was initially loaded with
Dilantin with an increase in his dose to 500 mg p.o. q.d.
During this hospitalization, the patient had one additional
episode where during sectioning he lowered his head and
became transiently not responsive for a second.  It was
unclear if that episode presented a seizure or vasovagal
episode during sectioning.  The patient's Dilantin level was
monitored and was slightly subtherapeutic leading to his
Dilantin level to final dose of 500 mg q.d.  Additionally,
the patient's Neurontin was increased to 900 mg t.i.d.  He
underwent an EEG which showed diffuse slowing more on the
right than on the left.
2.  Pulmonary.   The patient initially persisted with high
oxygen requirement, was febrile with productive cough and was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration
pneumonia.  Once the sputum culture grew Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus the patient was changed to
Vancomycin.  Because patient persisted with diffuse pulmonary
effusions on his chest x-ray he was also started on Flagyl
for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  The patient remained with
good oxygen saturations on 30-50% face [**Month/Day (1) **].  On [**2-18**],
the patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy and T tube
placement.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He is being
discharged home with VNA Services for antibiotic
administration for the remaining 11 days.  He is to follow-up
with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] as well as
Pulmonology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3.  Cardiology.  During this hospitalization, the patient did
have an episode of transient
