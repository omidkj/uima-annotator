[**2143-2-13**] TTE showed:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. A bioprosthetic [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Trace [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 y/o female who initially presented with
dizziness, found to have an [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] hematoma whose course has
been complicated hyponatremia and a UTI.
.
#) [**Month/Day/Year **] Hematoma: Patient was initially admitted with
abdominal pain and dizziness, found to have an [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] hematoma.
She was initially admitted to the CVICU for strict blood
pressure control, managed on a nitroglycerin gtt with a goal SBP
of 90 to 120.  A TTE was done that showed that her cardiac
function was intact, when she was found to be hemodynamically
stable, she was transferred to the CICU on [**2-15**].  Her coumadin
was held due to concern for possible progression of her
hematoma, and in case she needed future operative management.
Her blood pressure regimen was adjusted to keep her goal BP
under 120/80 if possible, at the time of discharge her blood
pressure was mainly in the 120's systolic on her regimen of
metoprolol 100mg TID, amlodipine 10mg daily and valsartan 160mg
daily.  A repeat CTA was done that showed her hematoma was
stable, and vascular felt that she was safe for discharge with
outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  If her blood pressure is
not at goal during her rehab stay, would avoid hydralazine and
start low dose lisinopril to help with better BP management.
She had also previously been on HCTZ 25mg daily, which would be
another option as long as her sodium is stable.
.
#) Hyponatremia: on [**2-17**] patient was first noted to be
hyponatremic with a serum Na of 128, she was initially treated
with lasix and fluid restriction.  Over the next few days her
serum sodium did not improve and she was transferred to the
medicine service for further management.  Her serum sodium
improved with normal saline over the next few days as she was
hypovolemic,  hyponatremic.
.
#) Urinary Tract Infection: on [**2-17**] patient complained of
dysuria, a urinalysis was done that was suggestive of infection
and she was initially started on cipro, a culture was done that
grew pan-sensitive enterococcus and she was treated with a 4 day
course of augmentin.
.
#) Altered Mental Status: on [**2-21**] patient was noted to be more
somnolent, a CT of her head was done that showed a question of
an old infarct, so neurology was consulted.  After their
evaluation, an MRI was recommended but due to prior stapedectomy
she was unable to undergo the MRI, it was decided that since the
lesion seen on the CT was old, she did not need an MRI.  Her
mental status improved over the next few days, and it was
thought that her dehydration and hyponatremia were likely
contributing her altered mental status.  She will follow up with
neurology as an outpatient.
.
#) Atrial Fibrillation: restarted home warfarin at 5mg daily,
uptitrated metoprolol for blood pressure control
.
#) Hypothyroidism: continued home synthroid
.
#) GERD: continued home omeprazole
