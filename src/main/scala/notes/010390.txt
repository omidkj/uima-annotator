Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname 17862**] was a same day admit after undergoing
preoperative work-up prior to admission. On [**6-6**] he was brought

Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. He continued to slowly improve and worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname 17862**] did
