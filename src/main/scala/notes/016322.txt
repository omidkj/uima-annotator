Brief Hospital Course:
34yoM w/ PMH DM Type I c/b gastroparesis, chronic renal failure,
who presents w/ nausea/vomiting and DKA.
.
#. DKA: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting (non
bloody) that he felt was c/w gastroparesis, and halved his home
Glargine because of decreased PO intake. He was found to have
sugars in the 500s and a gap of 21. The likely trigger was poor
absorption [**1-25**] gastroparesis. He was admitted to the MICU and
started on an insulin drip and IVF. Once the serum glucose<200,
he was changed to D51/2NS at 150-250cc/hr and reduced to regular
insulin infusion to 0.02-0.05U/Kg/Hr IV to keep serum glucose
between 150-200. His gap closed from 16 to 11 and he was called
out to the floor. Once the pt was able to eat, he was started on
SC multidose insulin regimen. He also underwent an infectious
workup, and blood cultures, UA/urine culture, and CXR were found
negative for acute infection. His diet was advanced and he
tolerated PO intake well with good control of sugars. He was
discharged on home Insulin regimen. However, given gastroparesis
was precipitating factor and continues to be an issue, he was
scheduled for follow-up with his endocrinologist who he had not
seen in a while for better insulin regimen and management of
gastroparesis.
.
#. Nausea/vomiting: Likely c/w gastroparesis, given consistency
w/ prior symptoms. Also on ddx are SBO which was r/o on KUB. The
patient was treated with compazine and zofran PRN in the MICU
and transitioned to home reglan and erythromycin when he started
taking POs. At time of discharge he denied nausea. He will
follow-up with endocrionologist.
.
#. CKD: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.6, On admission Cr 3.4 Likely
pre-renal in etiology given history of nausea/vomiting and
improvement w/ fluids. Medications were initially renally dosed
and nephrotoxic meds were held (ACEi). With fluids patient
trended back down to 2.4 and was restarted on ACEi.
.
#. HTN: Per the patient and his mom, he has had a long history
of difficult to control blood pressures. When the patient
presented to the ED he had very elevated pressures but did not
receive medications there. He is on clonidine and lisinopril at
home, but stated he had been unable to take his doses PM and AM
prior to admission. Given lisinopril was held during admission
his BPs continued to trend up. When he tolerated POs he was
restarted on home meds but still did not experience good
control, with DBPs notable for being in the 90s-110s. He
received a few doses of IV hydralazine for pressure control in
the setting of headaches. He was started on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
to supplement home meds and will continue further management as
an outpt with PCP.
.
# Tachycardia: Likely [**1-25**] hypovolemia, could also be reflex
tachycardia from hydralazine. Was somewhat decreased with IVF
and starting metoprolol.
