Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
54 yo W with chronic paranoia who per EMS, ED claims to be
thrown out of chair x 3 by unknown assalants. She claims this
has happened 3 times over the last week. She had called 911
multiple times and there was no sign of a struggle per EMT.
concerned that may be having psychotic issues vs syncope.
Evaluated by pysch in ED felt needed syncopy rule out. CT head
negative, CXR in ED limited by body habitis but negative.
.
On arrival to the floor. Pt claims she was not assalted, but
rather felt as though she was thrown to the floor on multiple
occasions. She denies LOC, shaking, toungue biting, loss of
bladder or bowel control. She can not further elaborate on
details of the falls. Upon arrival to the floor the pt is very
somulent. She complains of L sharp back pain [**8-4**] with walking
and right leg weakness. No numbness or tingling, no change in
bowel or bladder habits. She claims that her extreme fatigue is
new as of this am. No SOB, cough, chest pain.
.
Immediately upon arrival to floor pt triggered for tachycardia
to 180s. SaO2 to mid 80s, to 95% on 3L. Comparing radial pulse
to tele apprears tele was sensing P waves as seperate beats,
therefore the tachycardia was false. P 80-90s.
.
Soon after the pt appeared more solmulent and was noted to have
transient bradys to mid 20s with up to 3.5 sec asystolic pauses
on tele.
.
ROS: denies chest pain, cough, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation,
extremity edema.

CXR: Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, and vascular enlargement of
the hila are longstanding. There is no pulmonary edema. Pleural
effusion if any is small, on the left. Because of the technical
limitations of bedside radiography, conventional radiographs are
recommended for better evaluation of the left lower lobe. No
pneumothorax.

ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function.No structural cardiac cause of syncope
identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-6-16**], the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.

CT HEAD: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Images through the skull base are
limited due to patient motion despite rescanning. Allowing for
this, no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or infarction is seen. The soft tissues and
orbits appear intact. No evidence of fracture or bony
destruction is noted along the visualized calvarium. Mild
mucosal thickening is noted along the left maxillary sinus and
some of the ethmoid air cells. The mastoid air cells remain well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: Minimal sinus mucosal disease. Otherwise normal
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 y/o with psych history reports repeated falls intermittently
attributed to being thrown out of her chair. Unclear daily of
falls but hypoxic, hypercarbic, with bradycardia and pauses on
tele suggestive of syncope.
.
#  Paranoia: Chronic issue.  Psych was consulted during
hospitalization.  They recommended Haldol 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Also, the
patient will likely require inpatient admission in psych
facility given symptoms, complicated by patient refusal to take
meds.  Sectioned 12 by psychiatry.  Evaluated by BEST team for
placement and placed at [**Hospital1 3278**] inpatient psychiatric facility.
.
# Syncope/Pauses:  No actual documented syncope during
hospitalization.  Questionable given history of falls.  Most
likely sinus pauses are in the setting of sleep or falling to
sleep.  Given her sleep latency is likely shortened given her
significant OSA, she may have these pauses during the day.  Full
work up revealed no contributing medical source including ECHO,
CE, labs.  Cardiology consulted, and determined not to be pacer
candidate.  Pauses on tele thought by cardiology to be related
to hypercapnia.
.
# Hypercarbia, hypoxia:  Likely secondary to obesity
hypoventilation syndrome and OSA.  Evidence of OSA by pulmonary
arterty hypertension.  The patient refused to wear CPAP, became
acutely obtunded, ABG showed hypercapnia and acidosis.  She was
able to have CPAP placed during this time, however removed it 3
hours after wearing.  She then refused subsequent attempts.
Continued oxygen supplementation as this seems to help.  Had
patient sleep upright in chair.  [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from formal PFTs in
future.  Patient was called out of the ICU as she was stable.
On the floor she required supplemental O2 overnight and
occasionally durring the day.  She took frequent naps during the
day but was always easily arousable. She had no other signs or
indications of a primary pulmonary process.  The patient is
closely followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who has previously arranged a sleep
study for the patient and will continue to follow and dictate
further possible treatment for her sleep apnea. It is hoped that
as her psychiatric illness is further controlled, she will be
able to tolerate CPAP.
.
#Anemia:  Microcytic anemia.  Iron panel sent and patient found
to be iron deficient.  Patient was started on iron.  Will
eventually need outpatient GI workup for age
