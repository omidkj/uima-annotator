CT abdomen:
1) Thickened wall in long segment of sigmoid colon, consistent
with diverticulitis, unchanged. There is a small amount of
interlooped free fluid in the pelvis, not amenable to drainage.
2) Pelvic fluid collection, of uncertain origin, that was
aspirated from [**10-17**] and shown to be not contaminated, and
unchanged.

TTE: Moderate aortic regurgitation and minimal aortic stenosis
but no discrete vegetation seen (does not exclude). Regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2161-7-23**], left
ventricular systolic function is now depressed (40%). The
severity of aortic regurgitation is similar.

CXR: Right jugular dialysis catheter is in right atrium. PICC
line is in SVC, partly obscured by the dialysis catheter. Linear
atelectases are present in both lower zones. No pleural
effusion. Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine
and in the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Surgical clips are
present in the right upper quadrant status post cholecystectomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old women with ESRD on HD who
presents with fever to 103, chills, and tachycardia to 103 with
possible line infection.
.
1.  Sepsis:  The patient was initially sent to the intensive
care unit under the sepsis protocol. She was started on
vancomycin for skin flora and unasyn for Group D enterococcus
(VRE) sensitive to amp (previous infections over last year). Her
blood cultures drawn at [**Location (un) 4265**] grew out oxacillin resistant coag
negative staph. Her urine cultures were without grown.  A CXR
was obtained and was without signs of pneumonia. Once she was
stabilized, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was sent to the floor where her
tunneled catheter was removed. The tip was sent for culture but
did not grow any organisms.
Access was an issue as 3 attempts in ED failed, including one
with US. Instead a PICC was placed and eventually, after she was
free of bacteria for > 48 hours, a new tunnel line was placed.

Despite placement of a new line and clean surveillance cultures,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers. She spiked through her
vancomycin which was always re-dosed when her daily levels fell
below 15. An [**Known lastname 1676**] CT was obtained, revealing a 7 c
