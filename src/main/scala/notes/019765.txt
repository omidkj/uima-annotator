Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
CT ABDOMEN ([**2124-11-4**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
2. Focal wall thickening of descending colon of unclear etiology
however correlation with colonoscopy is recommended as indicated
to exclude a neoplastic process.
3. Atherosclerotic changes of abdominal aorta and its branches
with infrarenal ectasia without frank aneurysm. Atrophic left
kidney.
4. Previously noted enhancing bladder mass not definitively
identified today.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2124-11-8**] 3:37 PM
IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram, [**11-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-8-4**], the
findings are similar

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-11-16**] 11:29 PM
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, with a question of a
possible pulmonary infarct on the right

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-11-17**] 7:58 PM
Lateral right lower lung opacity reflects combination of
layering effusion and multifocal right-sided pneumonia as
described above. Given patient's age, postoperative status and
fairly dependent positioning, aspiration is favored. No wedge
shaped opacities to suggest infarct. Small-to-moderate bilateral
simple pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Marked narrowing of the bronchus intermedius likley related to
focal bronchomalacia. Dilated pulmonary artery.

Endoscopy:
Colonoscopy [**11-7**]:
Polyp in the transverse colon (biopsy),Polyp in the descending
colon (biopsy), Mass in the 45cm (biopsy, injection),
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon
EGD [**11-7**]: Mild erythema in the antrum and stomach body
compatible with mild gastritis, Small hiatal hernia, Submucosal
venous structure in the mid-esophagus.

Pathology:
Colon bx from colonoscopy [**11-7**]:
A)  Ascending colon polyp, biopsy: Adenoma.
B)  Transverse colon polyp, biopsy: Adenoma.
C)  Mass at 45 cm, biopsy:Colonic mucosa with a single fragment
of neoplastic epithelium. The neoplastic fragment is scant and
is not associated with intact mucosa tissue; thus, further
interpretation is not possible.  It may represent adenoma,
adenocarcinoma, or carry-over artifact.

Surgical Pathology, 11/20 L colectomy:
T3 lesion, N0 (0 of 13 nodes positive), clear margins
