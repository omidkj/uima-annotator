Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81 year-old male with a history of severe dCHF,
CAD
s/p cath [**2121**] (prox LAD), restictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial
biopsy + for amyloid, a-fib on coumadin, HTN, HL,
hypothyroidism, recently discharged s/p large-volume
pericardiocentesis presenting from home with hypotnesion.  VNA
checked patient's INR earlier in the week, came back at 5.0,
measured a blood pressure at 60/p, called EMS.  After 250 cc
bolus given by EMS, BP increased to 80/palp. On arrival to the
ED, vitals were T 98.1 HR 130s in AFib BP 73/44.  After 2 x 500
cc NS bolus, BP increased to SBP 80.  Patient was asymptomatic,
reporting no chest pain, dizziness, SOB, palpitations.  CXR
showed cardiomegaly, but decreased size compared to last week.
Echo was done at the bedside, and showed a pericardial effusion,
unlcear about the size compared to last week, no tamponade
physiology. Triple Lumen catheter was placed, and patient was
started on levofed.  At time of transfer, HR 132 BP 55/27 RR 25
97% 2L.  Foley was put in, patient had put out 275 cc by time of
transfer.
.
On review of systems, he does endorse increasing weakness and
poor PO intake the last several days.  He also reports early
satiety. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO [**12-17**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
There is a loculated pericardial effusion, measuring 2.0 cm,
behind the lateral wall of the LV with the patient in left
lateral decubitus position. There is no free-flowing pericardial
fluid elsewhere.
IMPRESSION: Loculated pericardial effusion as described above.
Biventricular wall thickening, c/w known diagnosis of cardiac
amyloidosis. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild
aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-12-9**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old male with a history of severe dCHF, CAD s/p cath
[**2121**] (prox LAD), restictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial biopsy +
for amyloid, a-fib on coumadin, HTN, HL, hypothyroidism,
recently discharged s/p large-volume pericardiocentesis
presenting from home with hypotension, dehydration.
.
#. Palliative Care: After conversation with patient and
patient's family, patient decided that he would like to go home
with hospice care and would like comfort measures only.  His
medication regimen was revised as outlined below.  Palliative
care was consulted and home hospice was set up for the patient
upon discharge.
.
#. Hypotension: Patient hypotensive at baseline, with SBPs
usually in the 80s.  Etiology of worsening hypotension was
thought to be secondary to dehydration and overdiuresis in the
setting of no PO intake for several days.  Echo showed no
increase in size of pericardial effusion and patient had no
signs of tamponade.  Torsemide was held and patient was given
IVFs.  Levophed was weaned off and patient's MAPs remained in
the 50s, at his baseline, for the remainder of the admission.
.
# CHF:  Restrictive CM with myocardial biopsy positive for
amyloid, taken last week.  Echo showed an extremely small LV
cavity.  Torsemide was held throughout admission as patient was
hypovolemic.  He was discharged with the plan to weigh himself
every day and to take torsemide iof his weight goes up by 3 lbs
in one day.  He has scheduled follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
# C. Diff Colitis: Patient began to have profuse diarrhea and C.
diff toxin came back positive.  He was discharged on PO
Vancomycin and bismuth/probiotic for symptom control.
.
#. Gout flare: Patient given a prednisone taper for gout flare
on right foot with improvement in symptoms.
.
# CAD:  Aspirin and statin was discontinued as patient made CMO
as above.
.
#. RHYTHM: Patient has chronic atrial fibrillation.  Patient
discharged on metoprolol 100 XL.  Coumadin was discontinued as
patient made CMO as above.
.
# HLD: Statin discontinued as patient made CMO as above.
.
#. OSA: Remained on CPAP.  Patient will
