Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Prednisone / Azithromycin / Trilisate / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
79 y/o woman with a history of afib, on coumadin, s/p silent
inferior MI at some point in early [**2192**] with EF 40-45%,
parkinson's disease and autonomic dysfunction, transfered to the
CCU for managment of acute pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxic
and hypercarbic respiratory arrest.
.
She was admitted originally to the floor [**6-19**] after presenting
to the ED with shortness of breath, in afib with rates to the
130s and an infiltrate on chest xray. She was treated with
levofloxacin and metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]. Cardiology was consulted for
her afib and on the afternoon of [**6-21**] she was DCCV succesfully
to sinus rhythym. Her INR had been therapeutic > 3 weeks per EP
documentation so no TEE was performed.
.
At 3am on the morning of transfer to the CCU she was noted to be
hypertensive and dyspnic. She had O2 sats in the low 90s on a
NRB and an X-ray with acute pulmonary edema. She received 2 mg
of morphine, 20 mg lasix, [**1-23**] inch of nitro paste. Telemetry
revealed a wide complex AV dissociated rhythym at a rate of
approx 100, felt likely to be monomorphic VT. This was not
captured on a 12 lead EKG. A blood gas on the floor was
7.24/56/104.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, she was started on BiPap noninvasive
ventilation, received an additional 40 mg of lasix, 2 mg of
morphine, and a nitro drip was initiated. After 10-15 minutes on
Bipap, a repeat blood gas revealed worsening acidosis:
7.13/78/83. She was then intubated. She experienced transient
post-intubation hypotension responsive to 200mcg, then 100mcg
neosynephrine. She was breifly on dopamine.
.
ROS: Not obtained in full from patient due to extremis. Of note,
she was seen by her cardiologist on the day of admission (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with generalized aches and pains and increased
fatigue. At that time she was in atrial fibrillation and while
most of her symptoms were felt to be attributable to her PD, her
rate control was submoptimal with a pulse in the 100s. She was
increased to 37.5 toprol XL and her aldactone was decreased from
25 to 12.5mg and lisinpril decreased to 5mg from 20mg because of
concern for orthostatic hypothesnion given her known autonomic
dysfunction. She presented later that day to the ED.

11. Back pain
12. Hearing loss

14. Basal cell carcinoma
15. Osteoarthritis - neck and back pain - tylenol does not help,
so she does not take it


Social History:
Patient lives at home alone in [**Location (un) **], MA. Her husband died
last month at [**Hospital1 18**]. She is not living with her daughter,
because of too many stairs and feeling unsafe getting in and out
of her house.
Patient has 2 children that are close by and help them with some
of the shopping and ADL's. They have a cleaning woman 2X per
week. She has hired a caregiver to come 8:30AM-12:30PM - gives
her sponge bath, helps put on shoes and helps with morning
activities due to severe osteoarthritis pain and stiffness.
Patient receives [**Hospital1 16429**] on wheels as well as does shopping via
peapod. She uses a walker when she feels "unsteady" as she has
felt for the past week.

Family History:
Her parents died when they were in their 60s, her mother of
renal disease, her father of heart disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CARDIOVERSION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
The patient was initially admitted to the hospital on [**6-19**] with
a diagnosis of pneumonia. She was treated for several days with
Levofloxacin, but continued to be short of breath. She was in
atrial fibrialltion with a rate of approx 100, and it was
thought that cardioversion to normal sinus rhythym might help
her symptoms. She was succesfully cardioverted to sinus rhythym
on [**2193-6-21**].  Later that evening, however, she developed acute
pulmonary edema and required transfer to the CCU, intubation,
and mechanical ventialtion. During this period of stress, she
was noted to be in an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. She
was hemodynmaically stable and this rhythm resolved to normal
sinus rhythm without specific treatment. She was extubated the
next day and transfered to the floor. She remained in normal
sinus rhythm after cardioversion until discharge.

# HYPERTENSION AND DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
Her blood pressure and heart failure medications were titrated
to the doses on which she is being discharged. Her hospital
course was complicated by one episode of hypotension thought to
be due to hydralazine 10 mg PO, which was administered for
hypertension (SBP 175).  Her episode of hypotension resolved
with intravenous fluids and her blood pressure remained stable
to slighlty elevated prior to discharge.  To better control her
blood pressure and for pedal edema, an additional medication was
added (lasix 10 mg).  It is anticipated that she will require
this medication for the short term, approximately one week.
Also, of note, the timing of the patients medications,
lisinopril at night and spironolactone, lasix, metoprolol in the
AM is important to adhere to as per her home regimen (with the
exception of lasix which is new). Dr.[**Name (NI) 14643**] office was
contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to discharge for followup within one week of
discharge from rehabilitation to monitor her outpatient blood
pressure and adjust medications as needed (currently schedule
for [**7-17**]).

# PARKINSON'S DISEASE
She has parkinson's disease and labile blood pressure. T
