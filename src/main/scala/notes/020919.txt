History of Present Illness:
HPI: 82 year old male MMP including HTN, past strokes, dementia,
dysphagia and diffuse pain syndrome who presents with
respiratory distress in the setting of vomiting. Per nursing
report at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab at 5:30pm the patient had a small amount
of coffee ground emesis, and oxygenation saturation dropped to
87%. He was placed on oxygen and his saturations did not
respond. Other vitals at that time BP 160/100, P 92, RR: 30,
Temp: 98.6. EMS was called. EMS found the patient tachypneic in
the 40s and intubated his for respiratory distress with nasal
tube. The patient was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was found to
have BP 105/66, RR: 20, P: 86, Temp (rectal) 99.0, O2 sat 100%
FiO2 60%, PEEP 5, CMV, with versed bolus for sedation. Patient
NG tube revealed hemocult positive material. CXR showed
bilateral lower lobe infiltrates consistent with aspiration.
Patient was given 40 mg protonix IV and a versed bolus. The
patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 48.8. He was
transfered to the MICU for further monitoring and care.
.
Per [**Hospital **] rehab, at baseline the patient is alert and
conversive but not ambulatory. He is incontinent of bowel and
bladder and dependent in all of his adls. Per his wife he ate a
very large lunch and soon afterwards began to spit up small
amounts of material into a tissue.

Studies
[**2104-6-12**] CXR: b/l lower lobe dense consolidation suggestive of
aspiration
.
CXR [**6-23**] In comparison with the study of [**6-22**], the degree of
pulmonary
vascular congestion radiographically has somewhat decreased.
Areas of
increased opacification are again seen bilaterally that could
reflect pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is in
the midline, so that there is no evidence of substantial volume
loss in the left hemithorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 82 year old male w/ CAD, HTN, vascular disease, chronic
dysphagia 2' hiatal hernia, and dementia who presents from rehab
after an episode of vomiting and aspiration.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Was intubated [**6-11**] w/ hypoxic respiratory
distress and pleural effusions. Pt was diagnosed with an
aspiration PNA w/ Klebsiella growing in sputum cx's on [**6-12**],
that were pan-sensitive and treated w/ ceftriaxone (10 day
course completed [**6-26**]). His aspiration is likely [**1-5**] his large,
chronic hiatal hernia. He was previously covered emperically for
vanc/zosyn/cipro until his speciations returned. He also had
bilateral dense infilatrates on chest x-ray c/w aspiration PNA
and pleural effusions, which did not need to be tapped. He also
has episodes of apnea attributed to dementia vs sedating meds
(morphine, fentanyl, ativan).  He was extubated on 7.18, and his
ABG remained appropriate. Pt was continued on NC on the floor
and at discharge has O2 Sat 96% on 2L NC. His sputum returned +
for MRSA colonization on 7.21, and he was placed on precautions.
 He was OOB and given chest PT. He was diuresed w/ Lasix as
needed but on discharge is off lasix.
.
# Hiatal Hernia: No actively bleeding vessels were seen on upper
endoscopy, so there was less concern for [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears 2'
to vomiting. PO access was difficult to obtain on this patient,
as he failed his first S&S test, and was not a candidate for
open J-tube or endoscopic Dobhoff placement by GI due to his
MMPs and hiatal hernias, respectively. He was started on TPN for
~3 days ending [**6-24**]. He passed S&S test on 7.21, and his PO meds
were restarted and his diet was advanced as tolerated. See
discharge instructions for precautions for feeding.
.
# Hypernatremia: Patient was hypernatremic w/ Na up to 148 and a
FWD 2.2. Likely multifactorial etiologies (diuresis induced, 2'
to TPN, and decreased PO free water intake, hypercalcemic, =>
blocking ADH at the level of the collecting tubules, leading to
a DI-like diuresis).  He was treated w/ D5W maintenance, and Na
was checked daily. He was encouraged to take water PO and
transition off of TPN. His TPN levels of Na and Calcium
gluconate were also reduced. At time of discharge, pt is off TPN
and lasix, taking PO and has a Na of 144 which has been normal
for 4 days.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Calcium was elevated to 10.5, free calc to
1.44. Likely related to immobilization vs. possible low
phosphate 2' to refeeding syndrome. Ionized calcium 1.44,
decreased to 1.39 ([**6-23**]) w/ PO4 repletion. Pt not symptomatic
(has dementia and poor stooling at baseline), no
bisphosphonates. PTH and AP WNL, unlikely malignancy or primary
hyperthyroidism.  Can also occur w/ hypothyroidsm. Ca at
discharge is 10.8. Consider checking TSH as outpt.  Pt will need
Ca levels followed up at [**Hospital1 1501**] and also should consider IVF there
for treatment of hypercalcemia.
.
# Elevated INR: Had an INR up to 2.4 this admission, likely 2'
to vitamin K deficiency, not on coumadin. He was given vit K IV
x1, and his INR resolved to 1.2 where it remained until
discharge.
.
# Dementia:  Donepezil was held until patient passed S&S, then
he was restarted on home dose of donepezil PO.
.
# Hypotension: No acute bleeds noted on endoscopy, hct stable
between 32-35. He was initially re-started on Metoprolol IV, and
the rest of his antihypertensives were held (lisinopril). He had
an episode of low BPs to 80s o/n on 7.21, and his
antihypertensives were held thereafter.  At discharge, pt off
lasix, lisinopril and metoprolol with BP 154/90.
.
# Dysphagia: passed S&S.  Discharged on pureed food and nectar
thick liquids.
.
# Pain: Has chronic back pain. Was given morphine PRN for back
pain but this was d/c'd with concerns for possibility of
altering mental status. Discharged on PRN tylenol.
.
# + blood cx's: Patient had Blood cx's from [**6-12**] positive for
GPCs/GNRs (Corynebacterium/Propionibacterium). Patient did not
exhibit a septic picture (low grade
