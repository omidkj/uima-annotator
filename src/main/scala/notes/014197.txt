CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 78-year-old man transferred from [**Hospital6 4874**] status post myocardial infarction,
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 78-year-old man with past
medical history significant for PMR, hypertension, with no
known history of coronary artery disease, who presented at
outside hospital complaining of chest pressure radiating to
neck when using a snow-blower.  Pain subsided with rest, but

x1 year.

The patient was treated with Lopressor and started on Heparin

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Heart rate 77, blood
pressure 151/93, respiratory rate 20 and O2 sat is 98% on 2
liters.  General:  Pleasant-elderly man well appearing in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils 1.5 mm.  Oropharynx is moist.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with marked
diminished breath sounds throughout.  Heart:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, normal S1, S2 with no murmur.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities with 2+ edema to the left ankle, 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.2, BUN 31,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 130.  White count 8.7, hematocrit
35.7, platelets 196, INR 0.9.  CK 162, MB 7.9, troponin 40.6.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus rhythm at 94, normal axis, and
normal intervals.  J-point elevated in V4-5 with early R-wave
progression.

CHEST X-RAY:  No effusions or infiltrates.  No emphysematous
changes.

The day after admission, the patient was brought to the
catheterization laboratory, where he underwent cardiac
catheterization.  Please see catheterization report for full
details.  Summary of his catheterization showed 2+ mitral
regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 45%, left main 70%
lesion, left anterior descending artery, no significant
disease, left circumflex 80% at the origin, ostia 99%
proximal, 100% in the distal.

CT Surgery was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted
for coronary artery bypass grafting plus or minus mitral
valve repair/replacement.  On [**2-11**], the patient was
brought to the operating room at which time, he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with a mitral valve
repair.  Please see OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x4
with a LIMA to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft to OM and ramus sequentially, and saphenous vein
graft to the distal right coronary artery, and a mitral valve
repair with a #28 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  The patient tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the operating room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient was receiving milrinone
at 0.25 mcg/kg/minute, Neo-Synephrine at 1.5 mcg/kg/minute,
and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/minute.  The patient was extubated
shortly after arrival in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, he developed stridor after extubation, and was
immediately reintubated.  He showed a respiratory acidosis.

Transesophageal echocardiogram was done at that time, which
showed the patient to be underfilled.  He was given volume
and he responded well.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  An attempt to decrease the sedation
and wean his ventilation was unsuccessful.  The patient was
resedated and remained on full ventilatory support.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable on Esmolol, Levophed and milrinone.
He also remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.  His
milrinone was weaned off.  He did have a period of atrial
fibrillation, and was started on amiodarone at that time.

On postoperative day three, patient became somewhat hypoxic
as sputum production increased and he was empirically started
on ceftriaxone, and sputum cultures were sent at that time.

Over the next two days, the patient was weaned from his
cardioactive intravenous medications.  Sputum culture is
being positive for Pseudomonas and his antibiotics were
changed from ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.

On postoperative day six, the patient was weaned from his
ventilator and successfully extubated.  He remained in the
Intensive Care Unit at that time.  Because of continuous
respiratory status with vigorous chest PT as well as
antibiotics, the patient's respiratory status continued to
improve over the next several days.

On postoperative day nine, it was decided that he was stable
and ready to be transferred to Far Two for continued
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next
several days on the floor, the patient with the assistance of
the nursing staff and physical therapy, he increased his
activity level.  He remained hemodynamically stable
throughout that period.

On postoperative day 15, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility.  At the time of transfer, the patient's condition
is stable.

His physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs:
Temperature 98.2, heart rate 87, blood pressure 108/58,
respiratory rate 20, and O2 sat is 94% on room air.  Weight
preoperatively is 81.6 kg and at discharge it is 94.6 kg.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 31, platelets
388, INR of 2.5.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.9, chloride 107,
CO2 15, BUN 34, creatinine 1.2, glucose 76.

On physical exam, alert and oriented times three.  Moves all
extremities.  Follows commands.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, S1, S2 with no murmur.  Sternum is stable.
Incision with Steri-Strips, opened to air, clean and dry.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2-3+
pedal edema bilaterally.  Right leg incision with
Steri-Strips opened to air clean and dry.
