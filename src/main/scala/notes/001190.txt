Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
Milrinone infusion
admission to the cardiac intensive care unit
right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109642**] is 77M with h/o systolic and diastolic CHF, a-fib,
cardiac amyloidosis, and multiple myeloma transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] initially for volume overload and need for lasix
drip and chemotherapy.
The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-6-5**], at
which time RV biopsy demonstrated cardiac amyloidosis, as well
as a bone marrow biopsy with e/o multiple myeloma. ECHO showed
e/o new systolic heart failure on top of preexisting diastolic
heart failure and is s/p cardiac catheterization with e/o 50%
left main disease, 50% LAD stenosis.
Since discharge, the patient reports weight gain, as well as
DOE. He denies orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. He waited until he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2178-7-22**]
where he was noted to have elevated JVD and 3+ LE edema. Lasix
was switched to torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] with continued spironolactone
50mg daily.
When he initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], the patient was
noted to have change in mental status that was attributed to
uremia, [**Last Name (un) **], and medication side effect from torsemide. He also
had a bandemia of 9% and was initially treated for a potential
UTI. His CXR showed recurrent right pleural effusion. He was
treated for acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart
failure with IV lasix but of note this was limited by his BP's.
Weight prior to discharge from [**Location (un) 620**] 105kg.
While on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was being diuresed on
Lasix drip 30 mg/hour, with diuresis limited by increasing
creatinine. After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], it was thought that
the patient could benefit from milronone drip in the setting of
having a Swan placed to measure his wedge and his CO. The
patient also has an element of systolic failure, which could
also be improved with milronone.
On transfer to the floor, the patient reports feeling well.

Cardiac Cath Report [**8-19**]: Elevated right- and left-sided filling
pressures, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension in the
setting of left-sided heart failure, large V waves suggestive of
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  Normal cardiac output
and index.

EKG [**2178-8-25**]
Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block. Left axis
deviation. Left
anterior fascicular block. Old inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2178-8-22**] no significant changes are
noted.

CXR [**2178-8-20**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a Swan-Ganz catheter.  The catheter needs to be
pulled back given that the tip is projecting over distal parts
of the right pulmonary artery.  An opacity that pre-existed at
the bases of the right upper lobe is no longer visible. However,
the lung volumes have decreased and a small pleural effusion is
unchanged at the right lung base.  Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly.  The right PICC line is constant in position.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
1.  No hydronephrosis.  Simple bilateral renal cysts.
2.  Right pleural effusion and trace of ascites seen in the
right upper
quadrant.
3.  Arterial and venous flow is documented within each of the
kidneys,
however, further Doppler analysis cannot be performed as the
patient is unable to hold his breath.
Social Work:
Family has met w/ palliative team and wife expresses that the
conversation is "premature". Pt and wife have not signed DNR and
still solidifying long-term plans. Pt, wife and [**Name2 (NI) **] are aware of
life expectancy ([**7-21**] mos) and reiterated to SW and physician
that Pt is going to optimize highest
