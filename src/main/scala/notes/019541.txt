Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic ulcer of the right heel.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right below-knee popliteal artery to distal
posterior tibial artery bypass with nonreversed right lesser
saphenous vein.


History of Present Illness:
This 79-year-old gentleman has had a previous
left femoral to posterior tibial bypass. He has developed an
ischemic heel ulcer on the right, and an attempt at salvage
of this foot with a percutaneous intervention proved
unsuccessful. His angiogram showed that he had a peroneal
artery in continuity to his ankle, but his only runoff vessel
into his foot was his posterior tibial artery, and he is now
undergoing a bypass. His greater saphenous vein has
previously been harvested. Ultrasound showed that his lesser
saphenous vein was good.

ECHO Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wireis seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Severely depressed LVEF.


LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid inferior -  akinetic;
basal inferolateral - akinetic;
mid inferolateral - akinetic;
anterior apex - akinetic;
septal apex- akinetic;
inferior apex - akinetic;
lateral apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
(2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:

The left atrium is normal in size.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior,
inferolateral and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
No definite left ventricular thrombus seen (cannot exclude).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2135-5-19**], the
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted [**2137-3-10**]

Because of Pacer - EP consult - they recommended increase
beta-blockers. They also left a handout noting that the pt has a
ICD, which is made by [**Company **], model # 7277 [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 19961**],
hasbeen recalled. This device can have a battery shorting
action. It has been seen in 1:10,000.

Cardiology consult - Recommended that ICD generator change needs
to be done in next few months ( battery failure is NOT
imminant). Also recommended increase beta-blockers for HR 50 -
60 BPM.

[**2137-3-12**]

Pt underwent a right below-knee popliteal artery to distal
posterior tibial artery bypass with nonreversed right lesser
saphenous vein. The Procedure was without complications. The pt
was transfered to the PACU in stable condition. The pt recovered
from anesthesia with out complications. He was transfered to the
floor in stable condition.

[**2137-3-13**]

Patient experienced tachycardia with slight ectopy. BP remained
stable. Pt was beta blocked. C/W asa, monitered for CHF - in
setting of PRBC.

[**2137-3-14**]

Pt experienced acute SOB, hypoxia, HTN episode - pt moved to the
SICU. Percipitating factor was related to CHF secondary to vol
overload. Pt R/O MI. Pt was diuresed, Nitro was stared for HTN
episode. Pt turnrd the corner on or about [**2137-3-16**]. He was then
transferd to the regular floor.

[**2137-3-16**]

Pt foley catheter was removed, PT/Casemanagement consults put
in. CVL was dc'd.
Pt was allowed to get OOB to chair. he experienced no
difficulties. Pt meds were adjusted by the CHF service. Pt
responded well.

[**2137-3-18**]

Pt experienced pain in left arm. There was swelling at the site,
warm to touch, with slight erythema. Ortho was consulted on
[**2137-3-19**] - they recommended films, ESR. CRP, US and a tap, which
they will analyze. These were put in and done accordingly. They
are R/O infection, bursitis and or DVT.
