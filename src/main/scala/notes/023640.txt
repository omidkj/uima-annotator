CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from outside
hospital after ventricular tachycardia with AICD shock times
two this morning in the setting of a potassium of 3.0.

The patient is a 62-year-old gentleman transferred from an
outside hospital for an AICD workup after multiple shocks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ventricular
tachycardia with AICD placement in [**2167**].  Revised most
recently here at [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**2172-1-9**].  History of coronary artery disease with
cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 25%  Has a mechanical
mitral valve placement.

The patient was in his usual state of health until 10 days
ago when he noted increased lower extremity edema and short
of breath.  The patient progressively worsened and came to
the emergency department of an outside hospital [**2172-7-4**] for a
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The patient
progressively diuresed with Lasix and Zaroxolyn with good
symptomatic response.  However, the patient has fluctuating
electrolytes and on [**2172-7-7**] in the early morning went into
V-tach and was shocked three times then recurred and shocked
three more times and was found to have a potassium of 3.0 at
that time.

He is currently on a regimen of Amiodarone and Mexiletine to
suppress ventricular tachycardia and to make the ventricular
tachycardia more responsive to the shocks.  After shocks the
patient's labs were corrected and he was transferred here for
AICD interrogation and evaluation.

on room air.  The  patient was an obese older gentleman in no
acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Mucous

LABS:  White count 7.2, hematocrit 42.4, platelet 106, SMA 7
139, 4.1.  96/27, BUN 51, creatinine 2.3, glucose 120,
calcium 8.7, alk phos 5.3, mag 2.5.  The patient had a
prothrombin time of 19.4, INR 2.5, PTT 22.8.

The patient's last echo in [**2172-1-9**] which showed focal
systolic left ventricular dysfunction, mechanical mitral
valve normal.  EF 25%

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  V. Tach.  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.
The patient was taken to the EP Laboratory where the patient
had a NIPS, non-invasive procedure done.  The patient had an
oblation was then done of the V-tach, this was unsuccessful.
The patient returned to the EP- laboratory on [**2172-7-16**] for a
experiment cold tip catheterization which was successful in
ablating his ventriculoperitoneal focus.

After [**7-16**] the patient had no more runs of ventricular
tachycardia.  The patient's Mexiletine was stopped after
[**2172-7-16**] successful cold tip catheterization.

2.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient admitted with
increased lower extremity swelling, short of breath, the
patient was continued to be diuresed with Lasix, Zaroxolyn.
Zaroxolyn was discontinued after the patient was deemed to be
uvolemic.  The patient was returned back to his normal dose
of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with resolvement in congestive
heart failure symptoms.

3.  Renal.  The patient admitted with a creatinine of 2.3,
unknown baseline creatinine, most likely this was an acute
renal failure on top of chronic renal failure.  The patient's
Lasix was held initially.  The patient's creatinine
stabilized and was discharged with a creatinine of 2.1.

4.  Heme.  The patient admitted with an INR of 2.5, however,
the patient's Coumadin was held secondary to EP studies.  The
patient was transitioned to Heparin.  The patient had EP
study done the second and again on the 9th with successful
catheterization on the 9th.  The patient was kept on Heparin
and transitioned over to Coumadin.  The patient was
discharged on both Heparin drip and Coumadin dose at 7.5 mg q
day.  The goal is to have the patient therapeutic on Coumadin
with an INR ranging between 2.5 and 3.5 prior to discharge
from the rehabilitation.

The patient had a hematocrit of 42.4 on admission, the
patient's hematocrit was stable however after the patient's
[**7-16**] procedure the patient had an episode of epistaxis.  After
epistaxis the patient's hematocrit dropped to 27 the patient
was transfused as needed.  After the procedure the patient's
hematocrit stabilized and after discharge the hematocrit was
30.7.

5.  ID:   The patient on [**2172-7-19**] developed symptoms of
dysuria.  The patient had a positive urine culture for E.
coli.  The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice
a day.  The patient had two doses prior to discharge.  The
patient will follow-up with a seven day course of
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a da

6.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  The patient admitted with multiple
medications for high blood pressure.  The patient's Atenolol
25 mg was increased and switched over to Lopressor 75 mb
twice a day.  The patient's Losartan was discontinued and the
patient was started on Hydralazine and was discharged with 20
mg b.i.d.  with blood pressures on discharge in the 130 to
140/60 to 70 range.

7.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient had anxiety issues related to
the number of shocks or to the possibility of the patient
being shocked.  Psychiatry was consulted.  They felt it was
necessary to start the patient on low dose of Klonopin.  The
patient was started on .5 mg of Klonopin b.i.d.  The patient
discharged on this dose.  The patient without anxiety upon
discharge.  The patient told to follow-up with his therapist.
