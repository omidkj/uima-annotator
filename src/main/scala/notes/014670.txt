HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
woman with a history of thyroid cancer who is status post
thyroidectomy in [**2148**], which was complicated by left vocal
cord paralysis.  On [**7-10**] of this year the patient
underwent thyroplasty at [**State 350**] Eye & Ear Institute
with medialization of the left vocal cord.  On [**7-15**] of
this year, the patient had increased edema of the vocal cords
as well as tenderness and edema of the left side of her neck,
and was subsequently admitted to the ENT Service at [**Hospital1 1444**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity.
2.  Crohn's disease.
3.  Status post ileostomy.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with apparent
restrictive picture.  Pulmonary function tests from [**7-5**]
revealed FVC of 53% or predicted, FEV1:FVC ratio of 98% or
predicted, and an FEV1 of 52% or predicted.
5.  Thyroid cancer, status post thyroidectomy in [**2148**]
complicated by left vocal cord paralysis.
6.  "Irregular heart beat."  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
history of ventricular ectopy.
7.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
8.  History of osteoporosis.
9.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  PERCOCET, NEURONTIN, PROPULSID, MOTRIN,
CLINDAMYCIN, KEFLEX, CIPROFLOXACIN, PENICILLIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications included
Phos-Lo, lithium, Coumadin, albuterol, Nephrocaps, Miacalcin,
Atrovent, Serevent, maprotiline, Prilosec, Premarin,
Synthroid, Serax.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has never been married.  She
denies any drug or alcohol abuse.  The patient has a
45-pack-year history of smoking; she quit three years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient vitals were
noted to be as follows:  Temperature 98.2, heart rate 74,
blood pressure 112/60, respirations 24 per minute, satting
96% on 50% oxygen.  Physical examination revealed a patient
who somewhat uncomfortable.  She exhibited audible stridor
both on inspiratory and expiratory breathing.  The patient's
larynx was found to have swelling over the arytenoid, and
there was swelling over the left arytenoid and diffuse
erythema as well as general edema throughout both vocal
cords.  The neck was found to be soft and nontender.  Chest
examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with
intermittent rales.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on admission revealed the
patient to be osteopenic.  There was some question of
possible tracheal deviation in the mediastinum, and the
patient was thought to have a very very small pleural
effusion on the left.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Complete blood count revealed
a white blood cell count of 9.8, hemoglobin of 12.4,
hematocrit of 44, platelets 280.  INR 1.6.  Chem-7 revealed a
sodium of 137, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 98, bicarbonate
of 22, BUN of 26, creatinine of 6.6, and glucose of 126.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   As mentioned above, the patient was
admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] ENT
Service.  She was given steroids and antibiotics.  A
bronchoscopy revealed her airway diameter to be approximately
3 mm, which was insufficient for intubation.  Because the
patient's neck edema, her Coumadin was briefly discontinued
on [**2153-7-15**], and her right arm AV fistula subsequently
clotted.

On [**2153-7-17**], the patient was seen by transplant surgery
who successfully reopened the patient's AV fistula.  The
patient received a short course of dialysis that day and
received a full course of dialysis the following day.  The
patient was maintained on a heparin drip and was loaded with
Coumadin in order to keep her AV fistula opened.

On the morning of discharge, as mentioned above, the patient
received a full course of dialysis.  She also was seen by
Interventional Radiology who performed a fistulogram which
revealed that the patient had some stenosis in the central
brachial vein at the site of the surgical patch.  It was felt
that this are would not be amenable to PTA because of the
recent surgical intervention.

It should be noted that initially the patient was under the
care of the ENT Service and in the Intensive Care Unit
because of her airway instability.  However, following
administration of steroids and antibiotics, her laryngeal and
neck edema and tenderness decreased significantly such that
she was felt to be stable enough to be transferred to the
floor.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Service on
the evening of [**2153-7-17**], where her preoperative regimen
was continued.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Laryngeal edema.
2.  Thyroid cancer.
3.  Status post thyroidectomy (in [**2148**] complicated by left
vocal cord paralysis).
4.  Status post thyroplasty (on [**2153-7-10**]) with
medialization of left vocal cord.
5.  End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity.
6.  Crohn's disease.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  Bipolar disorder.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:   The patient was discharged on her
home medication regimen.  This included the above-mentioned
medications.  The patient was also given prescriptions for
azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days.  The patient
received a prescription for Medrol dose pack as well.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Upon discharge, the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs.  She had a blood pressure
of 122/70, heart rate of 66, breathing 16 times per minute.
Her temperature was 98.7 degrees.  Laboratories on the
morning of discharge included a complete blood count of 7.1
and a hematocrit of 44.  On examination, the patient was
noted to be watching television and receiving dialysis, in no
acute distress.  Her mucous membranes were moist.  Her neck
incision was clean, dry and intact with no increased swelling
or erythema.  Her heart examination revealed a regular rate
and rhythm without murmur, rubs or gallops.  Chest
examination revealed good air movement bilaterally without
wheezes.  Abdominal examination revealed ileostomy to be in
place without erythema or drainage.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
