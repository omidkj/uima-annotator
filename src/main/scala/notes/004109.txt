Admission Date:  [**2149-5-13**]       Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:   [**2102-12-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL ICU

REASON FOR TRANSFER:  Management of liver failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
woman with past medical history as listed below who was
transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for further management of
acute hepatitis.  She was in her usual state of health until
four days prior to admission there when she developed right
upper quadrant/epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.  Family
members also reported that they thought that she looked
jaundiced.  Additionally, she reported chills and temperature
to 101 at home.  She denied any hematemesis, saying that when
she vomited that it was bilious.  Her stools were noted to be
[**Male First Name (un) 1658**] colored and smaller in caliber than usual.  She denied
any sick contacts or recent travel.  She had started no new
medications and denied the use of alcohol or intravenous drug
use.  Of note, she reported that her ex-husband (divorced
three years ago) had a history of hepatitis C.

At [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, right upper quadrant ultrasound on the
day of admission was initially normal.  Her transaminases
rose rapidly to the range of [**2146**] to 3000 with INR of 2.1 at
the time of transfer.  Hepatitis serologies and autoimmune
studies were sent, most of which were still pending at the
time of transfer.

At the time of admission to [**Hospital1 188**], she complained of continuing right upper quadrant
pain.  She denied further nausea, vomiting, chills or fever.
In addition, she reported a thirty pound weight gain over the
previous few months as well as increased abdominal girth over
the previous week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Open cholecystectomy in [**2124**].
2.  Status post appendectomy.
3.  Depression.
4.  Multiple benign breast masses.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix.
2.  Morphine p.r.n.
3.  Klonopin 0.5 mg three times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her 21 year old
daughter and her father.  She reports ongoing smoking with
greater than thirty pack year history.  She has a history of
suicide attempts in the past by overdose with benzodiazepines
but denied again any active drug use.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Percocet.
3.  Remeron.
4.  Vicodin.
5.  Trazodone.
6.  Neurontin.
7.  Compazine.

This list was obtained from the patient's local pharmacy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed the
patient was afebrile at 98.2., heart rate 74, blood pressure
113/55, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 97% in room
air.  Pertinent physical findings included that she was obese
and jaundiced.  She had scleral icterus.  Her heart and lung
examinations were without significant findings.  Her
abdominal examination revealed tenderness over the right
upper quadrant, liver palpable approximately 3.0 centimeters
below the costal margin.  Cholecystectomy scar was noted.
She had no stigmata of chronic liver disease or elevated
portal pressures. She had no asterixis on examination.
Extremities revealed no palmar erythema, cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, complete blood count was
unremarkable.  Chem7 revealed sodium of 136, potassium 5.1,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine within normal limits.  INR
on admission was 2.1.  Liver function tests revealed ALT
2481, AST 3416, alkaline phosphatase 203, total bilirubin
16.3, direct bilirubin 9.9, total protein 5.3, albumin 2.9.
Numerous serologies looking at possible causes of her liver
disease were still pending at the outside hospital at the
time of transfer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Acute hepatitis - Upon admission, blood was sent for
numerous studies to determine the etiology of her acute
hepatitis.  Things that were examined included hepatitis A, B
and C serologies, hepatitis B and C viral loads, EBV, CMV,
HSV serologies, HIV, varicella, RPR, toxoplasma and
ceruloplasmin.  Ultimately, these results yielded an etiology
consistent with acute hepatitis B as her hepatitis B surface
antigen returned positive.  All other studies were negative.
She was treated supportively for her acute hepatitis B with
coagulation studies being followed very closely.  Her liver
enzymes remained stable.  On [**2149-5-16**], without any signs of
hepatic encephalopathy, the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.  While still in
the Intensive Care Unit and upon transfer to the floor, the
patient had been treated with Morphine including a PCA for
her severe abdominal pain.  On [**2149-5-18**], the patient became
acutely more encephalopathic and was transferred to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit, placed on the transplant list
for possible liver transplant.  While awaiting a liver, the
patient admitted to recent intravenous drug use, specifically
the use of Heroin.  Her admission of illicit drug use
precluded her from getting a liver transplant and she was
transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit back to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, she continued to decline neurologically with
worsening encephalopathy, increasing asterixis and eventually
significant lethargy and obtundation.  Her INR continued to
elevate and, at the time of readmission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, her INR was 6.8.  On [**2149-5-22**], the
patient's INR reached its highest point of 25.0.  At that
time, hematology was consulted regarding reversal of her INR.
It was recommended that she be given daily Vitamin K , fresh
frozen plasma, and cryoglobulins for fibrinogen less than 150
and Factor VII-A was suggested for acute bleeding or if any
procedure was needed to be performed.

On [**2149-5-24**], the patient's mental status deteriorated further
and she was ultimately intubated for airway support.
Neurosurgery was consulted at that time.  After reversal of
INR to normal levels, intracerebral pressure monitor (BOLT)
was placed for monitoring of her intracranial pressure.  Her
intracranial pressure was solid and maintained at level of
less than 25 with a cerebral perfusion pressure greater than
50.  At one point, her intracranial pressure rose to a level
of 24 at which time she was treated with 20 grams of
intravenous Mannitol.  In the interim, the patient had
developed acute renal failure and was essentially anuric
becoming incredibly volume overloaded with all the blood
products she was receiving.  Once the BOLT was placed, it was
necessary to maintain an INR of less than 1.5.  For this, she
received very frequent transfusions of fresh frozen plasma,
Factor VII-A, cryoglobulins and platelets for levels that
were less than 70,000.  Renal was consulted and CVVH was
instituted in the Intensive Care Unit for volume removal as
well as to help with the elevation in intracranial pressure.
This treatment continued until [**2149-5-30**], in that the patient
received frequent blood products and CVVH for volume removal.
The patient's platelets were found to fall precipitously and
Heparin dependent antibodies were checked finding that she
was HIT positive.  For this, Heparin could not be used in the
CVVH and the CVVH filter clotted.  Citrate was used
alternatively as an anticoagulant (see renal below) and
ultimately as the patient showed no signs of improvement in
her hepatic function, it was decided after a family meeting
on [**2149-5-30**], that once the CVVH filter clotted off again that
it would not be restarted.  That was the case on [**2149-5-30**],
after which time, CVVH was not restarted.  The patient had
her BOLT removed and has since been monitored for progressive
neurologic decline.  At the time of this dictation, there is
evidence of cerebral herniation in that her pupils are fixed
and dilated bilaterally.  She continues to be sedated on the
ventilator so the neurologic examination is difficult beyond
that, however, without any improvement in her liver synthetic
function, her prognosis is grime.  The patient was made "Do
Not Resuscitate" after a family meeting.

Liver enzymes have trended downward and are actually below
normal limits suggesting that hepati
