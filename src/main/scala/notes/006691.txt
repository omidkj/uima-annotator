Chief Complaint:
Bleeding from ostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
TIPS ([**6-28**])

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 65 year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and h/o
bladder cancer s/p ileal loop who transferred from OSH with
bleeding from his ostomy site.
He initially presented [**6-17**] with bleeding from ileal loop since
the evening of [**6-16**]. He reported ??????spirting?????? of blood from his
ostomy.

His initial Hct was 18.6 at 0230. He was given a total of 5UPRBC
per nursing signout and most recent Hct at 2100 was 22.4 ( down
from 25 at 1823).  At 2pm he underwent scope by GI that showed
peri ??????stomal varices and evidence of recent bleeding. Upper EGD
showed non-bleeding varices. At 3pm he had a large bleed with
clots from the stoma. EBL 2400cc Pressure dressing applied and
he was started on octreotide at 50mcg/hour and systolic blood
pressure dropped to 83-78 so he was started on neosynephrine
peripherally.

His INR was 1.6 and it is unclear how many units of [**Name (NI) 9087**] he
received, but it was between 2 and 5 units.  Prior to transfer
he became hypotensive with SBPs in the low 80s and was
transiently started on a neosyneprhine gtt peripherally.

His Neopsynephrine was dc??????d during [**Location (un) **] because he was
normotensive.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for
possible TIPS.

Of note, the patient had a similar bleed 3 weeks ago which
resolved spontaneously amd for which the patient did not seek
medical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
DATA:
[**6-17**] OSH GI Procedure:
Ileoscopy to the proximal end of the ileal loop: Both ureteral
orifices were identified and appear intact, There was no
bleeding or bleeding site noted, but he did have some peri
stomal varices noted, some with stigmata of bleeding.  EGD
showed distal erosive esophagitis. 2 esophageal variceal chains;
1+ portal gastropathy and mild fundal variceal, and small
duodenal varices.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 65 year old gentleman with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis, metastatic bladder cancer s/p radical resection, CAD,
HTN, IDDM presented on [**2146-6-17**] with upper gastrointestinal bleed
from ostomy varices.  Bleeding was successfully treated with
embolization and TIPS procedure, however ensuing hepatic
encephalopathy led to a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium that could
not be successfully treated despite lactulose enemas.  His
course was further complicated by Klebsiella sepsis which
resolved early in the hospital course with ceftriaxone
treatment, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia which was never
successfully controlled.

On [**7-24**] the family decided to place the patient on hospice care,
largely because of the lack of improvement in the patients
mental status.  All non-comfort medications were subsequently
discontinued.  In the ensuing days, attempts were made to find a
suitable hospice care facility and an appropriate facility was
found for the patient to transfer for [**7-28**].  On the morning of
the 14th pt. began becoming unresponsive and went into agonal
breathing.  The family was notified that the patient would
probably pass away soon.  With the family present, the patient
went into respiratory arrest and expired.  He was pronounced
dead at 1:20 pm, [**2146-7-28**].  Autopsy declined by family.

The hospital course of this patient is summarized by problem
below:

1. GI Bleed:  Known cirrhotic with bleeding from ostomy varices.
Hepatology was consulted. Further investigation via endoscopy
revealed bleeding from varices around the stoma site. He was
placed on octretide, and a TIPS procedure was attempted and was
unsuccessful. The area was the embolized by IR. Patient remained
stable and a repeat TIPS was successful (done on [**6-28**]). The
gradient was reduced from 30 to 8.  In addition, repeat TIPS
showed a portal vein clot and he was placed on heparin for 24
hours.  However repeat TIPS showed no evidence of portal vein
clot - therefore heparin was dc'ed. Patient was given vitamin K
and [**Month/Year (2) 9087**] as needed to correct coagulapathy.
-After the TIPS and embolization, GI bleeding resolved.

2. Sepsis: Patient grew 4/4 bottles positive for Klebsiella. He
was started in meropenem initially, but switched to ceftriaxone
once sensitivities were back. In the setting of being infected
he was also hypotensive, requiring pressors that were slowly
weaned off. His CVP was closely monitered to keep his cvp >12.
On transfer to floor, all surveillance cultures are negative and
he has been afebrile while maintaining his blood pressure.
-Pt remained afebrile on the floor thereafter.

3. Respiratory failure: Initially he was intubated electively
for his first TIPS. Patient remained reintubated in his septci
state post TIPS. As his clinical status improved, he was weaned
from ventilator and extubated.
- Pt remained with o2 sats above 92% on room air.

4. Encephalopathy: Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS.  difficult to assess
what pt's baseline MS is.  Likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
contributing factors have included hypernatremia, and liver
disease s/p TIPS.  Hyperantremia corrected for now, will follow
Na.
- aspiration precautions with aggressive suctioning
- Pt was placed on lactulose and rifaximin for the
encephalopathy and received it while NG tube was in place.
However pt self d/c'ed the NG tube and thereafter it was
difficult to place NG again, he is receiving lactulose by enema
at present.  Family aware and they have decided against NG tube
placement.  Per nurses the pt had difficulty retaining lactulose
enemas.  Lower volume/higher concentration solutio
