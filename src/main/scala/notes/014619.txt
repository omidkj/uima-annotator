Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-18**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.

CTA CHEST [**5-18**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus, as
questioned. No pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.

2. Marked prominence of the right atrium, with relative
diminutive caliber of the right ventricle. This could reflect
Ebstein's anomaly, and correlation with echocardiography is
recommended.

3. Intermediate density filling defect within the left atrial
appendage,
concerning for thrombus, which could also be further evaluated
with
echocardiography.

CT Head [**5-17**]: Stable appearance of brain, with right frontal,
subinsular, and parietal infarcts; bifrontal and right temporal
hemorrhagic contusions; mild subarachnoid, subdural, and
intraventricular hemorrhage; and 3-mm rightward shift of the
falx cerebri, with slight entrapment and dilation of the left
lateral ventricle.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**5-16**]: Hemorrhagic contusions in the bifrontal and right
temporal lobe. Other sequelae of trauma are stable.  Acute
infarcts in the right frontal and parietal lobe. MRA of the
Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the proximal
intracranial vasculature. Distal vasculature cannot be assessed
due to excessive motion artifact.   MRA of the neck demonstrates
no significant stenosis.

Ct C/A/P
1. No acute injury in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. 5-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule and 3-mm left lower
lobe pulmonary nodule. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] criteria, followup with
dedicated chest CT can be performed at 12 months if patient has
no risk factors for malignancy. If patient has risk factors for
malignancy, then dedicated chest CT is recommended in 6 to 12
months.
3. Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.5 cm.

CT C-Spine
1. No acute fracture or malalignment.
2. Multilevel degenerative change with mild narrowing of the
spinal canal.
This can predispose to cord injury in the setting of significant
trauma.

CT head
1. Increasing size of hemorrhagic contusions within the frontal
lobes
bilaterally and in the right temporal lobe as described above.
2. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the parietal,
occipital, and
temporal lobes bilaterally.
3. Stable appearance of nondisplaced fracture of the left
frontal bone.

Carotid ultrasound [**5-11**]
Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.

Echocardiogram [**5-11**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45
%) global hypokinesis most prominent in the inferior and
infero-lateral walls. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 28221**] is a 78-year-old man with past medical history
notable for atrial fibrillation, who had been anticoagulated on
Coumadin until approximately six days
prior to his initial admission for colonoscopy, CHF, coronary
artery disease status post CABG in [**2145**], and a prior stroke
approximately 10 years ago with some residual right-sided
weakness who is currently admitted to the neurology inpatient
stroke service.  In the setting of his Coumadin being held, he
had sustained a fall and had significant hemorrhagic contusions
to his bilateral frontal and anterior temporal lobes and had
been taken care of by the neurosurgical service.  During this
time, his Coumadin was continued to be held.  Neurology became
involved
in his care on [**5-16**] at which time there was some concern for a
change in behavior including some greater lethargy.  An MRI
showed right-sided large wedge-shaped infarcts, likely
cardioembolic in etiology.

On general physical exam the morning of [**5-18**], the patient is
afebrile, but is tachycardic to the low 100s with an irregularly
irregular rhythm.  His lungs sound clear; however, there is a
machine-like murmur to his heart that seems to
