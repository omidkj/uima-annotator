CXR [**2169-11-18**]:
FINDINGS: A portable semi-upright frontal view of the chest was
obtained.
Consolidation in the right mid and lower lungs is likely
pneumonia. A moderate right pleural effusion is also likely
present. Increased opacity in the left mid lung field may be
developing focus of infection. There is no large pneumothorax.
Pulmonary vascular is engorged. Evaluation of heart size is
limited due to consolidation. The bones are diffusely
osteopenic.

IMPRESSION:
Mild pulmonary edema with moderate right pleural effusion. Right
lung
opacification may be due to pneumonia, or possibly asymmetric
pulmonary edema. There may be a developing focus of infection in
the left mid lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with severe dementia admitted from Nursing home facility
([**Hospital3 537**]) with right middle and right lower lobe
pneumonia, encephalopathy, hypernatremia, and hypoxemia
.
#Hypoxemia/Health care associated pneumonia:
The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit
with high oxygen requirement requiring oxygen via a
non-rebreather. She was treated for health care associated
pneumonia as she is a nursing home resident with Vancomycin and
Zosyn to complete an 8 day course to end [**11-27**] with vancomycin
trough goal of 15-20. She was also given Solumedrol in the ICU
but this was not continued when she was transferred to the
medical floor. Her oxygen requirements improved and she was
maintained on 2-3L of oxygen by nasal canula through most of her
hospitalization.
.
#Aspiration:
Given the location of the pneumonia and her encephalopathy and
severe dementia she was evaluated by speech pathology who felt
that the patient would always be at risk for aspiration, but
that she should be monitored with 1:1 supervision and have a
pureed dysphagia with thin liquids and all pills crushed in
applesauce diet. The risk of recurrent aspiration and pneumonina
was discussed with the health care proxy [**Name (NI) **] (daughter).
.
# Hypernatremia/Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition: Na was 151 on
admission and peaked at 153. This was felt to be due to the
patient's poor oral intake on top of infection. Throughout the
hospitalization the patient continued not to eat and was
maintained on IV fluids. Her sodium remained stable and improved
slightly each day on D51/2NS +/- K depending on potassium at
75ml/hr without complications of volume overload. Nutrition was
discussed with the patient's family including daughter and
health care proxy [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 91472**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 91473**]) who said that the
patient would not want a feeding tube of any kind or TPN. They
understood that this may lead to undernourishment but re-stated
that they did not want tubes or TPN for feeding/nutrition.
.
# Severe Dementia/Encephalopathy: Her mental status improved
slowly over hospitalizatoin. She was able to answer questions
and interact on discharge but was not always oriented and
unclear if she comprehended completely. Daughter said patient
was close to her mental baseline prior to discharge.
.
# DM: Patient was managed on insulin sliding scale
.
# Diabetic neuropathy: gabapentin and tramadol were continued
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
.
#Acces: A midline IV was placed for IV antibiotics.
.
#Goals of care: The issue of aspiration and nutrition were
discussed with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy [**Name (NI) **] (phone
number above) prior to discharge. She confirmed that feeding
tubes and TPN were not wanted. They understood that she may be
reliant on IV fluids and even with this she may be
undernourished if she continued not to eat. She also understood
that with feeding she was at high risk for pneumonia and
hypoxemia. The issue of "do not hospitalize" was discussed, but
a decision was not made at the time of discharge, but the HCP
understood that this was an option and will consider further
depending on
