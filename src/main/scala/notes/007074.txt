Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] AVR with a mechanical valve on [**9-15**] See
operative note for details  .He weaned from CPB on neosynephrine
and Popafol.  he required a right CT for a pneumothorax and was
then extubated easily. he was somewhat hypoxic, in part due to
his smoking history and in part due to poor respiratory effort
due to pain.
Analgesia was achieved and he improved.  His oxygenation was
adequate and the CT was removed. He was transferred to the floor
and recovered from his surgery uneventfully.
At discharge he was ambulatory, all wound were healing well and
his pain was well controlled.

He is anticoagulated due to his mechanical valve and his
Coumadin will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73562**], his internist at
