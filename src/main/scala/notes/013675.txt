Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-5**] EGD x 2.

History of Present Illness:
88 y/o female with recent embolic stroke in [**1-28**] followed by
recent admission [**Date range (1) 8361**] for a incidental hct of 18 at rehab.
She had been initially anticoagulated after her stroke, but
developed hematuria and heparin was discontinued.  It was also
noted that she had a 10 pound weight loss over the past 6
months.
     Recently admitted [**2-19**] after found to have hct of 18 at
[**Hospital 599**] Nursing Home. Hct was 31.1 from a previous d/c [**2182-2-8**].
Hct was 29.5 on recent d/c [**2-21**]. retic [**2-19**] 8.4, nl b12 ferritin.
The pt was transfused to hct 32 with 3U pRBCs. There was no
overt bleeding. The pt underwent EGD and colonoscopy which
revealed only gastritis, colonoscopy was negative other than a
polyp, lipoma, and a diverticulum. The mechanism of the hct drop
was suscpected friable gastritis in the setting of asa. The hct
remained stable without further transfusions.
  Patient was at rehab today when she had a large black stool
followed by witnessed syncope on the toilet lasting approx 3
minutes. At that time SBP in 80's per rehab.  Upon arival to the
ED patient had BP of 70/40.  She was given 400cc NS and BP
improved and remained stable.  Hct was 25.8. In the ED patient
refused rectal and NG lavage. GI has seen the patient and
recommeded MICU monitoring and blood transfusion, IV protonix.
Patient having melena in the ED.

Past Medical History:
1) s/p CVA on [**2182-2-5**] secondary to PFO with right to left shunt
versus complex non-mobile 4 mm aortic atheroma. On ASA only.
2) Left internal carotid aneurysm.
3) Hypertension. On valsartan-HCTZ.
4) Gout. On allopurinol.
5) Gastritis
6) htn


Social History:
Patient worked as a secretary for over 50 years and has been
retired for almost 10 years.  She is single, never married with
no children.  Her nephew is her closest living relative and her

Since discharge from the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-8**], she has lived at [**Hospital1 599**]
for rehabilitation.  She occasionally has an alcoholic beverage

Physical Exam:
PE:97.9 121/30  67  22  100%
Gen: Slightly agitated elderly female, asking to go home,
pulling off tape and O2 sat.  Refusing blood draws, NG tube,
rectal exam.
HEENT: mmm, op clear, anicteric sclera, no carotid bruit noted
CV:  rrr s1s2 3/6 sem (old)
Pulm: crackles at left base, otherwise clear
Abd: distended, soft, NT, no rebound, guarding, active bowel
sounds
Rectal: patient refuses
Ext: no edema, bilat LE changes consistent with peripheral
vascular disease, thickened nails


Pertinent Results:
[**3-6**] Abd X-ray:
IMPRESSION: Distended loops of predominantly large bowel with
some small bowel consistent with ileus. Less likely colonic
obstruction. Unchanged compared to prior study. Moderate left
pleural effusion.

[**3-6**] Angiography:
IMPRESSION: 1) Non-selective aortography and selective celiac
arteriography demonstrated no evidence of active
gastrointestinal bleeding. Marked vascular tortuosity and
diffuse atheromatous disease was demonstrated.
2) Selective catheterization of the left gastric artery was
unsuccessful. No embolization was performed.

[**3-6**] Chest/Abd CT:
1. Acute large pulmonary embolism in the right main pulmonary
artery.
2. Multiple low-density lesions in the liver with rim
enhancement. Diagnostic considerations include metastatic
lesions or hepatic abscess.
3. Focal biliary ductal dilatation in the right and left lobes
of the liver.
4. Abnormal soft tissue encasing the celiac axis and superior
mesenteric artery that appears widely patent.
5. Abnormal dilatation of colon with air-fluid levels extending
to the level of the rectum. No free air seen.
6. Abnormal hypoenhancement/mural irregularity in posterior
fundal gastric wall with adjacent small amount of free fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo female with recent embolic stroke and GI/gastritis,
presents with melana, hypotension, and altered mental status.
Since admission has rapid drop in HCT, hypotensive, intubated
for EGD and found to have large clot in stomach.
.
1.  GI Bleed/Anemia:
Throughout her course she continue to have melanotic stools and
required multiple units of packed red blood cells.  The GI
service was consulted and performed two EGDs which showed a
large clot in the fundus, suspicious for a Dieulafoy lesion.
She also had an angiography for potential embolectomy but this
was negative for a bleeding vessel.  The surgery service was
consulted but due to her comorbidities she was not considered an
operative candidate.
.
2. Colonic distension:
She began to develop colonic distension on [**3-5**] and an abdominal
CT revealed distension of her entire colon with a normal caliber
small bowel.  This was of unclear etiology although suspicion
was high for bowel ischemia.  A rectal tube was placed to help
decompress her colon.
.
3. Liver lesions:
On the CT scan of her abdomen she was also noted to have liver
lesions suggestive of either metastatic disease or abscesses.
.
4. Hypotension:
She was hypotensive on admission likely due to hypovolemia from
her GI blood loss and she required aggressive fluid
resuscitation and pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
.
5. Hyponatremia:
This resolved with IV hydration.
.
4. PE:
On the CT scan done to evaluate her abdominal distension she was
noted to have pulmonary emboli.
.
6. Dispo:
On admission, aggressive measures were pursued but as her ICU
course progressed she developed many complications, including
her GI bleed requiring multiple transfusions and that was
without a treatable source, severely dilated colon, PE, and
hypotension.  Her case was discussed with her family and the
decision was made to stop aggressive measures and pursue comfort
measures only.  At this point she was extubated, her medications
were stopped and she was started on a morphine drip.  She passed
away several hours later at approximately 9:30 pm on [**2182-3-6**].
