Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-pericardiocentesis in cardiac catheterization laboratory on
[**2150-11-30**]
-Classical Caesarian section on [**2150-12-8**]

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 26 year-old G1P0 female at 27 [**5-8**] wks who initially
presented to an OSH complaining of fever and pleuritic chest
pain.  Five days PTA, the pt developed onset of substernal chest
pain while sitting.  She rated the intensity of the pain as a
[**4-11**],  radiating to L arm.  She added that the pain got steadily
worse over the next several days.  She noted that the pain was
exacerbated by exertion.  She also developed fevers to 102-103,
and shortness of breath over the days prior to admission.  She
was recently seen in OSH ED with complaints of fever, and was
admitted to an OSH from [**Date range (1) 59852**] when she presented again
with fever, weakness, pleuritic cp, and tachycardia at which
time she underwent suboptimal CTA (problem w/ contrast bolus)
and nuclear perfusion scan (ventilation portion not performed)
which was read as normal.

On the day of admission at the outside ED, she was noted to be
tachycardic to 150, saturating 99% on 4L O2 via nasal cannula.
Blood cultures were drawn, and she was started on a heparin drip
over the concern for pulmonary embolus.

On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], she denied dysuria, urinary frequency,
hematuria,  abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, BRBPR,
contractions, vaginal bleeding or spotting, rashes, or skin
breakdown.
She did admit to recent onset of right knee pain and swelling
following syncopal episode 3 weeks PTA, but did not notice pain
until five days PTA.  There was no previous history of joint or
muscle pain.  She also complained of orthopnea and PND but
denied any increased lower extremity edema.
She also complained of a sore throat that began five days PTA.
She stated that she initially had difficulty swallowing and
could not take solids but had improved over the two-three days
PTA.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pericarditis: The pt's. symptoms and EKG findings were
suggestive of pericarditis. As she also presented with fever and
leukocytosis with bandemia, she was empirically started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin on admission for a possible
infectious etiology.  Given the constellation of the pt's
symptoms, a rheumatologic cause was also in the differential and
a number of serologic tests were sent (all of which eventually
returned negative). On the morning of the second hospital day,
an echocardiogram was performed which revealed a large
pericardial effusion.  She was started on indomethacin.  A
central venous catheter was inserted and a Swan-Ganz catheter
was floated.  This revealed tamponade physiology.  Therefore,
the pt. was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab
where she underwent fluoroscopically guided pericardiocentesis.
The pt. tolerated the procedure well and approximately 400 ccs
of viscous yellow fluid was drained.  A drain was left in place
for 24 hours which drained approximately 80 more cc of
serosanguinous fluid.  The fluid was sent for gram stain as well
as bacterial, fungal, viral and acid fast cultures.  On HD #4,
the pericardial fluid grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans, at which time
the pt. was started on ambisome.  Numerous repeat
echocardiograms were performed over the course of the next week
and a half to assess for reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid
given the pt's. persistent tachycardia and hypoxia.  None of
these studies revealed reaccumulation.  On HD #3, the pt. was
started on IV steroids as indomethacin was discontinued
secondary to ARF.  The pt. reported dramatic improvement in her
chest pain on steroids.  She was eventually transitioned to a
slow p.o. steroid taper.  The ID service had recommended
treating possible infectious causes with a 2 week course of
ceftriaxone and a 6 week course of ambisome.   The patient was
then changed to fluconazle to complete a [**4-7**] week course.  She
will be discharged on fluconazole to followup in [**Hospital **] clinic.  She
should take 4 more days of prednisone 5mg/ day upon discharge.

2) Fever/Leukocytosis: The pt. was noted to have a low-grade
fever on admission, but defervesced shortly after admission
after initiation of treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
 She began to spike fevers again 9 days into her hospital stay
after her caesarian section.  All of the pt's. indwelling lines
were removed and sent for culture.  IV vancomycin was
empirically begun for IV empiric treatment.  Blood cultures
eventually grew out coagulase negative staph.  She was treated
with a total of a 10 day course.

3) Hypoxia: The pt. was noted to be hypoxic on admission.  A CTA
was performed which was not suggestive of pulmonary embolus.
She consistently required oxygen by nasal cannula and, at times,
facemask.  Her arterial blood gases showed both hypercarbia and
hypoxemia.  It was thought that her hypoxia was secondary to
splinting from chest pain, atelectasis and a component of CHF.
After delivery of her baby, the pt's. O2 requirements decreased
and the pt. was noted to be less tachypneic and saturating well
with minimal O2 via nasal cannula.

4)Right knee effusion:  The pt. was noted to have an effusion of
her right knee on admission.  It was tapped by the rheumatology
service on the night of adm
