CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: 86 year old man with ? of obstrxn / p/op leak

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man with ? of obstrxn / p/op leak
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
86 year old man with ? of obstrxn / p/op leak
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: 86-year-old man with history of colorectal carcinoma
and colectomy.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: Left-sided dual chamber pacemaker is identified. There
is a free lead that probably corresponds to prior advise.
Bibasilar opacities are seen consistent with pleural effusions.
The cardiac silhouette is obscured by these opacities and cannot
be evaluated. The aorta appears tortuous. _____ vascular
calcifications are identified. The upper lung zones appear
clear.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions. Surgical clips are seen
overlying the right upper quadrant and the mid abdomen
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2189-8-28**]  3:27:52 PM


Ventricularly paced rhythm, rate 60. Probable underlying atrial
fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-8-28**] no diagnostic
change.

Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man s/p transverse colectomy, now w/ vomiting, fever

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for collection, obstruction. please give
gastrograffin (pt had ? of leak on outside hospital scan--we
could not see evidence of such on studies). page [**Numeric Identifier **] w/
questions.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 86-year-old man status post transverse colectomy,
now with vomiting and fever. Evaluate for collection or
obstruction. Please administer Gastrografin.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were performed with IV contrast.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large right pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis and a small-to-moderate
size left effusion. The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
kidneys are unremarkable with the exception of a left large
simple renal cyst. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph
nodes within the retroperitoneum or mesentery. There is a small
amount of free air within the abdomen and subcutaneous tissue
adjacent to incision site. Surrounding site of anastomosis in
the region of the hepatic flexure, there is a moderate amount of
fat stranding with no definite fluid collection identified.
These findings could represent sequelae of the prior anastomosis
from 10 days ago.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, rectum, and
sigmoid colon are unremarkable. The prostate is slightly
enlarged.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions.
2. Small amount of free air within the abdomen and subcutaneous
tissues adjacent to incision site, likely postoperative
sequelae.
3. Small amount of fat stranding surrounding anastomotic site,
consistent with postoperative sequelae. No focal fluid
collection is identified. Contrast is seen passing this site.
4. No evidence of bowel leak or obstruction.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2189-8-31**] 12:03 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: eval for dvt

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man with fevers, increasing WBC, with bilat pitting
edema & [**Last Name (un) **] signs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for dvt
INDICATION: An 86-year-old male with fevers and increasing white
blood cell count and bilateral pitting edema. Evaluate for DVT.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:

[**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. Normal compressibility, augmentation, flow, and
waveforms are demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal
thrombus.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of DVT bilaterally.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2189-9-1**] 4:50 PM

PORTABLE ABDOMEN; FOLLOW-UP,REQUEST BY RAD.

Reason: CHK FOR GASTRIC EMPTYING POST UGI

INDICATION: Check for gastric emptying status post upper GI.

Note is made of the GI/small bowel follow through of [**9-1**], [**2188**].

SUPINE ABDOMINAL RADIOGRAPH: Clips are seen in the right upper
quadrant. Contrast is seen within the stomach as well as within
loops of small and large bowel. Staples are seen over the mid
abdomen. There is no evidence of obstruction.

IMPRESSION:

1. Contrast remains within the stomach. No evidence of
obstruction.

BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT

Reason: eval gastric emptying... directed consult to dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86M s/p distant B2 with gastric bezoar (but no strciture on EGD)
& N/V after transverse colectmoy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval gastric emptying... directed consult to dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. pls call
with questions
INDICATION: A distant history of gastric bezoar with nausea and
vomiting after transverse colectomy. Please evaluate gastric
emptying.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: A focussed fluoroscopic study of the stomach was
performed. Patient was orally administered a thin barium, which
demonstrated free passage through the esophagus into the
stomach. There is no evidence for hiatal hernia. There was
significant reflux with a large column of contrast refluxing
into the esophagus to the upper mediastinum. This was
accompanied by dysfunctional tertiary peristaltic waves.
Esophageal lumen is featureless with a small diverticulum noted
in the mid portion of the esophagus. The patient was kept in the
fluoroscopic suite for 20 minutes without opacification of the
stomach antrum. Given a large column of reflux of contrast, a
decision was made not to administer fizzies for stomach
dilation. Study will be continued on the floor with subsequent
portable abdominal radiograph to assess gastric emptying.
Three-lead pacemaker is noted with leads co
