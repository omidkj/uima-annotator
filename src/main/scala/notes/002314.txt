STUDIES
CXR [**2139-4-1**]-IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
CXR [**2139-4-4**]-IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and
22: Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic, small bilateral pleural
effusions have increased, pulmonary vascular congestion in the
upper lungs persists, but there is no pulmonary edema.  No
pneumothorax.
CXR [**2139-4-5**]-IMPRESSION:AP chest compared to [**4-1**] through
23: Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding.  Small-to-moderate left
pleural effusion stable since [**4-4**].  Pulmonary vascular
engorgement suggests a mild-to-moderate cardiac decompensation.
Left lower lobe opacification can be
explained by atelectasis present since at least [**4-1**].
Right lung shows no evidence of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-4-14**] 11:18 PM
1. The right upper lobe airspace disease is almost cleared
indicating either it was edema or atelectasis.
2. Persistent bilateral bibasilar atelectasis with small
coexistent pleural effusion. The homogeneous opacification in
the left lung could be attributed to patient's body habitus and
positioning during the procedure.

CT Head [**2139-4-4**] IMPRESSION: Probable large left MCA ischemia. CT
perfusion or MRI are recommended for further characterization.
.
CT Head [**2139-4-7**] (Prelim): There is now marked diffuse
hypodensity seen throughout the left MCA territory, consistent
with evolution of large left MCA territory infarct. There is no
sign of intracranial hemorrhage. There is now mild regional
sulcal effacement, as well as a small amount of mass effect on
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. The ventricles
are otherwise unchanged in size and the basal cisterns are not
effaced.
IMPRESSION: Evolving large left MCA territory infarct, now with
mild regional sulcal effacement, and minimal mass effect on the
