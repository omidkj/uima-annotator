History of Present Illness:
79 yo RH woman with h/o afib and DVT on coumadin, recurrent
falls since hip fracture years ago, who yesterday fell and hit
her head. Was evaluated by EMS last night, patient said she felt
fine and she did not present for medical therapy. In AM, workers
on her home thought she was different, shuffling, instead of
writing a check for $3000, she picked up the phone and dialed
"3000". Answered the door in her nightgown. Went to [**Hospital1 **] at 2:30pm, lethargic but "A&Ox3", no weakness noted.

BP was 160/104, given 5mv lopressor. INR was 6, reversed with 1
u FFP and vit K 5mg. Intubated for transport to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurgical evaluation, given lido/etom/succ. Also given
25grams mannitol at OSH. Neurosurgery spoke with family- > no
neurosurgical intervention is to be done. Although family states

she is still FULL CODE and they want all medical therapy. In the
ED she got 2 more units of FFP and 5 mg vit K, also loaded with
dilantin. BP running a bit low now, SBP 90's, will likely not be
able to tolerate mannitol.

T 101 at [**Hospital1 46**], 100.6 here after being given tylenol at OSH.
She has a chronic LLE cellulitis, recently started a new
antibiotic for this.

Pertinent Results:
Admission workup:
Non contrast head CT at [**Hospital1 18**]: intraparenchymal bleed centered
in left
occipital lobe with extension into left lateral ventricle. less
blood seen in right lateral ventricle. small amount of subdural
blood. considerable left cerebral mass effect - subfalcine
herniation. early transtentorial herniation.

CXR: 1. An ET tube with the tip positioned approximately 4 cm
above the carina. 2. Right perihilar opacity, which may
represent
an infiltrate or aspiration. 3. Small left pleural effusion.

[**4-21**] repeat head CT: Stable appearance of large left occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extent into the ventricles.
Approximately 7 mm of rightward shift of the normally midline
structures, perhaps slightly increased in extent since the prior
exam (approximately 6 mm previously).

[**4-20**] CXR: No interval change from prior study. Bibasilar
atelectasis and a
left-sided pleural effusion are noted.

[**4-27**] CXR: unofficial read shows increased effusions and evidence
of pulmonary edema

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Fluoroscopic assistance was
provided for the speech and swallow division as they performed
their swallowing evaluation. Various consistencies of barium
including thin liquid, nectar-thick liquid, puree, barium-coated
cookie, and pill were administered. Bolus formation was
characterized by slow chewing. Premature spillover was noted
with pudding consistency. There is one instances of penetration
of the laryngeal vestibule during the swallow. The barium-coated
tablet passed freely through the esophagus and into the stomach,
without hold up.
IMPRESSION: Penetration of the airway without aspiration with
thin liquid.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 yo woman on coumadin (INR supratheraputic) s/p fall
with a large left occipital hemorrhage with ventricular
extension and early herniation. Family has decided against
neurosurgical intervention, although would like full medical
therapy.

Of note, the patient has had multiple DVTs in the past in
addition to a PE in [**11-30**].
She has not opened her left eye for ~40 years, and the lids have
been slightly swollen at baseline. Right eye has been
intermittently "lazy" and there are times in the AM when eye is
down and out and pt has to physically move eyeball "back into
place." According to the patient's daughter, she does have
vision in the left eye.

Hospital Course
Neuro:
Pt was admitted to the neuro ICU with Q1H neuro checks, head CT
was followed and showed a subtle increase in shift but no
evidence of true herniation. After extubation and withdrawal of
sedating meds she became quite awake and alert, sometimes
agitated, but had a neuro exam notable for a R sided field cut
(leaving her essentially with only a R nasal field for vision
given that her L eye is closed). Her coumadin was stopped given
the hemorrhage. Neurosurgery was initially following the patient
but they did not intervene given her improving exam. During her
admission, she developed delerium. During this period, she
required chemical and physical restraints to avoid harming
herself. She was pancultured and it was discovered that she had
a positive UA. Once she was treated for the urinary tract
infection, her mental status improved. She also improved once
she was placed on standing seroquel.

Resp:
She was extubated on HD 2. She required daily albuterol/atrovent
nebs for respiratory distress. However on [**4-27**] am she was noted
to be more tachypneic, with desaturations when she layed flat. A
repeat CXR was performed that showed evidence of pulmonary edema
and large effusions. She was given a dose of IV lasix prior to
transferring to medicine. She was diuresed with IV lasix for
about 5 more days. She then remained euvolemic.

CV:
She continued to be in atrial fibrillation during her stay, but
upon transfer to the floor began to have episodes of RVR.
Diltiazem IV was pushed a total of three times with only
transient effect. Therefore, on [**4-25**] she was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
