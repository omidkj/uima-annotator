Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**12-29**] to respiratory failure
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 yo female with history of COPD, recurrent
aspiration pna, MAT, PVD s/p Left femoral-peroneal bypass, HTN,
CAD presented initially to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-9-14**] with worsening
dyspnea. Pt has had an extended hospital course, beginning in
[**8-2**] when she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on 2 occasions with
respiratory distress, thought due to COPD flare and aspiration
pneumonia. Most recently patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2169-8-25**] with what was thought to be COPD flare and aspiration
pneumonia. During this hospital course, pt had a failed speech
and swallow evaluation with silent aspiration (no cough reflex).
She was also transferred to the MICU for increased respiratory
distress, but did not require intubation. The patient was
discharged from this hospitalization with NG tube in place, as
she refused PEG tube placement.
.
Upon most recent discharge, patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 15454**] rehab. From here, on [**2169-9-5**], she was admitted to
[**Hospital **] Hospital for re-aspiration pneumonia (unclear when NGT
was d/ced) which progressed to respiratory failure requiring
intubation. Pt was discharged from Caritas to [**Hospital1 49145**] rehab facility on high dose steroid taper.
.
Over the following 48 hours post-discharge, patient had
worsening dyspnea, increased oxygen requirement to 6L NC with
desaturations into the 80's. She given methylprednisolone and
lasix 40 IV x2, as dyspnea was thought related to CHF. Pt was
then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for planned cardiac catheterization.
However, pt had increasing respiratory distress in transit,
requiring BiPAP. She was initially admitted to the CCU team.
Initially pt was treated with prednisone 20mg daily and
nebulizers. Morning after admission, the patient had increasing
respiratory distress on BiPAP, with an ABG of 7.34/61/67, and
she was subsequently intubated. She was started on solumedrol
60mg IV q8hr, Vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl. Pulmonary was
consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**2169-9-15**] that
demonstrated a large amount of mucous and ?contrast/aspiration
material that was suctioned out.
.
She has remained hemodynamically stable, and respiratory status
has remained stable on vent. Other notable hospital course
events include pt noted to be guaic + on exam, Hct has remained
stable. Patient was extubated on [**9-17**]. She was transferred from
MICU to CCU Step Down for further care.

Past Medical History:
1)Asthma > 5 hospitalization with no history of intubations. She
has been on steroids since the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**]. Prior to
this, she had been steroid free for the past 2 years.
2)Hypertension.
3)Steroid induced hyperglycemia. Discharged on insulin following

her [**Hospital1 **] admission.
4)Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-peroneal
bypass in [**2162**]
5)Multi-focal bacterial pneumonia.
6)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- PFT [**7-2**]- FVC 61% pred,
FEV1 56% pred, FEV1/FVC 92%, Reduced FVC related to gas
trapping, ~400 cc worse than PFT from one year ago.
7)Multi-focal atrial tachycardia.
8)Oral thrush.
9)Question left hilar mass.

Social History:
Distant tobacco use. Occasional alcohol use. The patient was
living with 24 hour home health aide until [**Month (only) **]
hospitalization. Since then has been a resident at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
rehab facility.

Family History:
Asthma in her father
