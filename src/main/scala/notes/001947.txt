History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109788**] is a pleasant 84yo, Spanish-speaking female with a
history of coronary artery disease (s/p RCA stent [**2191**]), severe
TR, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart
failure, chronic kidney disease, DM2, HTN who presents with
acute on chronic dyspnea. She has had significant dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea, and PND for the past two months, but it has
acutely worsened over the past 10-20 days. She occasionally gets
pain in the sternal and lower neck area over that same time
period, but it is unclear if she is interpreting that symptom as
shortness of breath. She struggles to sleep, and needs to be
upright to do so. She has worsening edema of the lower legs as
well, with a departure from her dry weight of 200 to 210. She
has been taking all meds and diuretics. She denies salt loading.
She denies exertional chest pain or pressure. She was instructed
to present to the ED by her PCP after her [**Name9 (PRE) 269**] found her sats to
be 88% on RA this afternoon.

In the ED, initial vs were 98.2 60 120/62 28 98% 8L Mask. She
was in Afib with a rate of 60. Labs notable for elevated BNP to
2654, and Ddimer>1000. She did not get CTA due to renal failure,
which is chronic. CXR showed pulmonary vascular congestion,
which is chronic.

On arrival to the floor, initial vitals were T98.1 BP106/62 HR71
RR22 100/2L. She is resting. She has minimal shortness of breath
right now, and no chest pain or pressure. She complains of
general weakness and malaise.
Notably, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-/2202**] with toe pain due to
ingrown nail, and had a course complicated by hypoxia and
hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating MICU transfer. She
improved with a multifocal regimen of diuretics, antibitoics,
and steroids and was eventually liberated from oxygen. She has
had multiple admissions for CHF according to her cardiologist.
Efforts to reduce lower extremity edema and mild dyspnea with
exertion are thwarted by worsening renal performance, and she is
allowed to remain modestly overloaded at baseline. Most recent
dry weight appears to be around 200lb.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive otherwise for constipation.
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

CXR [**2202-7-30**]
Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema, not likely
changed given lower inspiratory effort on the current exam.

CXR [**2202-7-31**]
There are low lung volumes.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and
tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is increased
from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.  If any, there are small
bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of lobar
pneumonia.

[**2202-8-7**] CT chest IMPRESSION:
1.  No effusion or consolidation.
2.  Scattered pulmonary nodules and ground glass opacities
requiring follow-up chest CT in 6 months.
3.  Mild lower lobe bronchial wall thickening could reflect a
chronic small airways disease.
4.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with prominent coronary artery

calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109788**] is a 84yoF with [**Hospital 7133**] medical problems including
diastolic heart failure (EF 70%), DM2, CKD, TR here with
shortness of breath likely caused by decompensation of CHF.
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: likely related to obesity
hypoventilation and sleep apnea complicated by decompensated
heart failure. Seen by Pulm and Sleep who recommend BiPAP at
night and at day as needed. Improved with BiPAP qHS and
diuresis. Pt continued nebulizer treatments and inhaled steroids
throughout admission. She did not receive systemic steroids.
Pt's respiratory status improved with diuresis approximately 9L,
BiPAP at night, and was successfully weaned off oxygen.  She is
set up for outpatient follow-up for pulmonary function tests,
sleep study, and urgent care pulm clinic.
.
# [**Hospital1 **]-VENTRICULAR HEART FAILURE: Pt presented with worsening
dyspnea over several days. ACS ruled out:  troponins negative
x2, EKG unchanged from prior, and symptom onset was insidious,
and the patient says her chest pain is close to baseline. Likely
SOB [**1-7**] acute diastolic heart failure, with superimposed COPD
component. The patient was clinically volume overloaded on
admission with worsening lower extremity edema, desaturations,
and increased weight. Lasix drip and fluid restriction was
started on the floor. The patient was placed on supplemental O2
on the floor. Albuterol nebs were given. The patient had a
persistently altered mental status on the floor, with increased
sleepiness and confusion from baseline accoringing to
discussions with her f
