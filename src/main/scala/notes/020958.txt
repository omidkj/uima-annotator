Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, SSCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
44yo M w/ AIDS (VL 43,700 and CD4 11 on [**2175-7-25**]) and [**Date Range 1074**]
gastritis/colitis and [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis, recent MICU admission
for asthma, found to have MAC, presented to the ER from his
PCP's office for evaluation of his SOB. Pt states that for the
last 3 days, he has had increasing SOB and DOE. He denies having
any f/c/night sweats. 40# wt loss over last 6 weeks (but was
"water weight", treated w/ lasix). Has been told by his RN at
home that "the bottom of his lungs aren't working right", so
went to his PCP's office tonight for regular f/u and, given his
h/o of PCP and MAC, was sent to the ER by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] EMS
arrival, he was found to be awake and alert, seated in a WC, on
4L by nc (his home regimen). His RR was 36 and his lung exam was
noted to have rhonchi and wheezing bilaterally. No O2 sat was
recorded, but the patient was placed on 15L by [**Name10 (NameIs) 597**]. O2 sats in
ED triage, back on 4L nc, were 93% -> improved to 100% on [**Name10 (NameIs) 597**].
.
In the ER, the patient was given respiratory treatments
(alb/ipratroprium nebs) and, once improved, was switched back to
4L nc with sats of 98%. Was able to eat dinner w/o difficulty.
Did note some pleuritic CP w/ movement from bed to stretcher. He
was given acyclovir 450mg IV x1 for zoster, bactrim 225mg IV x1
for ? PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] percocet for pain. He was also transfused 1u pRBC
for a Hct of 16.5. Cultures were drawn (blood and urine) and are
pending. UA negative. ABG x2 were performed. First ABG was
7.5/27/161, second ABG was 7.43/35/78. It is unclear what
settings he was on ([**Name (NI) 597**] vs. nc) for the ABGs, but there is no
documentation of a change in status between the ABGs. He had a
CT of his chest performed and then was transferred to the MICU
for further care.
.
Of note, patient has been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] twice over the past
summer, from [**6-26**] -> [**6-30**] (MICU admission for dyspnea, treated
for PCP pna and CAP despite neg cx, sputum eventually grew MAC,
does not appear to have been treated for MAC) and [**7-11**] -> [**7-30**]
(for diarrhea, dysphagia, and neutropenia; had prolonged hosp
course for w/u of diarrhea - cx neg, but ? [**Month/Day (4) 1074**] colitis - and
eventual BM bx which was negative for infxn or malignancy). He
was in rehab at [**Hospital1 **] til 2 weeks ago and was taking lasix
for diuresis of his "water weight". Upon hospital d/c, he states
he weighed 140# and is now down to 106# with lasix. He notes
that he was doing well at home until the last 3 days when he
went downhill "fast". His baseline functional status is that he
can do his ADLs, but uses a wheelchair to get around and is
chronically on 4L nc at home. He is moving in with his mother
soon as he can no longer manage on his own. Pt states that his
main reason for him coming to the hospital tonight is pain on
his buttocks and that the intervention that made the most
improvement in his symptoms was percocet. He does admit that the
nebulizers helped, but feels that his breathing is comfortable
currently.
