Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion and left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line


History of Present Illness:
81 yo female with history of CAD, DM, severe PVD sent from NH
with MS changes and new left sided weakness. She was discharged
to the NH after a recent stay at [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia, on [**Doctor First Name **]
service. On Levo/Flagyl for UTI from NH. Slightly unclear if
still on these from [**Name (NI) **]. According to notes at baseline she is
slightly confused, but was non-verbal on EMS arrival. She was
found by EMS lying down unable to ambulate.
.
She was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 55077**] for L fem endarterectomy and
patch angioplasty with L fem-[**Name (NI) 55075**] PTFE jump graft([**6-22**]) then
Left [**Name (NI) 55076**] PTFE graft, removal of fem-veingraft PTFE graft,
ligation of fem-AT vein graft [**6-23**]. She was started on
levo/flagyl [**6-24**] for pneumonia and was discharged to complete 2
week course of levofloxacin/flagyl. She was recommended to go to
rehab but her family preferred to take her home. She returned
[**7-2**] as her family was unable to care for her at home and was
discharged to rehab [**7-3**].
.
In the ED her vitals were Temp 99.8, HR 60, BP 103/47, RR 20,
100% RA. She was found to smell of ketones. While in the ED her
BP dropped to 74/27 but responded to IV fluids. She was found to
have a glucose of "critically high". Her NA 128 K 6.8, BUN/creat
86/2.5, A right IJ was placed. She was treated with Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone. She was started in an insulin drip, IV fluids (2L
recorded). Given Calcium Gluconate, and Bicarb and written for
kayaxlate which was never given. In the ED she had minimal urine
output. A head CT showed no evidence of bleed. CXR was
unremarkable. She was tranfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-7-15**]):
      YEAST.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
.
ekg [**2139-7-15**]:
Sinus rhythm
Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction
Nonspecific low amplitude anterolateral T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2139-6-28**], further T waves changes
present
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT [**2139-7-14**]: There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures,
or major vascular territorial infarct. There is mild asymmetry
to the ventricles with slight prominence of the left ventricle.
Moderate-to-severe periventricular hypoattenuation is consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is no
evidence of major vascular territorial infarct. Faint lacunar
infarcts are seen in the left caudate and internal capsule.
Osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarct. If there is strong suspicion for a CVA, MRI
with DWI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
.
BRAIN MRI [**2139-7-17**]:
Diffusion images demonstrate subtle areas of increased signal in
both external capsules as well as in the left periventricular
region which demonstrate increased signal on ADC map indicative
of chronic changes and T2 shine through. There is no evidence of
a slow diffusion identified to indicate acute infarct. There is
no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus. Moderate brain
atrophy is seen. There are diffuse periventricular and
subcortical white matter hyperintensities predominantly in the
frontal lobe indicative of severe changes of small vessel
disease.
IMPRESSION: Severe changes of small vessel disease. Subtle areas
of increased signal on diffusion images appear to be due to T2
shine through. Moderate brain atrophy.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates atherosclerotic disease affecting the
distal vertebral arteries, proximal basilar artery and left
middle cerebral artery with irregularity of the flow signal.
There is an area of narrowing at the distal right vertebral
artery which appears to be due to greater than 50% narrowing of
the vertebral artery. No evidence of occlusion seen in the
arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Atherosclerotic disease affecting both cavernous
carotids, left middle cerebral artery and vertebral and proximal
basilar arteries as described above. Probable stenosis of distal
right vertebral artery near its junction with the
vertebrobasilar artery.
.
CHEST, ONE VIEW [**2139-7-14**]: Comparison with multiple previous
examinations, including [**2136-5-23**] and [**2139-6-27**]. New
right IJ central venous line with the tip at the cavoatrial
junction. Thickening in the right lung apex, unchanged since the
last exam. Linear atelectasis at the left lung base. Lungs
otherwise appear clear. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
are unchanged. Midline sternotomy wires and evidence of previous
CABG. No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Successful
right IJ line placement.
