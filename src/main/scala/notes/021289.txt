confused. He was taken to the core area where he was found to
have 80% on RA. EKG showed no ischemic changes. CXR was

In the ED waiting room, patient had a brief episode of near
syncope during which he was feeling SOB and confused and "looked
bad." He was tachycardic and tachypneic. O2 Sat was 80% on RA
with venous pH 7.1, prompting intubation. Serial EKGs were
without ischemic changes. He was noted to be acidotic with
lactate 8. CT torso was done to rule out PE. No PE was
demonstrated, but there were diffuse ground glass opacities
concerning for multifocal pneumonia. He was given vancomycin,
zosyn, levofloxacin. CT also showed 3.8 cm infrarenal AAA.
Vascular Surgery service saw him in the ED. He was intubated and

Brief Hospital Course:
An 84 year-old man presents with likely sepsis secondary to
pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: patient was intubated in ED for hypoxemic
respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia. Due to
initial aggressive fluid resuscitation, patient had to be
diuresed over several days before extubation. During the course
of intubation, patient intermittently hyperventilated regardless
of ventilator settings and failed repeated SBTs. Benzodiazepenes
and opiates briefly brought down respiratory rate. At one point,
family considered making patient CMO and terminal extubation.
However, patient was gradually more alert and once asked
declined terminal extubation and agreed that if extubation was
unsuccessful, re-intubation would be okay. Patient was
successfully extubated on [**2153-4-24**] and called out to the medicine
floor.  Patient remained comfortable on 4L with improved breath
sounds.
.
# MRSA pneumonia: Patient presented with bandemia and
leukopenia, fevers, and CT with multilobar infiltrates
diagnostic of severe pneumonia. Vancomycin, zosyn, and
levofloxacin were started. He initially required levophed to
maintain MAP >65.  Sputum cultures grew MRSA.  Antibiotics were
narrowed to vancomycin.  Levophed was weaned, and BP remained
normal to hypertensive.  However, a few days into his MICU
course, he was again febrile and clinically tenuous, so
antibiotic regimen was broadened back to include cefepime and
ciprofloxacin in addition to the IV vancomycin. He finished his
course of antibiotics on [**2153-4-24**] and he has been stable on 4L of
O2 with gradually improving breath sounds.
.
# RUE edema/weakness - upper extremity ultrasound showed an age
indeterminate midcephalic vein clot with signs of distal flow.
Vascular surgery was consulted, recommended no anticoagulation.
Warm packs, elevation, and NSAIDS were used.  Head CT was
performed with no signs of intracranial process to explain
weakness.  Patient will require physical rehabilitation of right
arm.
.
# Hct drop: Hct fell from 35 on admission to 27, likely
secondary to fluids, and was subsequently stable.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Atorvastatin was continued.
.
# AAA: 3 cm, newly discovered.  Patient was seen by vascular in
ED who recommended repeat US in 6 months
