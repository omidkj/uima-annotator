Chief Complaint:
SOB, dyspnea, asthma attack

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
48F with past medical history of hypertension, obesity, and RVOT
ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation in [**2111-1-12**],
allergic rhinitis, sleep apnea,depression, and iron deficiency
anemia, severe asthma who presents with cough for 1 week and
chest tightness. She notes that she had a "cold", associated
with headache, chills, nasal congestion and sorethroat which
started ~ 1week ago. Most prominent has been a persistent dry
cough and worsening SOB and wheezing. No sputum production. Does
note vague left sided chest pain worsened with cough. Also notes
significant myalgias she attributes to her persistent coughing.
She has been using her nebs, flovent twice daily, Adavir diskus
and albuterol as needed. Her albuterol for the last 2 days she
has been using several times during the day/evening "too many to
count". She states that her PF this AM was around 120 and is
usually in the 200s. So this made her come to the hospital.
.
Of note, patient with history of difficult to control asthma.
She is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] pulm and by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from sleep.
She was last seen by pulm in [**2112-7-11**] and by sleep in [**2112-9-10**].
As per notes, she has difficulty with medication compliance and
at times get confused about her inhalers. There was also
recommendation that she gets ride of her indoor cats (3 cats)
and farrets, however she had not done so. She states that she
has mice in her house and the cats help keep the mice way. She
was getting Xolair injection for her allergies, but she has
developed dizziness during her last injection in [**2112-10-11**]. She
saw cards since then who does not think this is related to
arrythmia and recommended doing EKG during her next injection.
She states that she has not received any injections since then.

.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 124 125/102 24 98% on 4L. Her
physical exam was notable for use of accessory muscles. Short
sentences. Tight chest with diffuse wheeze. She was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs, Solumedrol 125mg. Patient
deveoloped worsening SOB and tightness following her 2nd neb tx.
Received Magnesium and started on continuous albuterol
nebulizer. Her initial lactate was 1.8, WBC 5.4 (N:70 Band:6
L:14 M:8 E:2 Bas:0), Hgb 12.9/ Hct 38.4, plats were not measured
due to clumping. She had ABG done after having worse SOB: pH
7.52 pCO2 25/ pO2 69/ HCO3 21/ Lactate:2.8. She also continued
to be tachycardic, her EKG was consistent with sinus tachy, no
ST changes. Her Cxray showed no acute cardiac or pulmonary
process, however soft tissue attenuation causes hazy
opacification over the mid to lower portions of both lungs. She
had blood cultures sent. No antibiotics were given. She was then
admitted to the ICU for close monitoring for asthma exacerbation
and tachycardia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt was coughing with exp wheezing, but
with + lung sounds through out. She was started on nebs. Post
neb, she states to be feeling "much better". Now able to speak
in full sentences. Wheezing improving. Her sats were 100% on 3L
N/C.

Imaging:
CTA of chest/CT of abdomen/pelvis:
FINDINGS: There is no significant axillary or mediastinal
adenopathy.
Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 9
mm within the aortopulmonary window (3a:20). No evidence of
pulmonary embolus. The aorta is normal in appearance. The great
vessels opacify normally.
The trachea and bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.
The esophagus is normal in appearance. There is a small hiatal
hernia. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No consolidation. No
pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary nodules.
CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The liver is normal in
attenuation. No focal liver lesion identified. There is no
intrahepatic duct dilation.
Previous cholecystectomy noted with surgical clips within the
gallbladder
fossa. The common duct measures 7.5 mm which is in keeping with
previous
cholecystectomy. The spleen, both adrenal glands, pancreas and
both kidneys are normal in appearance. The aorta is normal in
caliber throughout. The portal vein, splenic vein, superior
mesenteric vein and mesenteric vessels opacify normally. The
visualized small and large bowel are normal. There is no
significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy. There is
no free fluid.
CT PELVIS: Intrauterine contraceptive device within the uterus.
The urinary bladder is normal in appearance with a Foley
catheter in situ. Air present within the urinary bladder is
likely due to recent instrumentation from Foley catheter
insertion. The rectum and sigmoid are normal in appearance. No
free fluid or free air. There is no inguinal or pelvic
adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No susp
