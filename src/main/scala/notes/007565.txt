Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with PMH of CML who presents following
a syncopal episode with hypoxia. Per his friend [**Name (NI) **], the
patient was walking in his kitchen at home and suddenly had a
"glazed expression". He then fell to the ground within seconds
and fell to the ground, not hitting his head. His friend was
unable to get him up from the ground so they called EMS. He
"dazed" for less than 30 seconds on the ground, then remembers
his friend trying to help him up. He had no postictal state,
prodrome, or other concerns before the episode.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have a room air sat of 88%. This
improved to 94% on 6L NC. He then dropped to 88% on 6L (pO2 61)
and was put on a NRB with improvement to 98%. He was given 2
liters of fluids for possible orthstasis. His WBC was up to 58
from 11 in [**Month (only) **]. Over concern for blast crisis, oncology was
consulted who suggested that and given 2g PO hydrea and 150 mg
po allopurinol. He was admitted to the MICU for the oxygen
requirement.

ROS: Complains of occasional DOE. No CP, SOB, F, C, N/V/D,
cough, other symptoms.

.
[**2109-4-7**]: CTA chest
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Mildly dilated pulmonary
arteries measuring 3.2 cm, which may represent pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
2. Calcified tortuous thoracic aorta, however, please note the
evaluation of aorta is limited due to poor opacification and
timing.
3. Mild diffuse septal thickening in peripheral portion of the
lungs.
4. Small mediastinal nodes.
.
[**2109-4-8**]: TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. No intra-cardiac shunt detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]M with CML, tachy-brady syndrome
who presents with syncopal episode, found to be hypoxic with WBC
of 50's.
.
1.) Hypoxia - The most likely cause to the hypoxia was CHF and
volume overload as the hypoxia resolved with diuresis.  Although
the chest xray was relative unremarkable for pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation with CTA was negative except for septal
thickening and possible elevated PA pressures. TTE with shunt
studye was negative for shunt.  He was gently diuresed and his
oxygentation was normal at time of discharge.  Note was made
that although his initial ABG showed a pO2 of 60 c/w hypoxia,
his pulse-oximetry was inconsistent likely related to the wide
pulse variability secondary to this frequent ectopic rhythm.
.
2.) Tachy-brady: The patient has a history of tachy likely
aflutter with 2:1 conduction which managing with beta-blockade
has been limited by symptomatic brady-cardia.  His syncope was
most likely related to a bradycardic event.  He was monitored on
telemetry and now pacer requiring rhythms were detected.  He was
followed by the EP service who recommended pacemaker placement
on a non-emergent basis. His beta-blocker was continued as
tolerated. He was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-of-Hearts monitor and
follow-up planned with his PCP and his cardiologist for planned
pacemaker placement as an outpatient.
.
3.) Syncope - The cause of the syncope was thought to be a
transient bradycardic event.  He remained asymptomatic during
his hospital stay despite his irregular heartrate which was felt
to be predominantly a low-atrial ectopic rhythm. The TTE
revealed no evidence of outflow obstruction as the cause of the
syncope.
.
4.) Mental Status - There was initial concern for altered mental
status.  The patient had a non-focal neuro exam and per
discussions with his PCP the patient was near his baseline.
.
5.) CML with elevated WBC: The patient has a long history of CML
and has been on hydrea for maintenance of the blood counts.  He
presented with elevated WBC and plts but no evidence of blasts
in the periphery to suggest blast crisis. He was followed by the
hematology service who recommended an increase in his hydrea
dose and continuation of the allopurinol.
.
6.) HTN - titrate beta-blocker as tolerated by heart rate.
7.) hypothyroid - no active issues.  There was a mildly elevated
TSH but in the setting of the acute illness, no changes to his
thyroid replacement was made.  This can be followed-up as an
outpatient.
.
8.) proph - SQHeparin, bowel regimen
9.) FEN - po as tolerated
10.) code - full
11.) access - PIV
12.) dispo - The patient was discharged to home with
[**Doctor Last Name **]-of-Hearts monitor with follow-up plan as above.
