Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for cardiac catheterization and
electrophysiology evaluation following admission for chest pain
with ventricular fibrillation arrest, myocardial infarction, and
heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stenting of the LAD [**2132-6-19**]
Cardiac catheterization with stenting of the LAD again on
[**2132-6-19**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old woman with history of CAD s/p remote
MI (20 yrs ago) and anterior MI ([**12/2130**]), type II diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior DVT who was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2132-6-6**] complaining of nausea,
vomiting, cough and sudden onset shortness of breath. She was
found to have elevated troponin at OSH (on admission 0.98, peak
at 27) consistent with myocardial infaction. CXR showed
pulmonary edema. She was treated medically with heparin
(converted to Lovenox), beta blocker, aspirin, statin and
diuresis. Per report, ECG on admission was notable for sinus
tachycardia, STE in II, III, aVF (not available in chart). She
had a urinalysis consistent with a urinary tract infection and
was started on levofloxacin. On [**6-12**], she had a ventricular
fibrillation arrest, received one shock and returned to sinus
rhythm. Reportedly the rhythm was polymorphic non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia which deteriorated into ventricular
fibrillation (no strips available). She was started on
amiodarone. An echocardiogram was done on [**2132-6-9**] and showed EF
40% with low septal apical inferior hypokinesis, consistent with
systolic left ventricular heart failure. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology
evaluation.

Of note, prior to admission she was living independently with a
health care assistant. She had been living with her husband but
he has been hospitalized over the past three months. This was a
major source of stress for the patient.

On arrival to the catheterization laboratory holding area, the
patient refused cardiac catheterizaiton. She is anxious about
lying flat for 4 hrs following the procedure. She was also noted
to have multiple loose bowel movements beginning this morning.
Per the patient's daughter she had asked for a suppository prior
to transfer but unclear per nursing notes whether or not she
received one. The patient's mental status is slightly altered
which per her daughter is consistent with her mental status
since this admission to [**Hospital3 **].

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, and ankle edema. Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope, however patient
does not appear to be a reliable informant.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease
  inferior MI [**44**] yrs ago
  anteroseptal MI [**12-8**]

Claustrophobia

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. The patient lives at
home alone currently. She lives with her husband at baseline,
however he has been hospitalized over the past three months.

Non contributory

ECG [**2132-6-17**] 11:43:04 AM
Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm. There are Q waves in the inferior leads
with ST-T wave abnormalities suggestive of inferior wall
myocardial infarction, most likely acute or subacute. There is
also poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out old anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. There are also diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities with deep T wave inversions throughout the
precordial leads suggestive of myocardial ischemia/injury
pattern. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2132-6-17**] CXR
The aorta is unfolded with wall calcifications.  Hilar contour
is unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is within normal
limits. Healed, right-sided rib fracture is seen.  No focal
opacity indicating pneumonia is identified.
