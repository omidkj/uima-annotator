History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 42 year old male with HIV/AIDS (CD4 74, VL
96K), h/o toxo, anemia, and hep B, who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with
fever, malaise and hemoptysis (per patient's brother). Per
patient, he's been having fevers for 6 months. He denies
abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea. He does report vomiting,
but denies hematemesis. He has been having chronic headaches. He
also reports episodes of bright red blood per rectum, though
this is not new. When asked why he came to the ED, he states he
is not sure.
.
Per patient's brother, the patient has communication problems,
particularly stuttering. He also states patient's right side is
not as strong as his left, particuarly after he got diagnosed
with the toxo. The brother also reports the patient has been
weak and coughing up blood for about one month.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.8, 108, 112/79, 18, 98%RA. He had a
CXR which showed multifocal patchy opacities, and a CT with
RML/LLL PNA, but too much motion artifact to comment on ground
glass opacity. His oxygenation remained stable. He was given
bactrim, levofloxacin, and prednisone in the ED. He also had
blood on his rectal exam, and an NGL was performed which was
negative. He was given 2L IVF and 1 unit of blood as well as
PPI. Vitals prior to transfer were 82, 101/70, 15, 100%2L NC.
.
The patient was transferred from the ED to the MICU Green
overnight on [**12-24**] for observation. His Hct remained stable and
he required no further transfusions. The bleeding was thought to
be secondary to hemorrhoids (he has a known history of
hemorrhoids). GI was consulted and recommended outpatient scope
as well as stool studies. Given the CT chest findings,
hemoptysis, and HIV status, he underwent BAL for TB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
this showed just blood. These studies are pending. He was
started on empiric levoflox, vanc, bactrim, and prednisone to
cover HCAP and PCP.
.
Currently, the patient is comfortable. He is without any
complaints. He denies pain. He notes only weakness prior to
admission. He does not know of any exposures to TB and has not
lived in a shelter or nursing home and has not been
incarcerated.
