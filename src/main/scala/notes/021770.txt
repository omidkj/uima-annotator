HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male who
was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and underwent
neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced disease.  He
presents now for resection of his tumor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer as above status post
laparoscopy, Port-A-Cath placement, J tube placement, status
post chemoradiation.

Hypertension.

GERD.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Oxycodone every 4-6 hours.
2. Protonix.
3. Aleve.
4. Hydrocodone every 4-6 hours.
5. Levaquin for recent question pneumonia.
6. Morphine short and long-acting.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2184-12-28**], he underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**]
[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.  The procedure was uncomplicated
and his postoperative course was summarized as follows:

Neurologic:  His pain initially was controlled with an
epidural and then with a PCA with transition to oral
medications.  He continues to have significant pain issues
including right leg pain, which has been chronic and is being
worked up in  the past.  He is now back on all his
preoperative pain medications at the slightly higher doses,
and in addition, is on a clonidine patch.

Cardiovascular:  He did present with an episode of atrial
fibrillation postoperatively, which was controlled and
converted to sinus with beta-blockers.  He remains on beta-
blockers with good heart rate and blood pressure control.

Respiratory:  Initially, he had presented with mild hypoxia
and dyspnea.  This improved with aggressive pulmonary toilet.
His last sputum culture grew gram-negative rods and there was
a question of possible infiltrate on a CT scan and therefore
is being treated with levofloxacin.  Prior to discharge, his
sats have remained stable and good on room air, and he has
not had any complaints of shortness of breath.

GI:  On postoperative day seven, the patient underwent a
swallow study, which showed slow emptying of the stomach, but
leak at the anastomosis.  After that, his diet was gradually
advanced.  He is now tolerating a regular soft diet, which
should be continued.  Since postoperative day one, he has
been on tube feeds, which have been increased slowly to goal
and is now getting cycled tube feeds at night, which include
ProBalance at 85 cc an hour from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

GU:  Patient's renal function has remained normal at all
times and his urine output has been good.

Heme:  During his stay here, the patient was kept on
subcutaneous prophylactic Heparin to prevent DVT.  Throughout
his hospitalization, he required only 1 unit of blood on
postoperative day two for a low hematocrit and tachycardia.
He has remained stable since and his last hematocrit is 28.6
on [**1-10**].

ID:  On [**1-8**], the patient developed fever.  At that
time, he had central lines in place.  Cultures were drawn and
the line was removed.  Both blood cultures and the line tip
grew MRSA, and therefore, it was concluded that the patient
had line sepsis with bacteremia.  Given the culture results,
he is being treated with Vancomycin since IV through his
port.  He has remained afebrile since and our hope is to
complete a two week course of antibiotics through the port,
which hopefully can be saved and shows no signs of infection
at this time.

Musculoskeletal:  As noted, the patient is persistently
complaining of pain, which has been a chronic problem since
preoperative, but at the same time has been able to ambulate
independently and with some work with physical therapy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is discharged in stable
condition to a rehabilitation facility with the following
recommendations:
Continue cycled tube feeds and at the same time advance by
mouth intake with supplements and diet.

Continue Vancomycin for a total of two week treatment.

Continue current pain control with followup with the Chronic
Pain Service in order to manage his pain issues and consult
these treatments.

Please refer to the discharge paperwork as to discharge
medications.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Esophageal cancer status post
chemoradiation.
