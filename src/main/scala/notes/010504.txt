Brief Hospital Course:
A 38 year old lady with a history of severe asthma with
environmental triggers presenting with two episodes of the same
to the ICU.  At the time of arrival she looked quite comfortable
and was not in active respiratory distress, but given her
history she was monitored closely overnight.  She required one
dose of continuous nebs as well as her normal inhaled
medications.  She did not require other doses of nebs overnight
and had a low O2 requirement.  She was given double her daily
dose of home steroids.  In the morning she stated she felt much
better, but with a mild cough, which she often gets after asthma
exacerbations.  She noted subjective improvement in respiratory
status and wanted to go home.  Her peak flow improved to 280
(baseline 300) and her O2 sats remained above 95% on RA.  Her
lungs were clear with good air movment bilaterally.  Given the
increased in WBC with prednisone burst her home steroid regimen
remains unclear.  Therefore she will be discharged on home
medications without a steroid burst and will follow up with her
pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 2177**].
