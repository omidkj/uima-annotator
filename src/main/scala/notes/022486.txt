gravity, and dysarthric. GCS 7 at arrival to ED. Head CT
demonstrated R cerebellar hemorrhage. Pt electively intubated in
the ED s/p these findings.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2173-4-20**]: A large, acute, mostly right cerebellar
hemorrhage. Fourth ventricle is not identified concerning for a
development of hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of
hydrocephalus yet. Subdural hematoma along the left tentorium.
Blood in the right sphenoid sinus.

Head CT [**2173-4-22**]: Status post evacuation of cerebellar hemorrhage,
with overall unchanged appearance of the brain with residual
hemorrhage in posterior fossa and arund the ventricular
catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was seen by the stroke team initially and then by the
neurosurgery team after she was diagnosed with a R cerebellar
hemorrhage. A ventriculostomy drain was placed at the bedside
and an MRI was performed which demonstrated a question of
increased pressure and the risk of impending herniation. The
patient was emergently consented via her family and taken to the
operating room for an occipital craniotomy with evacuation of
the hemorrhage. She was transferred intubated to the SICU where
her blood pressure was controlled, neuro checks were performed
and she was carefully monitored. She remained stable, however,
was minimally responsive off sedation. POD1 she was noted to be
in rate controlled atrial fibrillation and a cardiology consult
was obtained. They recommended rate control with metoprolol and
amiodarone for an attempt at conversion. Over the next few days,
she was in and out of atrial fibrillation with normal blood
pressures. At this time, her ventriculostomy drain was in place
with normal ICPs. On POD 4 her ventriculostomy drain was d/ced
without any complication. Over the next few days her mental
status improved, she opened her eyes and did follow simple
commands. Nutrition was maintained with tube feeds via a dobhoff
tube.
POD 8 a tracheostomy was placed at the bedside. Per her
families' wishes, a PEG tube was deferred. She was weaned to
trach mask and remained afebrile and stable. Patient at this
point was in NSR and cardiology did recommend an amiodarone
taper.
Over the next few days, despite being afebrile, pt's WBC did
continue to increase, peaking at 24,000. Pancultures were sent
which were positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in her blood and
on her CVL catheter tip. She was started on Zosyn for
Pseudomonas coverage. Her WBC did trend down, and she remained
afebrile and stable.
Prior to discharge, a postpyloric feeding tube was placed in
interventional radiology and the patient was started on tube
feeds. She was discharged to rehabilitation on POD 14 in stable
condition.
