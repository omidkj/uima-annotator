Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intubation and extubation x 2
PEG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
83yo F with baseline dementia, Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] on Prednisone,
Asp PNA, Splenectomy, hx of MVR (porcine valve), CVA, Afib, hx
Endocarditis who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure. The
pt's family states that one month ago, the pt saw her
neurologist; at that time they requested that decreased the
prednisone dose. Pt's MG has been stable for ~ 10 years on 10mg.
Initially, prednisone decreased to alternating 10/5mg; then
decreased to 5mg qd, which is the current dose. Per dtr, she
noted pt developed non-productive cough, increased dysphagia,
and increased lethargy 2 weeks ago - the grandson disagrees with
this history. One day PTA, pt was noted to have increased
lethargy and difficulty walking (is able to walk with assistance
at baseline). Temp was noted to be 100; brought pt to ED. Family
denies recent chills, pains (pt is non-communicative), cough,
changes in urination (incontinent at baseline), diarrhea.
.
On presentation to the ED, the pt was found to have a fever to
101.4 and to be hypoxic to the 80s and rapidly deteriorated to
the 70s at which point she was intubated. Started on propofol
drip.
Initial labs remarkable for Lactate 3.5, WBC 25. CXR with RML
infiltrate. In the ED was given Ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
Started on propofol drip. Given 3L NS, tylenol, decadron 10mg IV
x1.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 83yo F with Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **], asthma, hx of splenectomy and
aspiration PNA, CVA and MVR with Afib who is admitted from the
ED with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and
RSV.
.
#. Respiratory Failure (hypoxic at admission then later
hypercarbic for reintubation):  The patient empirically started
on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and clindamycin to cover community
acquired PNA as well as aspiration PNA given her previous hx of
aspiration pneumonia and Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  Because of her
level of hypoxia, she was intubated for oxygenation.  Given her
chronic steroid use for MG and immunosuppression, bronchoscopy
was done and was ruled out of PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cx eventually grew S.
pneumo and viral cx came back positive for RSV.  The patient was
continued on ceftriaxone, azithro, and clinida until the patient
developed rash likely from ceftriaxone as she has a known PCN
allergy causing rash.  The patient was switched to levofloxacin
and finished a total of 7 day course of antibiotics.  The
patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator and extubated
on [**2-21**].  While waiting to be called out to the floor, the
patient developed CHF exacerbation [**1-23**] poor BP and pulse control
as the patient has MVR.  After diuresis and better BP and pulse
control, the patient was ready to be called out but then
developed somnolence.  ABG was obtained and was 7.22/90/91 c/w
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient was placed on
BIPAP with improvement with hypercarbia but did not resolve,
thus the patient was re-intubated after discussing with family.
On the day after intubation, the patient spiked a temp and
developed leukocytosis, so pt was started on vanco and levo
empircally for nosocomial PNA. After cultures returned negative
48 hours however, the abx were discontinued. The patient was
aggressively diuresed and BP and pulse were strictly controlled.
 After adequate diuresis, the patient was extubated again and
weaned O2 supplement as tolerated.  She was transferred to the
floor where she remained stable.  Her oxygen was gradually
weaned until patient was maintaining oxygen saturation of 94-95%
on room air.
.
#. Streptococcal PNA/RSV/ citrobacter UTI:  The patient was on
ceftriaxone, azithro and clinda for 5 days and then switched to
levo to complete a 7 day course of abx for PNA until [**2-22**].
Citrobacter was pansensitive.

#. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: The patient was transiently on iv
solumedrol then swithed to home dose prednisone 10mg qday.
Initially, there was a question whether recent lowering of
prednisone to 5 mg could be contributing to difficulty
ventilation weaning and neurology and neuromuscular were
consulted.  It was concluded that the patient was less likely to
having myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] flare, and was continued on the same
prednisone dose.  The patient was extubated successfully with
diuresis, nebs and treatment of PNA. When the patient was
re-intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, prednisone was
increased to 10mg qday.
.
CVS:
#. ischemia: The patient was ruled out with negative 3 sets of
negative cardiac biomarkers.
.
#. CHF:  The patient received a lot of fluids while in the MICU
and developed pulmonary edema.  The patient was subsequently
diuresed with iv lasix and later auto-diuresed herself as well.
The patient was given iv lasix/prn for diuresis. The patient was
also started on BB and ACEI.  The patient will likely need a
standing po lasix as outpatient.
.
#. A-fib: hx of afib. The patient was in and out of a-fib while
in the MICU.  As the patient was on no anticoagulation as
outpatient, so no anticoagulation was started.  The patient was
started on low dose BB and was titrated up for rate control.
.
# HTN: The patient was noted to be hypertensive in the MICU and
was started on a BB and ACEI.  Her blood pressure remained
well-controlled on the current regimin.
.
# PPX: tylenol, PPI, bowel regimen, sc heparin
.
# FEN: The patient failed speech and swallow on [**2121-2-21**] and
post-pyloric tube was placed and started tube feeding. Speech
and swallow evaluation was repeated on [**2121-3-4**] and patient
failed again.  PEG tube was placed on [**2121-3-5**].  There were
well as discussions about the PEG tube and the fact that she
will likley remain unable to tolerate PO indefintely.   Although
they say they understand that she cannot tolerate food or
liquids, they are a
