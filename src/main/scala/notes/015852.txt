Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Mirtazapine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing for VTach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Your ICD was interrogated on [**2147-8-21**], and you were shocked for
Ventricular Tachycardia by your AICD once during this admission.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 86 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2136**],
chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF 20%,
who presents with recurrent ICD firing in the setting of
sustained VTach.  The patient states that he was in his normal
state of health until this afternoon, when he was "shocked" at
his nursing home.  Per the nursing home, the patient was shocked
by his ICD at approximately 3 PM.  He then had [**6-21**] subsequent
episodes of ICD firing.  He became unresponsive for 5-10 seconds
during these episodes but regained consciousness with ICD
firing.  The patient denies recent lower extremity swelling,
shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND.  He does endorse a feeling
of chest fullness after the repeated shocks.  The patient was
brought to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, the patient's VS were T 98.1, P 74, BP 118/80, R 16,
O2 96% on RA.  EP was consulted and the patient's pacemaker was
interrogated.  The patient's programmed anti-tachycardia pacing
settings were decreased, and the number of Joules for firing was
increased from 20 to 35.  He was thought to be fluid overloaded,
so he was given Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  He was then given a
Lidocaine bolus of 100 mg IV and started on Lidocaine 2 mg gtt.


On arrival to the floor, the patient had another episode of VT,
for which he was shocked after approximately 15 seconds.  The
patient was unresponsive during this episode but regained
consciousness when his ICD fired.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does endorse recent constipation for the past two days.  All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion (though poor exercise capacity), paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

RELEVANT STUDIES:

CXR ([**2147-8-21**]):  Wet read: low lung volumes result in
bronchovascular crowding, likely account for right infrahilar
opacity. vascular congestion, new retrocardiac opacity.

CXR ([**2147-8-25**]): Interval worsening of the left basal
consolidation that might represent infectious process versus
atelectasis.

EKG ([**2146-8-24**]):  Ventricularly paced at rate of 79 bpm.  Left
axis deviation.  RBBB with LAFB.  Q waves in II, III, AVF.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2146-8-22**]): Left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of nearly all
segments. Estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
Aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. Aortic valve leaflets (3)
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular
cavity enlargement with extensive regional systolic dysfunction
and depressed cardiac index c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated thoracic
aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Ventricular Tachycardia:  The patient had approximately 8
episodes of VTach the day of admission, for which his ICD fired.
 He became unresponsive for approximately 5-10 seconds during
these episodes and regained consciousness with ICD firing.  It
appears that the patient was not taking Amiodarone at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab. On discussion with staff and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], it seemed
that Amiodarone was discontinued since patient had not had VT or
ICD firing from [**Month (only) **] to [**2147-6-16**], and it was felt pt would be
stable off Amiodarone. Interrogation of his pacemaker on
admission showed over 20 shocks delivered for VT in the past few
weeks. The most likely etiology for these recurrence episodes is
lack of effective medication and electrolyte disturbances were
thought to have played a secondary role.

Patient was treated with Lidocaine and amiodarone drip in the
CCU and transitioned to Amiodarone PO after a 10 gram load. He
is currently on Amiodarone 400 mg daily. He has had many
episodes of Slow VT (rates 120's) in which the BP has been
stable and pt has been asymptomatic. His ICD was adjusted so
that a shock is delivered only for VF or VT at a very high rate.
 It is also set to pace him out of faster rhythms as a primary
r
