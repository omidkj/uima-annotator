Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Witnessed Public Fall

Hip fracture repair - no complications


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt. is a 55 year-old male with a history of coronary
artery disease and diabetes mellitus who presented after being
found down by EMS.  At the time of my encounter, the pt was
intubated and sedated and thus the history is per the record.
On arrival to the ED, the pt. stated that he bent over to get
his wallet and could not get up. He denied losing consciousness.
EMS was called at 1331, arrived at 1337, departed at 1339 and
arrived at hospital at 1352. It is presumed he was not down for
long as he was in a populated area, town
square, and EMS was called immediately. Per EMS notes, he was
alert and oriented x3, found supine on the ground, denied all
complaints. EMS report noted slurred speech, right sided gaze
preference, weakness on the left side.  Per EMS record, the pt's
fingerstick glucose was 163, Pupils 4mm bilaterally.
Pt arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] and a "code stroke" was called at 1402.
Patient seen immediately by ED neuro resident. Patient was found
awake, alert, fluent, denying anything is the matter, was noted
to have right gaze preference, left sided hemiparesis (held both
UE to gravity x 10 seconds, held left LE to gravity x 4 seconds
then fell), left sensory neglect, left field cut vs. neglect.
NIHSS of 10 on arrival. Fingerstick glucose was 161 in the ED.
The pt was taken for head CT, which was negative for bleed. The
patient denied history of GI bleed, MVA or trauma, recent MI,
h/o stroke or seizures, recent surgery, brain tumor, aneurysms.
SBP was 171/110 thus intravenous t- PA was given. Stated weight
of 240 pounds, thus patient was bolused with 9mg t- PA at 1433,
and remaining 81mg infused over the next hour.
After t- PA was given, patient's status worsened, with less
verbal output, inability to raise left side to gravity (was able
to previously). Repeat head CT showed no bleed. Later, patient
began having periods of apnea, became cyanotic, using accessory
muscles to breathe, thus patient intubated and sedated at 1515.

Home O2.

EKG: incomplete LBBB, TWI flattening V4-V6

CT head:
There is a small lacunar infarction in the right basal ganglia
which appears old and there is a tiny area of decreased
attenuation in the right parietal white matter, also with the
appearance of an old infarction. There are no areas of cortical
attenuation abnormality or gyral edema to suggest acute cortical
infarction. The ventricles are not dilated. There is no shift of
intracranial structures. No acute intracranial hemorrhage is
seen. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.
The skull has a normal appearance.
IMPRESSION: An acute infarction is not identified, however, MRI
with
diffusion-weighted imaging would be a more sensitive study for
evaluation if this is suspected. There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage. .

MRI/MRA ([**2140-8-19**])
FINDINGS BRAIN MRI:
Diffusion images demonstrate slow diffusion in the right insular
cortex extending to the right basal ganglia and corona radiata
region indicative of acute infarct. Small areas of acute infarct
also seen in the posterior aspect of the right sylvian fissure
along the right temporal cortex and in the right frontal
cortical region. These findings indicate acute infarcts in the
distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. Additionally,
a small area of slow diffusion is identified at the left
parietal convexity region. This most likely represents a small
area of acute infarct in the left parietal cortex. There is no
mass effect or midline shift seen. Mild prominence of ventricles
and sulci noted. Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal
enhancement seen. No evidence of acute or chronic blood products
are identified.
IMPRESSION: Acute infarcts in the distribution of right middle
cerebral artery, predominantly involving the insular cortex and
subcortical region of the corona radiata and basal ganglia.
Small infarcts in the right temporal and frontal region are also
noted. A small infarct is seen in the left parietal cortical
region. No enhancing lesions are identified.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of vascular
occlusion or stenosis is seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
.
ECHO [**2140-8-19**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (however
cannot exclude and views were suboptimal). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis/akinesis, severe septal hypokinesis and probable
apical hypokinesis with moderate to severe hypokinesis
elsewhere. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic root
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.
