Aspiration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4476**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a long history of
end-stage dementia for at least 10 years with recurrent
aspiration pneumonias and pressure ulcers who presents to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital **] Rehab with an aspiration. He was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-3**] after he had an aspiration and had a
prolonged intubation. He was treated with vanc/zosyn for a two
week course which was completed [**3-5**]. Today, nursing at [**Hospital1 **]
noted that his abdomen was somewhat distended. A KUB was
performed that showed the feeding tube was coiled in his stomach
in a different position. Tube feeds were restarted and the
feeding tube was noted to be further displaced with the phlange
out of place. The patient was turned and began vomiting and
gagging and was suctions. His VS when he was evaluated there
were T 98.8 BP 119/76 RR 32 Sat 90% on 60% FM.
.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED evaluation. In the ED,
he was immediately intubated, and started on
levaquin/vanc/flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia. He
transiently dropped his blood pressure to a systolic of 80's
over 30's and was started on levophed.

RADIOLOGY
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-3-9**] 10:48 PM
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with perihilar haze and
upper zone redistribution present. A focal opacity is present in
the left mid lung zone. Findings may represent CHF/volume
overload with concern for concomitant infection.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-3-19**] 3:49 PM
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has developed since
[**3-16**], partially obscuring multifocal consolidation, and
accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion. Large
cardiac silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right
central venous line are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-3-21**] 9:51 AM
IMPRESSION: Worsening of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe
consolidations vs. left pleural effusion. 2) Improvement of the
right lower lobe consolidation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-4-2**] 1:02 PM
FINDINGS: There is a frontal and a view dedicated to the right
lateral chest. The tracheostomy tube is unchanged. The right IJ
line with tip in the superior vena cava is unchanged. There
continue to be patchy areas of opacity in both lower lungs and
in the perihilar regions suggesting multifocal pneumonia. There
could also be an element of CHF

C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2175-4-5**] 1:24 PM
CHANGE G-TUBE TO G-J TUBE
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a MIC gastrojejunostomy tube
with the tip of the tube in the small bowel loop. This catheter
is ready to use

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-4-6**] 12:33 PM
Right pleural effusion is again demonstrated grossly unchanged
as well as pleural effusion on the left. The position of the
various lines and tubes is unaltered and the left lower lobe
consolidation is again demonstrated

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-4-11**] 5:59 AM
Moderately severe pulmonary edema and moderate left and small
right pleural effusion have increased over the past five days.
More discrete region of consolidation seen in the left perihilar
lung is now partially obscured but has not cleared and other
areas of pneumonia could be obscured by the effusions and edema.
Heart size is top normal. Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian
central venous catheter ar
