Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous inferior vena cava filter placement.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with
history of glioblastoma of the right temporal lobe, s/p
resection [**2101-12-30**] followed by irradiation and temozolomide, VP
shunt placement on [**2102-8-1**], and now on Procarbazine, CCNU, and
Vincristine (PCV) since [**2102-8-23**].  His most recent cycle was on
[**2102-10-10**].  He presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED on [**2102-11-14**]
with shortness of breath.  The patient states that his shortness
of breath started 2 days prior to admission but worsened the day
prior to admission so much that he could not move without
becoming short of breath and even at rest was SOB.  He denies
fevers or chills.  He reports a cough which started on the day
of admission which is non-productive.  He states that everyone
in his family has a head cold currently.  He has congestion and
right ear fullness with decreased hearing, and has been using
drops to break up the wax in his ear.  He reports 2 days of
diarrhea last week after eating raw shellfish which as resolved.


He initially went to [**Hospital3 4107**] and underwent CTA which
showed no pulmonary embolism but did show bilateral infiltrates
concerning for pneumonia.  He received 750 mg of Levaquin at the
OSH.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Of note, he
has been on dexamethasone for almost 1 year and has not taken
Bactrim prophylaxis.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and
admitted.  The informal read of the CTa was suspicious for
pulmonary embolism.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncological History:
- [**12-21**] developed headaches and leg weakness and CT at [**Hospital1 **] showed right temporal lobe mass. Started on
dexamethasone.  Underwent subtotal resection of the R temporal
lobe mass by Papavassilious on [**2101-12-30**], path positive for GBM
- received temozolamide chemo-radiation, followed by adjuvant
temozolomide (4 cycles)
- ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2102-8-1**]
- started Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) on [**2102-8-23**]
- cycle 2 of PCV on [**2102-10-10**]

None.

EXTREMITIES: wwp, no edema. DPs, PTs 2+.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
60.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  His language is
fluent with good comprehension.  Short-term recall is intact.
He has mild psychomotor slowing.  Cranial Nerve Examination:
His pupils are equal and reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm
bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are full without nystagmus.
Visual fields
are full to confrontation.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He does not have tremors while working on
[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] eighth floor.  His muscle strengths are [**5-17**] at all
muscle groups, except for proximal lower extremity weakness at
4+/5 strength on both side.  His muscle tone is normal.  His
reflexes are 2- bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His
toes are down.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  He cannot do tandem.  Coordination examination
does not reveal

Imaging:
CT head [**2102-11-16**]: 1. No acute hemorrhage.
2. Large confluent hypodensity involving the right
frontoparietal and
temporal lobes with adjacent vasogenic edema. Increased mass
effect with
compression of the adjacent right lateral ventricle with
leftward shift has
increased since prior study (MRI [**2102-10-2**]).
3. Post-VP shunt terminating in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is
unchanged in
position.

CT head [**2102-11-23**]: Technically limited study by patient motion,
with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Large right
cerebral hypodensity with associated mass effect is
redemonstrated, with decreased right to left subfalcine shift,
though increased mass effect and compression of the right
lateral ventricle.

Echocardiogram [**2102-11-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler or rest
saline injection. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild anterior and anterolateral wall
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with low normal global systolic function. Mildly right
ventricular dysfunction. No ASD/PFO detected with rest saline
contrast only.

CXR [**2102-11-17**]: (upon admission):  Interval increase in the degree
of the bilateral consolidations within the upper lobes and
appearance of new consolidation in the right mid-lung concerning
for progression of the pneumonia.

CXR [**2102-11-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
minimal increase of the pre-existing opacities at the left lung
base. Otherwise, the distribution and severity of the
pre-existing opacities is unchanged. No evidence of newly
appeared parenchymal opacities. Unchanged low lung volumes with
mild cardiomegaly, minimal overhydration and absence of larger
pleural effusions.

CTA Chest:
1. Motion artifacts, decreased image quality.
2. No definite pulmonary emboli. Borderline cardiomegaly.
3. Bilateral upper and lower lobe reticular and ground glass
density lower lobe opacities, suggesting evolving pneumonia.
Differential diagnosis is lengthy, and may include opportunistic
pathogens.  More linear right upper lobe densities could
represent linear atelectasis.
4. Possible hepatic steatosis.
5. Small zone of lingular region peripheral atelectasis next to
major fissure.

[**2102-11-27**] CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:
CT THORAX: The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube
lying approximately 20 mm above the carina.  An NG tube is noted
in situ.
There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath whose tip is seen in the
right v
