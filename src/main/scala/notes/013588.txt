.
Images:
CXR: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Evaluation is limited due to low lung volumes and the patient's
chin overlying the lung apices as well as patient's rotation to
the right. There is persistent large right pleural effusion with
right basilar consolidation. The left lung appears grossly
clear. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion more apparent
in the right upper lung. Heart size cannot be assessed. Aorta
appears unfolded. No definite pneumothorax is seen. Bones are
demineralized. IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided pleural
effusion with right basilar consolidation, likely atelectasis.
Increasing congestion notable in the right lung. Evaluation
quite limited due to patient's position.
.
EKG: NSR at 69, incomplete LBBB, normal axis, low limb lead
voltage, diffuse TWF; all grossly unchanged from prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
77M with CAD, CHF EF 20%, dementia; presenting with
conjunctivitis and hypoxemia yesterday, admitted to MICU for
sCHF exacerbation.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: EF 20%. Patient
demonstrated evidence of volume overload with tachypnea,
hypoxia, LE edema, decreased breath sounds, and elevated JVD.
Pneumonia was initially considered and he was covered with 24
hrs of Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone, but he had no
evidence of leukocytosis or fever and little change in a CXR, so
the antibiotics were stopped. A serum BNP was markedly elevated
on admission and clinical exam were more consistent with CHF
exacerbation. CXR demonstrated a large, simple right pleural
effusion. He was treated with supplemental O2, Albuterol nebs,
diuresed with IV Lasix, and continued his home dose Metoprolol
and Enalapril. His symptoms improved on with this regimen and
his effusion demonstrated improvement with serial CXR's. While
the cause of his CHF exacerbation is unknown, the patient
reports medication compliance and cardiac enzymes were negative
x 3 without EKG changes. Despite the absence of clear ischemic
event, he was maintained on telemetry throughout this
hospitalization without incident. He was discharged on an
increased dose of Lasix.
.
# Bilateral Conjunctivitis: Patient with marked erythema and
exudate on admission, most likely bacterial. He received 1.5
days of Ciprofloxacin eye drops and changed to Erythromycin
drops QID on admission with subsequent improvement in his
symptoms. He completed 7 days of treatment & the patient was
without eye pain or significant periorbital edema throughout
this admission and his extraocular movements were intact
throughout his stay.
.
# CAD: Patient with negative CE's x 3. Patient continued on his
home Metoprolol and a an ASA was restarted, but he was not on a
statin on admission and it was not started as an inpatient. He
remained on telemetry throughout this hospitalization without
incident.
.
# Hematuria: Patient with an episode of hematuria, thought to be
[**1-2**] traumatic Foley placement. Hematuria improved without
intervention.
.
# Dementia. Patient continued on his home Aricept, but Namenda
was not given because it was non-formulary. It was restarted at
discharge.
.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Patient remained in sinus
rhythm throughout this admission. He was continued on his home
Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] with adequate rate control. He was started
on ASA 325mg in lieu of Coumadin given his history of GI bleed.
.
# Hypertension: Patient normotensive as an inpatient, but
continued on his home Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], Enalapril 20mg daily,
& Lasix 80mg IV PRN.

# Elevated INR: Patient with elevated INR, thought to be
nutritional deficiency. Given 1mg Vitamin K with subsequent
improvement in his INR from 1.7 to 1.3.
.
# Code: Patient remained FULL CODE throughout this
hospitalization
