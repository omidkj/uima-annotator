Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization  [**2200-3-7**]
[**2200-3-11**] CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to DIAG)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old male with CAD s/p MI with DES to
LAD in [**2196**] c/b ISRS in [**2196**] (re-stent) and [**4-/2199**] (BMS x3) and
DES to proximal LAD in [**9-/2199**], rapid atrial tachycardia s/p
AVNRT ablation, DM2, ESRD on HD (last done yesterday), and PVD
s/p partial left foot amputation.  He reports that he developed
a productive cough on [**2200-3-3**].  He did not have any fevers or
chills.  Later that night, he developed substernal chest pain
and pressure like "an elbow pressing in the chest" up to [**6-17**] in
intensity.  He denied any associated dyspnea, nausea, vomiting,
or diaphoresis.  The pain resolved with SLNG, but recurred the
next morning shortly before his PCA arrived.  He has had anginal
chest pain in the past with a similar quality, but not as
severe.  He continued to have chest pain, and was brought to the
[**Hospital3 417**] ED.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2200-3-4**], where he was found
to have hyperkalemia and Troponin elevation with peak 43.71.
His CXR reportedly showed "mild congestion."  He was started on
a Heparin drip.  His pain resolved and he had no further
complaints of chest pain, but did have dyspnea getting up to the
commode.  He was transferred here today for cardiac
catheterization.  Vital signs prior to transfer were T 98.9, HR
68 (SR with LBBB), BP 117/62, RR 22, and SpO2 98% on RA.  At the
OSH, he was also noted to be intermittently incontinent of
stool.
.
Cardiac catheterization today was attempted with a right radial
approach, but was unsuccessful, and was converted to a right
femoral approach.  The cath showed 3VD and no intervention was
performed.  He is now being evaluated for possible CABG.  On
arrival to the floor, he was CP free and reported no pain or
tenderness at the cath site.  He continued to have a somewhat
productive cough.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, significant
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  He does
report DOE, and is able to walk less than 150 ft and climb less
than one flight of stairs before becoming SOB at baseline.
.
On further review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He has had a clot
removed from his dialysis fistula in the past.  He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF=25-30 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque . There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function ( EF = 30-35%)
2. Mitral regurgitation is moderate now
3. Unchanged tricuspid regurgitation
4. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 60 year old male with CAD s/p MI with DES to
LAD in [**2196**] c/b ISRS in [**2196**] (re-stent) and [**4-/2199**] (BMS x3) and
DES to proximal LAD in [**9-/2199**], rapid atrial tachycardia s/p
AVNRT ablation, DM2, ESRD on HD, and PVD s/p left foot
amputation who was admitted to OSH on [**2200-3-4**] with chest pain
with positive cardiac biomarkers and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for management of NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization,
which showed three vessel disease. He subsequently underwent
CABG....
.
# NSTEMI with coronary artery disease: The patient presented to
[**Hospital3 417**] hospital on [**2200-3-4**] in setting of chest pain
with troponin I elevation to 43.71 and CK-MB 30.8. He has a
significant history of CAD s/p multiple PCI with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 28525**]
and ISRS.  Cardiac cath showed on [**2200-3-7**] three vessel disease
and severe diastolic dysfunction.  No intervention was
performed, and he was evaluated for CABG by Cardiac Surgery.
CABG was subsequently performed...  He was continued on his home
cardiac regimen of Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, and Imdur.
 His Clopidogrel was held prior to surgery.
.
# Pump: He was found to have severe diastolic dysfunction on
cardiac cath with ECHO performed on [**2200-3-8**] showing L
