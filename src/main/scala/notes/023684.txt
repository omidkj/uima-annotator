History of Present Illness:
85 yo male with severe CAD s/p CABGx2, bioprosthetic MVR,
ischemic CM with EF 25% who presents with worsening shortness of
breath. At baseline he is able to ambulate 1 block, drive, do
his own grocery shopping and perform all of his ADL's when his
heart failure is compensated. Four weeks ago he noticed
increasing SOB and productive cough. His PCP started him on a 3
day course of azithromycin and his symptoms initially improved.
He then began noticing increasing DOE, SOB, PND and orthopnea.
He denied sick contacts, fevers, chills but cough was productive
of yellow sputum. He was taking all of his medications, there
was no dietary indiscretion, and he did not notice any increase
in his weight or LE edema. He denied any chest pain, chest
tightness or palpitations. Over the past week he has spent most
of his time in bed with poor appetite. He had difficulty even
getting to the bathroom so called his PCP who told him to
present to [**Hospital1 18**].

Swan line placement [**2128-7-13**] -
COMMENTS:     1. Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean
PCPW of
13mmHg with an elevated PAP of 50/11. Cardiac index was low
normal at
2l/min/m2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate-severe pulmonary
hypertension.
2. Mild elevation of PCW
3. Mild RV diastolic dysfunction
.
[**2128-7-13**] CXR compared to [**2128-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: Reexpanded left lower lobe with residual atelectasis
in bilateral lung bases. No acute pulmonary process.
.
[**2128-7-14**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe consolidation, new from [**2128-3-25**], likely
representing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Right infrahilar mass lesion is not excluded on this
non-contrast exam. There is a rounded, bulging contour of the
medial right major fissure, which raises the possibility of a
hilar mass. A non-contrast CT could be repeated after treatment,
to assess for clearing in this region. Alternatively,
bronchoscopy could be performed.
3. Secretions within the bronchus intermedius and right lower
lobe bronchi.
4. Chronic left lower lobe consolidation, which may be related
to aspiration.
5. Moderately severe cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 85 yo male with severe CAD s/p CABGx2, bioprosthetic
MVR, ischemic CM with EF 25% who presents with worsening
shortness of breath.  Hospital course by problem:
.
#) CAD: No symptoms or signs suggestive of an ischemic event at
this time. First set of CE is neg and there was no need to
cycle.  We continued the patient's aspirin, statin, B-blocker
and held his ACE-I for the first night while diuresis was
attempted.  The patient is on standing lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] at home
which was held in favor of PRN IV lasix here.  We restarted the
ACEI and the Lasix prior to discharge.
.
#) Rhythm: Patient was in known afib at the time of admission.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2357**] the patient's amiodrone was held. The patient
is well rate controlled and a beta-blocker was continued,
however at a lower dose. The patient is not anticoagulated
because of CHF and risk of hemoptysis, which has happend to him
in the past.
.
#) Pump: Patient appeared to be in both left and right sided
heart failure on initial exam.  A swan line was floated. Wedge
pressure of 13 suggests no severe back pressure although he does
have poor cardiac output. High PA pressures suggest pulm HTN of
unclear cause. BNP elevated.  The patient was given lasix to
remove 500cc per day.
.
#) Pneumonia:  An alternative explanation of the patient's
pulmonary symptoms was pneumonia.  A sputum gram stain revealed
gram positive cocci in chains, pairs and clusters.  He was
treated with levofloxacin.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: we continued on outpatient statin dose.
.
#) CRI: patient's creatinine was near baseline.
.
#) Anemia:  Patient is on q2week epogen for this.  On the 3rd
day of admission the patient was given 20,000 units of epogen.
