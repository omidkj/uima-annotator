History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 25-year-old male with a past medical history of
dilated cardiomyopathy (EF of 25%), hypothyroidism (secondary to
thyroid ablation in setting of Grave's disease), and morbid
obesity who is admitted from [**Hospital1 18**] ED with acute renal failure
and hyperkalemia.  One week prior to admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
started on Torsemide 100mg QD by his outpatient cardiologist.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] reports feeling nauseated since with dry heaves and poor
PO intake; he continued to take his diuretics during this time.
He has "ripping" abdoming pain every time he dry heaves.  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
also endorses some bright red blood in his stools for the past 2
days. He denies vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, fevers,
chills, visual changes, or any other signs of acute illness.
Patient denies any recent travel, no new exposures, and says
that he has been having relatively normal urine output for the
last few days.

Upon arrival to ED, initial vitals were: 96.3 88 90/49 18 SP02
100% on RA.  Creatinine was 8.2 up from a baseline of 1.1.
Potassium was 7.0 (eventually rose to 7.4) and white count was
16.4.  FeUrea 18%.  Patient received calcium, 10 units of
regular insulin, an amp of D50, and 40mg IV PPI.  An EKG showed
QRS widening and PR prolongation.  CXR was without infiltrate
and bedside ultrasound was negative for pericardial effusion.  A
non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of acute
intra-abdominal process.  Upon arrival to MICU, vitals were: 84,
80/35, 22, 100% on RA.

Imaging:
TTE [**1-23**]:
Very poor image quality. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LV systolic function appears severely depressed. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2185-4-20**], the LV may be more dilated. If
indicated, a cardiac MRI or nuclear gated blood pool scan (MUGA)
may be better to assess LV size and systolic function.

CT abd/pelvis [**1-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal process; specifically no evidence of
obstruction.
2. Fatty liver.
3. No colonic wall thickening to suggest colitis or toxic
megacolon.

LLE LENI [**1-21**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.

CT abd/pelvis [**1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for colitis or other acute intra-abdominal
process.
2. Fatty liver.
.
ECHO [**1-23**]:
Very poor image quality. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LV systolic function appears severely depressed. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2185-4-20**], the LV may be more dilated. If
indicated, a cardiac MRI or nuclear gated blood pool scan (MUGA)
may be better to assess LV size and systolic function.
.
Upper extremity ultrasound [**2-1**]:
Normal study, specifically with no right upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**1-30**]:
1. No evidence of colitis or toxic [**Last Name (un) 2432**]-colon. No other acute
abdominal
pathology.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Small amount of ascites, new since the prior study.
.
CXR [**2-8**]:
1. The left PM/ICD lead runs down the accessory left SVC,
through the
coronary sinus, and ends in the left ventricle.
2. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
3. Increased vascular distension with possible marginal edema.
