History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 73 y/o man with h/o CAD, systolic heart
dysfunction, and paroxysmal atrial fibrilation on warfarin who
presents with left flank pain, ecchymosis, and swelling of two
days duration.  Pt was in his USOH until [**2-24**] when he
developed a cough, without any associated fevers, rhinorrhea or
sputum production. He attempted to use robitussin and
multivitamins, as well as russian med (Biciptol)without
improvement of barking cough. He then saw his PCP who prescribed
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] 3 day course of Azithromycin without adjusting coumadin dose.
On day 2 pt developed pain in his left lower quadrant. Pain
worsened overnight and pt felt his side tensen and hurt
significantly when moving. His wife called EMS this morning.
.
Of note, pt's coumadin dose had recently been repeatedly
adjusted both up and down, with weekly following of INR. His
last INR was 2 weeks ago and was therapeutic at 2.3 on regimen
of 7.5mg twice a week and 5mg the remaining days. He denies any
new medications other than azithromycin and denies any dietary
changes.
.
In ED vital signs were T 97.5, BP 125/71, HR 74 RR 18 O2 sat 98%
RA. He was noted to have echymosis over his flank and CT imaging
was obtained. At radiology he complained of LH upon getting up
from the stretcher.  He denies LOC but did have some blurry
vision with this.  His symptoms resolved upon sitting.  He
denies associated CP, SOB during episode.  Orthostatics were not
done. He did not have any more such complaints. CT head was
unremarkable and CT abdomen showed a hematoma extending from the
spleen to the anterior musculature of the hip. His WBCs were 17
and a CXR and UA were negative.
.
ROS was otherwise negative. The pt denied recent unintended

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old man with history of HTN, CAD status post multiple
stents, cardioembolic CVA and paroxysmal atrial fibrilation on
warfarin who presents with left flank pain and found to have
retroperitoneal hematoma.
.
1.) Retroperitoneal hematoma: Occurred in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR of 5.6.  Appears to be spontaneous given
lack of trauma to the area.  Was recently started on
azithromycin 3 days ago which could explain increased INR.
Admission Hct 36, nadir at 26, however prior baseline was 42.
Received 5mg Vit K in ED as well as 2 units FFP to reverse
coagulopathty.  Transfused 2 units p RBCs total during stay.
Initially there was concern for continued hemorrhage, but
angiogram did not show any culprit area.  His Hct stabilized and
