Echo [**2131-5-11**]:
EF 70-75%, 3+TR 2+MR, 2+AR, mod AS, mod pulm HTN.

CXR [**2131-5-10**]:
1. Left internal jugular central venous catheter likely
terminating within the brachiocephalic confluence. No definite
pneumothorax identified; however, left apex was not included on
current radiograph.

2. Grossly unchanged appearance to bilateral pleural effusions
and basilar atelectasis. More dense opacity within the
retrocardiac region also likely represents atelectasis; however,
underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 F s/p recent left AKA on [**2131-3-23**], transferred from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with fever and hypotension.

Felt to be related to possibly multiple sources including AKA
stump (cellulitis vs abscess vs osteo), C Diff colitis, UTI;
also possible early pneumonia with retrocardiac opacity on CXR).
 Pt initially covered broadly with vanco/cefepime/metronidazole
without good effect.  Hemodynamics continued to decline as well
as respiratory status with increasing CO2 retention despite
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.

Pressors initially started with moderate effect, however, pt's
mental status began to decline despite improved mean arterial
pressures.  Family meeting was held given continued decline, and
pt was made comfort measures only by son.  Pt expired at 19:49
[**2131-5-12**] and family was informed.  Autopsy was declined.
