Date of Birth:   [**2049-8-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY AND CLINICAL COURSE:  The patient is a 70 year old
woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal
disease, on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, status
post prior myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular
disease, status post left iliac stent and right femoral
bypass and above the knee amputation, who presented with an
inferior myocardial infarction in the setting of
gastrointestinal bleeding and an INR of 3.7 on [**2119-11-6**].

The patient was intubated for flash pulmonary edema secondary
to fluid overload after receiving blood products for a
dropping hematocrit and elevated INR.  She went for a cardiac
catheterization the following day and had ostium and right
coronary artery successfully stented.  However, both cardiac
catheterization and echocardiogram revealed severe aortic
stenosis.  The patient remained pressor dependent with
aggressive medical management and periodic hemodialysis.

The patient went for vasculoplasty on [**2119-11-9**] in the
hopes of decreasing her outflow and help her cardiac output.
However, the patient continued to deteriorate clinically and
required more pressors for blood pressure support.  On
[**2119-11-10**], the patient began more hypotensive and
acidotic and required a bicarbonate drip.

On [**2119-11-11**], the patient went into a ventricular
tachycardia arrest.  She received cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and epinephrine initially.  However, given the
patient's poor prognosis and critical condition, the family
decided not to pursue more aggressive treatment and the
patient passed away around 10:10 a.m. on [**2119-11-11**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Cardiac arrest.
Cardiogenic shock.
Septic shock.
Profound metabolic acidosis.
Diabetes mellitus.
End-stage renal disease.
Severe peripheral vascular disease.
