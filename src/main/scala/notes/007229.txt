Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zosyn / Cephalosporins / Vancomycin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intubation


History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with dementia (non-communicative at
baseline), status post multiple prior aspiration penumonias,
status post PEG placement in [**7-7**], and history of multiple UTIs
presentd this admission as a transfer from [**Hospital3 18648**] in respiratory distress.  She was in her usual state of
health when her husband noticed gurgling and gasping during tube
feeding.  The patient was brought to NWH by her husband where
she was found to be in respiratory distress, tachypneic to the
30s but without evidence of desaturation. She was on a 100% NRB
with SaO2 in the 90s and was intubated (AC TV: 400, RR: 16,
PEEP: 5, FiO2: 50%; 7.56/27/492).  CXR was unremarkable, but UA
was significant with pyuria.  She received zosyn and
ciprofloxacin. She was next transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of respiratory distress. In the ED, she recieved IVF,
repeat CXR that was unremarkable, and a CTA that was negative
for PE, consolidation, or CHF.  She was transferred to the ICU
and maintained on propofol on the vent (AC TV: 500, RR: 14,
PEEP: 5, FiO2: 0.5; 7.47/31/221) until uncomplicated extubation
the next day.


Past Medical History:
1.  Alzheimer's dementia (previously tx'd for presumed
Parkinsons with carvidopa which was subsequently discontinued by
the patient's husband on [**12-12**])
2.  Aspiration PNA
3.  h/o UTI - with R ureteral stent placement
4.  Small Bowel Obstruction s/p colon resection
5.  h/o CVA
6.  Hip fx

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-12-27**] 8:49 AM
FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged compared to the previous study. Again
note is made of subglottic narrowing of the upper airway. Note
is made of bibasilar plate- like atelectasis, with decreased
lung volumes, and elevated bilateral diaphragm. No definite
evidence of CHF is noted. Left lower lobe patchy opacity is
noted, slightly increased compared to the previous
study.IMPRESSION: Small lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
Increased opacity in the left lower lobe, representing
atelectasis vs. aspiration pneumonia.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-12-26**] 9:32 AM
The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
limits and stable compared with the previous study. The lungs
appear clear and there are no pleural effusions. Healed right
proximal humeral fracture is incidentally noted.
Finally, note is made of interval extubation. There is a tapered
appearance of the airway in the glottic and subglottic region.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of aspiration or pneumonia. 2)
Tapered appearance of glottic and subglottic airway.
Post-intubation edema cannot be excluded and clinical
correlation suggested.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-12-25**] 4:39 AM
There are no prior studies available for comparison. There is an
endotracheal tube with tip below the thoracic inlet. The tip is
located 1.5 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube is present
with tip in the stomach. The proximal port of the nasogastric
tube is at or slightly above the level of the GE junction. The
heart is not enlarged. There are aortic calcifications. Bandlike
opacity is present at the right lower lung zone consistent with
atelectasis or scarring. There is blunting of the left
costophrenic angle, possibly consistent with an effusion. There
is no evidence of congestive heart failure. There are
degenerative changes vs. old fracture of the right humeral head.
IMPRESSION: 1. Endotracheal tube positioned slightly low, with
tip 1.5 cm from the carina. This may be withdrawn 2-3 cm for
optimal positioning. 2. Nasogastric tube with proximal port at
the GE junction. This may be advanced for optimal positioning.
3. Possible small left pleural effusion. No evidence of CHF.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2180-12-25**] 7:20 AM
PULMONARY CTA: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
unremarkable. Specifically, there is excellent contrast
opacification of the pulmonary vessels and there are no filling
defects to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolis.
Scattered calcifications are noted throughout the thoracic
aorta.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are several small nodules
associated with the thryoid gland. The patient is intubated. The
airways are patent through the segmental bronchi bilatera
