RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT; -59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVIC
Reason: ptx
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with r IJ
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ptx
INDICATIONS: 59-year-old man with right internal jugular
catheter.
COMPARISONS: Earlier in the same day.
CHEST, AP PORTABLE: There is a new endotracheal tube, beyond the
thoracic inlet, terminating 4 cm above the carina. A right
internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
distal superior vena cava. A new nasogastric tube terminates in
the stomach but there is a sidehole latter immediately at or
above the gastroesophageal junction.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is new
focal opacity in the left upper lobe, consistent with aspiration
or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION:
1. Nasogastric tube with side hole latter above the
gastroesophageal junction. 2. New focal opacity in the left
upper lobe with rapid onset, with the differential diagnosis
including aspiration or pneumonia.
Findings discussed with resident covering the patient.

CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: pre op kidney [**Hospital 23678**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with for kidney tx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pre op kidney tx
INDICATION: 59-year-old man with kidney transplant. Preop
study..
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart size is at the upper
limits of normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable and
unremarkable. The ill- defined pulmonary vasculature as well as
basilar interstitial opacities are most consistent with stable
vascular congestion. Overall there has been little interval
change compared to prior study.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Mild vascular congestion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: infiltrates
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with r IJ
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
infiltrates
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, 12:08 P.M.
INDICATION: Followup infiltrate.
FINDINGS: Compared with 5/8 at 11:38 p.m., no significant change
in tube and line positions. The right lung is grossly clear. No
overt CHF.
There has been partial interval clearing of the streaky
atelectasis/infiltrate in the retrocardiac region. There has
also been partial clearing of what appears to be atelectasis in
the left peri/suprahilar region.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2167-4-22**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-25**], no
change.

59M s/p aborted kidney tx for hypoxia in OR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CTA CHEST ONLY; eval for PE infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
STUDY: CTA OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST.
INDICATION: 59-year-old male status post aborted kidney
transplant, presenting with hypoxia. Assess for pulmonary
embolism.
COMPARISONS: None.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT axial images were acquired of the
chest. Following administration of intravenous contrast, MDCT
axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the upper
abdomen. Coronal, sagittal, and oblique reformatted images were
then obtained.
CTA OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no
filling defects present within the main pulmonary arteries or
the segmental branches to the upper lobes bilaterally. However,
given technical difficulties of bolus administration, the lower
lobe arteries cannot be evaluated bilaterally. There is biatrial
enlargement. There is no aortic dissection. There is no evidence
of pulmonary fibrosis. There is a bilateral, dependent
atelectasis. There are mild, streaky opacities within the left
lobe. The lungs are otherwise unremarkable. A prominent
prevascular node measures 9 mm (3:18). There are few prominent
mediastinal nodes, particularly posterior to the esophagus. None
meet criteria for pathology. There are no pathologic hilar or
axillary lymph nodes.
Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or bla
