History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 year-old woman with a h/o CHF, CAD s/p MI
('[**32**]), Type 2 DM, and bilateral blindness who had a recent
admission to an OSH for dizziness with a fall and tibial fx, and
was then transferred to rehab. On [**3-9**], she was readmitted with
post-prandial abdominal pain, dyspnea with an O2sat of 76% on
RA, fevers to 104.0 and elevated WBC count. She was diagnosed
with worsening CHF (BNP has steadily risen since [**3-9**] and was
1100 at last measurement) and urosepsis. U/A and urine cultures
were negative, though Cipro had already been started at the time
that cultures were drawn. The etiology of her post-prandial
abdominal pain is still unclear, though CT scan shows extensive
calcification of the aorta and mesenteric vessels, and the
patient has newly diagnosed PAF and mesenteric ischemia from
emboli is also a possibility.  Pt transferred to CCU team on
HD#1 for better management of CHF.

urine output remained nearly zero.  Her primary medical team
