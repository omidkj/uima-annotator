Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo male with PMH of type 2 diabetes on insulin c/b neuropathy
and depression admitted with multifocal pneumonia and diabetic
ketoacidosis.

#Multifocal Pneumonia:
Patient was admitted with shortness of breath and chills and
oxygen requirement along with leukocytosis and CXR suggestive of
multifocal pneumonia. He was initially started on
vanc/cefepime/azithromycin and then narrowed to levofloxacin
with improvement in symptoms. Urine legionella Ag and
respiratory viral panel were negative. Patient was discharged to
complete a total of a 5 day course of abx with last dose
[**2148-4-27**].

He should have a follow up CXR in 6 weeks to document
resolution.

#Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis:
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU with DKA. He was
treated with IVF and IV insulin and his anion gap closed and
sugars were controlled. He was transferred to floor and sugars
were well controlled on his home regimen. His metformin was held
during admission and restarted on discharge. A1c was 9.

#Urinary retention:
This was felt to be due to neuropathy from diabetes exacerbated
by acute illness. He was able to void without problems prior to
discharge.

#Hyponatremia - pt presented with Na of 123 in setting of
hyperglycemia. Considered to be pseudohyponatremia in setting of
elevated blood glucose. Legionella antigen was negative as
above. Sodium normalized with IVF repletion and correction of
hyperglycemia.

#Depression: Patient was continued on home Buspar

#Hypertension:
Patient initially had all antihypertensives stopped in setting
of dehydration/DKA/low blood pressures. These were added back as
patient recovered and he was discharged on his usual home
regimen of blood pressure agents.

hospitalization.

#Disposition:
Patient was discharged back to his [**Hospital3 **] facility with
home PT. He has a previously scheduled appt with his PCP in one
week.
