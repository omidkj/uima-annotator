History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105259**] is a 68 year-old man with ESRD on HD, CAD, COPD.
He was in his usual state of health on [**6-21**] when he was seated
in a chair and he had sudden onset shortness of breath without
chest pain or palpitations. He was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital
on [**6-21**]. There he was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He was briefly hypotensive in the peri-intubation period,
thought to be secondary to propofol vs. sepsis. For the latter
he was treated briefly with vancomycin and Zosyn. Also under
consideration was that he may have aspirated secondary to
benzodiazepine overdose. He was also treated for a COPD
exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers. He was subsequently
thought to have had flash pulmonary edema secondary to a primary
cardiac event, as below.
.
On his initial EKG, he had precordial ST elevations and T-wave
inversions inferiorly that were thought to be rate related. He
was hypotensive and having an upper GI bleed, so treatment of
acute MI including [**Month/Year (2) **], beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**], statin, ACEI were
with-held. He was transferred to the ICU wihere EKG showed
resolution of the ST elevation; however, troponin rose to 4.8.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that no treatment options
for ACS were available as he was not stable for catheterization,
anticoagulation was contraindicated (GI bleed), beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**]
could not be given because of hypotension, and his ESRD
precluded ACEI.
.
On the second hospital day, the patient became tachycardic to
the 130s and desatruated to 88% on 2L. EKG showed ST depressions
V5/V6. He was given 5 mg IV lopressor in decrease in HR to the
low 100s as well as 1 mg IV ativan. Cardiology was again
consulted, and he was given PO metoprolol such that HR decreased
to the 90s over hours. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema.
Renal was consulted, and he received 80 mg IV furosemide with
diuresis of 250 cc and improvement to 98% O2 Sat on 2L. EKG 3
hours later showed resolution of ST depressions and resolution
of sinus tachycardia. Cardiac enzymes were again cycled.
Troponin I increased to 1.22 8 hours after and subsequently
fell. CK was flat. At no point did he experience chest pain.
.
Upon review of the case, the cardiology consulting service felt
that he because he had inducible ischemia that seemed to be rate
dependent, he was a candidate for non-urgent catheterization.
His beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 81 mg, and statin were restarted prior to
transfer. Echo showed EF 35-45% with mild LV mild hypokinesis,
moderate concentric LVH, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
His course was complicated by bright red blood in the NG tube at
the time of intubation. Hct dropped from 48 on admission, to 35
after agressive fluid resuscitation. It was subsequently stable
for several days
.
For his ESRD he underwent HD Tuesday and Thursday and was
maintained net negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-25**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system with a ramus branch revealed severe two
vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing but was free of
critical stenoses. The LAD was heavily calcified and diffusely
diseased with mild tapering of the proximal vessel and diffuse
disease extending from D1 and culminating in a 90% stenosis just
before the small D3 branch with post-stenotic dilatation. S1 had
a moderate origin stenosis. The D1 branch was diffusely disease
with a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel. There were septal
collaterals to the distal RCA system. The moderate caliber LCx
was diffusely diseased, and it was difficult to quantitate the
reference vessel diameter. It supplied small diffusely diseased
OM branches with distal AV groove collaterals to the distal RCA.
The ramus branch was a modest caliber but patent vessel. The RCA
was totally occluded serially in the proximal vessel after some
severe disease and reconstituted distally (RCA, RPL1, RPL2, and
RPDA) via vasa and left to right collaterals. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right heart filling pressures with
a mean RA of 6 mmHg and moderate-severely elevated left heart
filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 19 mmHg and LVEDP of 26
mmHg. There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PASP
of 31mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.7 l/min/m2
(using an assumed oxygen consumption). 3. Left ventriculography
was deferred.
[**6-28**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction including hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls, distal
septum and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal (LVEF 40%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
cavity dilation and regional dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
[**6-30**] CT of Head: Scattered hypodense foci in bilateral occipital
lobes and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, most consistent with
acute/subacute embolic infarcts, superimposed on more chronic
infarction. As the patient is unable to tolerate MRI secondary
to presence of epicardial pacer leads, serial CT examinations
could be performed to assess possible evolution.
[**7-1**] MRI of Head: Innumerable foci of slow diffusion with
associated T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity scattered throughout
the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Findings are
consistent with acute-subacute infarcts of multiple etiologies,
including embolic infarcts, watershed infarction, and hy
