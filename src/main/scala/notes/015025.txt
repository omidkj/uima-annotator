Brief Hospital Course:
Thrombocytopenia
The patient initially presented with bruising, fatigue and fever
to an OSH with anemia and thrombocytopenia.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of what was thought to be TTP given the
constellation of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia, fever, normal PT/PTT, negative D-dimer.  She had a
weakly positive Coombs test, a positive [**Doctor First Name **] (1:160) and positive
anticardiolipin IgM, suggesting possible autoimmunity.  To
further evaluate this, an anti-DS DNA antibody and a anti-Sm
antibody were sent.  The anti DS-DNA Ab was negative, the anti
Sm antibody was pending on discharge.

On admission the patient had a platelet count of 7, and was
started on daily plasmapheresis and prednisone 80 mg QD.
Hematology and transfusions consults were obtained.  She had a
marked allergic reaction to pheresis (hives, itching, wheezing)
that required premedicating her with hydrocortisone and
benadryl, and standing famotidine.  Notwithstanding her allergic
reaction, she responded well to plasmapheresis, and her platelet
count rose to 224K after daily therapy.  At this point pheresis
was changed to QOD, but the patient's platelet count fell on
this regimen to a nadir of 99, and she was restarted on daily
pheresis.  Daily pheresis resulted in platelets rebounding to
238, and at this point pheresis was held and her platelet count
was followed.  They remained in the 200s until discharge.  An
ADAMTS13 assay was performed and showed high inhibitor units and
low activity levels.

Initially the patient had a groin line for pheresis, but this
was removed and a right subclavian catheter was placed.  This
was removed prior to discharge.

On discharge, the patient had hematology follow up in place
close to her home in [**Location (un) 5503**] for further management.

Anemia
The patient had a microangiopathic anemia as noted above:
normocytic, hemolytic (haptoglobin <20, LDH=1410, Tbili=7.1),
and with an appropriate bone marrow response (retic count=6.4).
The laboratory values were not consistent with Fe deficiency
anemia Fe=74, calTIBC=254, Ferritn=304 TRF=195.  Her hemolysis
labs normalized after initiation of therapy.  The patient was
stable with a HCT in the mid-20s while admitted.

Elevated WBC Count
The patient's WBC count rose to the low-20,000 range once she
started the steroid therapy.  There was no evidence of
infection.

Confusion
The patient was thought to be confused at the outside hospital,
but did not demonstrate any evidence of confusion during her
admission at [**Hospital1 18**] and had a non-focal neurologic exam.

Smoking Cessation
The patient was smoking one pack per day on admission.  She was
interested in quitting and was initiated on a nicotine patch
while admitted, which was tapered.  On discharge she was given a
prescription for a nicotine patch and will follow up with her
PCP.

Steroid prohpylaxis
The patient was started on Ca, vitamin D, and fosamax, to
continue while she is on steroids.  She was also discharged with
famotidine for GI prophylaxis.  She was on an insulin sliding
scale while in the hospital, and her FS remained in the mid-100s
while on steroids, so she was not discharged on any agents, but
will get her glucose checked weekly along with her platelets
while on steroids.
