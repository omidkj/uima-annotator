DKA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible sigmoidoscopy


History of Present Illness:
52 yo woman with Type 1 DM and HTN who presents in DKA in the
setting of a recent C.diff infection and worsening N/V/D over
the past 1 week. She states that her symptoms initally started
at the end of [**Month (only) 205**] with N/V/D (non-bloody) and crampy abdominal
pain. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 16998**], was treated for
c. diff with Flagyl but experienced excessive nausea so she was
switched to oral Vancomycin. Her BSs were well controlled during
this admission. She is currently employed in a nursing home
facility and feels that she may have contracted c. diff at work.

.
After being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] she felt better for several
weeks but continued to have [**7-6**] loose BMs but was better than
before. She was seen by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1586**] [**Doctor Last Name 2161**] in the [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2147-9-25**], referred to him by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was thought that she may
have had recurrent c. diff or a post-infectious IBS like
syndrome at the time. On [**10-3**] she underwent a flexible
sigmoidoscopy with biopsy, which was unremarkable.
.
For the past week she has had non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal
discomfort, weakness, nausea, and vomiting which have all
progressively gotten worse. She was initally having 10+ loose
BMs each day but has not had any in the past day since she has
not eaten anything. She states that her appetite has been very
poor since last Monday. Whenever she tries to eat something she
feels nauseous and vomits what she eats. She localizes her
abdominal discomfort to the RLQ.
.
She states that her sugars have been extremely high on the day
of admission in the 400's and denies stopping or missing any of
her insulin she takes at home. She denies any recent fevers,
chills, cough, SOB, or chest pain. Denies any recent travel or
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] had some polydipsia but denies polyuria.
.

started on continuous IVFs and was started  on insulin drip

CXR [**2147-10-18**]
COMPARISON: PA and lateral radiograph [**2147-10-16**].
Most of right pleural effusion has been removed. Minimal
parenchymal changes are identified within the right lung base,
presumably related to residual atelectasis. No pneumothorax
identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in
appearance.

ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CT chest -
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion

FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral
lower extremities including the common femoral veins,
superficial femoral veins, and popliteal veins was performed.
Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms was
demonstrated bilaterally. Intraluminal thrombus was not
identified.

IMPRESSION: No DVT.

CXR [**2147-10-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. A new moderately sized right pleural effusion.
2. New lingular atelectasis vs. early pneumonia.

US abdomen -
IMPRESSION: No evidence of megacolon. Cecum measures
approximately 7 cm in diameter.

Brief Hospital Course:
# DKA: Treated in the ICU with insulin drip with eventual
closure of anion gap and transfer to the medical floor. [**Last Name (un) **]
was consulted and sugars were controlled with an insulin sliding
scale and glargine.
.
# C. Difficile colitis diarrhea: Positive stool c.diff. The
patient had a very protracted course while in the hospital. GI
followed her while in house. High doses of oral vancomycin was
started with some improvement initially. A combination of IV
flagyl and oral vanc was tried as well, with no improvement.
Rifaximin was started. The patient was advised a low-lactose
diet. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was done by GI after 2 weeks of
unremitting diarrhea - which revealed pseudomembranes. Biopsies
were done to r/o other processes the results of which are
pending at this time and should be followed up in clinic. The
overall appearance at flex. sig was more suggestive of a C. diff
colitis than an IBD.

After about a week of high dose vancomycin and  rifaximin - the
patient started having decreasing stools at night and more
semi-formed stools. Her appetite improved. All along, she was
placed on contact precautions. She was observed for a few days
after the stools had decreased to ensure resolution and then
discharged home.

The plan is to continue vancomycin 500 PO Q6h for atleast a 3
week course. Then after a repeat stool c diff x 3, and if the
patient's symptoms are consistantly improving - a very slow
taper may be tried. The patient may need vancomycin for the next
many months to a year. This plan was communicated to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs
