Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89 y/o F with h/o dementia, HTN, severe osteopenia s/p recent
hospitalizations [**6-26**] to [**7-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for mechanical fall.
Films at that time revealed no fracture. Pt was also noted to go
into mild CHF s/p IVF and was noted to have mild diastolic CHF
per report. EF showed normal ECHO w/ EKG revealing sinus tach.
Daily lasix and lisinopril were started, ASA and statins
continued and patient was transfered to rehab for PT s/p fall on
[**2118-7-1**]
.
On the day of admission, the patient's daughter noted that the
pt was much more lethargic than usual. Per her daughter, patient
denied cough, sputum, fever, dysuria. At baseline, patient is
alert and oriented x 2 but had declined since last
hospitalization
.
She was brought to the ED where her white count was noted to be
27.5K w/ pyuria and bacturia w/ SBP's in 80s. She received 8L of
IVF with improvement in urine output but was started on levophed
and initiated on MUST protocol. CXR also revealed evidence of
LLL pneumonia. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis management. In the
[**Name (NI) 153**], pt's BP improved and she was weaned off pressors. She was
weaned from a nonrebreather to a face tent to room air and O2
sats remained in the mid-90s. She was then transferred to the
floor for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 y/o F w/dementia, HTN, severe osteoperosis, s/p recent mech
fall who p/w urosepsis + LLL pna, enrolled on MUST protocol.
.
1. Septic Shock: Her sepsis was felt most likely secondary to
UTI. Other potential source was her LLL pneumonia. She was
covered empirically with CTX/Azithro and remained afebrile over
her first hospital day. She was enrolled in MUST protocol based
on hypoxia, tachycardia, leukocytosis and development of septic
shock. She received 8L NS in ED for volume resucitation and
developed respiratory distress requiring NRB FM. Therefore
further IVF's were held and she was started on levophed pressors
to maintain MAP>65. She was able to be weaned off pressors after
overnight monitoring with maintenance of blood pressure and
urine output. Final culture data revealed pan-sensitive E. Coli
in both the urine cx and 1/2 blood cx from admission.  Ceftaz
and azithro were stopped and switched to levaquin.  On day prior
to discharge, pt noted to also have gram positive rods in [**2-13**]
blood cx from admission.  ID was called and, given that the
patient was afebrile, improving and immunocompetant, antibiotics
were not added as the gram positive rods were likely a
contaminant.
.
2. Altered Mental Status: Her change from baseline was felt
likely secondary to underlying infection + hypoxia, with
non-focal neurologic exam.
.
3. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to fluid overload in setting of
diastolic dysfunction. Also exacerbated by underlying pneumonia.
Avoided further IVF's and treated pneumonia with antibiotics as
outlined above.  Pt received two doses of Lasix after a blood
transfusion.  She was restarted on her home dose of lasix once
her BP had stabilized.
.
4. Diastolic CHF- History of diastolic CHF with preserved
systolic fn. Held anti-hypertensives during hypotensive episode.
Meds were restarted upon stabilization of blood pressure.  As
above, she was restarted on lzasix due to some volume overload.
Patient was duiresed with IV lasix in the hospital and
transitioned to PO lasix at discharge. Patient was discharged on
20mg lasix daily.
.
4. Tachycardia: Pt was noted to have tachycardia while on
telemetry in the ICU but on an EKG from her prior admission, she
had sinus tach at 110.  She was started on a beta-blocker and
titrated up.  There was some T wave inversions/flattening seen
in the lateral leads so cardiac enzymes were checked and were
normal.
.
5. Renal Insufficiency: Cr initially elevated to 1.7. Likely
pre-renal in etiology. She had marked improvement after IVF
resuccitaion with steady urine output >30cc/hr.
.
6. Prophylaxis: Bowel Regimen, SC heparin
.
7. Code: DNR/DNI
