Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, mass in left upper lobe

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. significant for
malignant bladder cancer s/p elective radical cystectomy/ileal
conduit on [**4-25**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, and new mass-like lesion
obstructing proximal orifice of left upper lobe, who is
transferred from [**Location (un) 28318**], [**State 1727**] for IP evaluation of lung
lesion.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 56711**] was initially diagnosed with low-grade high-volume
bladder tumor approximately 1 year ago.  He had multiple
resections of his tumor, but continued to suffer from gross
hematuria.  In preparation for radical cystectomy, patient had
an extensive metastatic evaluation, including chest CT, that
revealed no metastatic disease outside of the bladder.  On [**4-25**],
patient went for radical cystectomy; he initially did well but
then developed increased 02 requirements over the next few days
and eventually required reintubation.  A repeat CXR showed
evidence of collapse of the left upper lobe, and a repeat CT
scan confirmed collapse and question of a mass (The prior CT
images were reviewed and in retrospect it appeared as though
there was an upper lobe hilar mass i [**2140-3-1**] as well).
Patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**4-27**] and a mass-like lesion
was found obstructing the proximal orifice of the left upper
lobe.  Washings were taken but biopsy was not done due to
bleeding.    During hospitalization, patient also had fascial
dehiscence and evisceration that required emergent return to the
OR.
.
Patient is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Interventional
Pulmonology evaluation of bronchial mass.  He is intubated and
on fentanyl boluses.  Vitals on arrival were: 100.1, HR: 143,
BP: 119/66, and SPo2 92% on Fi02 70%, 8 driving pressure, 5 of
PEEP.

Past Medical History:

Social History:

Imaging:
CXR [**2140-4-28**]:  Followup of the patient with bladder cancer after
radical prostatectomy and new bronchial mass.  Portable AP chest
radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for
comparison.  Current study demonstrates the intubated patient
with the ET tube tip being 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is a large left hilar mass with
left upper lobe atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
There is a curvilinear lucency surrounding the aortic arch most
likely representing the Luftsichel sign associated with left
upper lobe atelectasis. Right lung demonstrates a right lower
lobe opacity, partially characterized on that study and may
represent infectious process or partial atelectasis. Correlation
with cross-sectional imaging is required. The partial imaging of
the upper abdomen shows bilateral ureteral stents.
.
ECHO [**2140-4-29**]: Suboptimal images. The left atrium is normal in
size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >70%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
.
CT ABDOMEN / PELVIS [**2140-5-3**]
1. Status post radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with no
evidence of leak. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis does
not communicate with
contrast-filled ileal conduit.
2. Fatty liver. Cystic liver lesion in segment II with adjacent
fatty
sparing.
3. Soft tissue lesion narrowing the left main and left upper
lobe bronchus
with left upper lobe atelectasis; incompletely imaged.
4. Cholelithiasis; no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
5. Incidental intramuscular lipoma between the internal and
external left
oblique muscle.

CT CHEST [**2140-5-6**]
FINDINGS:

The patient is intubated, with the ET tube tip being
approximately 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach. The right PICC line tip is at the low SVC.

There are several mediastinal lymph nodes, some of them more
than 1 cm in
diameter. Although they may represent reactive findings, but
they also can be enlarged due to neoplastic involvement giving
the large mass in the left hilus, that appears to be located at
the level of left main pulmonary artery, where it enters the
lungs. The exact dimension of the mass is difficult to estimate
given
