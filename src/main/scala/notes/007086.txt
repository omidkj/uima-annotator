Service:  MEDICINE/[**Hospital1 **] FIRM

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath/diabetic ketoacidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus Type 2,
insulin dependent and history of hypertension, asthma and a
history of thrombocytosis of unclear etiology, who initially
presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of
increasing dyspnea times one week.

Initial presentation to the Emergency Department was eight days
prior to admission. The patient was diagnosed with bronchitis
with an asthma exacerbation and treated with Azithromycin times
five days and a five day course of Prednisone tapered and then
discharged home from the Emergency Department.  Over the past
week the patient has had increasing shortness of breath,
productive cough with whitish sputum and polyuria and
occasional nausea.

The patient denied fevers, chills, sore throat, abdominal pain,
melena, dysuria, rashes, joint pain or chest pain.  The patient
reports good medical compliance with Glargine an insulin sliding
scale.  The patient notes continued use of her nebulizer without
relief of shortness of breath and notes increasing weight loss
over the past six months, unintentional.  In the Emergency
Department the patient was found to have a blood sugar of 570,
was found to be tachycardic, afebrile, with an anion gap of 40,
small ketones in her urine and total c02 of 7.

The patient was admitted overnight to the MICU service on an
insulin drip with the anion gap closed on the morning of transfer
to the medicine service.  A chest x-ray was obtained which was
clear without evidence of infiltrate but a dedimer returned with
greater than 1,900 and an emergent CTA was done showing a filling
defect in the right posterior apical segmental branch with
multiple areas of air space opacities within the left upper and
left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.  The patient was
started on heparin drip overnight.  Antibiotics were held off
given that she was afebrile and unclear if there was a focal
source of the pneumonia.

The patient was transferred to the medicine service as she was
tolerating a p.o. diet and was given 60 units of Glargine off the
insulin drip.  The patient reports decreased ambulation over the
past week due to fatigue, also denies leg swelling or upper
extremity swelling.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Shortness of breath.  The patient had progressive dyspnea
over the past week, initially treated with bronchitis +
asthma flare, now found to have a pulmonary edema on the CTA,
unclear if initial presentation Emergency Department eight
days prior to admission was related to pulmonary edema at the
time, however, patient risk factors are, over the past week,
with decreased ambulation and mobility secondary to fatigue
makes it less likely until recently.

2.  Pulmonary edema.  The patient had no obvious source on
exam.  No palpable cords or deep vein thrombosis obvious on
exam.  Patient has a history of thrombocytosis of unclear
etiology, unclear whether or not the patient has a
hypercoagulable state.  This will likely need to be clarified
given the thrombocytosis.  However, the patient was initially
started on weight-based heparin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and
was subsequently transitioned on the day prior to discharge
on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous twice a day as well as Coumadin
loaded while she was in house.  The patient had a discharge
INR of 1.4 based on two loads of 5 mg and a 7.5 mg load.  The
patient will be discharged with 5 mg of Coumadin to have her
INR followed up with her primary care physician on [**2105-11-23**].  Patient will also have the [**Hospital6 1587**] to follow her INR.  Until her INR is greater than
2.0 the patient will likely need to have Lovenox shots.
Monitor her 02 sats which were greater than 92% on room air.

3.  Asthma flare.  The patient had peak fluids that were
under 400.  She had no obvious wheezing on exam.  The patient
was maintained on nebs around the clock and then transitioned
to meter dose inhalers with her Albuterol and subsequently
started on her steroid of Salmeterol and Flovent on the day
prior to discharge with improvement of her shortness of
breath.

4.  Hyperglycemia, anion gap closed while in the MICU off the
insulin drip.  We optimized her blood sugar control with
changing her Glargine over to NPH given the fact that her
Glargine was also not available on formulary for Medicaid.
The patient was maintained on 60 units q a.m. and 20 units q
p.m. based on her insulin requirements with stable blood
sugar control on the day of discharge.  This will likely need
to be followed up as a future outpatient in order to adjust
her insulin requirements.  Diabetic teaching was maintained
and the patient was maintained on a diabetic diet.

5.  ID.  The patient remained afebrile with a white blood
