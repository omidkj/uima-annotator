Strep (group G) sepsis likely related to cellulitis of LLE

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking woman with PMHx significant for diastolic
CHF (EF>55%), afib, CML, admitted 10 days ago from
hematology/oncology clinic for CHF exacerbation.   She was
diuresed well and Gleevec was D/C'd as it was thought to be a
culprit in her CHF exacerbation.  She returned to the hospital 3
days post-discharge with a cough and nausea w/ a small amt of
emesis.  No F/C, abd pain, C/D, no CP, stable bilat pedal edema,
stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND.

Initially on presentation to ED on [**8-24**] she was febrile to
103.7F, she had a negative U/A and was started on Vanc Levo for
cellulitis / possible PNA, her LLE duplex u/s was negative, SBP
dropped to 70s and lactate was 2.1 initially and dropped to 1.8
w/ fluids.  Central line placed and patient transferred to MICU.


MICU course: fluid responsive hypotension although temporarily
on levophed.  Tx initially w/ Vanc / Levo, transitioned to
Penicillin G.

Today patient states that she feels well and initially presented
to the hospital with extreme fatigue as her main complaint as
well as Left lower extremity pain and swelling, with no known
traumatic event preceeding.  +N and small amt emesis and a HA
w/o any visual changes.  She has no PND, no chest pain, no SOB,
and has not exerted herself lately but @ home can walk 1 block
w/o any DOE or fatigue.  Reproducible orthopnea @ 30 degrees
now, @ baseline sleeps w/ 2 pillows although has no orthopnea.

Micro data:
[**8-24**]: 4/4 bottles Beta Strep Group G.
MRSA screen negative
Blood cultures from [**8-25**], [**8-26**], [**8-27**] NGTD
Ucx: 10k-100k enterococcus, cipro sensitive
guiac stool

Echo [**6-3**] - Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small (0.9 cm) circumferential pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-6-10**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly. The
other findings are similar.

Repeat ECHO [**2102-8-26**]: No evidence of endocarditis. Symmetric LVH
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small-to-moderate sized
pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.

CXR port AP [**2102-8-24**]: Findings consistent with interstitial and
alveolar edema, with bilateral pleural effusions.  Early
pneumonia cannot be excluded and repeat imaging following
diuresis could be helpful for further evaluation.

CXR port AP [**2102-8-26**]: Single portable radiograph of the chest
demonstrates no change in the cardiomediastinal contour.  Left
internal jugular central venous catheter is again seen with its
tip in the SVC.  Assessment is limited by patient positioning
but there is likely a small right-sided pleural effusion.  No
pneumothorax.  The appearance of the lungs is unchanged.

LLE duplex u/s [**2102-8-24**]: No evidence of left lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis

U/A [**8-27**]: [**5-7**] WBC, 0-2 epi, neg leuk es, neg nitrites, 0-2 RBC,
few bacteria

EKG: Afib nml axis, nl intervals, TW flattening in all leads
except leads v4-6; unchanged from [**2102-8-19**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Sepsis- Transiently on pressors, fluid resuscitated and
transferred from ICU to floor.  Sepsis likely related to her RLE
cellulitis as blood cx grew 4/4 bottles group G beta strep.
Treated initially with vancomycin, switched to penicillin G IV
and continued to improve.  Hemodynamically stable.  8 days of
antibiotics received in hospital, continue for 6 more days.
continue to keep leg elevated and teds stockings in place.  Also
fungal foot infection slightly on dorsum of feet bilaterally and
between toes, continue clotrimazole cream until clear and then
for an additional 1-2 weeks.

Diastolic CHF- recent admission for CHF in setting of gleevec,
gleevec held and patient diuresed and improved.  This admission
for sepsis patient was agressively hydrated and then was in
moderate CHF and diursed to nearly the point of euvolemia.  She
was diuresing well upon discharge and was restarted on her home
regimen of 20mg po bid of lasix.  Her weight was 71.8kg and she
was sating in the mid/high.  Please continue to administer lasix
and titrate up if needed to goal of even to negative 500cc as
she is still mildly fluid overloaded. Continue Toprol XL 50mg
for rate control, uptitrate prn.  On dig in past but dig toxic
so dig has been avoided.

CML- on gleevec, thought to be cause of heart failure
exacerbations as reportedly she goes into pulmonary edema
whenever her gleevec is initiated.  Her Hematologist /
oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] has been notified via email regarding this
change.  She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] within 2-4 weeks of
her discharge.

ARF- baseline creatinine 0.7 to 0.9, ARF in ICU in setting of
sepsis thought to be related to ATN, no improvement with
diuresis of volume overload, Cr peaked at 1.3 in MICU and
discharged with Cr of 1.3, would trend over time.   Hopeful that
her Cr would recover overtime.

A-fib- relatively well rate controlled.  No anticoagulation per
patient preference.

Anemia- chronic, baseline near hct 2
