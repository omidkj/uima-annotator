Chief Complaint:
Transfer for liver transplant eval

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Thoracentesis
Chest tube removal
Dobhoff placement x2


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year-old female with a history of breast cancer,
hemochromatosis, hepatic encephalopathy, s/p TIPS [**2154-1-13**],
hepatic hydrothorax who is transferred for transplant
evaluation.

The patient was recently discharged on [**1-16**] after a prolonged
hospitalization for ascites and pleural effusions.  The patient
underwent TIPS proceudre on [**1-13**] and was discharged home.
However, she became very confused secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy and admitted on [**2154-1-19**].  The patient was found
unresponsive for 8 minutes and transferred to the MICU (no
medications and was not intubated). The patient hepatic
encephalopathy was improving, but she had worsening hypoxia
secondary to pleural effusions.  She eventually required
intubation and right chest tube was placed.  She had good
drainage from her tube and also diuresed via lasix gtt.  She was
able to be extubated on [**1-30**].  Her chest tube continues to drain
500cc per day.  Additionally, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by c. diff colitis for which she was treated with a
16 day course of po vancomycin.  Additionally, her blood
cultures grew VRE and was treated with linezolid that was
changed to daptomycin that was d/c on [**1-28**].  The patient also
had several episodes of atrial tachycardia that was initially
treated with propanolol, but was stopped secondary to
hypotension.  The patient was also found to have an left
axillary DVT and has been on heparin gtt since [**1-31**].  The
patient was transferred for further workup of the hydrothorax
and liver transplant eval.

On arrival the paient had no complaints and doing well. She
denied abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, bloody
stools, SOB or other complaints.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2-6**]
FINDINGS: Bilateral chest tubes, no evidence of right-sided
pleural effusion. Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with
air-fluid level. Moderate cardiomegaly with increased
interstitial markings. Right PICC line in standard position.
Right basal areas of atelectasis. Obviously atelectatic increase
in lung density around the left hilus. Moderate bilateral apical
thickening.

Bronchial washings [**2-7**]
Atypical epithelial cells in a background of pulmonary
macrophages and bronchial cells.

TTE [**2-7**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ [**2-8**]
1. Patent and appropriate TIPS and portal veins.
2. Small amount of sludge within the gallbladder with some tiny
stones.

Pleural fluid cytology [**2-8**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Rare mesothelial cells.
  Lymphocytes and monocytes (see note).

MRI abd/pelvis [**2-10**]
1. Evidence of iron deposition in the liver and pancreas,
consistent with
primary chemochromatosis. No evidence of iron deposition in the
heart on
limited images presented. No imaging stigmata of cirrhosis.
2. No focal liver lesion.
3. Trace ascites.
4. Patchy increased signal at the lung bases, trace right
pleural effusion.

LUE Doppler U/S [**2-14**]
No deep vein thrombosis seen in the left arm.

Pleural fluid cytology [**2-15**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Reactive mesothelial cells and macrophages.

CXR [**2-16**]
There is blunting of both CP angles, but there is no large
effusion
as was present previously. Right-sided PICC line tip is in the
right atrium.  Feeding tube tip is off the film. There are areas
of opacity in the left lower lung and right mid lung. The left
lower lung opacity has a rounded configuration and measures 2.6
cm. This has not been visualized on the prior film, some of
which could have been due to technique, volume loss, infiltrate,
and overlying effusion. The mass lesion in this region cannot be
totally excluded and if cross-sectional imaging has been
obtained at an outside institution would be helpful to ensure
that no lesion is present, this could just be a loculated area
of fluid. The heart is upper limits normal in size.

IMPRESSION: Patchy areas of opacity in the left mid lung and the
right mid
lung. It is unclear if these represent focal infiltrates.
Recommend
followup.

Repeat CXR [**2-16**]
Compared to the film from earlier the same day there is a small
right
pneumothorax. This was present on the earlier film but was not
commented
upon. There is volume loss in both lower lungs and a more
confluent
appearance to the opacity previously mention
