Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Gastrointestinal Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69 year old female with h/o GIB secondary to PUD, extensive CAD
with recent percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of SVG to RCA
conduit and OM1 on chronic plavix and ASA presenting with
hematchezia.
.
Pt recently hospitalized in CCU from [**Date range (1) 32223**] for treatment of
cardiogenic shock. On arrival patient noted to be persistently
hypotensive. ECHO on admission showed depressed EF of 20-25%,
diffuse WMA and elevated RA pressures.  Echo was grossly
unchanged from baseline (7/[**2165**]).  EKG was also unchanged from
baseline. Patient was cathed which showed new distal occlusions
in the OM1 and 90% stenosis of the RCA-ACG bypass, DES were
placed in both. Placed on Pepcid for GIB ppx.
.
Her [**9-3**] - [**9-20**] Hospital course was complicated:
1.  Fluid overload/Kidney Failure necessitating CVVH. She
started on  on CVVH with intermittent need for phenylephrine to
maintain sufficient MAPs.  Phenylephrine was difficult to wean
but ultimately pt was started on midodrine, sudafed and
fludrocortisone to assist in raising SVR.  In total ~20 L were
removed with CVVH. A new tunneled dialysis catheter was placed
prior to discharge with plan to  continue dialysis in rehab and
ultimately resume outpatient HD.
2. Leukocytosis/Line Infection. During stay her right tunneled
dialysis line on the right was noted to be erythematous.
Cultures were sent from the line and 1 of 2 bottles grew gram
positive rods, gram negative rods and gram postive cocci in
pairs and chains. She was started on empiric Vancomycin and
Zosyn antibiotic tx and completed a 10 day.
.
Patient discharged to rehab on [**9-20**]. NOted this morning to pass
several maroon color stools with clots. EMS called; en route
SBPs noted to be SBP of 85 (per last d/c summary SBPs 80s-90s).
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.7 91 84/41 18 98% 6L Nasal Cannula.
SBPs increased to 110s prior to IV hydration. Patient underwent
NG lavage which demonstrated scant clots with predominantly
bilious fluid; all clots resolved after flush with 500cc of IVF.
GI consulted and recommended transfusion and initiation of PPI
ggt, CT angio. Patient transfused 2units of uncrossed RBCs and
1u of platelets. Decision made to admit to MICU for further
mgmt.
.
On the floor, patient overall feeling "lousy". Denies abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis. Reports acute worsening of
chronic non-productive cough. Reports stable 2 pillow
orthnopnea, stable edema. Denies fevers, chills, sweats.

CTA
1. Slightly decreased wall thickening at the hepatic flexure of
the colon
consistent with improving colitis. Focal areas of colonic
mucosal enhancement but no definite areas of active
extravasation into the GI tract to suggest a site for GI
bleeding.
2. Hypodense lesion in the pancreatic head which may represent a
cystic
lesion or dilated side branch. Recommend follow up MRI in 1
year.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, stable from prior study.
4. Moderate narrowing at the origin of the left renal artery.
.
CXR
IMPRESSION: Since [**2165-9-19**], right effusion has
increased and now is moderate in quantity. Bilateral lower lung
atelectasis left more than right is stable as is left pleural
effusion. Stable, moderate to severe
cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with h/o GIB secondary to peptic ulcer
disease, extensive CAD s/p CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy with
chronic systolic heart failure with recent DES of SVG-RCA
conduit and OM1 one month ago on Plavix and ASA, and ESRD on HD
admitted with hematchezia. Course was notbable for ICU admission
for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
.
#Gastrointestinal hemorrhage:
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for atrial
fibrillation but hemoatocrit was stable. A NG lavage was
performed with no obvious bleeding but ?scant coffee ground. Pt
was managed with a PPI and a CT was performed which showed
improved hepatic flexure colitis. The patient was transfused
3units PRBCs and 1 units platelets and hematocrit remained
stable. GI was consulted as was the patient's Cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. ASA and Plavix were continued given recent stent placment
and endoscopy was deferred given low likelihood of an
intervenable lesion and the patients somewhat tenuous
cardiopulmonary status. The patient was transferred to the floor
and hematocrit remained stable without further evidence of
hematochezia. PPI was discontinued and patient was placed back
on H2blocker therapy as the most likely source of bleeding was
felt to be mild hepatic flexure ischemic colitis on the
background of dual anti-platelet therapy.
.
# A.Fib CHADS score 4: not previously anticoagulated due to h/o
recurrent GI bleeds. Patient had been started on amiodarone on
last CCU admission, but given rapid Afib the patien
