Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old female with a history of sarcoidosis, chronic
systolic heart failure with EF 35%, and pulmonary hypertension
who presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, acute on
chronic renal failure, and hypercalcemia.

#. Shortness of Breath: On admission, she had hypoxia requiring
O2 supplementation (greater than at baseline) and was treated
with intravenous fluids.  It was felt that her shortness of
breath was related to her sarcoidosis and complicated by acute
renal failure and hypercalcemia.  She did not appear volume
overloaded on exam and responded well with symptomatic
improvement after IV fluids and prednisone.  Her prednisone dose
was increased from her home dose of 5mg to 40mg and later
tapered to 20mg daily.  She had a CT chest which did not show
progression of her sarcoidosis since [**Month (only) **].  A multidisciplinary
approach was taken to determine the best course of treatment
with input from her primary medicine team, pulmonology,
cardiology, and nephrology.  It was decided that she would
likely benefit from supplemental oxygen, prednisone at higher
doses than previous, and afterload reduction and CHF management
with metoprolol and losartan.  At discharge, she required her
baseline 2L of oxygen but still had shortness of breath with
ambulation.

#. Hypercalcemia: On admission, she had a calcium level of 15.1.
 This was likely caused by a combination of sarcoidosis and
taking 1500mg Ca daily at home.  Her calcium levels decreased to
normal while in the hospital with aggressive rehydration and
prednisone therapy.  UPEP was normal, her 1,25(OH) vitamin D
level, SPEP, and PTHrP levels are still pending at discharge.

#. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On admission, her creatinine
was increased to 3.2 (baseline is 1.7-1.9).  She was given IV
fluids and her lasix was held and her creatinine returned back
to baseline by the time of discharge.  Her renal failure was
thought to be predominantly of prerenal etiology due to overuse
of Lasix prior to admission with a secondary contribution of
hypercalcemia.

#. Chronic systolic Heart Failure: She has known systolic heart
failure with an EF of 35%.  However, her shortness of breath was
not thought to be related to worsening heart failure.  Her Lasix
was stopped and she was volume repleted resulting in symptomatic
improvement.  She was advised to continue without Lasix after
discharge.  Her atenolol was swithced to metoprolol and
losartan, which she tolerated well prior to discharge.

#. History of PE/Factor V Leiden: Warfarin was initially held
due to a high INR of 3.9.  It was restarted at her home dose of
2.5mg po daily after her INR decreased to therapeutic range.

#. Anxiety: She was anxious throughout her hospitalization which
may have contributed to her shortness of breath.  Her outpatient
regimen of lorazepam was continued and she was encouraged to
take lorazepam as needed.

#. Nosebleed: She had one episode of anterior epistaxis one day
prior to discharge.  She had a slow trickle of blood from her
right nostril, likely related to her use of oxygen that was not
humidified.  She was given Afrin nasal spray and held pressure
with resolution of her symptoms.

#. Code Status: Patient was FULL CODE throughout this
hospitalization.
