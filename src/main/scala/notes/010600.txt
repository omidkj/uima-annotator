Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 21-year-old
female who was struck by a car and run over by both the front
and rear tires over her head and abdomen and pelvis.  She
arrived awake with a GCS of 15, but with marked edema and
ecchymosis of her left lower extremity and with a noted left
thigh deformity.  She was hemodynamically stable throughout.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congenital bicuspid aorta with aortic
stenosis and pulmonic stenosis, status post pulmonic
valvuloplasty at age 20 months.

MEDICATIONS:  None

ALLERGIES:  None

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Attends [**University/College 41342**]and is from [**Location (un) 7498**].  Denies alcohol, tobacco or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.6??????, heart rate 116, blood
pressure 122/48, respirations 26 at 100%.
GENERAL:  GCS 15, on collar and backboard.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Marked facial edema with
nasal laceration.  No deformities or bony stepoff.  Pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Tympanic membranes were clear
bilaterally.  No hemotympanum.  Nasal septum without septal
hematoma.  Oropharynx clear with normal occlusion.  Teeth
nontender, non mobile.
NECK:  Collared.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No crepitus.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular, tachycardic.
ABDOMEN:  Flat, no guarding, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Obvious deformity of the left lower extremity.
Deformity of the left thigh with traction placed, 2+ femoral
and 1+ popliteal pulses.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were equal
bilaterally.  Left thigh was tense and tender.
PELVIS:  Stable, nontender.
RECTAL:  Normal tone, no gross blood, heme negative.
NEUROLOGIC:  Motor [**5-31**] bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Sensation intact bilateral upper and lower extremities.

INITIAL RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Cervical spine lateral C1 to
C6 without fracture.  Chest x-ray, left clavicle fracture,
small left pneumothorax, left lower lobe fractures.  Pelvis
left superior ramus fracture, slight widening of the SI
joint.  CT scan of the head revealed no intracranial injury.
There is a left frontal sinus fracture.  CT chest left rib
fracture, small pneumothorax.  Mediastinum without evidence
of aortic injury.  Bilateral pulmonary contusions.  CT of the
abdomen and pelvis no intraabdominal injury or fluid.  Femur
grossly displaced midshaft femur fracture.

IMPRESSION:  A 21-year-old female with multi trauma after
being struck as a pedestrian by an automobile.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was hemodynamically stable
throughout her stay in the Emergency Department and was
planned to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and
orthopedics was consulted for her multiple orthopedic
injuries.  She received ampicillin and gentamicin in the
Emergency Department as prophylaxis for aortic stenosis.  She
was planned to go to the Operating Room for a left femur rod
and possible pelvic fracture repair or fixation.  She was
given also a plastics consult for her facial fracture.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**5-12**], but
this was aborted secondary to hemodynamic instability which
was attributed to hypovolemia in the setting of her aortic
stenosis.  She had a cardiology consult and echocardiogram
which showed that she had an ejection fraction of greater
than 55%, but an aortic gradient of 67 and a small area of
0.6 consistent with worsening of her prior aortic stenosis.
She was successfully taken to the Operating Room on [**5-14**] for open reduction internal fixation of both her left
femur with a rod and her pelvis without difficulty.  She
remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic
monitoring given her aortic stenosis.

She was followed with a Swan-Ganz catheter to optimize fluid
status and hemodynamics and she slowly improved and was able
to be extubated successfully.  The patient was also noted to
have a right sided sacral fracture and rami fractures for
which she did not undergo operative repair, but was told by
orthopedics to remain non weight bearing on that side to
allow healing.  She also had a left clavicle fracture and she
was placed in a sling for this.  The patient's hemodynamics
were optimized with the help of cardiology and she was
eventually felt stable for discharge to the floor for
continued physical therapy and advancement of diet.  She
initially was not taking an adequate amount of oral intake,
however this improved throughout to the point that she was
taking a full regular diet at the time of discharge with good
urine output.  She did develop a pneumococcal pneumonia which
was sensitive to levofloxacin.  She was treated with nine
days of levofloxacin in the hospital and will complete a 14
day course depending on her condition at the time of
discharge.  She was also kept on Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous
[**Hospital1 **] for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, as she is non
weight bearing on her right leg, partial weight bearing on
her left leg and will be bed bound for some time undergoing
physical therapy.

At the time of discharge, she was taking a full diet.  Her
breathing status had improved considerably and she was nearly
weaned to room air and she was felt stable for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility for continued orthopedic
rehabilitation.  She will be going to [**Hospital3 41343**]
for continued care.
