Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS

1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20-25 %), in the setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] may be an overestimation.

3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis.

4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

8. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

9. There is no pericardial effusion.

10 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on 1040 at
[**2134-10-5**].

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions

2. The LV remains globally hypokinetic with an EF 20%.

3. A well seated mitral annuloplasty ring is seen in the mitral
annulus. No MR is seen.

4. Aortic regurgitation remain 1+ post bypass

5. Aortic contour is smooth post decannulation.

6. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notified of findings 1457 on [**2134-10-5**]
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
AP CHEST, 6:39 P.M., [**10-7**]

HISTORY: Mitral valve repair. Possible pneumothorax following
chest tube
removal.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-4**] and 9:

Lung volumes are lower following removal of the endotracheal
tube, with
worsened atelectasis at both lung bases, left greater than
right, and increase
in small bilateral pleural effusion. Increasing cardiac diameter
could be due
in part to lower lung volumes, and probably some mediastinal
fluid collection,
although there is no distention of mediastinal veins to suggest
hemodynamic
significance. No pneumothorax. Upper lungs clear. Right jugular
sheath ends
at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**10-5**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8650**]t MVrepair (#34mm ring) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
. XCT=42min., CPB =68 minutes. He was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition on epinephrine, propofol and levophed drips.
Extubated later that evening. POD#1 he required milrinone due to
decreased cardiac output. His rhythm was intermittently
SR/AFib-rate controlled. The milrinone was weaned to off with a
stable cardiac output/cardiac index. All tubes and lines were
discontinued when criteria was met.POD#3 he was transferred to
the SDU for further telemetry and recovery. Beta-blocker
optimized as BP tolerated. Mr.[**Known lastname **] was restarted on his Coumadin
for his intermittent AFib. Despite discussions regarding the
potential risks of stroke if not taking Coumadin, Mr.[**Known lastname **]
refuses.At time of discharge Coumadin will be prescribed and he
follow-up for INR/ Coumadin dosing has been arranged. the
remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
uneventful. He continued to progress and on POD#6 he was
discharged to home with VNA. All follow-up appointments were
advised.
