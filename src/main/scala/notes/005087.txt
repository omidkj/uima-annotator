History of Present Illness:
***
History obtained from OMR review, speaking with her husband and
son- in law [**Name (NI) **]. Pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] speaking, hard of hearing and
her hearing aides are not with her at the time of the encounter.
The author attempted to communicate with her via the telephone
and her son in law but it was not possible given her hearing
impediment.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 12307**] is a 80 year old [**Known lastname 595**]-speaking female with a
history of CAD s/p CABG, C. difficile colitis, DM2, and dCHF
brought to the ED for increased lethargy and somnolence noted at
her [**Hospital1 1501**].  Evaluation at [**Hospital3 2558**] revealed WBC count 15.2
and creatinine 1.7 (up from baseline of 0.7 - 1.0).  VS: BP
100/60, HR 78 irreg, RR 20 and 0 2 sat 94% on 2L.  She was
admitted to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2123-4-15**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab following
a hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia due to dCHF exacerbation,
ARF, and C. difficile colitis.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: pain 0, T 98.4, HR 100, BP 97/45, RR
24 98% RA.  Patient was noted to be somnolent but would wake up
to talk with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] him, the patient had been more
somnolent for a couple of days, but was not reporting pain
anywhere or any shortness of breath or cough.  The patient
initially triggered in the ED for O2 sat of 84% on RA that
returned to 100% on 2L NC.  She subsequently became hypotensive
to 85/55 and a right femoral line was placed under sterile
conditions due to difficulty obtaining access and she received a
1L NS bolus.  Her O2 sat subsequently trended down to the low
90s, felt to be related to mouth breathing, and she was placed
on a non-rebreather.  Labs were notable for WBC count 13.7 with
11 bands, lactate 2.4, creatinine 2.6, troponin T 0.14, CK 18.
EKG had inferior ST depressions that were felt to be demand
related to tachycardia.  CXR was clear.  Head CT without acute
process.  UA with moderate bacteria but only [**4-16**] WBC.  She
received vancomycin, cefepime, aspirin 325 mg and was admitted
to the ICU.  Vital signs on sign-out were: HR 90, BP 116/57, RR
20, 100% nonrenbreather.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient was sleeping, easily
arousable, but quickly fell back asleep.

Unable to obtain.

Social History:
Home: [**Month/Day/Year 595**]-speaking only. Lived with husband prior to heart

outline below. Never smoked.
Occupation: Retired physician
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Denies
Drugs: Denies
After spending 1.5 months ([**4-/2122**]) at [**Hospital1 112**] ICU -> [**Hospital1 **] for
vented unit -> rehab ([**Location (un) 745**] where the PEG was removed) -> home
[**2122-6-12**] where she developed Cdiff colitis -> [**Hospital1 18**] -> MACU in
[**Hospital1 5595**] ([**2122-8-12**])->[**Hospital3 2558**] ( [**Month (only) 205**] - [**Month (only) 359**]) -> home for

Imaging/results:
EKG: ST 99 bpm, ST depressions in II, III, and aVF and V3-V5.
Compared to [**2123-2-28**] ST depressions are new.
.
CXR:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There are low inspiratory lung
volumes. Cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged, and
the patient is status post mitral valve replacement. Enlargement
of the left atrium is unchanged. Multiple clips are seen within
the mediastinal region. There is a tortuous aorta which is
calcified. The hilar contours are prominent, unchanged. There
has been interval improvement in degree of aeration of the right
upper lobe
with near resolution of previously noted atelectasis. The right
PICC has been removed. No new areas of focal consolidation are
seen. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No acute skeletal
abnormalities are present.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in aeration of the right upper
lobe.
.
CT head [**4-16**];
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Unchanged calcified masses at the left frontal and right CP
angle, likely calcified meningiomas.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted initially to ICU, was arousable but sleepy.  Bolused 1L
overnight for hypotension to 80s and had PICC placed for access
and fem line was d/c'ed.  C diff returned positve and started PO
vancomycin. Broad abx stopped as no UTI and CXR neg and no other
source of infections.  Final head CT read: No acute intracranial
abnormality.  MS improved with Vanco and hydration. Creat
improved from 2.6->1.2.  EKG changes resolved and trops flat c/w
demand leak. Developed some hypoxia/sob, with repeat CXR showing
fluid overload [**4
