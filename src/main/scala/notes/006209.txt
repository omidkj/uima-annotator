71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease,
diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, spontaneous
aortobifemoral on [**2169-8-2**] who had a relatively uneventful

vomiting ............. eating at rehabilitation that had been
worsening over the past two days and unable to keep anything

no signs of obstruction.  He came in with an increased white
count of 24 with admission hematocrit of 1.8.  His admission
date is [**2169-8-13**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

2.  Myocardial infarction x3.  Last echocardiogram showed
ejection fraction of 75%, carotid stenosis right side 40%,
left side 69%
3.  Type II diabetes
4.  Retinopathy
5.  Neuropathy
6.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
7.  Lung nodules
8.  Right kidney atrophy with baseline creatinine ranging
from 1.8 to 2.0, though has been as low as 1.5 as well.
9.  He had an aortobifemoral on [**2169-8-2**].
10. Vocal cord polypectomy in [**2167**].
11. Laser surgery of his eyes of some sort in '[**65**].

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Regular insulin sliding scale on admission
2.  Lopressor 75 mg po bid
3.  Percocet prn
4.  Imdur 60 mg [**Hospital1 **]
5.  Minoxidil 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
6.  Lipitor 40 mg qd
7.  Diltiazem extended release 120 mg once a day
8.  Niacin sustained release 1 gm once a day
9.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient on admission had a temperature of
100.1??????, pulse 78, 146/50 blood pressure, 20 and 97%
saturation 2 liters.
ABDOMEN:  Minimal right upper quadrant tenderness without a
physical exam [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, some slight left greater than right edema
for which he had an ultrasound which showed no deep venous
thromboses.
RECTAL:  Normal tone, guaiac negative.

LABS:  His white count was stated previously.  The rest of
his labs were a chemistry of 136, 3.7, 101, 27, 20, 1.8,
calcium of 7.9 at [**Hospital1 1474**].  On admission the [**Hospital6 1760**], his CBC was 20.0, 30.6 and
295 with a chemistry of 136, 3.7, 99, 26, 20, 1.7, 137.
Coagulation profile was within normal limits.  His liver
function tests at [**Hospital6 256**] were
an ALT of 28, AST 22, alkaline phosphatase 91, amylase 17,
total bilirubin 1.2, lipase of 31.

RADIOLOGY:  KUB showed mildly dilated small bowel with good
air and contrast without evidence of obstruction, no free
air.  Ultrasound at outside hospital showed sludge in the
gallbladder wall duct scan.  Post fluid CT at the outside
hospital showed stranding around the gallbladder, mild
dilated loops, scanned fluid around the previously right
aortic limb and of the aortobifemoral.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The picture was that the patient was likely
to have cholecystitis and we were consulted.  Our evaluation
was that the patient did indeed have cholecystitis and he was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2169-8-14**].  His white count at
this point had gone up to 21.3 from 20.  The patient had an
attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy which had to be
converted to open and postoperatively the patient had a
nasogastric tube and a Foley and was receiving perioperative
antibiotics which had also been started preoperatively on
admission.  He did not tolerate the postoperative period
well.  The patient was kept in the PACU and had to be
extubated by anesthesia after he had desaturations.  The
patient had an A-line immediately placed and was put on
ventilation.  He had his epidural line fixed.  He was
hemodynamically stable.  His hematocrit was stable too at
this point.  Invasive monitoring was performed and the
patient was kept in the Recovery Room overnight.  The
determination was made that the patient could later be
extubated and ............. was transferred to the floor in
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit setting for additional
monitoring.

The rest of his hospital course is as follows:
Neurologically, the patient originally had an epidural.
After his diet was advanced and he was tolerating po's, he
was switched over to po pain medication without difficulty
and his pain was well controlled.  He had never had signs of
a stroke.  He never had any neurological deficits.

Cardiac:  The patient was on intravenous Lopressor and his po
medications were on hold after the operation given his NPO
status.  His po medications were then slowly added back, as
he began to tolerate a diet and his blood pressure was well
controlled.  The patient upon discharge was tolerating a
regular diabetic diet.

Respiratory:  Patient outlined as above wound up being
intubated in the Recovery Room for an overnight stay and was
then transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit past
being extubated.  The rest of the stay was significant for
aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet along with
nebulizers and supplemental oxygen which he had
preoperatively.

Abdomen:  The patient's old aortic bifemoral wound has had
staples discontinued as did the groin wound from his previous
aortobifemoral.  His gallbladder cholecystectomy incision
looked red on postoperative day #3 and Kefzol was started,
renally dosed in order to prevent infection.  The wound was
carefully monitored and with Kefzol the patient's wound
improved.  He is going to be discharged on Keflex with
regards to that.  Otherwise, there are no acute issues.  His
abdominal pain from the cholecystitis was resolved.

Gastrointestinal:  The patient is tolerating a diabetic diet
well, getting Colace.

Renal:  Patient has elevated creatinine which is consistent
with his chronic renal insufficiency.  The patient had some
swelling for which he was given Lasix twice during the course
of his admission and his electrolytes were appropriately
repleted.  The patient is not in congestive heart failure
upon discharge.

Infectious disease:  The patient will receive seven days of
Keflex as an outpatient, has received Kefzol in house after
signs of the wound having a slight amount of erythema and
cellulitis.

Heme:  The patient's heme as stated was stable and the
patient received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis including
Venodynes and subcutaneous heparin.  He had a vascular duplex
prior to discharge, on the day of discharge on [**2169-8-18**],
which was again negative for deep venous thrombosis.

The patient is being discharged to rehabilitation today in
good condition.
