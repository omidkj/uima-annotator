CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx s/p ct's removed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx s/p ct's removed
CLINICAL INDICATION: Rule out pneumothorax, status post chest
tube removal.

FINDINGS: A single portable image of the chest is compared to
the prior examination dated [**2126-3-8**]. In the interim since the
prior examination, the Swan-Ganz catheter and endotracheal tube
have been removed. Allowing for slight differences in technique,
the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Severe bullous
emphysematous changes are noted in the mid and upper lungs
bilaterally. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. There is new
obscuration of the right costophrenic angle likely secondary to
underlying effusion. There is a persistent left retrocardiac
opacity that has slightly progressed since the prior
examination, likely secondary to underlying atelectasis and an
associated effusion, difficult to exclude pneumonia. In
addition, there is a new patchy opacity obscuring the right
cardiac border concerning for an evolving pneumonia and/or
atelectasis. The patient is status post CABG and median
sternotomy.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior apical and apical
hypokinesis.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50% %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal
free wall contractility.
5. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. He was taken to the
operating room on [**2-/2047**] where he underwent an off pump CABG x 2.
He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was
extubated later that same day. He was transferred to the floor
on POD #3. He did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge home on POD #4.
