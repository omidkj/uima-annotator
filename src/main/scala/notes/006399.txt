Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with Cypher stent placement

History of Present Illness:
58 y.o man w/ diet-controlled dyslipidemia presented to
[**Hospital1 **] w/ SSCP for several hours today. He reports the
gradual onset of "indigestion" over the last week, located
substernally in the center of his chest. He reports that the
symptoms were slightly worsened with food and had no
relationship with exertion. He tried eating yogurt which helped
mildly. Today around 1 pm the symptoms progressed from mild to
severe and persistent, with associated nausea, diaphoresis,
numbness in his left arm, and tingling in his right arm. His
primary care physician recommended going to [**Hospital3 1280**] to be
evaluated where he got an EKG which was suspicious for anterior
MI. He received ASA x 4, Lopressor, integrillin bolus, heparin
bolus and infusion, nitro infusion, and transferred via
helicopter for emergent catheterization.

Cath revealed subtotal occlusion of proximal LAD, just before S1
w/ near normal flow. 30% mid and 60% distal disease. A 3.0-23
cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was placed. Transient decreased flow was
reversed w/ diltiazem. After this intervention, there was normal
flow.  Hemodynamics showed Fick CO of 4.36, Fick CI 2.21, PCW
19, RA mean 11, PA 34/20, RV 34/6 (6). EF was 22% by LV gram w/
severe anteroapical akinesis. Patient was transferred post-cath
to the CCU in stable condition. He was initiated on routine
post-MI management: metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin.

On arrival to the CCU, he [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] chest pain, shortness of
breath, vomiting, or syncope.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
lives with wife.

Catheterization [**2195-11-22**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery
had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The
LAD
demonstrated a subtotal occlusion proximally just before the S1,
a 30%
stenosis in the mid vessel, and a 60% stenosis distally.   The
LCX
contained no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
The RCA
contained no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided pressures
were
mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 10 mm Hg and RVEDP was 12
mm Hg).
PA pressures were mildly elevated (PA pressure was 33/12 mm Hg).
 Left
sided pressures were mildly to moderately elevated (mean PCW
pressure
was 19 mm Hg and LVEDP was 23 mm Hg).  Cardiac index was normal
(at 2.5
L/min/m2).   There was no significant gradient across the aortic
valve
upon withdrawal of the catheter from the left ventricle to the
ascending
aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated
ejection
fraction of 32%.  Extensive anteroapical akinesis was noted.  No
mitral
regurgitation was noted.
4.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy with
AngioSeal
device.
5. Successful PTCA/stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x23mm
Cypher
DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
6. 8F arteriotomy site was successfully closed with a 8F
angioseal
closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. Successful PCI with DES of mid LAD subtotal occlusion.

CXR [**2195-11-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of CHF.
2. Minimal right lower zone infiltrate, suggesting aspiration or
pneumonia. We suggest follow-up films to ensure resolution.

Echo [**2195-11-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the septum and
anterior wall,
distal inferior and lateral walls, and apex. No masses or
thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD
lesion).


Brief Hospital Course:
1. STEMI: EKG w/ STE in V1-V4, 1/2 mm elevations in AVL and I w/
Q waves V1-V5 on OSH EKG. Had catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
started on integrillin, aspirin, statin, plavix, ACE and beta
blocker. Post-cath, patient has had a variety of re-perfusion
ectopy including PVC's and AIVR which resolved by hospital day
2. Lipid panel showed elevated LDL to 102 so lipitor was
continued at a moderate dose. CK peak was 2744. Nutrition and
physical therapy were consulted for post MI teaching. He will
follow up with outpatient cardiology at [**Hospital3 1280**]. He was
monitored for 72 hours.

2. Low EF: Patient w/ akinetic anteroapical walls, EF 22% by LV
gram. ACE and BB were started. Heparin and coumadin therapy were
started given his apical akinesis. A repeat echo showed
persistent apical akinesis and EF of 30% and no thrombus. He
will continue becoming slowly therapeutic on the coumadin at
home and be followed by his PMD.

3. WBC - He was noted to have elevated WBC which was likely
stress from MI. Chest xray showed possible RLL infiltrate but
the patient was afebrile so no antibiotics were started.

4. Social work/case management: SW was consulted to help the
patient cope with the new diagnosis. CM informed the primary
team that the paitient had no medical insurance by choice so the
team kept costs in mind while caring for this patient, and he
was discharged on half pills of higher dose medications where
possible.
