History of Present Illness:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] presented to OSH ED complaining of chest pain. The
patient has noted intermittent chest pain over the last two
months. He describes it as pressure in his mid chest, lasting
several minutes at a time. These were worsened by activity and
resolved with rest, without associated nasuea, vomiting,
diaphoresis or shortness of breath. In the last few days, these
episodes have become more frequent and last longer. He also has
been feeling short of breath, and has been unable to lie flat
secondary to shortness of breath. He also has noted some ankle
swelling. Last night he had an episode at rest that persisted
and he decided to got to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac workup and cardiac
surgery was consulted for revascularization.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
Smoked 1ppd x many years until recently. Occasional alcohol.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Pertinent Results:
[**2171-7-26**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with posterior akinesis, inferior and lateral
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
30-35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2171-8-17**] ECHO: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded. 2. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. 4. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There
is a small pericardial effusion. 8. There are bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2171-9-6**] Echo: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left
ventricle is not well seen. The inferior and posterior walls may
be hypokinetic, but the overall left ventricular ejection
fraction appears to be preserved. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2171-9-6**] Head CT: 1. Probable subacute infarct in the right PCA
territory. 2. Complete opacification of the right mastoid air
cells may be related to
recent intubation, however, acute mastoiditis is not excluded
and clinical
correlation is recommended. 3. Mild mucosal thickening in the
left maxillary and bilateral ethmoid sinuses.

[**2171-9-6**] Chest CT: 1. Interval decrease in loculated left pleural
effusion with small amount of associated atelectatic lung at the
left base. 2. Small right pleural effusion. 3. Remainder of exam
is essentially unchanged from [**2171-9-3**].

[**2171-9-9**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing left pleural effusion has minimally decreased in
extent. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Borderline size
of the cardiac silhouette without signs of overhydration.
Tracheostomy tube, pacemaker. Sternal fixation devices. No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The pre-existing pleural
opacity on the left has decreased in extent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2171-7-25**] for further
management of his chest pain. Heparin and nitroglycerin were
continued. He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe left main and three vessel disease. Given the severity of
his disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] initially refused surgery and elected for medical
management. He continued to have intermittent chest pain and
ultimately agreed to surgical revascularization. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
duplex ultrasound which showed less then 40% bilateral internal
carotid artery stenosis. Plavix was held in anticipation of
