vs
   infection such as PNA or UTI

Renal Failure
  -creatine 2.9, most likely pre-renal.  Will not overhydrate-
do not want to fluid
   overload.  Will gently fluid bolus, con't to monitor, avoid
renal toxic meds

was placed on morphine 1-2 mg q4 hrs. However, the pt asked for
little morphine over the first day adn this was changed to a
morphone drip per family request since they said she does not
often complain. Morphine drip of 2mg/hr was started. On Tues
