Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Thoracentesis on [**4-19**] and [**4-25**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12982**] is an 85yo M w/ a PMH of CHF, CAD, afib, HTN,
dyslipidemia and PVD who presented to his regularly scheduled EP
appointment. At his appointment, it was felt that the patient
had worsened SOB, increased peripheral edema, and what looked
like a cellulitis vs. thrombophlebitis in his LUE. His radial
pulse was not palpable and it was felt that the patient needed
admission for management of his CHF and for [**Known lastname 1106**] surgery's
evaluation of his LUE.
.
The patient and his son note that the patient had been well up
until 3 months ago when he was first admitted for pneumonia.
Since that time, it has been a downward spiral and the patient
has been bouncing in and out of rehab. The son notes that the
patient never had an issue with fluid management until then and
was on a steady dose of diuretics for approximately 4 years
prior to his admission 3 months ago.
.
He was most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-4-11**] after a 6
day stay for CHF exacerbation. It was felt at the time that his
symptoms were due to miscommunication about his lasix doses (was
taking 80mg QD instead of 80 QAM/40 QPM). He was aggressively
diuresed with IV lasix and then switched back to PO lasix. Per
the son, the patient's left hand was starting to get a little
swollen prior to discharge.
.
Since discharge, the son feels that Mr. [**Known lastname 12982**] has steadily
declined. The rehab has commented on increased abdominal girth,
swelling in his "mid section" (the patient states that his
scrotum gets pinched by his clothes), as well as worsening
swelling in his legs and now left arm. He denies any orthopnea
or PND. Can not assess for DOE as pt is ambulating minimally
lately. He states that he has only minimal SOB and does not
require oxygen at the nursing home. However, he does state that
he sometimes finds it hard to catch his breathe. He denies any
chest pain or pressure. He denies any LH or dizziness. He denies
any pain in his left arm and does not think that he had an IV in
that arm during his last admission. He states that his arm is
sensitive to touch, but not frankly painful. Last night, the
patient notes that he had trouble sleeping but can't tell if it
was due to shortness of breath or discomfort. He spent the night
sitting up in a chair and feels like the rehab center just
wasn't able to take care of him anymore. He feels "relieved"
that he's here.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke
(though son states head CT in past showed evidence of old
infarcts), TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Is notable for significant
edema.
