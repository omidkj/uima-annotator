Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 87 year-old female with a history of atrial
fibrillation on warfarin, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CHF
who presented to an OSH with acute onset right hemiparesis. The
patient is unable to give a history and history per husband.
The patient was in her usual state of health until around 7 am
on the morning of admission when she was noted to be slumping to
the right, was lethargic and not verbal. Her right arm and leg
appeared weak per her husband. She was taken to [**Hospital3 628**]
ED by EMS and was found to be hypertensive with systolic blood
pressure in the 200-220 mmHg range, to have a flaccid right
hemiparesis, and a large territory left MCA stroke on CT scan
(image not available). She was treated with aspirin and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt was placed on a labetalol drip for
persistently elevated blood pressure into the 250's systolic.
She was therefore admitted to the ICU overnight where her
neurologic symptoms remained static.  Her blood pressure
decreased into the 180's systolic off labetalol gtt (she did
require the drip for approx. 15min [**Name8 (MD) **] RN for BP of 210mmHg
systolic).

At the time of my encounter, the pt. was not responding to the
examiner's inquiries and not following commands.

ROS: Unremarkable per admission note. Unable to elicit review of
systems this am.

follow commands.

left. No adventitious movements noted.  Pt would move left arm
and leg spontaneously and would withdraw from pain.  Only weak
arm flexion in response to pain in right arm.  No movement noted
in right leg.

-sensory: Pt withdrew from painful stimuli on left and grimaced
to painful stimuli on right.

-DTRs: 3+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and 1+
ankle jerks bilaterally. Plantar response was extensor

Radiologic Data:
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a large region of edema
involving the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, with
loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation. This is consistent with
an evolving left middle cerebral artery distribution infarct.
The cortex is involved and there is effacement of the sulci in
this area. There is an old right middle cerebral artery
distribution infarct. There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Note is made of multiple areas of high signal
intensity on T2-
weighted images and FLAIR, representing chronic small vessel
ischemia. Note is made of multiple small areas of cerebellar
lacunes. No evidence of acute hemorrhage noted.
.
CXR: ?CHF vs. interstitial lung disease. No evidence for PNA.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87 year-old female with atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented with lethargy and
right sided weakness. She had eye and head deviation to the left
and a dense flaccid hemiplegia on the right. Imaging was
remarkable for a large L-MCA stroke which is consistent with the
physical findings on neurologic examination. The etiology is
likely cardioembolic given history of atrial fibrillation on
sub-therapeutic dose of warfarin. Given the presence of a bruit
and vascular risk factors, artery-to-artery embolism is also
possible.
.
Neuro:
The patient had a R-hemiparesis and was not able to swallow. The
exam remained stable. The patient would repond to vocal cues but
was not able to follow any commands.
.
Cardiovascular:
She ruled out for myocardial infarction. Telemetry was
remarkable for atrial fibrillation and she had pulmonary edema
secondary to heart failure. Her rate was controled with high
doses of metoprolol.
.
Pulmonary:
The patient required supplemental oxygen and could not be weaned
off. CXR showed pulmonary edema, for which the patient received
lasix PRN. She could not be aggressively diuresed given a
significant hypernatremia. A likely aspiration pneumonia added
to her respiratory failure.
.
Infectious disease:
The patient was treated for an aspiration pneumonia with
levaquin and flagyl. Levaquin also covered a UTI. Although she
remained afebrile, her WBC count continued to be elevated and
she continued to deteriorate.
.
FEN:
The patient developed electrolyte imbalances including
hypokalemia, hypomagnesia and, most significantly, a severe
hypernatremia. Potassium and Magnesium were repleted and sodium
was corrected slowly by free H2O boluses via the NGT.
The patient was started on tube feeds as she was not able to
swallow. The feeds increased her respiraty excretions and had to
be held intermittently. After discussion with GI, palliative
care, priest, and family it was decided not to proceed with PEG
tube placement.
.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] condition continued to deteriorate and Internal
Medicine was consulted for advise regarding her multiple medical
problems. At that point, palliative care was consulted and a
family meeting, including a priest, was scheduled. It was
decided on [**9-6**]/5 to make Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and withdraw any
invasive tests or aggressive treatments. She was given morphine
and expired in the morning of [**9-7**]/5 with the family present.
