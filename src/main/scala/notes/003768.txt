Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea & weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o M w/hx CLL (not on treatment), ESRD (still making urine,
with functional AV fistula in place) listed for transplant,
T2DM, transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED, where he was
initially brought by EMS with two days of weakness and dyspnea.
[**Hospital1 **] records indicate triage VS of 98.8, 169/69, 85, 26, 99%.
Labs notable for K+ 6.9, Troponin I 0.72, WBC 39.0. CXR
preliminary report noted "? developing right mid lung
infiltrate. Clinical correlation and followup recommended."
There, he was given levofloxacin, calcium chloride, dextrose,
insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and kayexelate. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 100.3, 102/66, 85, 22, 96% RA. Exam
notable for decreased BS on right lung, otherwise CTAB. ECG
reported as having peaked T waves. Labs were notable for
potassium of 6.4, and he was given calcium gluconate,
kayexalate, insulin, and glucose. He was given one liter NS and
albuterol nebs. Creatinine was 9 at OSH, 9.5 at [**Hospital1 18**]. Per ED
records, patient was discussed with renal and BMT services.
Patient was given acetaminophen 1g PO.
.
Per admission note, patient was initially found to be lethargic
on the floor, but arousable to voice. Labs drawn in ED (pending
at time of transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2), were notable for leukocytosis to
23K (96% lymphocytes), potassium of 5.8, blood gas of
7.30/23/99/12, with anion gap of 19 on metabolic panel. Renal
was consulted to the floor. A foley catheter was placed. While
on the floor, he received a one liter bolus of normal saline,
and was started on D5W with 150 mE1 NaHCO3 infusion. He was
ordered for 2g calcium gluconate.
.
On assessment by MICU resident, his vitals were 99.4, 151/76,
82, 18, 100% 3L. He reported feeling "better," but does feel
chilled.

.
[**9-14**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-9-17**] the findings are
similar.
.
STUDIES:
[**9-15**] CXR: Left lower hemithorax is uniformly opacified,
probably by a combination of consolidation and pleural effusion.
Lesser consolidation is present in the right middle lobe
laterally. Heart size is top normal, unchanged since the prior
examination. Small right pleural effusion may be present.
Findings are most consistent with bilateral pneumonia.
Asymmetric edema could be present as well or concurrently given
distention of mediastinal and hilar vessels.
.
[**9-16**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of
the
pre-existing left pleural effusion has decreased. The
ventilation of the left basal and retrocardiac lung areas, has
improved. The pre-existing right parenchymal opacity is also
smaller than on the previous image. No newly appeared
parenchymal opacity. Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of
pulmonary edema.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old M with CLL, CKD, DMII presents with dyspnea and
weakness found to have elevated lymphocyte-predominant
leukocytosis with electrolyte abnormalities, likely secondary to
leukemoid reaction to CAP and acute on chronic kidney injury,
s/p short MICU course where he received emergent dialysis to
correct metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities
.
# Pneumonia: The patient presented with dyspnea and weakness,
and had an infiltrate on his CXR. He was started on Levofloxacin
for community acquired pneumonia. His fever curve trended down
and his leukocytosis improved. His cough resolved and his
fatigue/weakness dramatically improved. He was satting well on
room air. He was discharged home with antibiotics to complete a
14 day course, and close follow up with his primary care
physician and [**Month/Year (2) 5564**].
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of
ESRD, not on HD, still producing urine. He presented with
hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia and
acute on chronic kidney injury, initially concerning for Tumor
Lysis Syndrome, despite no history of chemotherapy or
glucocorticoid use. He was started on intravenous fluids with
bicarb, and underwent emergent hemodialysis in the MICU to
correct his metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities. He was
given intravenous lasix boluses to promote urine output. After
discussion with Hematology/Oncology, Tumor Lysis Syndrome was
thought unlikely (see below). It is possible that his acute
kidney injury was due to urate nephropathy, and the other
electrolyte abnormalities were secondary to the acutely worsened
renal function. He underwent a total of three hemodialysis
sessions with much improvement. For his hypocalcemia he was
treated with IV calcium gluconate. He was started on calcitriol
and calcium carbonate supplements. A vitamin D level is pending.
He was discharged home with close follow up with his
Nephrologist.
.
# Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (indolent): The patient has not
required treatment for his CLL. He presented with cervical
lymphadenopathy, a lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, elevated
LDH, and electrolyte abnormalities, which were concerning for
[**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation to lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted and felt that
there was no evidence for this on his peripheral smear (no
blasts or prolymphocytes), and that the elevated white count
