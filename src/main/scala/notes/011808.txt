Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
arterial line

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 83 y/o M with MMP including CAD s/p CABG, afib,
HTN, Parkinson's and chronic aspiration recently admitted for
GIB and PNA who represents with hypoxic respiratory distress
requiring intubation in the ED.
.
During his last admission ([**Date range (1) 66812**]); Pt presented from his NH
intubated after being found in respiratory distress, febrile,
hypotensive and anemic/melena. Pt was admitted to the MICU and
started on pressors and broad spectrum ABx. Transfused
aggressively requring 7 units PRBC and FFP to reverse a
therapeutic INR. HCT stabilized and EGD was not pursued based on
family wishes. Abx course for MRSA PNA: Vanc/Zosyn ->
Vanc/Flagyl -> Vanc/Levo which he was d/c home on to complete 10
more days of therapy. Of note; during this hospitalization he
had occasional desaturations, but these resolved with aggressive
chest PT and expectoration of large mucus plugs. Pt subsequentlt
d/c'd to rehab on [**6-29**] to complete his ABx course.
.
Rehab: Apparently Pt with worsening lung examination and hypoxia
with SaO2 66% on unclear O2.
.
ED Course:
Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure [7.38/68/48]
Became hypotensive -> transiently started on Levophed
ABx: Levo/Flagyl


Past Medical History:
1. Parkinson's
2. chronic aspiration with g-tube
3. AFib on coumadin  (had been evaluated by cardiologist in
[**12-22**], and it was decided not to place him on coumadin given
history of multiple falls, but to rate control him with
metoprolol.  Had been on sotalol in the past)
4. CAD s/p CABG [**2157**], 4 coronary vein grafts
5. frequent falls
6. GERD
7. Hyperlipidemia
8. Myelodysplastic syndrome
9. Urinary obstruction (?BPH)
10. HTN
11. Antral gastritis
12. malignant melanoma right ear excised
13. multiple polyps (from ascending, transverse and sigmoid
colons - hyperplastic tubulovillous adenomas) seen on
colonoscopy [**3-/2164**]
14. Restrictive lung disease [**3-21**] to asbestos exposure
15. chronic vit B12 deficiency
16. BPH


Social History:
Patient lives in a nursing home.  Quit smoking in [**2128**] after 20
years.  Quit alcohol in [**2154**].


Family History:
diabetes in brother

Physical Exam:

.
Gen: intubated and sedated
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, ETT
Neck: visible carotid pulsations, no obvious JVD
Lungs: course BS thru/o with scattered rhonchi ant.
CV: tachycardic, no appreciated m/r/g
Abd: soft, nd. g-tube site intact. +BS
Ext: No edema, 1+ DP bilaterally, PT not felt
SKIN: dry and cool
Neuro: sedated


Pertinent Results:
CXR AP [**7-2**]:
1. Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
2. There is mild pulmonary edema.

ECG [**7-2**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy
Poor R wave progression - could be in part left ventricular
hypertrophy but clinical correlation is suggested
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2165-6-25**], no significant change

Moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the right lung, unchanged
over the past three days. Small right pleural effusion persists.
Heart size normal. Tip of the ET tube at the level of the
sternal notch. No pneumothorax.

ECHO [**7-4**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-18**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (but cannot exclude).
