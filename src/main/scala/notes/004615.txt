History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast
cancer with lung and brain mets admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
management of respiratory distress.  The patient reports that
she has had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and a
cough productive of whitish sputum over the past several months,
and that these symptoms prompted her CT chest in [**8-4**] that
demonstrated her pulmonary metastasis.  She states that over the
past 2 days, she has had worsening shortness of breath such that
she is now unable to climb [**11-27**] flight of stairs. She also
endorses some right sided chest pain that is not pleuritic,
which she states has been intermitent for several months. She
denies any f/c/s, palpitaitons, n/v/d, sore throat, LBP, or
myalgias.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.5 130 143/82 28 94% RA.  She
developed a worsening O2 requirement to 5L nc, and received
vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. She was then admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Currently, the patient continues to complain of dyspnea and
cough. Denies any CP, palpitations, or assymetric lower
extremity edema.


Past Medical History:
BREAST CANCER:
- [**2170**] - diagnosed with 4 cm right breast infiltrating ductal
carcinoma, grade 3, LVI, ER/PR/Her-2/neu +, [**9-13**] positive
axillary nodes. Underwent 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan and
four cycles of Taxol, followed by right total mastectomy, which
revealed no residual carcinoma.
- Treated at [**Hospital1 2025**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2026**] of Rad-Onc, chest wall,
supraclavicular, and axillary nodes (50 Gy).
- On tamoxifen, switched to letrozole in 11/[**2176**].
- [**2177-12-4**], found to have 1 cm left breast mass. Partial
mastectomy demonstrated 1.1 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma,
grade 2, LVI positive, 3 mm posterior [**Last Name (un) 2027**] and DCIS 2 mm from
inferior margin. ER/PR +, Her-2/neu -. [**11-27**] positive sentinel
lymph nodes.
- Treated with Taxol and Cytoxan for four cycles. Genetic
testing revealed her to be BRCA2 heterozygosity, so she
underwent left mastectomy, which revealed no residual carcinoma.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] performed a laparoscopic TAH-BSO.
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] treated her to the chest wall (50.4 Gy) and the
supraclavicular and axillary nodes (45 Gy), completed on
[**2178-8-21**]. She had no evidence of recurrence at the
time
of her last visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2180-6-5**].
- [**8-4**], developed dry cough and frontal headaches. CTA chest on
[**2180-8-22**] demonstrated LLL pulmonary mass (17 x 16 mm with
possible lymphangitic spread), enlarged cervical nodes, and a
2.2-cm paratracheal node.
- EBUS by IP on [**2089-8-31**], 4R/7 path. Path poorly differentiated
carcinoma that was TTF-1 negative, mammoglobin positive, ER
negative, and HER-2/neu equivocal.
- CA27.29 was elevated at 431 on [**2180-9-13**], up from 270
on [**2180-8-30**], 45 on [**2180-5-5**], and 25 on [**2179-10-26**].
- [**2180-9-13**] - Brain MRI revealed a 4.3 x 4.2 mm left cerebellar
lesion and two small foci in the right occipital lobe. There was
no edema or mass effect around these lesions.
- [**2180-9-15**] - started xeloda

CXR ([**2180-10-29**]):
Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left
perihilar
region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small
left pleural effusion. Findings most likely relate to pulmonary
edema. Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior
CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-30**]):
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. There is brief right ventricular
diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology. Moderate pericardial effusion
with echo evidence of tamponade.
.
CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]):
No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Massive progression of
disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural
effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared
multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis
carcinomatosa.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-31**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially
echodense. The pericardium may be thickened but is not well
visualized. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller.
.
CXR [**2180-11-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer
disease with
pericardial effusion, extensive infi
