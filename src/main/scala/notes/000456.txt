Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2199-4-23**] morning, the patient was admitted to the SICU for
retroperitoneal bleed and started on norepinephrine gtt for
hemodynamic instability.  Family was [**Name (NI) 653**], and the surgical
team discussed and confirmed DNR/DNI status and treatment wishes
with patient and family.  According to patient's wishes, he
underwent endovascular arteriographic coil embolization by
interventional radiology.  Throughout the day, the patient
received a total of 11 units PRBC, 6 units FFP, and 2 units
platelets to maintain hemodynamic stability.  He remained stable
on norepinephrine gtt after the procedure.  On [**2199-4-24**] early
morning, he suffered respiratory distress with increased oxygen
requirement, and CXR showed near complete opacification of the
right lung, likely secondary to mucous plug.  Bronchoscopy was
offered, which would have required intubation with low
likelihood of successful extubation, and patient and family
understood and declined in accordance to DNR/DNI wishes.  Over
the subsequent few hours, the patient suffered respiratory
failure and expired at 0715.  The family declined autopsy.
