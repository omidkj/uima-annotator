HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
Haitian woman with baseline dementia, end-stage renal
disease, on hemodialysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hepatitis
C, history of peritoneal tuberculosis, with five [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] admissions in the past nine months,
who presents after dialysis with respiratory distress.

The patient was in her usual state of poor health and, after
dialysis on the day of admission, vomited during transport
home.  She became tachypneic and diaphoretic and was brought
to the Emergency Room.  There, she had BIPAP placed, which
she tolerated well.  Arterial blood gases on four liters
nasal cannula showed a pH of 7.32, pCO2 52 and pO2 79.  This
improved to a pH of 7.39, pCO2 39 and pO2 68 on BIPAP 10/5
and 70% FiO2.

After long discussions with the patient's son and the house
staff, it was decided that the family would like the patient
to receive the BIPAP if necessary, and she was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient also developed a fever
to 104.  Blood cultures were sent and the patient was given
levofloxacin 500 mg times one.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  2.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.  3.  Hepatitis C.
4.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, left
ventricular ejection fraction 55% in [**2196-7-10**].  5.
Multi-infarction dementia.  6.  Peritoneal tuberculosis,
status post INH and Rifampin treatment.  7.  Enterococcus
faecium line infection [**2196-2-11**], vancomycin resistant.
8.  Multiple pneumoniae.  9.  Pericardial cyst.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zantac 150 mg p.o.q.d., regular
insulin 4 units q.a.m., NPH insulin 18 units q.h.s.,
Nephrocaps one p.o.q.d., Nepro tube feeds, Norvasc 10 mg
p.o.q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor (cough).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is Creole speaking and does not
speak English.  Her son is involved in her care.  The patient
lives in a nursing home and has had declining health in the
past year.  She is "Do Not Resuscitate", "Do Not Intubate".

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
is cachectic and minimally responsive, lying in the fetal
position, appears frightened.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Sclerae clear, mucous membranes dry.  Lungs:
Crackles heard one-half up from base on the right more than
left, no wheezes, poor air movement, using accessory muscles
to breath.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2,
no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds,
liver palpable, gastrostomy tube in place.  Extremities:
Thin with pounding distal pulses bilaterally, bilateral lower
extremity contractures.  Neurologic:  Patient groaning but
following simple commands.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory data were hemolyzed.
Arterial blood gases were as noted above.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 120 beats per minute with left axis
deviation and normal intervals, old Q waves in leads II, III
and AVF, baseline artifact, no acute changes from previous
electrocardiograms.  Chest x-ray revealed right middle lobe
opacity and an old pericardial cyst.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for a chief complaint of tachypnea.  She
was placed on BIPAP ventilation for respiratory acidosis,
which improved, and her oxygenation was good.  She received
Levaquin for presumed pneumonia.

The patient's temperature, however, continued to rise,
reaching levels above 106.  She was tachycardiac to a rate
greater than 150.  She was treated with ice packs,
intravenous fluid and her antibiotics were broadened to
include vancomycin and Flagyl.

Despite these treatments, the patient remained tachypneic and
tachycardiac and became increasingly hypotensive.  On the
first hospital day, the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **], spoke with the family and it was agreed that the
patient should be taken off the BIPAP ventilation and started
on a morphine drip because of her extremely poor prognosis.
The family was at her bedside at the time of her death at
5:04 p.m.

CAUSE OF DEATH:
Respiratory failure from an aspiration pneumonia.
