FALLS



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
HPI:
The patient is an 81y old man with background of HTN and
neuropathy and unexplained coma. He is transferred today from an
OSH with large R SDH after unwitnessed fall at home 2 days ago.
He was seen with his daughter providing additional background
history.

Mr [**Known lastname 73222**] had a fall at home 4 days ago. His daughter saw him
that day and he seemed well aside from a single episode each of
vomiting and urinary incontinence. He seemed fine on day 2 after
the event. But on day three  he said he was not feeling himself
and on the phone seemed to be having trouble finding words, and
was less active than usual. His daughter did observe he was
holding the R eye shut more than usual and this persisted to
today. Today he also had decreased oral intake. She found him
this morning weak and unable to get off the toilet.  Says he had
not been there very long. He complains now of double vision. No
H/A, neck or back pain, dizzyness/weakness or paraesthesias.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-5-19**] 1:17 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: S/P BURR HOLES

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with large R SDH s/p burr holes
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?decr in R SDH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Not needed

INDICATION: 81-year-old male with large right subdural
hemorrhage, status post burr hole placement. Please evaluate for
decrease in size of right subdural hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: [**2153-5-18**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of right-sided burr
hole, and interval decrease in size of large right subdural
fluid collection, which remains moderate in size, with layering
foci of high attenuation and new pneumocephalus. Degree of mass
effect upon subjacent cortex has lessened, and degree of
subfalcine herniation has also lessened, with approximately 10
mm of leftward shift of midline structures, compared to 15 mm
seen on previous scan. There is no longer effacement of the
suprasellar cistern.

Note is now made of apparent small left-sided extra-axial fluid
collection, which appears to represent small chronic left
subdural hemorrhage, not well appreciated on prior scan.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post right frontal burr hole, with interval decrease
in size of right subdural fluid collection. Decreased mass
effect and subfalcine herniation, evidenced by decrease in
leftward shift of normally midline structures. Decreased
effacement of the suprasellar cistern.
2. Small left convexity extra-axial fluid collection likely
represents small chronic left subdural hematoma.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Reason: KNOWN SDH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man s/p fall 3 days ago with mental status change
and known SDH and SAH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o aneurysm
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

COMPLEX SUBDURAL COLLECTION OVER THE RIGHT CEREBRAL CONVEXITY
WITH MIXED LOW AND HIGH ATTENUATION REPRESENTING EITHER
HYPERACUTE UPON ACUTE SUBDURAL VS ACUTE ON CHRONIC SUBDURAL.
THIS COLLECTION EXERTS SUBSTANTIAL MASS EFFECT ON THE SUBJACENT
CORTEX WITH 1.5CM LEFTWARD MIDLINE SHIFT OF THE FALX CEREBRI.
THERE IS RIGHT SUBFALCINE HERNIATION AS WELL AS IPSILATERAL
UNCAL HERNIATION WITH EARLY TRANSTENTORIAL HERNIATION DENOTED BY
EFFACENMENT OF THE MESENCEPHALIC CISTERN.
A HYPOATTENUATION COLLECTION ALONG THE LEFT CEREBRAL CONVEXITY
[**Month (only) **] REPRESENT AN OLD CHRONIC SUBDURAL HEMATOMA. THERE IS A
SLIGHT HYPERATTENUATING FOCUS ALONG THE LEFT CEREBRAL CONVEXITY

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-5-29**] 1:19 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man decreased mental status, s/p SDH evacuations
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for interval change
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Decreased mental status, status post subdural
hematoma evacuation.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: As noted on the prior examination of [**2153-5-28**],
there is an unchanged mixed density subdural hematoma. The
amount of gas in the subdural space has improved since prior
examination. The degree of uncal and subfalcine herniation is
unchanged. There are no new areas of intracranial hemorrhage. No
significant left subdural collection is noted. There is a right
frontal craniotomy.

IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2153-5-28**], there has been no change
in the right cerebral convexity subdural hematoma. There is
unchanged uncal and subfalcine herniation.
