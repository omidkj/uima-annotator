Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/ came to hospital for LE weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EMG


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6185**] is a 77 year old female with a history of coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, congestive heart failure (EF 30%), and
COPD who initially presented to an OSH with a three week history
of progressive lower extremity weakness and falls at home. She
denies specific trauma on presentation. She also complained of
an involuntary 30 lb weight loss over a period of 3 months. She
has chronic dyspnea on exertion thought to be secondary to her
severe CAD and congestive heart failure but she had not had a
worsening of these symptoms prior to presentation. She was
transferred to this hospital for neurology consultation for
possible [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] syndrome.
.
She was admitted to the neurology service on [**2112-3-24**]. She
initially underwent non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis which showed no clear etiology of her weakness of weight
loss. She underwent EMG which showed no electrophysiologic
evidence for a generalized polyneuropathy (including a
demyelinating radiculopolyneuropathy)
or for a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy on the right. On [**2112-3-25**]
she underwent non-contrast CT C-spine which showed multilevel
degenerative changes as well as a CT of the abdomen with
contrast which showed no active malignancy. She received IV
hydration prior to her CT scan. Since her CT scan she has had a
worsening of her creatinine from 1.1 on admission to 1.4 on [**3-26**]
and 2.0 on [**3-27**]. She received IV hydration at 70 cc/hr for her
acute renal failure. Overnight on [**2112-3-27**] she was noted to have
worsening dyspnea. She underwent CXR which showed hyperinflation
but no evidence of pneumonia or volume overload.
.
The MICU consult service was called on [**2112-3-27**] at approximately
6PM for worsening respiratory distress. On arrival the patient
was audibly wheezing and was using accessory muscles of
respiration. While previously satting well on room air she was
noted to be 85% on RA and was placed on a non-rebreather. Prior
to arrival she had received 10 mg IV lasix with no effect
(previously on torsemide 20 mg daily). ABG showed acute
respiratory acidosis 7.26/56/124 on a non-rebreather. Repeat CXR
was concerning for mild worsening of pulmonary edema. She did
not have improvement after nebulizer therapy. She was
transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.
.
MICU COURSE:
On arrival to the MICU she was placed on BIPAP out of concern
for pulmonary edema. She was somnolent and not responsive to
questions. She was continuing to use accessory muscles of
respiration. Nitro gtt was given for a few hours. Despite
minimal urine output from furosemide, patient's respiratory
status rapidly improved. Her acute renal failure was thought to
be from contrast loads. In the morning after MICU transfer,
patient started to autodiurese.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The basal anterior wall contracts
best, but is also hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The estimated cardiac index is low
(2.1L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
global hypokinesis and mild right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc., Cannot
exclude multivessel CAD). Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

.
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe atherosclerotic stenosis at the origins of the celiac
axis and SMA
with post-stenotic dilatation. These findings raise the
possibility of
intestinal angina, particularly given the patient's history of
weight loss.
There is no CT evidence of acute ischemia.
2. Enlargement of the adrenal glands bilaterally without focal
nodules,
likely adrenal hyperplasia.
3. A 3.3 cm right adnexal cyst, which is abnormal in this
postmenopausal
patient. Pelvic ultrasound is recommended for further
characterization.
4. Two peripherally enhancing hepatic lesions consistent with
hemangiomas.
5. Patent aorto-bifem graft.
6. 3 and 4 mm pulmonary nodules at the lung bases. The patient
is scheduled
to have a dedicated chest CT shortly, at which time the
remainder of the chest
can be evaluated.
