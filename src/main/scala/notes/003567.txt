Jaundice

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 yo male with h/o AVR (mechanical valve), Afib, AAA
5.9 cm not surgical candidate, admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] for painless
jaundice.  He had an ERCP with was unsuccessful at OSH,
therefore he was sent here for repeat ERCP and evaluation.  He
had a stent removed, biopsies of a suspicious lesion, and new
stent placed.  During the procedure, he became intermittently
hypotensive, with SBP in the 80s, requiring fluid boluses and
800 mcg of phenylephrine. He received Versed 2 mg, Propofol 100
mg, and fentanyl 75 mcg during the procedure.  He received 800
mL of LR during the procedure.   Post ERCP, he was in the
holding area, noted to be hypotensive to low 90s, and with a
concerning "wide complex rhythm".  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was called to evaluate
and monitor the patient prior to transfer back to [**Hospital1 1474**].  At
the time of evaluation, the patient only complained of some
abdominal soreness, denied chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness, or
dizziness.  SBP had already improved to 112/68.  His rhythm was
V-paced. Cardiology was also at bedside to evaluate.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, or rash.

ERCP [**2137-1-11**]:
Impression: A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was found
in the major papilla. The stent was removed with a snare and
sent for cytology.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major
papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful contrast medium
was injected resulting in complete opacification.
A single smooth stricture that was 35mm long was seen at the mid
CBD extending to the hilum. There was moderate post-obstructive
dilation.
A 10FR by 250cm SPYGLASS Choledochoscope was introduced into the
bile duct with success.  The mucosa appeared irregular and
friable, suspicious for a malignant process.  Three cold forceps
biopsy were taken from the stricture through the SPYGLASS
choledochoscope for histology.
A 10cm by 10FRmm Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully using a 10FR stent introducer kit. Excellent bile
drainage was achieved
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum
PLAN:  Return to outside hospital under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35828**] [**Name (STitle) **] care
Follow for response/complications
Please call if develops jaundice, black stools, fever, or
abdominal pain
juices today when awake, alert, and at baseline
Follow-up cytology results
Follow-up biopsy results
If malignancy confirmed will arrange ERCP and metal stent
insertion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]

ECG [**2137-1-11**]: Multiple ECGs available for evaluation and telemtry
strip.  Baseline underlying rhythm Atrial fibrillation.  Some
ECG are V-paced.  Difficult to determine whether there are any
ischemic changes on v-paced beats, but no obvious ST segment
changes.  rate in 90s-100.  Tele strip shows afib, then
subsequent likely V-paced rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: This is a 85 year-old male with a history of
mechanical AVR, atrial fibrillation, AAA, who is transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p ERCP c/b hypotension and concern for "wide complex"
rhythm.

# Hypotension:  Patient's hypotension was thought to be
secondary to sedation and possibly volume depletion.  He
underwent a rule-out for myocardial infarction that was
negative.  He was given a 500cc normal saline bolus and his
blood pressure remained stable during his hospital stay.  He did
not require vasopressors.

# Hypoxia:  Patient had an oxygen requirement of 4L that was
thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema.  He will likely need
gentle diuresis upon arrival at [**Hospital1 1474**] to help reduce his
oxygen requirement.  Subjectively, he was not complaining of
shortness of breath.

# Ventricular-paced rhythm/AFIB:  Patient has a history of afib
with V-paced rhythm.  He did not complain of chest pain and also
ruled out for myocardial infarction.  He was restarted on
lovenox after his ERCP on [**1-11**] at [**Hospital1 18**].

# Painless Jaundice:  Patient underwent a repeat ERCP on the
evening of [**2137-1-11**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  A plastic stent placed in the
biliary duct was found in the major papilla. The stent was
removed with a snare and sent for cytology.  Evidence of a
previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful.  A single smooth
stricture that was 35mm long was seen at the mid CBD extending
to the hilum. There was moderate post-obstructive dilation.  A
10FR by 250cm SPYGLASS Choledochoscope was introduced into the
bile duct with success.
The mucosa appeared irregular and friable, suspicious for a
malignant process.
Three cold forceps biopsy were taken from the stricture through
the SPYGLASS choledochoscope for histology.  A 10cm by 10FRmm
Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully using a 10FR
stent introducer kit. Excellent bile drainage was achieved.
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum.  He should
return to [**Hospital1 1474**] under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35828**] [**Name (STitle) **] care and his cytology
results should be followed-up.

# Mechanical AVR:  Patient was restarted on lovenox after
discussion with the ERCP fellow.

# C. diff:  Patient had diarrhea and his stool was positive for
c. diff.  He was started on po flagyl.
