Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IA tPA and Merci clot retrieval


History of Present Illness:
54 yo left-handed man with sudden onset of bilateral vision
loss,
dizziness and left sided weakness who presents from [**Hospital **]
hospital as a code stroke. He has a past medical history that is
significant for severe cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15% - etiology
unknown, thought possible secondary to cocaine/EtOH), HTN
currently controlled, and diabetes (on insulin). Patient had
been
in the hospital and discharged on [**2143-12-6**] after presentation for
chest pain, and then found to have a severely depressed EF. He
was diuresed during that admission and started on Lasix,
coumadin
and digoxin. After the hospitalization he stated that he had
been
up and around at home with little difficulty. He noted a few
episodes of dizziness while standing that had resolved after he
was able to sit down. This morning, he was in the kitchen having
some melon when he states that he felt suddenly short of breath
and then started to lose vision in both eyes. He was feeling
dizzy, so he went over to his couch and sat down. He thought the
episode may be related to his blood sugars, so he tried to take
his insulin, but then realized he could not see it and dropped
it
on the floor. He fell to the ground while trying to retrieve it,
and then according to his mother he was unable to get up. She
reports that he was still moving his hands bilaterally as well
as
his feet, but was unable to get up. She called 911 and he was
brought to [**Location (un) **] where he received IV tPA.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where stroke scale was 17
mostly
for neglect, L arm and leg weakness and sensory loss. He was
admitted to the neuro-ICU.

EKG [**2143-12-9**]:
Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage
with ST-T wave abnormalities of strain and/or myocardial
ischemia. Since the previous tracing opf [**2143-12-4**] the rate is
slower. Limb lead voltage is more prominent. T wave
abnormalities can now be seen. Previously, P wave was
superimposed on T wave.

CT head/CTA head and neck/CT Perfusion head [**2143-12-9**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the right insula and hypodensity within the
right posterior
putamen suggesting right MCA territory acute infarction. No
acute
intracranial hemorrhage is seen. There is no hydrocephalus, nor
shift of
normally midline structures. The basal cisterns are patent. The
soft tissues
and orbits are unremarkable. Mucus retention cyst is noted in
the right
maxillary sinus. Vascular calcifications are noted in bilateral
cavernous
carotid arteries.

CT PERFUSION: There are areas of matched increased mean transit
time (MTT)
and decreased blood volume (BV) in the right frontal and
parietal lobes, in the MCA territory, consistent with acute
infarction. In the periphery of the right MCA territory, in the
inferior right temporal lobe and superior right frontal lobe,
there are small regions of mismatched increased MTT without
definite decreased BV, possibly representing small areas of
ischemic penumbra.

CTA NECK: Imaging is slightly limited due to suboptimal timing
of the
contrast bolus. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the
origin of the left common carotid artery as well as the separate
origin of the left
vertebral artery from the aortic arch.

Mild calcified plaque is noted at the right carotid bulb and
proximal right internal carotid artery. The right internal
carotid artery measures 6.5 mm proximally and 4.5 mm distally.
On the left, there is partially calcified and noncalcified
plaque at the carotid bulb and proximal ICA, causing some
luminal narrowing. The left ICA measures 4.5 mm proximally and
4.5 mm distally.

The cervical vertebral arteries are patent.

Allowing for imaging during expiration, no lesion is seen within
the
visualized lung apices. No adenopathy is noted by size criteria
within the
visualized upper mediastinum and neck.

Degenerative changes are noted in the visualized cervical spine.


CTA HEAD: There is atherosclerotic calcification and irregular
narrowing of the right cavernous carotid artery. The M1 and all
three M2 branches of the right MCA arteries are patent; however,
note is made of relative decreased opacification of distal
branches of the superior right MCA division compared to the left
(5:260). The left MCA and bilateral ACAs are patent. Incidental
note is made of bifurcation of the right A1 with arteries
supplying both the right and left ACA. Bilateral posterior
communicating arteries are patent.

The intracranial posterior circulation is patent.

IMPRESSIONS:

1. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right insula
and also
posterior right putamen suggest acute right MCA territory
infarction. No
acute intracranial hemorrhage seen.
