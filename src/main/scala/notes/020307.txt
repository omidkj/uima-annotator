EKG (Admission): Sinus rhythm and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Left atrial enlargement. Low limb lead voltage. ST-T wave
flattening in the limb leads and T wave inversions in leads
V5-V6. The ST segment in lead V4 appears upward coved and  T
waves are biphasic. The lateral ST-T wave changes may represent
ischemic process. The ECG reflects ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe native three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
a 90%
narrowing at its ostium. The LAD was diffusely diseased but gave
rise to
4 moderate sized diagonal branches. D4 had an 80% ostial
stenosis. The
LCX was diffusely diseased and was totally occluded in the mid
vessel
after supplying a single, small and diffusely diseased OM
branch. The
RCA was diffusely diseased and totally occluded in the mid
vessel.
2. Arterial conduit arteriography revealed a patent LIMA->LAD.
The
SVG->OM1, the SVG->OM2, and the SVG->PL were all totally
occluded
proximally. The SVG->PDA had a focal 50% lesion proximally and
supplied
a small territory.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left
ventricular
filling pressures with an initial LVEDP of 28 mmHg and a mean
PCWP of 20
mmHg that increased to 30 mmHg after angiography. The cardiac
output was
initially 5.4 L/min. Given the high filling pressures, the
patient was
administered furosemide and a dobutamine drip after which his
cardiac
output rose to 6.1 L/min. A resting gradient of approximately 20
mmHg
was measured across the aortic valve with a calculated aortic
valve area
of 1.7 cm2.
4. Left ventriculography demonstrated profound systolic
dysfunction with
a calculated LVEF of 12% that was also consistent with visual
estimate.
No significant mitral regurgitation was detected.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA->LAD and SVG->PDA.
3. Totally occluded SVG->OM1, SVG->OM2, and SVG->PL.
4. Mild aortic stenosis.
5. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
