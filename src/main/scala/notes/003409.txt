HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 47 year old male with
a history of four plus mitral regurgitation confirmed on
echocardiogram on [**2121-2-14**].  Symptomatically, the
patient reports that he occasionally feels lightheaded when
he gets up too quickly and periodically awakes from sleep
with a sensation of a rapid heartbeat.  The patient denied
any episodes of syncope; he additionally denied any evidence
of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  The patient
was subsequently referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for
evaluation and discussion of surgical options for repair.
The patient was thereafter scheduled for elective minimally
invasive mitral valve repair on [**2121-4-7**].

During the course of this initial attempted procedure, severe
inflammation of the right femoral artery was noted, requiring
an intraoperative vascular surgery consultation.  Due to high
suspicion of arteritis versus infection, the patient's
procedure was aborted at this time.

The patient was subsequently scheduled for follow-up in
Clinic and thereafter scheduled for repeat attempted
minimally invasive mitral valve repair on [**2121-5-5**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Status post knee surgery.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a nonsmoker.  The patient is
married and runs [**Location (un) **] Comics.  The patient denies alcohol
or a drug history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2121-5-5**], the patient underwent a
minimally invasive mitral valve repair.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well with a total bypass time of 191
minutes and cross clamp time of 163 minutes.  Lines placed
intraoperatively included a left radial arterial line.

The patient was subsequently transferred, intubated, from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit for
further evaluation and management.

Shortly following arrival, the patient was successfully
weaned and extubated without complication.  Postoperative
hematocrit was noted to be 30.1.

In the CSRU, the patient was successfully weaned from his
drips and advanced to a full regular diet without
complication.  On postoperative day number two, the patient
was cleared for transfer to the floor and was subsequently
admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

Postoperatively, the patient progressed well clinically.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was evaluated by
Physical Therapy who cleared him for discharge to home
following resolution of his medical issues.  By postoperative
day number three, the patient was noted to have pain well
controlled via oral pain medications and his pacer wires were
removed without complication.

The patient progressed well to independent ambulation and was
noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts of
urine at all times.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was noted to be
afebrile and stable with evidence of slightly diminished
oxygen saturation.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a small right
middle lobe consolidation, after which point, the patient was
begun on oral Levofloxacin for a seven day course.

The patient was thereafter noted to demonstrate improved
oxygen saturations of 95% and over on room air while at rest
and ambulating.  The patient was noted to be fully tolerant
of a normal regular diet with good pain control via oral pain
medications.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge on postoperative day number four, [**2121-5-9**],
with instructions for follow-up.
