Chief Complaint:
Fatigue/Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-11-30**] Redo sternotomy, redo mitral valve replacement with a
25/33-mm Conformex mechanical valve

History of Present Illness:
64 year old gentleman with a history of bileaflet mitral
regurgitation who underwent a mitral valve repair in [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2131**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital. This spring, he noted tea colored
urine, some jaundice and was found to have hemolytic anemic.
Hematology work-up was negative and suggested that his mitral
valve repair may be the cause of his hemolytic anemia. An echo
in [**2131-5-26**] was reportedly okay however his anemia progressed
along with symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Repeat
echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 462**] showed severe mitral valve
regurgitation. Given the severity of his mitral regurgitation
and persistent hemolytic anemia, he has been referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for redo mitral valve surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-11-30**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 - 50%). with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is A-Paced on no inotropes. There is a
bileaflet mitral prosthesis which is well-seated and functioning
well with no MR, and normal small upstream jets. Preserved
biventricular systolic fxn. EF remains 45 - 50%. TR is now mild.
No AI. Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15068**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**11-30**] he was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy, Mitral
valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta blockers and diuretics were started on post-op day one and
he was diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On this day he was
transferred to the step-down unit for further care. Coumadin was
initiated and titrated for a goal INR 2.5-3.5. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day two and epicardial pacing wires on day
three. He continued to make progress while working with physical
therapy for strength and mobility. He was discharged on a week
of Keflex for erythematous chest tube sites without drainage.
On post-op day five he appeared to be doing well and was
discharged home with VNA services by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  All follow-up
appointments were advised. His Coumadin for his mitral valve
will be followed by his Cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20948**]. The goal INR
will be 2.5-3.5 it will be drawn every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.
