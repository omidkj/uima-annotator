Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male with hx of CHF (EF 30-35%), CAD (s/p 13
catheterizations, 5 stents), pAF, moderate AS, PVD, COPD, stage
III melanoma and recurrent GIB who is transferred for
symptomatic bradycardia. He was admitted to OSH on [**11-27**]
for GI bleed. Yesterday patient states he felt lightheaded and
had pre-syncopal episode, no LOC. Of note he had a similar
presentation mid [**Month (only) 359**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service for 24
hrs, this was attribute to his medications. Patient denies any
dyspnea which is his cardiac equivalent, he has never had chest
pain or chest pressure. At [**Location (un) **] patient had a BP 96/60 and
bradycardic in 30s and there was concern he couls need a
transvenous pacer. Also, patient noted to be in ARF with
creatinine of 4.5 and elevation in LFT's.

EKG [**10-19**]: Lead V5 is missing. Sinus bradycardia with a P-R
interval of 240 milliseconds.  Non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the previous tracing the rate is slower.
.
RUQ U/S [**10-19**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely coarsened echotexture of the liver. No discrete
nodule seen;
however, evaluation is limited given the coarsened appearance of
the liver.
.
Multiphasic CT or MRI is more sensitive for detecting focal
intrahepatic
lesions and can be considered for further evaluation if
indicated.
.
2. Collapsed gallbladder with sludge and gallstones.
.
TTE [**10-21**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2166-10-31**], the degrees of mitral regurgitation
and aortic stenosis have increased. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are higher. The RV is
dilated/hypokinetic on the current study.
.
CXR [**10-21**]: Placement bipolar pacemaker. Findings consistent with
pulmonary
vascular congestion as demonstrated previously.

Brief Hospital Course:
# bradycardia - DDx included tachy/brady syndrome c/b excessive
beta blockade, new ischemia, hypothyroidism, degenerative
changes to conduction system, metastatic damage to conduction
system.  Given the patient's h/o PAF and prior hospitalizations
in which exquisite sensitivity to beta blockade was noted, it
was felt that tachy/brady syndrome was the most likely etiology.
 Transvenous pacing and/or temp wire were not necessary as
patient remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic before
PPM placement.
- [**Company 1543**] Adapta DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 41904**] 70/130 was placed.
- Clindamycin x 3 days following pacemaker placement.
- Restarted amiodarone and BB s/p pacemaker placement.
- No coumadin, as patient has h/o hemodynamically significant GI
bleeds on this medication.
.
# AOCRF - Known CRF.  Had been NPO x 4-5 days while still
receiving lasix, [**Last Name (un) **] @ OSH.  Urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiol
