History of Present Illness:
(History obtained with help of pt's son, who is physician)
HPI: 86 M with PMH CAD, diastolic CHF (EF50%), AFIB on coumadin,
DM2, presents with progressive SOB. Pt has not been feeling well
since Thursday, no SOB, no CP, rales in bases at baseline, but
on [**Name (NI) 1017**], pt started feeling very SOB, and then became acutely
worse until came to ED on Mon AM.
.
Pt denies CP, palpitations, nausea, vomiting. Pt's HR and BP
were in good control at home(pt monitors BP/HR). Pt was given
lasix by son (who is MD) without any improvement in symptoms. No
recent orthopnea/PND. Has not been feeling well for past 4 days.
Three days PTA developed right shoulder and neck pain. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son
states that he may have been gradually developing CHF over past
few days, although pt was not c/o SOB.
.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypoxic at 60% on RA -->
increased to 96% on NRB, BP 206/78 brought down to SBP 130s. Pt
was given lasix 60 IV x2 and lasix 40 IVx1 with -2.5L UO;
started on nitro gtt. O2 sat's improved and O2 decreased to 50%
FM with initial O2 sats in mid 90s. However, began to desat to
high 80s and NRB was re-placed. Bipap was initiated, then placed
on NRB, and ABG 7.15/97/77/36, and was placed back on bipap.
Also, pt was initially noted to have CP; pt received ASA 325,
nitro sl, nitro gtt, with relief of symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 M with PMH diastolic CHF EF 50-55%, PAFIB on coumadin, DM2,
presents with acute CHF exacerbation due to pneumonia, and UTI.
.
# CHF exacerbation:
Pt has diastolic heart failure with EF 60% on TTE.
Decompensation was rapid over hours to days before admission,
likely etiology being pneumonia. Pt presented with fever and
leukocytosis. Pt was approximately 10 L overloaded on admission,
and responded well to lasix for diuresis. He was euvolemic by
[**4-4**]. Another consideration for etiology of CHF exacerbation
include HTN (SBP was 206 on admission).
.
Pt had no EKG changes, no chest pain or pressure, no SOB. Pt had
negative cardiac enzymes, and an ischemic etiology was not
investigated. Pt's ischemic history includes 3VD, stented LADx2
[**1-/2156**] and [**5-12**], stented LCX [**1-/2156**] with 100% occlusion [**5-12**] that
was unsuccessfully stented c/b dissection, RCA 70%. Pt was
placed on ASA, metoprolol, diovan, statin. Imdur 120 QD per home
regimen was discontinued.
.
Pt was in NSR on admission, but reverted to AFIB within 2 days.
Metoprolol was used for rate control, pt was administered no
rhythm control, and Coumadin dose was readjusted for
anticoagulation. Pt's home regimen of coumadin is 3 QHS; INR
was 3.5 on day of discharge; holding warfarin. Will need repeat
INR and resume
warfarin as tolerated for goal of INR [**2-14**].
.
# Pneumonia:
Pt was administered Levofloxacin from [**4-2**] - [**4-4**]. Since pt
continued to spike fevers for 3 days on levo, Vanc/Aztreonam was
started on [**4-4**].
Completed course of vanc/aztreonam on [**4-13**]; remained afebrile.
.
# UTI:
Pt's first urinalysis and urine culture were negative on
admission. Pt started to develop incontinence during admission,
and was recultured. Urine culture showed Morganella morganii
that was pansensitive except to nitrofurantoin. Pt was given
vanc/aztreonam, and clinically improved, he should complete 10
day course on [**2166-4-13**].
Repeat UA with no evidence for UTI at time of discharge.
.
# Altered mental status:
Pt was disoriented in the early AM and late PM during early
admission. His mental status continued to improve during
admission and was at baseline when tranferred to medicine, and
pt became oriented. Etiology was likely due to pna/uti and ICU
disorientation. Pt was treated with Zyprexa prn. Neurontin per
home regimen was discon
