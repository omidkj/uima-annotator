Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17813**]
Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation at the outside hospital prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Central venous catheter placement in ED [**2208-5-27**]

History of Present Illness:
64M with a PMH of complex partial seizures with secondary
generalisation with previously good control, likely focus was
right parietal IPH in [**2199**] s/p craniotomy and residual mild left
hemiparesis, T2DM poorly controlled with severe diabetic
retinopathy s/p laser surgery with left eye blindness, HTN,
dCHF, right groin mass with biopsy results of an atypical
spindle cell
neoplasm [**4-/2208**] awaiting excision and CKD with new worsening
renal function and nephrotic syndrome possibly secondary to
minimal change (awaiting EM result from bx) with recent tapering
of AEDs in the setting of her worsening renal function presents
with status epilepticus, intubated at OSH and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Very scant OSH records. Patient had decreased Keppra from 1500mg
[**Hospital1 **] to 500 [**Hospital1 **] at recent medicine admission 5/23-28/[**2207**] given
worsening renal function up to Cr c4 on renal guidance at which
time he had presented with a mechanical fall, new peripheral
edema and worsening renal failure. Since then patient had
continued to be seizure free and was maintained on prednisone
60mg qd for nephrotic syndrome felt likely secondary to minimal
change nephropathy and receiving diuresis with furosemide. He
has also had a groin mass biopsied on [**2208-5-4**] which showed
atypical spindle cell neoplasm and is awaiting elective
resection with clear margins. In addition, he had a recent ED
admission for a
burst blister on his left shin due to his severe anasarca on
[**2208-5-24**]. His PCP had discussed with his neurologist regarding
the change in Keppra dosing per documentation on [**2208-5-17**].

Since then, patient had been in his usual state of health until
the evening of [**2208-5-26**] when he started to have generalised
convulsions and apparently convulsive status for over 30
minutes. Had 3 doses of lorazepam en route without termination
of his seizures and was intubated on arrival at [**Hospital **] Hospital
at
20:39 and paralysed with x1 dose of vecuronium. Per
documentation, patient came in actively seizing (eye deviation
to L) and very scant documentation and given midazolam 10mg and
loaded with 2g IV Keppra. Labs there revealed a high WCC 13.1
and UA was negative. In addition, patient was afebrile
throughout and vitals were stable. At family request, patient
was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] and started on propofol and midazolam
prior to departure.

Here, patient was initially only on propofol and I examined the
patient initially after this had been stopped for 30 minutes.
Patient was noted to have eye movements where they would drift
to the left with sustained nystagmus which was concerning for
ongoing seizure activity. A right CVC was placed in the ED due
to problems with IV access (had only 1 peripheral IV cannula. On
assessment, he had no withdrawal at all on the left and had
reasonable withdrawal on the right but would not grimace to pain
but wold occasionally keep his eyes open. Of note per medicine
discharge summary, his left hemiparesis was felt to be very mild
at that time suggesting that his current manifestations were a
post-ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] phenomenon. He has had no recent neurology
evaluation, the last being 8/[**2206**].

Unable to obtain ROS as patient intubated.

Past Medical History:
- R parietal ICH in [**2199**], s/p cranotomy with subsequent left
hemiparesis and seizure disorder

subsequent generalized tonic clonic movements and post-ictal
[**Doctor Last Name 555**] paresis

diabetic retinopathy s/p laser surgery with left eye blindness
