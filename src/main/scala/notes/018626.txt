Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
septic shock
transfer from OSH MICU for management of pancreatitis, sepsis,
and ARDS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation at outside hospital
Hemodialysis
Temporary hemodialysis catheter placement
Endoscopic ultrasound
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage


History of Present Illness:
57yo man presented to OSH [**2184-5-17**] with abdominal pain and nausea,
also with some dyspnea on exertion. On admission he was noted to
have pancreatitis and was admitted for management. A CT showed
no common bile duct dilation, but stones were seen in the
gallbladder with borderline gallbladder wall edema vs.
peri-colicystic fluid. Several days after admission he became
febrile, and was found to have klebsiella bacteremia. He
developed worsening respiratory distress with hypoxia shortly
after taking po barium contrast for a planned CT, at which time
he was diagnosed with ARDS by films and intubated. Shortly after
intubation he had a code for pulseless electrical activity. He
was resuscitated, and after a day on pressors was weaned off
successfully. His urine output decreased, however, and he
developed acute renal failure. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
management with the possibility of requiring hemodialysis or
cholecystectomy.

Imaging:

CXR at OSH: b/l opacities
CT at OSH: Pancreatic edema, no dilation of CBD
MRA at OSH: no RAS, >1cm stone in gall bladder

[**5-25**]: Renal Ultrasound: CONCLUSION: Kidneys are normal in size
and appearance without hydronephrosis. Incidental note of
splenomegaly, minimal ascites, and cholelithiasis.

[**5-25**]: CXR: Lung volumes are low, bilateral essentially perihilar
consolidation is symmetric, heart is enlarged and mediastinal
veins and hila are dilated. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema would be
the presumptive diagnosis.

[**5-25**] CXR (to assess earlier ptx):
1. Normal position of tubes and lines.
2. Worsening of the bilateral pulmonary consolidations.
3. Left lower lobe atelectasis in addition to consolidations.
4. No evidence of pneumothorax.

[**5-25**] KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus

[**5-26**] CXR: Lung volumes are low, bilateral essentially perihilar
consolidation is symmetric, heart is enlarged and mediastinal
veins and hila are dilated. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema would be
the presumptive diagnosis. With benefit of a subsequent film,
one can see a small medial and basal left pneumothorax. Given
the history of a remote left-sided line placement, this may be
longstanding

[**5-26**] KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of small or large bowel
obstruction. No progression of contrast through the colon

[**5-27**] HIDA: IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis or common
bile duct obstruction

[**5-31**] MRCP: 1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation or
pancreatic ductal dilatation. 2. Small (less than 2.5 x 2 cm)
hypoenhancing area in the anterior pancreatic neck may represent
an area of necrosis. Small amount of anterior peripancreatic
fluid. No pancreatic ductal dilatation. 3. Cholelithiasis
without findings of acute cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis
on MRI. 4. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites and small
bibasilar pleural effusions.

[**6-3**] EUS: Using a radial echoendoscope, the pancreas and
surrounding structures were imaged. No lymph nodes identified in
the region of the celiac axis. The pancreas was diffusely mildly
hypoechoic with some focal stranding and mild increase in
pancreatic duct wall echogenicity. No other features of chronic
pancreatitis. At the level of the pancreatic head adjacent fluid
collection identified - some peripancreatic ascites. No mass
lesions within the pancreatic head identifed but within the head
a mild diffuse area of reduced echogenicity more in keeping with
edema was identified. GB wall not thickened but large solitary
gallstone identified (2cm). CBD 3.3 mm PD 1.7 mm.


Brief Hospital Course:
57yo man with pancreatitis, ARDS, Klebsiella bacteremia,
gallstones, and acute renal failure status post pulseless
electrical activity arrest, transferred from outside hospital
with subsequent resolution of above problems.

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. Klebsiella bacteremia - The patient came to [**Hospital1 **] s/p septic
shock w/ resuscitation at OSH. He was noted to have Klebsiella
bacteremia. He was originally put on ceftriaxone, b/c Klebsiella
sensitive to this at OSH, but vancomycin was added when he
continued to spike temperatures. His line was removed and he
became afebrile with negative blood cultures, thus the
vancomycin was discontinued. On [**5-27**] meropenem was started, and
on [**5-29**] ceftriaxone was discontinued. He was treated with a 14
day course of antibiotics, ending on [**6-10**] (day of discharge).
Surveillance blood cultures were negative. He remained afebrile
throughout the rest of his hospital stay.

2. Pancreatitis - Per OSH records, the patient had mild
pancreatitis and a gallstone w/ thickened gallbladder wall but
no frank evidence of cholecystitis. His pancreatic enzymes
continued to trend down here and HIDA scan showed no evidence of
cholecystitis. A pancreatic specialist was consulted. An MRCP
showed evidence of cholelithiasis and a focal area of
necrotizing pancreatitis for he underwent endoscopic ultrasound.
This showed only peripancreatic fluid; the area of possible
necrosis by MRCP appeared to be edema by EUS. A cholecystectomy
may be indicated in the future, but not immediately given his
recent events. He was tolerating a regular diet on discharge. He
was discharged with a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**],
gastroenterologist.

3. respiratory failure - He was admitted with hypoxic
respiratory failure and intubated at the OSH. This was thought
to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of septic shock. Upon
arrival to the [**Hospital1 **], the ARDS seemed improved by CXR. His P/F
ratio was 190 upon arrival, so lung protective ventilation was
started. Within a few days, the P/F ratio had improved to the
300s so weaning trials with PS were started. On [**5-30**], he was
successfully extubated. A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on
[**5-27**] without evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

4. acute renal failure - On transfer, the patient had ARF of
unknown etiology, possibly ATN from contrast. A renal u/s showed
no hydronephrosis. He was followed by the renal service
throughout the hospitalization. He was put on hemodialysis after
temporary line placement on hospital day 2 give
