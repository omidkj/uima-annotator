Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old white
male with history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft times three vessels in [**2121**], end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis three times a week,
diabetes mellitus and hypertension transferred from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for cardiac catheterization.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with
complaints of increased dyspnea on exertion, weakness and
dizziness.  In the Emergency Department their he was found to
have new EKG changes, new T wave depressions in V2 through V3
and more depressed T wave depressions in V4 through V6 and
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was ruled out for MI by
serial enzymes, although he did have an initial CK MB index
of 3.2 and had an echocardiogram which showed LV enlargement
with akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.  Also with
hypokinesis of other LV walls and ejection fraction of 30%,
mitral tricuspid regurgitation with a pulmonary artery
systolic pressure of 45 mg of Mercury, mild MR with
significant left atrial enlargement.  Patient then had a
Persantine MIBI which showed a small lateral wall ischemia
and small inferior wall infarct.

Decision was then made to transfer to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac
catheterization showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 22 mg of Mercury, right atrial pressure of 25 mg of
Mercury, PA pressure of 46/17, right ventricular pressure
48/9.  A totally occluded LAD with positive collateral flow,
70% stenosis of the left circumflex.  The SVG to OM graft was
totally occluded.  SVG to DM graft was patent and LIMA to LAD
graft was patent.  Overall severe three vessel disease.  Two
out three grafts had moderately decreased left ventricular
ejection fraction of 40%, moderate mitral regurgitation and
moderately diffuse hypokinesis.

During the procedure, the patient became hypertensive with a
210/110 and intravenous prior to Nitroglycerin was started.
Patient also had flash pulmonary edema after a
................. load of about 500 cc and was electively
intubated for increased shortness of breath and agitation.
The patient was then transferred to the CCU for Nipride wean
and extubation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Not obtainable.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not obtainable.

Initial EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 65 beats per
minute, normal axis, QRS mildly elongated, left ventricular
hypertrophy by voltage, T wave inversions in V2 through V5,
ST depressions in I and L, unchanged from outside hospital
EKGs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with a temperature of 97.6
F, blood pressure 106/45, heart rate 68.  Pulmonary artery
pressure 37/11.  In general elderly, sedated, intubated male
lying still in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 2 mm bilaterally,
equal, round, reactive to light.  Endotracheal tube in place.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular:  IV/VI
systolic murmur loudest at the apex radiating to the axilla
into the back, irregular.  Pulmonary:  Loud bronchial sounds
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended with normal
abdominal bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Positive
abdominal bruit.  Extremities:  Warm, no edema, no hematoma
at right groin.  Neuro:  Patient sedated.  Withdraws from
touching of feet.

INITIAL LABORATORY RESULTS:  White blood cell count of 5.7,
hematocrit 32.7, platelets 134.  Differential was 72.4%
neutrophils, 18.2% lymphocytes, 8.2% monocytes, 1.0%
eosinophils, 0.2% basophil.  INR was 1.3. Potassium 5.5,
calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.7, phosphorus was 9.7.

ABG done was 7.45, 73 and 345 on 100% oxygen.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is an 83-year-old male with history
of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, end stage
renal disease on hemodialysis transferred from outside
hospital for cardiac catheterization secondary to abnormal P
MIBI with dyspnea and hypertension in Cath Lab.  Started on
Nipride and Nitroglycerin drips, intubated and electively
transferred to CCU for extubation and drip weaning.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  Patient is being kept on the Nitroglycerin drip
throughout the entire course when he was on the ventilator
and it was discontinued once he had been weaned.  The patient
was started on Imdur 50 mg p.o. q.d. for approximately six
hours prior to stopping the Nitroglycerin drip with no ill
effects.

Patient was noted to have a moderately decreased left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30 to 40%.  The patient was
started on an ACE inhibitor and was gradually titrated up,
however two days into ACE inhibitor therapy with Captopril,
the patient developed an erythematous rash which was
pruritic.  At this point, it was assumed that the rash was
secondary to the Sulfur group of the Captopril and patient
was switched to Lisinopril 40 p.o. q.d. with eventual
clearing of rash and no other ill effects.

The patient was switched over from Nitroglycerin drip to
Imdur with no ill effects.  Patient remained moderately
hypertensive throughout the hospital course with blood
pressures up to 160 mg of Mercury systolic were tolerated as
this patient is on hemodialysis.

2.  RHYTHM:  Patient was noted to have new onset atrial
fibrillation.  Patient was maintained on Telemetry and had
frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia as
well as ventricular tachycardia throughout the first two days
of hospitalization with gradual clearing of these.  The
patient was tried on a beta blocker and PR prolongation was
noted.  At this point, the beta blocker was discontinued and
patient had a pacemaker placed so that he would be able to
tolerate Amiodarone therapy.

Patient had a dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker placed
and was started on Amiodarone loading 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.  At
pacemaker placement, the patient received a dose of
Vancomycin.  The patient tolerated the pacemaker placement
and was kept on Telemetry for 24 hours after pacemaker was
placed with no adverse events noted.

The patient was also restarted on Coumadin for
anticoagulation after pacemaker placement.  The decision of
how long to continue Coumadin will be left up to the PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient's Amiodarone loading should be 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
times one week then 400 mg p.o. q.d. times one week and then
200 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient should be seen at [**Hospital **]
Clinic in one week.

3.  CORONARIES:  Patient with status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2121**], LIMA to LAD, SVG to LPDA, and SVG to OM
which is totally occluded, 70% stenotic lesion in mid
circumflex.  Patient was started on Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
and was kept on aspirin throughout hospital course.  The
patient should continue to take these two drugs indefinitely.


4.  PULMONARY:  Patient had an initial weaning trial
approximately 12 hours after admission to the CCU.  The
patient became tachypneic as he was initially weaned from the
ventilator and it was decided to rest him for another day.
The patient was switched over to pressure support and
successfully weaned on hospital day #2.  The patient
initially required oxygen, but soon was able to tolerate room
air with O2 saturations of 95% and above.  There were no
further pulmonary issues in the hospital course.

5.  RENAL:  Patient was continued on hemodialysis throughout
hospital course and initially started on Amphojel and Phos-Lo
as patient had increased phospho
