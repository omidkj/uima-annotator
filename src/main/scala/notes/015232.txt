Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 40 year old female with medical history
including Morbid Obesity, OSA, COPD/Asthma on home O2, Pulmonary
hypertension, history of DTV/PE who presents with dyspnea. The
patient has recently been hospitalized from [**2119-3-28**] to [**2119-4-7**]
for similar symptoms of dyspnea. During this hospitalization the
patient required intubation for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory
failure thought possibly to be secondary to viral or CAP for
which the patient was treated with CTX/Azithro. The patient was
noted to be tenuous post-extubation but refused repeat
intubation, ultimately weaned to 4L NC which is currently her
baseline home O2 requirement.
.
Last night the patient noted the acute onset of worsening
dyspnea, similar to previous Asthma exacerbations she has
experienced.
.
ED Course: Vitals: 100.6
In the ED the patient was assessed to be suffering likely from a
repeat Asthma/COPD exacerbation with WBC of 20.3 with 8%
bandemia. She was treated with Solumedrol 125 x 1,
Albuterol/Ipratropium nebulizers, and given CTX/Azithro after
blood cultures were drawn. An ABG performed in the ED was as
follows: 7.40/61/147/39.

Imaging: Chest Portable [**2120-8-22**]
Very limited study; however, the findings, in context of studies

dating from [**3-27**] through [**2119-4-1**], suggest that this may
represent "asymmetric" pulmonary edema, though other airspace
processes, such as infection must be considered.
.
TTE [**2113**]: EF > 55%, LVH
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle may
be enlarged and free wall hypokinesis may be present but the
right ventricle is not fully visualized. The aortic root is
normal in diameter. The ascending aorta is normal in diameter.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear grossly structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitaton. The mitral valve leaflets are grossly
normal. There is at least trace mitral regurgitation (suboptimal
views). There is no pericardial effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Dyspnea - Likely secondary to pneumonia superimposed on
chronic respiratory hypercarbia. On arrival, patient was on 50%
face mask, and improved with supportive treatment to 96% on 3
litres nasal cannula (she is on 4 litres NC home O2 and CPAP at
home for OSA but is non-compliant with latter).  She was treated
empirically for community acquired pneumonia with
ceftriaxone/azithromycin and should complete 10-day course of
ceftriaxone and 5 days of azithromycin.  Also, she was started
on prednisone 60mg, and should continue prednisone taper after
discharge (60mg x 1day, 50mg x 1 day, 40mg x 1 day, 30mg x 1
day, 20mg x 1 day, 10mg x 1day, then stop).  She will need to
continue supportive therapy with O2, supplement for goal sat
90-93%. Continue standing Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, Advair and
home MDI.  Of note, patient does have history of DVT/PE and is
anticoagulated on warfarin, with goal INR of 2.0-2.5.  LENI
ultrasound of right-lower extremity was limited by habitus but
was negative for DVT.  She should continue on warfarin 7mg every
day, goal INR 2.0-3.0.
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea - Nasal CPAP of 8cmH2O every night.
.
#. Reactive airway disease on home O2 - treatment as above
.
#. Pulmonary Hypertension - etiology likely secondary to OSA as
well as possibly secondary to chronic pulmonary embolism.
Titrate O2 as above, CPAP as above, continue anti-coagulation.
.
#. Hypertension - reported on last D/C summary, patient denies,
not currently on any BP meds.  Follow-up as outpatient.
.
#. FEN: Heart Healthy low Na diet when tolerated.
