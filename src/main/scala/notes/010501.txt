Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental Status changes
s/p Fall
Labile HTN
RLE cellulitis/ecchoymoses

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58 yo M with a h/o ESRD on HD, sz disorder, labile HTN
presenting to ED with mental status changes. Given confusion,
history largely obtained through chart. Per pt's son, on [**Name (NI) 2974**]
of last week, pt had a fall while stepping off bus and injured
RLE. Pt was given vanc at HD for cellulitis. On Sunday night pt
had sz activity and was possibly given ativan. Since that time
patient has been confused. Pt dialyzed today and brought from HD
by son. [**Name (NI) **] pt's family, he has not been compliant with his
medication. Of note pt was recently hospitalized [**2-17**] was mental
status changes and hypertensivve urgency. During the
hospitalization his mental status improved with. His BP was
controlled with a labetalol drip that was rapidly tapered off in
the setting of HD.

In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's vitals: 99, 73, 196/80, 16, 95% on ? O2. CXR
with evidence of [**Name (NI) 1106**] congestion, but no effusion or
consolidation. ekG: nsr @84 bpm LAD, lvh, 1 mm STE v1-3, std
v5-6 (all new), TWi in L (old). CEs pending at time of transfer
to MICU. Pt was given vanc 500 mg IV x2, lamictal 250 mg ivX1,
keppra 375 mg iv X1, nortyptiline 10 mg X1, sensipar 30 mg ivx1.
Pt with sbps that reached 260s. Given HTN, pt given clonidine
0.1 mg po x1, lopressor 10 mg ivx1, hydral 10 mg ivx1. Given
poor response pt was started on nitro gtt with some improvement
to sbps 180s. Pt with increased oxygen requirement to 4L by NC,
increased rr to 30s, started on BIPAP. Renal consulted with
plans for urgent dialysis. Pt transferred to MICU for further
management.

In the ICU....
CV: In the MICU the patient had persistent HTN with BP in
150-212/70-103 and he was managed in the MICU with labetalol
gtt, metoprolol 200mg QD, lisinopril 20mg QD, nifedipine 120mg
PO, and clonidine 0.1 [**Hospital1 **], ST to 115. He also had elevated
troponins, and EKG abnormalities attributed to ESRD and stable
LVH respectively. He was eventually titrated off of labetalol
gtt and transitioned to his home regimen for HTN management.
Renal: Seen by Nephrology, and HD was initiated.
Resp: O2 was d/c'd as patient's respiratory status improved and
with O2sats were 97% RA.
GI/GU: Distended, soft, NT abdomen.
Skin: Red/purple area of cellulities involved right shin. On
vanco day [**3-20**].
At time of transfer patient has no complaints.

[**2137-4-20**] - Calf films
IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling, which may be due to the
provided history of cellulitis. No evidence of acute fracture.
.
[**2137-4-19**] - abdominal ultrasound.
IMPRESSION: Large amount of ascites. Spot marked in right flank
for possible bedside paracentesis.

[**2137-4-22**] MRI calf
IMPRESSION:

Large superficial anterior collection with signal
characteristics that are most suggestive of a hematoma.
Superimposed infection is not excluded. Surrounding edema
extends into the deep muscles and fascial planes involving all
three leg compartments. No evidence of underlying osteomyelitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 yo M with a h/o ESRD on HD, sz disorder, labile HTN
presenting to ED with mental status changes, hypertensive
urgency, and RLE trauma.
.
Mental status changes: Likely result of a combination of
hypertensive encephalopathy given degree of hypertension on
admission (SBP in the 260s) and uremia since his mental status
has cleared following BP management and dialysis.

HTN: Patient was hypertensive to the 260s requiring Labetalol
drip in the MICU. He was transitioned back to his home
antihypertensive regimen when he was transferred to the medicine
floor. There, he continued to have episodes of HTN with SBPs in
the low 200s requiring IV hydralazine. His BP medication was
optimized by increasing his  his Nifedipine to 180mg daily, and
his Toprol XL to 250mg daily, and his clonidine at 0.3mg [**Hospital1 **].
He responds well to Hydral for elevated BP so if hypertensive
can try IV hydral.
.
ESRD: Pt receiving urgent dialysis in ICU. He was then
transitioned back onto his usual MWF HD schedule. His calcitriol
was discontinued and Sensipar 30mg daily was started per renal.

.
Cirrhosis: Abdominal distension w/o tenderness and low grade
temp to 100.7 on transfer to the medicine floor. Liver enzymes
and coags normal. Abdominal ultrasound with large volume ascitic
fluid. Given fever we did a diagnsotic para.  Paracentesis
revealed ascitic fluid with < 250 WBCs and negative G stain.
.
EKG changes: Discussed with cardiology. EKG changes likely
related to ESRD and stable LVH.
.
LE erythema/swelling: Cellulitis/ecchymoses. Blood x 3 NGTD.
Area seemed to be resolving clinically on medicine floor,
however the patient's pain remained moderate/severe. He was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage including unasyn
and vancomycin. Unasyn was discontinued do to concern of
allergic drug reaction (see below). Plain film and MRI of lower
extremity negative revealed superficial hematoma collections,
there was no eveidence of deep soft tissue infection or
osteomyelitis.
.
Respiratory distress: Patient's respiratory status quickly
improved. He no longer has an oxygen requirement.
.
Anemia: Baseline Hct in 30s. Hct trending down to 26. Likely
anemia in setting of ESRD. Now HCT stable.
.
Rash: Patient developed a macular erythematous rash involving
the neck and surrounding the RLE. Given that the patient has a
history of penicillin allergy it is likely the rash developed as
a result of the addition of unasyn to his antibiotic regimen. It
was discontinued after one day and his rash is slowly improving.
He recieved benadryl for pruritis associated with the rash.
