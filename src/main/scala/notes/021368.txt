Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for sepsis, back pain, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
History obtained from patient and records from [**Location (un) 105102**]
Hospital. The patient is felt to be a poor historian.

CC:[**CC Contact Info 105103**].
HPI:
.
The patient is an 85 year old female with a history of afib, CHF
EF 50-60%, s/p MVA ([**2127**]) -> laceration AA and colon
->colostomy, AVR s/p rheumatic fever, and CAD s/p CABG x
1(LIMA->LAD) who presented to [**Location (un) 105104**] Hospital on [**2138-4-9**]
with the chief complaint of left-sided abdominal and flank pain.
She stated that the pain radiated to her back, was associated
with nausea but no vomiting. She had eaten a meal the night
prior to admission. The patient acknowledes progressive weakness
and "not feeling well" over the past 2 weeks. Due to the
severity of her flank/abdominal pain, the patient called 911 and
was brought to [**Location (un) 105102**] Hospital.
.
She denies any constipation, diarrhea, or melena. She denied any
fevers, sick contacts and had never had a similar episode in the
past.
.
At [**Location (un) 745**]-Welseley on [**4-9**], the patient appeared toxic with a
fever to 101-102, tachycardic to 114, SBP 90->131/54 after IV
bolus. She received a total of 3 liters IVF in the ED and
continued to be hypotensive and therefore was started on neo and
transferred to the ICU. She was also placed on O2w - 6 liters,
sat'ing 100%. the patient was placed on Vanco, Zosyn and Flagyl
empirically for sepsis on [**2138-4-9**]. BCX x 3 were negative x 48
hours from [**2138-4-9**]. The patient was witnessed to have rigors.
.
A CT of her abdomen/pelvis showed :
.
CT A/P [**2138-4-9**]: No [**Doctor First Name **], masses, left transverse and left
colectomy. Right colostomy with herniation of colon in ostomy.
Residual Hartmann's pouch. Large amount of dystrophic bone
around left hip, 18 mm left adnexal cyst. No obstruction, left
renal stones, gallstones without pericholecystic fluid. 6.5 mm
stone in lower pole of left kidney. 8 mm stone in left renal
pelvis. No hydronephrosis. No AAA.
.
She was evaluated by surgery at the OSH who by report, also
performed an MRA which showed no ischemia/occlusion with known
afib (by report only through daughter-in-law).
.
In addition, she had a TTE to evaluate for endocarditis given
her prosthetic [**Doctor First Name **] which showed no vegetations. EF 55-60%.
.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

of left costophrenic diaphragm, atelectasis vs. effusion. R CVL
in place.

CT A/P [**2138-4-9**]: No [**Doctor First Name **], masses, left transverse and left
colectomy. Right colostomy with herniation of colon in ostomy.
Residual Hartmann's pouch. Large amount of dystrophic bone

No effusion, no intracardiac masses, clots/vegetations. Mild
LVH. Preserved RV and LV size and systolic function, EF 55-60%.
Bioprosthetic AVR is normally seated and functions well with
trace AI. Mild-moderate MR, TR. RV systolic pressure - 22 + CVP.

.
EKG [**2138-4-9**]: Sinus tachycardia to 112, LAD, Q waves V1-v3, poor
R wave progression, Q waves III and AVF. . TWI V6. Poor
baseline. 1st degree AV block.
.

.

After receiving fluid resuscitation in MICU and weaned off of
neo, the patient did develop CHF and diuresed over 3 liters to
10 mg IV lasix. On the same day, as the patient was transferred
to the floor, she was given an increased dose of Lopressor 25 mg
TID for afib with a systolic BP low normal 100-110s. Her BP then
dropped to 85 systolic. 2 liters of IVF were given and her BP
rose to 157. The patient was transferred back to the MICU a few
hours after her tranfer out for hypotension, ?hypoxia although
her O2 was stable at 96% on 2 liters and mental status change?
although she remained AOX3 and has known baseline mental status
deficiencies.
