Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-11-19**] to [**2170-11-22**] - Mechanical ventilation and intubation
[**2170-11-19**] to [**2170-11-20**] - Post-arrest hypothermia protocol
[**2170-11-19**] - Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y/o F with unknown PMHx who is being
admitted to the CCU after a witnessed cardiac arrest in an OSH
ED. Per report, the patient called 911 this morning after
developing acute-onset SOB at home this morning. She was noted
to be hypoxic (O2 sat 70's to 80's on CPAP) and was brought to
[**Hospital3 **] ED. Shortly after arriving in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she
had a witnessed cardiac arrest. Initial rhythm was PEA;
immediately prior to arrest, rhythm had been SR with prolonged
PR followed by slow Afib. During the arrest, she received 2 of
epi and 1 of atropine, with change of rhythm to Vfib. She then
received 2 more of epi, 1 of bicarb, 10 units IV insulin, and 2
shocks, with ROSC. Rhythm at that time was Afib with RVR. She
was intubated and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. She was
then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management. Of
note, she was also started on a diltiazem gtt for afib/rvr,
which was stopped on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer, she
did exhibit some agitation and attempted to pull her ETT, for
which she was given 3 mg ativan.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of
110's, no evidence of acute ischemia. The patient was placed on
fentanyl and versed for sedation. She was evaluated by
cardiology and bedside echo was performed. Given ? evidence of
right heart strain on echo, there was high suspicion for PE as
the etiology of the patient's arrest. She was empirically
started on heparin gtt. Given concern for potential infiltrate
on CXR, she was also empirically started on CTX/azithro. She was
difficult to ventilate [**12-27**] dyssynchrony. CVL was placed and the
patient was started on levophed to allow for increased sedation.
She underwent CTA chest prior to transfer to the CCU.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and sedated,
making further history unable to be obtained. Review of systems
was unable to be obtained.

Imaging:
-CXR ([**2170-11-19**]):
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position. No pneumothorax.
2. Multifocal opacities, most severe in the right upper lung,
concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
.
-CTA chest ([**2170-11-19**]):
Emboli within both right and left pulmonary arteries at the
segemental level. Associated scattered peripheral airspace
opacities likely reflect pulmonary infarction in the setting of
PE, however, infection cannot be excluded.
.
-TTE ([**2170-11-19**]):
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction. Small left ventricle with normal global and
regional systolic dysfunction. Unable to estimate pulmonary
pressures on this study.
.
-LENIs ([**2170-11-20**]):
No DVT; bilateral [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
- CT head noncontrast ([**11-22**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process with no evidence of hemorrhage
or mass.
2. No CT evidence of global hypoperfusion, though MRI would have
increased
sensitivity for early associated changes and can be obtained as
clinically
indicated.
3. Dilation of the bilateral right greater than left superior
ophthalmic
veins, which can be seen in the setting of carotid cavernous
fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o F with dementia and h/o VTE (not on anticoagulation at
admission) who was admitted to the CCU after a witnessed PEA
arrest in an OSH ED, with ROSC, now found to have bilateral PE's
on CT imaging.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# PEA ARREST: The patient is s/p witnessed cardiac arrest in OSH
ED (PEA -> Vfib) with ROSC. She was intubated, paralyzed,
sedated and therapeutic hypothermia protocol was initiated at
11AM on [**2170-11-19**] prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. The etiology of the
patient's arrest is most likely bilateral PE's, which were seen
on CTA imaging. She was started on a heparin gtt.  Other
etiologies which were considered include ischemia, electrolyte
abnormalities. Trop peaked at 0.67, however she received chest
compression and defibrillation prior to transfer, which could
elevate her biomarkers.  There were no EKG changes to suggest
ischemia and ACS was not though to be the cause of her arrest.
She was initially started on norepinephrine and phenylepherine
to maintain her MAP >60, phenylepherine was subsequently changed
to vasopressin.  Initially, she was noted to have a significant
metabolic acidosis with arterial pH <7.2.  She received 1amp of
bicarb followed by 1L of normal bicarbonate with improvement in
her acidemia.  Her lactate peaked at 5.3 and subsequently
trended down.
.
# Bilateral PE's: She has a history of DVT according to her PCP
who was [
