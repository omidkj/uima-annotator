Studies:
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**9-5**]:
1.  No evidence of acute process within the abdomen or pelvis.
2.  Persistent cholelithiasis.
3.  Very small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis.
.
CT Head [**2153-9-7**]
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.
2.  Unchanged (as compared with [**2144**]) multiple bony excrescences
from the skull base and cranial vault, which could represent
osteoma, dural ossification or ossified meningiomas.
.
MRI Head [**9-7**]:
Small bony irregularities of the inner table of the skull in
both
frontal and left temporal region are again noted and could
represent small
calcified/fatty degenerated meningiomas or due to osteomas as
suggested
previously.  No significant mass is seen on the adjacent brain.
Contrast-
enhanced study could not be obtained due to lack of IV access as
described
above.  No other significant abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 45yo woman with recurrent DKA amitted with episode of DKA
thought to be due to difficulty with medications.
.
# DKA:
Patient was treated in the MICU with insulin gtt and IV fluids
until her anion gap closed.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to improve
outpatient diabetic control.  Patient received diabetes
nutrition education as well as a social work consult to assist
with resources.  She stated that she found it easier to get to
appointments at [**Location **]practice where she has her
primary care, so it was decided to continue her diabetic care
through that office.  It appears that she was confused about how
to use Novolog insulin, so it was decided to put her back on a
Glargine and sliding scale regimen with Humalog.
.
# Bony abnormality on Head CT:
Incidental finding on head CT, concerning for meningioma vs
osteoma.  Patient had an MRI of head for further
characterization.  Of note, the bony abnormality appeared stable
since [**2144**].  She was advised to follow-up with Neuro-Oncology
for ?meningioma.
.
# Mental Status Change:
Upon admission, patient was confused and lethargic.  She had a
CT of her head, which was significant only for the bony
abnormality listed above.  Her confusion resolved once her
diabetes was controlled, and was felt to be due to DKA.
.
# Leukocytosis:
On admission, patient had a leukocytosis as well as exam
concerning for abdominal pathology.  She was placed on cipro and
flagyl to treat a possible infectious cause of her DKA.  Once
UCx, Blood Cx, CT abdomen and pelvis all negative and white
count was trending down, her antibiotics were stopped.  She
remained afebrile with normal WBC off antibiotics.
.
# Sinus Tachycardia:
Patient had sinus tachycardia on admission felt to be due to
dehydration in the setting of DKA.  She was given IV fluids.
Her heart rate remained high in the 90s during most of her
admission, and TSH was notable for being at the very low end of
the normal range.  As TSH is difficult to interpret in a sick
patient, it was suggested that her PCP obtain [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**] of her
TSH level in the future.
.
# HTN, Dyslipidemia, GERD:
Not active issues during her hospitalization.  Her home
lisinopril, atorvastatin, ASA, and PPI were given.
.
# FEN:
Patient required potassium repletion for her DKA.
