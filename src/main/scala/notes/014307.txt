History of Present Illness:
55yoWM with h/o hypocellular MDS presenting with fevers. MDS was
diagnosed in [**6-/2180**] and initially treated with danazol and
aranesp. In [**6-/2181**] patient was hospitalized for bilateral lung
aspergillus infection and enterobacter bacteremia. Port-o-cath

infection, including discharge [**2181-12-14**] with Staph epi
infection.  Most recent admission was [**Date range (1) 34838**]/05 with pneumonia
and bacteremia with Stenotrophomonus treated with a course of
bactrim and port-o-cath removal.  During this course, pulmonary
nodules were visualized and the patient was treated empirically
with voriconazole
.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old man with MDS who was initially admitted with febrile
neutropenia and coag + staph blood cultures (micrococcus sp.),
who was subsequently transferred to the ICU for increasing
respiratory distress and multi-focal pneumonia. A brief
[**Hospital 11822**] hospital course is outlined below.

1. Respiratory Distress/Multi-focal pneumoina- Mr. [**Known lastname 34834**] was
found to have a multi-focal pneumonia by chest x-ray. His
respiratory distress was felt secondary to this underlying
process and he was treated with broad antibiotics given his
neutropenic status. Of note, chest CT had also been performed
and was negative for PE. Ultimately he was placed on vancomycin
(gram positive coverage), meripenem (gram negatives/anaerobes),
azithromycin (atypicals) and caspofungin/voriconazole (fungal)
empiric coverage. He was also initially placed on treatment dose
bactrim empirically for PCP. (He also had a history of
stenotrophomonas VAP for which bactrim would be the treatment of
choice). Induced sputum cultures returned negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
continuation of bactrim was not felt indicated per ID
recommendations. Initial thought had been given to intubation to
help with oxygenation and for diagnostic bronchoscopy, however
the patient adamantly requested not to be intubated if at all
possible (although he was maintained as Full Code as he would
want intubation if needed emergently). He was maintained on
aggressive oxygen support with NRB face mask with maintainence
of O2 sats >93%. Throughout this initial stage, he appeared
fairly well clinically, without persistent fever, chills or
shortness of breath. His breathing remained unlabored despite
his high O2 requirement. Serial ABG's showed persistent PaO2's
>50% (after initial PaO2 of 44%) with stable CO2 ranging from
42-48 and pH ranging from 7.40-7.47. Subsequently, he did begin
to have more subjective dyspnea with desaturations requiring
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Repeat CXR at this
time showed worsening multi-focal pneumonia. However, his CXR
still seemed out of proportion to his clinical status.
Unfortunately all sputum cultures had returned negative, so we
were unable to tailor therapy appropriately. It was felt that
broad antibiotic coverage should continue since the differential
remained broad, however fungal etiology was highly suspected, as
was possible gram positive pneumonia (especially given positive
blood and urine cultures for MRSE). Therefore he was placed on
double anti-fungal coverage as outlined above. Vanco dose was
tapered up for goal trough levels of 20 for greater pulmonary
penetration. His respiratory status did slowly begun to improve.
He was weaned back off of positive pressure support, and then
off of NRB face mask, with maintenance of oxygenation on nasal
cannulation upon transfer back to the bone marrow transplant
service on [**4-21**].  He continued to improve on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] floor, with
diuresis progressing successfully with lasix prn, and with O2
requirement improving desp
