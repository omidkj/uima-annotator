History of Present Illness:
48 yo male with h/o severe COPD (requiring multiple
intubations), diastolic CHF (EF 60% from [**2-/2122**]), CAD with
reported prior MI,

and hx of non-compliance, presented to ED today with shortness
of breath and 3 hours of pleuritic substernal chest pain. On
arrival to the ED, he was in acute distress with peripheral sat
of 74% on room air, breathing 30-40 times per minute, with
SBP=120, and having difficulty speaking. He improved to 100% on
a NRB mask and was A&OX3 and able to relate part of his medical
hx. EKG showing non-specific T-wave changes. The initial
impression of the ED staff was that this pt was in heart failure
given his hx and a CXR which they felt was c/w pulm edema. Lung
exam was notable for diffuse wheezes. He was given lasix, 325
ASA, nitro (SL + drip) and nebs. He was switched from NRB to
non-invasive BiPAP for concern over increasing effort to
breathe, 15 minutes later, pt was intubated and sent for CTA of
the Chest. This was negative for PE but showed extensive
atelectasis of right lung, which ED interpreted as infectious.

Given this finding, a low BNP, and his deteriorating condition
(possible hypothermia), ED favored sepsis over CHF and fluid
rescucitated him. A RIJ central line was placed which entered
the right subclavian; this was removed and replaced with a right
femoral line. A repeat chest x-ray was markedly different from
his first CXR hours before showing new mediastinal shift to the
right and new diffuse right sided opacities. He was given
vanco/zosyn and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with MAP=67 on levophed,
HR=67, T=94.6 axillary.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], T=97.0, BP= 106/63, HR=75, Peripheral
Sat= 100% on AC 550, r=15, peep=5, FiO2=50%. On 0.06 of
levophed, intubated and sedated with fentanyl/midazolam.


Past Medical History:

BIPAP. Not on home O2 due to insurance issues.
Diastolic CHF, followed at Sea Coast Cardiology in [**Location (un) 3844**]

called this Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12838**], there was no record of patient.
Diverticulosis
Diabetes Mellitus
GERD

Social History:
He is married, but his wife resides in a state psychiatric
facility. He currently lives alone in CT. He is on disability.
History of smoking with unknown # of pk years, currently denies
smoking, ETOH, or recreational drug use.


Family History:
Father had emphysema, died of an MI at age 56. Mother died of an
MI at age 70. Otherwise non-contributory.

RESP: diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but good air
movement throughout

STUDIES:
ECHO:
LAST ECHO: [**2-/2122**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal

(LVEF 60%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.


ECG:
[**5-21**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse ST-T wave
changes which are non-specific.
[**5-22**]: Sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 no significant
diagnostic change
[**5-23**]: Marked sinus bradycardia Prolonged QT interval
Since previous tracing of [**2123-5-22**], the heart rate is slower, the
QT interval is longer


IMAGING:
[**5-22**] CTA:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No pulmonary embolism seen.
2. Atelectasis of the right upper and lower lobes and also
partially the right middle lobe.
3. Mosaic appearance of the left lung likely due to air trapping
rather than a perfusion abnormality.
4. OT tube terminates in the distal esophagus and needs to be
advanced. Mildly dilated stomach.


[**5-24**]: Portable CXR
Right upper lobe middle atelectasis has increased as it did
atelectasis in the right mid lung at the periphery. Right
perihilar right lower lobe medially and left lower lobe medial
atelectases are unchanged. There are no increasing pleural
effusions. ET tube is high. The tip is 9 cm above the carina; it
should be advanced for standard position. NG tube tip is in the
stomach


MICROBIOLOGY:
[**5-22**]: blood cultures neg to date
[**5-22**]: BAL, no microorganisms, no Legionella
[**5-22**]: viral panel neg
[**5-24**]: ET sputum, neg


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 yo male with an unclear medical history including
COPD previously requiring intubation, alleged CAD s/p MI, and
diastolic CHF presenting with chest pain and in respiratory
distress with progressive opacification and volume loss of the
right lung field likely secondary to aspiration vs. mucus
plugging which evolved while in the ED (likely during
intubation).

#) COPD:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the ED already intubated
for COPD/Asthma and peri-intubational hypotension.  He was
mechanically ventilated for 3 days, with extubation delayed due
to difficulties in sedation and mental status while on the vent.
 He was started on Corticosteroids, MDIs,
Levofloxacin->Azithromycin while intubated.  He developed
asymptomatic sinus bradycardia which was attributed variously to
his sedation, intubation and steroid course. On the morning of
day 3, the patient self-extubated and was started on a NRB.  He
was transitioned to Nasal cannula as his sensorium cleared
throughout the day.  Almost within minutes of self-extubation he
requested to leave AMA. The following day the patient cleared
and was transferred to the medical floor for further work up.

When arriving to the floor, the patient remained in notable
respiratory distress with increased work of breathing and unable
to complete sentences.  However, he was able to maintain his O2
saturation with supplemental nasal cannula oxygen. It was
recommended to the patient to treat his COPD flare with
prednisone, ipratroprium and albuterol nebulizers. However, the
patient refused prednisone because it reportedly makes him crazy
and refused ipratropium as he was reportedly told it is bad for
his heart. The patient used albuterol nebulizers and inhalers
and levalbuterol. He gradually improved with decreased work of
breathing and tolerated being weaned down on supplemental
oxygen. He attempted to leave the evening of [**5-30**] and was
evaluated by psychiatry who deemed him to have the capacity to
leave AMA, but he decided to stay until the morning. The
following morning, he demanded to leave AMA and left the floor
walking with a cane under his own power with no supplemental
oxygen in no apparent distress. He refused to sign an AMA form
but acknowledged understanding the risks of leaving against
medical advice including permanent physical impairment and
death.
