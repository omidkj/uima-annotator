Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
PEG placement
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
Initial admission to surgery:
75yM who underwent c-scope on [**2144-8-28**].  He returned that night
after dinner with abdominal pain.  Found to have
pneumoperitoneum.  Initially treated conservatively but failed
the following morning, taken to the OR for Exlap.  Transverse
colon 1 cm perforation found which was repaired with a stapled
primary repair as well as diverting ileostomy.  Postop had
difficult course including: Paroxysmal Afib, malnutrition on
TPN, delirium, and repeated mucous plugging requiring
reintubation and bronchoscopy.  He was tranferred here per the
family request.
.
On transfer to floor:
75 yo with PMH of CAD, infrarenal AAA, HTN, hemochromatosis,
dementia/delerium was transferred from OSH on [**9-16**] after he had
a complicated hospital course for iatrogenic colonic perforation
[**12-24**] colonoscopy, s/p primary repair with diverting ileostomy. He
had multiple organisms grew from blood culture and sputum
culture (E. Coli, pseudomonas, coag neg staph, alpha srep, etc.)
for which he has been treated with multiple abx (cefepime,
vancomycin, cipro, levofloxacin). pt is s/p trach on [**9-21**], PEG
and IVC placement on [**9-25**]. No significant hemodynamic
instability during precedures, but his SBP became lower over the
past 2-3 days (120-130 -> 90-100's). Found to have new developed
RLL PNA yesterday. His creatinine was elevated to 2.2 on
admission [**9-16**], improved to 1.4. However, it started to elevate
again since [**10-1**], up to 3.0 today. UOP started decreasing at
the same time to 400-500ml/day. Large amount of ileostomy output
1-2L/day. No contrast or NSAIDs exposure. As per his wife, his
had normal renal funciton before his complicated medical events.
On transfer, he continued to have persistent altered mental
status with minimal responsiveness, per wife this has been
ongoing since outside hospital. Thought to be combination of
anoxic brain injury / toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the
setting of normal LP, CT scan and EEG, with concomitant uremia,
hypoactive delirium, and infection exacerbating.

[**2144-9-17**]:  EEG:

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry due
to a
low amplitude, poorly organized slow delta frequency background
with
very low variability. This represents a severe encephalopathy.
There
were no clear epileptiform discharges or organized seizures seen


[**2144-9-17**]:  Cat scan of head:

No acute intracranial process

[**2144-9-18**]:  EEG:

IMPRESSION: This 24-hour EEG video telemetry was abnormal due to
a
generally slow background rhythm and bursts of generalized
slowing,
which indicate a moderate to severe encephalopathy which may be
due to
diffuse ischemic, toxic/metabolic, infectious, or other
etiologies.
There were no clear epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures seen

[**2144-9-19**]:  EEG:

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
presence
of a slow background which reached a maximum of 6 Hz, as well as
bursts
of generalized slowing, indicative of a moderate to severe
encephalopathy, which may be due to diffuse ischemic,
toxic/metabolic,
infectious, or other etiologies. There were no clear
epileptiform
features or electrographic seizures noted

[**2144-9-19**]:  Ultrasound lower extremities:

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. Diffuse soft tissue edema

[**2144-9-22**]:  Chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], the monitoring
and support
devices remain in place. Relatively low lung volumes persist.
Opacification at the bases most likely represent a combination
of pleural effusion and atelectasis.

No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion

[**2144-9-22**]:  Cat scan of the head:

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is well preserved.
There is no mass, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent in size and
configuration likely due to age-related global atrophy, si
