Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the
LA. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA. Good (>20
cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately
depressed LVEF. Doppler parameters are most consistent with
Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
thickening of mitral valve chordae. No MS. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**1-12**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient is in a
ventricularly paced rhythm. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for
post-bypass data

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the inferor and anterolateral walls There is
akinesis of the apex. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40% %). Doppler parameters are
most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on epinephrine, milrinone, and
norepinephrine infusions. There is a bioprosthetic valve in the
aortic position. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
peak gradient of 17 mmHg and a mean gradient 10 mmHg across the
aortic valve with a cardiac output of 6.1 L/min. There is a
mitral annuloplasty ring in place. Trace mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a peak gradient of 6 mmHg with a mean gradient of
3mmHg across the mitral valve at a cardiac output of 6.4 L/min.
Left ventricular function is slightly improved (LVEF 40-45%
