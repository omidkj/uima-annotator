Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with recurrent stage IIIB nonsmall cell lung CA s/p
resection '[**15**] and then pleurodesis in [**2127-10-3**] (O2 dependent at
baseline) presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with increasing shortness
of breath.  Patient has been dependent on 2L of O2 since her
pleurodesis in [**Month (only) 359**]. She is comfortable at rest but has
dyspnea with minimal exertion. On the day of admission she
complained of dyspnea at rest beginning at 8 pm. O2 sat per
report was 70%s on 2L. RR was 30s. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] ED.

Upon arrival to the ED, she was having difficulty speaking in
full sentences.  ABG 7.24/87/87/36.  She was placed on CPAP with
improvement in her respiratory status.  Repeat ABG
7.27/81/155/39.  She was also noted to be hypertensive with SBP
in the low 200's.  She was given IV Hydral 10 mg and placed on a
Nitro gtt with improvement in BP to the 160's, however, her BP
decreased to the low 100's when CPAP was started.  Pt expressed
to the ED resident that she did not wish to be intubated,
however, wanted aggressive cardiac resuscitation.  CXR revealed
near-total opacification of the left hemithorax.  BNP was 58.
She was given broad spectrum ABX (Vanco/Levo/Flagyl) for
suspected post-obstructive PNA.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was on 100% nonrebreather
breathing at 30-35 breaths/minute. ABG was 7.25/92/101. At that
point the patient expressed that she did not wish to be
intubated. She agreed to bipap but only if it was comfortable to
her. Goals of care were discussed with the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(her PCP) and the ICU attending and agreement was for comfort to
be the ultimate goal.


Past Medical History:
1. Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2115**] and s/p left
lower lobectomy. Followed with cxr until [**7-1**] when pt developed
cough and DOE. In [**8-1**] CXR showed a new pleural density. CT
guided biopsy was non diagnostic. In [**Month (only) 359**] a new effusion was
present and a diagnostic and theraputic thoracentesis and
pleurodesis was performed which showed non small cell lung
cancer. A PET scan was obtained in [**Month (only) **] which showed uptake
in the mediastinal and paraaortic lymph nodes, as well as
peri-renal area. Patient was started felt not to be a candidate
for chemotherapy and was started on tarceva several days prior
to admission.
2. Osteopenia.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Obesity.
5. Hypertension.
6. Urinary tract infections.
7. Irritable bowel syndrome.
8. Pap smear, [**2127-8-26**], not satisfactory for interpretation,
mammogram, [**7-1**], normal.

Social History:
Patient is married. Her husband is  living at the [**Hospital1 **] due to Parkinson's disease and moderate dementia. Until
recently, the patient visited him daily, however, several weeks
ago, due to progressive dyspnea she moved into [**Hospital 100**] Rehab as
well. She had worked as a secretary,  and her husband is a
retired grocer. They deny any occupational or environmental
exposures. She smoked two packs a day for 50 years and quit in
[**2115**]. She does not use alcohol or other drugs. Patient has a son
in [**Name (NI) **] who is not very involved in her care.


Family History:
Her mother died in her 90s from old age, and father died at 72
from a CVA. She does not have any brothers or sisters. There is
no other malignancy in the family except for maternal
grandmother with a history of breast cancer.

.
CXR [**2127-11-18**]: Interval near-total opacification of the left
hemithorax, likely secondary to pleural effusion and soft tissue
density, perhaps secondary to the patient's history of
metastatic disease. Interval worsening of congestive heart
failure with increased size of bilateral pleural effusions.
.
PET [**2127-10-21**]: Findings consistent with left lung cancer and left
pleurodesis.  FDG-avid lymph nodes in AP window (SUV 11.9), left
internal mammary (SUV 9.3), left & right hila (SUV 8.2, 7.6),
pre-cardiac (SUV 6.7) and likely para-aortic (SUV 8.0) at the
level of the upper pole to the left kidney.
.
PFT's [**2127-9-18**]: Results are consistent with a restrictive
ventilatory defect. Since [**11/2115**], FVC has decreased 1.55 L (58%)
and FEV1 has decreased 1.29 L (64%).
.
MIBI [**2127-6-18**]: Normal myocardial perfusion study.  Calculated
ejection fraction of 74%.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  76 yo F with recurrent stage IIIB nonsmall cell lung CA
s/p resection '[**15**] and then pleurodesis in [**10-1**] presents with
increasing shortness of breath.

Shortness of Breath resulting in hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory
failure secondary to worsening nonsmall cell lung CA, increased
pleural effusion, and possible post-obstructive PNA.  Pt's
respiratory status improved with CPAP, however, pt continues to
be acidemic with Bicarb of 81. Patient is not tolerating CPAP
due to discomfort and expresses the wish to remain comfortable.
Patient met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the ICU attending and
goals of care were discussed. It was explained that without
intubation the patient would not be able to maintain oxygenation
and ventilation. In addition, as she has a reaccumulating
malignant effusion, there is little likelihood that her
respiratory status could be reversed. Patient expressed the wish
to be made comfortable. Her husband, [**Name (NI) 13624**], came to visit from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab along with the patient's social worker. The social
worker felt that the patient would be most comfortable at [**Hospital1 100**]
Rehabiliation Center. Therefore, she is being transfered to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab with a goal of comfort care at the end of life.
