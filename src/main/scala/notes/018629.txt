Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral lower extremity swelling.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-26**] knee washout, plastic removed but metal left in.

History of Present Illness:
76 yo man w/ hx of CKD, DM2, HTN, COPD, who presents to the ED
for increasing swelling and redness to b/l LE (L>R) and SOB
w/productive cough w/yellowish sputum that has been worsening
over the last 1-1.5wks. In ED patient reported weight gain of 15
pounds in last two weeks and bilateral lower extremity swelling.
In addition had fever to 101.5 at home, increased sputum, cough,
slight hemoptysis and yellow phlegm. Also had worsening DOE to
the point that he could not get out of his wheel chair.

In ED he was given Vanc and neb X 1. CXR showed CM but no PNA.
LENI's unable to r/o DVT, though unlikely.

On the floor,  patient was given vanc, ctx, azithro to cover CAP
and a cellulitis/septic arthritis. Ortho planned to take patient
to OR [**8-26**] for washout and hardware change given may be septic
joint. Patient initially had low-grade fever to 99.9 with BPs
ranging 140s-170s/70a, HR 90s. Initial O2 sat was 95% on RA. He
received amytriptline (150mg), gabapentin (300mg) and a dose of
2 mg Iv morphine at 2200. At ~ 1am NF was called for
tachypnea/respiratory distress. Patient was breathing at 30 with
new O2 requirement (91% on RA 97% on 2L NC). Felt still SOB as
he did when he came in but was not initially altered. Got a neb
and labs were sent including ABG which revealed: PH 7.4/ PCO 40/
PO2 62. (abgs from [**2132**] on with O2 mas as only 70s with pH 7.4
when PCO2 is 40). Patient thought to have acute CHF exacerbation
and given 80mg IV lasix with good UOP but no improvement in
breathing. Given worry about patients MS (which had waned down
over the course of the NF evaluation) and hypoxia he was
transferred to the ICU.

IMAGING
ECHO ([**8-27**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-4-28**], the
findings are similar.

CXR ([**8-28**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
2. Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta, stable.
3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia/Shortness of breath: Must likely multifactorial in
etiology: with contribution from underlying COPD (wheezing and
short expiratory phase on exam), CHF given elevated BNP and
fluid on CXR, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome given body
habitus, and ?pneumonia though CXR without focal infiltrate.
Patient empirically treated for PNA given WBC count with broad
spectrum antibiotics:vanc/ctx/azithro.  Given IV solumedrol and
a prednisone taper for COPD. Home lasix initially held due to
acute on chronic kidney failure. In house CXR with mild vascular
congestion. As [**Last Name (un) **] improved home lasix/metolazone restarted and
patient diuresised well. With treatment of COPD, CHF and ?PNA
symptoms improved and patient weaned off supplemental oxygen
prior to discharge; completed predisone taper. Foley was left in
place in our for rehab facility to adequately monitor I/O.

# Septic Left knee/right left extremity cellulitis. Patient
found to have erythematous and tender left knee as well as
possible cellulitis of posterior right calf. Patient taken to OR
by ortho for washout of left knee by Dr. [*
