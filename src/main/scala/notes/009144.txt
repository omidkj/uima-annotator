Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 49413**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, fever, and pulmonary embolus.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 34 year old female with a history of SLE, lupus
nephritis with massive proteinuria, and pulmonary emboli as well
as DVT, who presented on [**11-2**] with two days of sharp, left
sided chest pain. She first started to feel unwell after her
rituximab infusion on the Friday prior to admission (this
represented her second dose of rituximab; first dose in [**9-19**]
was complicated by hypertension and facial swelling). She had
chills, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On the day
prior to admission, she awoke with constant, non-pleuritic, left
sided shoulder/chest/back pain, worsened by movement and
coughing. At that time she denied shortness of breath or
dyspnea. Moreover, she noticed a fever to 101.9. Concerned, she
came to the ED.
.
In the ED, she admitted to having symptoms of a typical lupus
flare for her. These included rash on her hands, swelling of her
face and legs, and pains in her feet, legs, and fingers. She
noted that her INR had been much more difficult to manage
recently, and she attributed this to the concurrent lupus flare.
Her VS: 100.3, 149/92, 124, 24, 99% on RA. Blood and urine
cultures were sent. She was given levofloxacin 500mg for
possible pneumonia based on CXR and started on a heparin gtt
based on the findings of new pulmonary emboli on CTA. She
received 1L NS. She was also given morphine for pain, tylenol
for fever, and anzemet for nausea. A CT chest demonstrated
bilateral lower pulmonary embolis. LENIs were negative for DVT.
She was transferred to the MICU for observation.
.
During her MICU stay, heme/onc was consulted given her
complicated history. She was maintained on a heparin gtt.
Prednisone was started for her lupus, and she was maintained on
her hydroxychloroquine. She was also given azithromicin and
ceftriaxone for several days for possible community acquired
pneumonia. She remained clinically stable and was transferred to
the floor.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient feels well, although she still
complains of slight left chest/shoulder pain, that was worse
with deep inspiration.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CXray ([**2104-11-6**]):  Bilateral pleural effusions with L>R.
.
Cxray ([**2104-11-2**]):  New consolidation in left lower lobe with
possible effusion, and new faint patchy opacity in right lower
lobe.  The findings are concerning for pneumonia in this patient
with fever.  Alternatively, thromboembolic disease with
parenchymal opacity versus infarction cannot be excluded in this
patient with right jugular venous thrombosis.  Evaluation by CT
study is recommended.
.
CT chest ([**2104-11-2**]):  1.  Bilateral segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli within the lower lobes more prominent on the
right.  Bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusions within the
lower lung fields. 2.  Stable bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy
consistent with patient's known lupus.  3.  Stable pulmonary
nodule.
.
Bilateral Lower Extremity U/S ([**2104-11-2**]):  Negative bilateral
lower extremity DVT study.
.
Bilateral Upper Extremity U/S ([**2104-11-3**]):   No evidence of
bilateral upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Mild edema
within the subcutaneous soft tissues.
.
Cardiac Echo ([**2104-11-3**]):  The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-10-8**],
the heart rate is lower, left ventricular systolic function is
now low normal, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is slightly higher. Right ventricular cavity size and
free wall motion remain normal.
Based on [**2094**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.
