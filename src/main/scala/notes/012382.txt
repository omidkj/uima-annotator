Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-11-23**]: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery x 3 with LIMA -->
LAD, reverse saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, posterior
descending artery, tissue aortic valve replacement


History of Present Illness:
89 yo male has had a year of decreasing exercise tolerance. This
has progressed at a faster pace in the past few months and he
has had to stop walking the 9
hole golf course, dancing and walking his several miles daily.
Echo has previously demonstarted critical AS, preserved LV and
mod-severe pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for right and
left heart catherization which revealed a three-vessel coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA had a 60% calcified stenosis.  The LAD
was heavily calcified with a long 80% proximal stenosis.  The
LCX had an 80% stenosis at its origin.  OM1 had an 80% proximal
stenosis.  The RCA was 100% occluded in the proximal segment
with left to right and right to right collaterals supplying the
distal vessel. He was scheduled for aortic valve replacement and
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis throughout. The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-18**]+) central mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Post Bypass: A tissue prosthesis is seen in the aortic poisition
which appears well seated. No AI. Peak gradient 27, mean 18 mm
Hg with cardiac index 2.2. No perivalvular leaks seen. LVEF and
wall motion unchanged. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo admitted with progressive shortness of breath for right
and left heart catherization - previous echo has previously
demonstarted critical AS, preserved LV and mod-severe pulmonary
hypertension.  The catherization revealed 3 vessel coronary
artery disease and the patient was taken to the operating room
for a coronary artery graft bypass surgery and aortic valve
replacement.

The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and an aortic
valve replacement on [**2168-11-23**].  Total bypass time 114 minutes,
cross clamp time 92 minutes.  See operative note for full
details.  The patient was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on Neosynephrine and propofol.  The Neosynephrine was
weaned off postoperative day 1 and the patient was extubated
that morning without incident.  He was started on beta blockers,
which were titrated up for better blood pressure control.  He
became somewhat disoriented with Percocet and all narcotics were
discontinued.  Neurology was consulted secondary to confusion
and word finding issues.  Head CT was done and was negative for
acute ischemic event.  Mental status was back to baseline at the
time of discharge.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac
surgery protocol.  He went into a rate controlled atrial
fibrillation on post operative day 3.  Amiodarone was given as a
bolus and he was started on po amiodarone as well as continued
on beta blockers. Amio discontinued for a 1.9 sec pause. He was
started on low dose coumadin on post operative day 5 for atrial
fibrillation greater than 48 hours.Cleared for discharge to
rehab on POD #6.
Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A Fib.
