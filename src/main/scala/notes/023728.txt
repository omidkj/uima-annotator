This is an addendum to the discharge summary dictated
[**2176-12-13**].

Since that discharge summary the patient remained in the
hospital secondary to inability to transfer.  However, there
were a number of new issues that occurred during these few
days.

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate:  The
patient had an episode upon returning fro dialysis with rapid
atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate greater then 150
beats per minute.  The patient had one episode earlier in her
course while in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was
rate controlled with intravenous Lopressor as well as
intravenous Diltiazem and subsequently spontaneously
converted to normal sinus rhythm and has remained so for 24
hours at the time of this discharge summary.  The patient was
not to be placed on anticoagulation secondary to her
underlying coagulopathy.

2.  Low grade DIC:  Throughout her course the patient has had
low platelets and a slowly dropping hematocrit.  Over the
last couple of days the patient with INR that was elevated at
times greater then 2 and a T bili that was rising from 2.3 to
4.1.  For this reason hematology was consulted regarding
possible DIC secondary to the patient's malignancy.
Hematology felt that with a normal fibrinogen and fibrin ____
products this could be low grade DIC, but it was not
clinically significant and therefore there was no specific
treatment.

3.  Delirium:  The patient's mental status waxed and waned
throughout her admission and had improved somewhat at the
time of the last summary.  Had deteriorated somewhat in the
last few days.  The patient did receive a dose of steroids on
Saturday [**12-14**] and it was felt this may have
contributed.  However, it is most likely secondary to the
patient's illness possibly to her DIC.

4.  Coag negative staph bacteremia:  The patient will be
treated with Vancomycin for a total of fourteen days after
her left hemodialysis catheter had been pulled.  At the time
of this dictation the patient is on day seven of fourteen.
She is being dosed 1 gram for Vancomycin level less then 15.
At the time of this dictation on [**12-17**] the patient's
Vancomycin level is pending.  If it is less then 15 the
patient will receive a dose of Vancomycin.  If it is not then
the patient will need levels subsequent days and dosed
accordingly.

5.  Hemodialysis:  The patient will need hemodialysis on a
Monday, Wednesday and Friday schedule.
