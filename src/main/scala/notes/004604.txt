History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old man with a diabetes, squamous cell
carcinoma of the neck s/p resection, hypertension, coronary
artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, and anemia who presented
to [**Hospital6 3105**] with a syncopal episode on [**2199-8-27**].
Prior to this event, he had been complaining of worsening lower
extremity edema, dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea for two
months. On [**2199-8-27**], he was bending forward when he fell over and
hit the floor with his head. At [**Hospital6 3105**], CT
head without contrast [**Hospital6 3780**] stable volume loss and
microvascular ischemic changes but no acute changes. An
echocardiogram performed at [**Hospital6 3105**] on
[**2199-8-28**], which [**Date Range 3780**] mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with an ejectino fraction of 55%, severe aortic
stenosis 0.64 cm2, and mean gradient 57 mmHg. Cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**2199-8-30**] with visualization of
clean grafts.
Upon presentation to [**Hospital6 3105**], he was found to
have acute on chronic kidney injury with a creatinine of 2.2.
Lisinopril and lasix were held, and the creatinine downtrended
to 1.4 upon discharge. Upon presentation, he was also found to
be anemic with iron deficiency anemia (ferritin of 7). Fecal
occult blood was positive, and he was scheduled for a
colonoscopy. Febrile to 101 degrees on [**9-1**], and was started on
vancomycin and levaquin for pneumonia as a chest film
[**Month/Year (2) 3780**] a right basilar infiltrate. Also of note, on [**9-1**]
he went into atrial fibrillation and metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was
restarted.

Upon arrival to the floor at [**Hospital1 18**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tachycardic to
130's in atrial fibrillation. He was also borderline febrile to
100. Otherwise, he was oxygenating well and was hemodynamically
stable. He complained of pleuritic right sided chest pain, but
was otherwise without complaint.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the
LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s)
LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF. TDI E/e'
>15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. Doppler parameters are most
consistent with c/w Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function. TASPE normal (>=1.6cm)

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex
(mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data
