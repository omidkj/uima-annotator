Chief Complaint:
abd pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement, R subclavian

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M w/ ILD, AVR who presented to the ED [**2145-8-17**] c/o abd
pain. He was in his USOH until he was driving home from his
Cardiology appointment and developed BLQ abd pain. He reported
eating raw clams earlier in the day. He became nauseous and
vomited 3 times (non-bloody) and had one episode of diarrhea.
Also noted SOB but denied any cough or chest pain. Also had
chills, no fevers.
.
In ED, he was initially tachycardic at 131, temp 99.5, bp
105/59, RR 20, 97% 2L. He spiked to 101.2 and was given levoflox
500 mg IV. His BP drifted down to 85/41, 78/palp-->66 at which
point he was confused. Lactate level was 2.8. CXR revealed a LLL
infiltrate. At this point a code sepsis was initiated and he was
begun on levophed. He was given vancomycin 1g and 6L NS. R SC
CVL was placed. Initial CVP 8-10, mixed venous 71. He was
admitted to the MICU on the sepsis protocol.
.
MICU Course:
Patient was off pressors since arrival to the MICU. He remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile on levofloxacin. He has been
auto diuresing.
.
Patient was transferred to medicine service on [**8-20**] and was
feeling well. He complained of abdominal pain with palpation. He
is tolerating PO diet and has not had episodes of emesis or
diarrhea since admission. He is guiaic positive with Hct 32 but
stable. Cardiac enzymes were noted for slightly elevated tropI
0.03 on [**8-19**], normal CK-MB. He was afebrile with normal WBC
count. He had mild SOB while laying flat. Denied fevers, chills,

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT [**2145-8-17**]
IMPRESSION: Properly positioned new right CV line. Bilateral
loculated pleural effusions that are stable. Bilateral
atelectasis and worsening pulmonary edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-8-17**] 5:57 PM
IMPRESSION: 1) Interval improvement in pulmonary edema compared
to [**2144-2-27**] with persistent bilateral interstitial opacities.
These are present on the preoperative study performed on [**2144-2-19**],
suggesting that they represent chronic changes.

2) There is loss of the definition of the left hemidiaphragm
suggestive of a left lower lobe process.

3) Density at the left lateral hemithorax with a sharp linear
border is unchanged compared to the preoperative studies dated
[**2144-2-19**]. Possibly representing loculated pleural fluid or pleural
thickening.

EKG [**2145-8-17**]
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-2-24**]
the rate is now faster.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2145-8-20**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are diffuse
interstitial opacities in both lower lobes with a peripheral
predominance with areas of subpleural honeycombing. Calcified
pleural plaques are seen in the right lung base posteriorly.
Extensive pleural fat deposition is present.

There are no pleural or pericardial effusions. There is a vague
area of decreased density within the left medial lobe of the
liver inferiorly (segment IVB), which is located anteriorly just
to the right of the gallbladder which measures 15 x 18 mm, and
is incompletely assessed. Several tiny calcifications are seen
in the periphery of the spleen. The gallbladder, adrenal glands,
pancreas, stomach, and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There
is no ascites or pathological mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymph node enlargement. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically and
homogeneously without evidence of focal mass or obstruction. No
intra-abdominal collection is identified.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse
diverticulosis but no evidence of acute diverticulitis. Distal
ureters and bladder are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in
the pelvis or pathological inguinal or pelvic lymph node
enlargement. Note is made of bilateral fat containing inguinal
hernias, left greater than right.

There is diffuse demineralization and degenerative changes in
the spine. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Vague round low density lesion in segment IVB of liver,
incompletely assessed. Further evaluation with ultrasound is
reccommended.
2. No other evidence of intraabdominal infection.
3. Multiple hepatic granulomas.
4. Diffuse interstitial lung disease in both lung bases with
calcified pleural plaques and extensive fat deposition in the
subpleural space. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary
fibrosis and asbestosis.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2145-8-20**] 5:20 PM
PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY: Patient is status post median
sternotomy with the prosthetic aortic valve in stable position.
The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
stable. There is decreased pulmonary edema compared with prior
exam. Stable interstitial opacities are seen diffusely and
bilaterally. There is circumferential pleural thickening
bilaterally, with nodularity at the right lung apex. Increased
opacity in the left lower lung is likely related is to the
surrounding pleural thickening. The surrounding soft tissue and
osseous structures are stable.
.
There has been interval removal of a right subclavian central
venous catheter. No pneumothorax is seen.
.
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o M w/interstitial lung disease on chronic steroids who
presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.
.
# SIRS w/sepsis:
Patient's clinical status improved quickly with antibiotics and
fluids. It is possible that the patient may have had a
viral/bacterial gastroenteritis resulting in sepsis. This ca
