CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral blue toes

Information was obtained from chart review and the patient,
who is reliable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old white male
with a history of carotid disease, status post right internal
carotid artery stenting in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year, known coronary
artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, who
was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for "blue toes".  He was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2132-6-10**].  He gives a 10 year history of
bilateral calf claudication.  At one block, he denies rest
pain with onset of blue toes, left greater than right, one
week ago.  The patient is to undergo arteriogram and then be
admitted over night for observation.  The patient was
evaluated by cardiology prior to discharge.  Their
recommendations were that a P-MIBI was optional, given the
patient has had recent revascularization and he is
asymptomatic and subsequently decreased his amount of
smoking.  Recommendations were to discontinue the Plavix five
days prior to surgery, follow electrocardiograms and cycle
enzymes postoperatively.  The patient returns now for
elective revascularization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Non Q wave myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year with
subsequent coronary artery bypass x5 with a left internal
mammary artery to LAD and saphenous to the left PDA and
saphenous to the obtuse marginal and diagonal on [**2132-4-21**].
3.  History of carotid stenosis, status post stenting of the
right internal carotid artery on [**2132-4-17**] with a recently
diagnosed subclavian steal syndrome on the right.
4.  History of transient ischemic attacks
5.  History of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of
30%
6.  History of insulin dependent diabetes
7.  History of hypertension
8.  History of peripheral vascular disease
9.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
10. History of mild mitral regurgitation
11. History of dyslipidemia
12. History of prostate carcinoma

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glipizide XL 5 mg qd
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Pravastatin 10 mg qd
4.  Plavix 75 mg qd
5.  Aspirin 325 mg qd
6.  Ambien 5 mg at hs prn
7.  Levaquin 500 mg qd

PREOPERATIVE LAB WORK:  White count 8.5, hematocrit 39.5,
platelets 320,000.  INR, PTT, PT were all normal.  BUN 27,
creatinine 1.1, potassium 4.6.

Cardiac catheterization prior to coronary artery surgery,
left main trunk was 60% stenosis with diffuse disease of the
left anterior descending with a mid 80% stenosis.  The left
circumflex was diffuse disease with a proximal stenosis of
50% and distal stenosis of 70%.  The left PDA had luminal
irregularities.  The right coronary was non dominant with
hepatic vessel.  There was elevation of the left ventricular
and diastolic pressure.  The PA pressure was 26/9.  Mean
pulmonary artery pressure was 11 mm.  There was global
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 39%.  There was no
segmental ostial disease of the innominate, the left
subclavian or left common carotid arteries.  Abdominal angio
did show that the left renal artery was non visualized, but
the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] was occluded with a patent SMA and celiac arteries.
Otherwise, there was no other disease of the infrarenal, the
bilateral common iliacs were okay.  The patient is now
admitted for elective revascularization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2132-6-25**].  He underwent
aortobifemoral bypass with bilateral femoral popliteal
bypasses with Dacron.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He
was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He remained
afebrile, hemodynamically stable.  Blood gases were 7.33, 37,
150, 20 minus 5.  He was on an SIMV of 50%, 700 x10 with 5 of
PEEP.  His MV was 70%.  The patient continued to do well.  He
had a faintly palpable right PT with triphasic dopplerable
signal on the right and triphasic dopplerable PT on the left.
The patient was transferred to the SICU for continued care
and respiratory support.  He was followed by the acute pain
service and analgesic control with an epidural.

Postoperative day 1, the patient had no overnight events.  He
did require fluid bolusing and nitroglycerin for afterload
reduction.  His postoperative hematocrit was 31.6.  BUN,
creatinine and potassium remained stable.  The patient was
extubated.  Epidural was continued.

Postoperative day 2, his hematocrit was 27.0.  His troponin
was less than 0.3.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  He
had been extubated.  His Lopressor was increased for
afterload reduction.  He received 1 unit of packed red blood
cells with Lasix and he was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.  His epidural infusion was
augmented to 10 mg for analgesic control.

Postoperative day 4, he continued to do well with a low grade
temperature though of 100.4??????.  Hematocrit remained stable at
27.2.  BUN and creatinine were stable at 14 and 1.0.
Epidural was discontinued and he was converted to oral
analgesics.  He was begun on a regular diet.
