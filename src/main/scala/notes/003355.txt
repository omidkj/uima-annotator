Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Moderate to severe spontaneous
echo contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity
(<0.2m/s)

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Cannot exclude MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to co-existing AR, the pressure
half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation
of true area. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. Moderate spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. The study is inadequate to
exclude significant mitral valve stenosis. Due to co-existing
aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral
valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced.
1. A bioprosthesis is well seated in the aortic position.
Leaflets open well. Mean gradient across the valve is 16 mm of
Hg. No AI jets are seen.
2. MR is trace to mild.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function is preserved






Brief Hospital Course:
on [**2113-3-17**] Mrs.[**Known lastname **] was admitted to MWMC with acute
exacerbation of CHF.She was stabilized and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further cardiac workup. She has known severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8
cm'2), CAD, recent UGIB with duodenal ulcer and AVMs associated
with SOB. GI was consulted for her recent history of GI bleed
and guiac positive stools. Serial hematocrits were followed and
on [**2113-3-20**] EGD was performed which showed previous treated
