bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Right leg, no edema, two plus
pulses.  Left leg in fraction splint.  Distal sensation
intact.  Able to move his left foot without difficulty.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Alert
an oriented times three.  Examination non-focal.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.5, hematocrit 40.4,
platelets 122.  Differential within normal limits.
Coagulation studies normal.

Sodium 135, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 29, BUN
28, creatinine 1.3, baseline 1.1 to 1.7.  Glucose 109.
Digoxin 0.8.  TSH 6.0 and 1001.  Urinalysis was within normal
limits.  Urine culture is pending.

Chest x-ray showed an enlarged left ventricle, tortuous
aorta.  No consolidation, no effusion or pneumonia.

Left femur was a comminuted spiral fracture of the distal
left femur with posterior medial displacement of the proximal
fragment.  The hip showed no fracture of the proximal left
femur.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 61 beats per minute, left
axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, normal
intervals, Qs in V1 through V2 and no change compared with
prior EKG of 05/99.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medicine Service on [**2117-3-5**] for
primary work-up and treatment of a left femur fracture status
post a mechanical fall.

1.   Left femur fracture and cardiovascular clearance:  Mr.
[**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to the Medicine Service for preoperative
cardiac clearance for his left femur fracture surgery.  His
outpatient Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was consulted and
recommended the patient be ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with serial CKs.  This was done overnight without
any acute rise in his cardiac enzymes.  He was placed on
Telemetry and there were no events on Telemetry noted.  In
addition, the patient had a Persantine thallium done which
showed mild to moderate partially reversible perfusion defect
in the inferior wall which is more apparent when compared to
his prior study.  He has an improved left ventricular wall
motion with an ejection fraction of approximately 52%.  Based
on this and consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 101490**] the patient was
deemed cardiac cleared for surgery.

He had a left open reduction and internal fixation of his
femur performed on [**2117-3-9**], that was performed well
without any complications.  The patient was noted to have a
drop in his hematocrit from 36 to 29 in the setting of the
operation which was felt secondary to blood loss during the
operation.  There were no acute signs of gastrointestinal
bleeding or blood loss post surgery.  He received two units
of blood and his hematocrit responded appropriately.

The recommendations of the Orthopedic Team is to continue
Coumadin for six months with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.0 for
deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy who recommended rehabilitation and the patient will
be transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for extensive rehabilitation
after discharge from the hospital.  He will follow-up with
the Orthopedics Department after discharge.

2.  Aspiration pneumonia:  On hospital day two, the patient
was noted to have vomiting and aspiration.  The patient was
lying in bed flat because of his left leg fracture and was
noted to have an emesis of bright yellow material, presumably
bilious and/or vanilla pudding.  Therefore, the patient has a
past history of the same quality of secretions through his
trachea, his vital signs were stable and his examination was
unchanged at that time.  He was suctioned; however, then
noted to have increasing oxygen requirement and his blood
pressure dropped to approximately 70 to 80 systolic
overnight.  He was given multiple fluid boluses without
significant response of his blood pressure and required
higher levels of oxygen and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was monitored in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit overnight in which he was given
intravenous antibiotics consisting of Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  His blood pressure stabilized and he was transferred
out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit the following morning.

It was thought to be evidence of aspiration pneumonia and he
was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl times seven days.
At the time of his hospital discharge, he is requiring very
minimal amounts of oxygen and to complete a course of
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a complete seven-day course.  He
is without complaints involving his respiratory status at
this time.

3.  Genitourinary:  The patient was noted to have urinary
tract infection secondary to Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus during the hospitalization.  This was
noted to occur after he had his orthopedic surgery and it was
felt best to treat this with a seven-day course of Vancomycin
since the patient has hardware after surgery.  The patient
was placed in Isolation and had the Foley changed and placed
on the condom catheter.  He had no symptoms of urinary tract
infection and we will check a urinalysis and urine culture
after he has completed the Vancomycin course.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has his TSH checked during this
hospitalization that was high at 11.  His Synthroid dose was
increased and would recommend checking a repeat TSH in three
to four weeks.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to acute
rehabilitation.  He will continue his antibiotics for
aspiration pneumonia and Vancomycin there and will acutely
rehabilitate after his left femur fracture before being
transferred home and resume care under his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1312**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 101490**] at that time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day times seven days started
[**2117-3-8**].
2.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times a day times seven d
