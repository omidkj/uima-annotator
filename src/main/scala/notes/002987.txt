History of Present Illness:
82M with metastatic esophageal CA managed by watchful waiting,
diabetes p/w confusion at [**Hospital 27838**] rehab. He was noted by the
staff at the rehab to develop difficulty breathing, decreased
oxygen sats requiring supplemental oxygen, and bp to the 80s
systolic. Of note, at the rehab he had just completeted a course
of levofloxacin for a RLL PNA for which he was treated at [**Hospital **]. He was sent to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation where

on 3L. He afebrile though found to have a lactate of 5.3 with a
wbc of 18.4 from 16.9 a couple of days prior. While his bp and
pulse were stable, sepsis protocol was initiated given the
elevated lactate and central line was placed in the ED. He was
given 3L NS in smaller boluses. CXR showed no infiltrates. UA
was positive. Vanc/zosyn were started empirically in the ED. He
was admitted to ICU.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple nodules throughout the liver consistent with
widespread metastases.
2. Small amount of perihepatic ascites.
.
KUB:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction or free
intra-abdominal air is identified.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal study due to markedly reduced lung volumes with no
acute consolidation. Right hemidiaphragm elevation. Probable
cardiomegaly. This will be better evaluated with PA and lateral
views of the chest when the patient could tolerate this.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
82M with metastatic esophageal CA, diabetes p/w sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis/UTI:
Pt had lactate to 5.3 on admission, with elevated WBC. The ource
was found to be UTI. He was treated initially with vanc and
zosyn. he was admitted under sepsis protocol with SvO2 central
venous line placed and received multiple fluid boluses in the
ED. His pulse and BP remained stable in the ED, although the
lactate was indicative of early sepsis. This resolved with
treatment. Urine Cx showed E Coli sensitive to bactrim. At
rehab, pyridium can be considered for pain if needed, patient's
daughter specifically requested this.
.
2. Hypoxia:
He was noted to have a new oxygen requirement. This was thought
to be [**2-6**] hypoventilation and abdominal distension. BNP was 2755
in the ED, although there was no other evidence of CHF.
.
3. Metastatic esophageal CA:
Liver US showed worsening metastatic disease with minimal
ascites, patent portal vein with hepatopetal flow. DNR/DNI
discussion was held with the patient and his son and daughter.
The patient expressed a clear desire to be DNR/DNI and also a
general preference to avoid further tests or procedures. His
goals are palliative.
.
4. ARF:
Cr was elevated 1.5 and had been 1.5 range at rehab for the past
week. His baseline was 1.0 on [**2156-4-1**]. This resolved to 1.1 with
IV fluids. His ACE inhibitor was held.
.
# hyperkalemia:
potassium was elevated to 5.7 on [**6-20**] at rehab, and was 5.7
again in ED. Pt is now s/p insulin and kayexalate, with k to
4.9. The potassium remained stable during the rest of the
admission.
.
# confusion:
This resolved by hospital day #2. It was likely mutlifactorial,
[**2-6**] acute illness, infection, oxycodone at rehab. This resolved
by the second hospital day.
.
# dm2:
Oral agents were held and he was covered with RISS.
.
# htn:
Lisinopril was held given the ARF.
.
FEN: cardiac, diabetic diet
.
