Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14637**] is a 36 year old male with severe biventricular
cardiomyopathy, EF 10%, HIV since [**2121**] (not on HAART),
depression, recent diagnosis of hepatitis presenting with 1 week
of progressive dyspnea, abdominal pain/distention,
PND/orthopnea, and tachycardia. He reports that his abdominal
pain was persistent ever since his last admission and has been
progressively worsening for the past month. Mainly located in
the epigastrum and RUQ, intermittently with right shoulder pain
as well. Has had nausea today only, no vomiting. He also
endorses progressive weight gain since his discharge one month
ago when he was 164 lbs, now reportedly 184 lbs. Has had looses,
yellow stools, [**3-1**]/day for the past week. Denies any
hematochezia/melena. He has had very poor sleep due to the pain
and took 2 tylenol pm a night for the past [**3-1**] nights. Stopped
taking his meds on Monday and Tues and felt much better, resumed
meds on Wed and symptoms returned. Has been feeling dehydrated
so stopped following fluid restriction and started drinking
3000-4000 ml daily. Also reports increasing abdominal pain and
distention and bloating of his face.
.
Of note he was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 14640**] with dyspnea
and fatigue and was found to have cardiomyopathy with EF 10%. He
was initially admitted to the CCU and treated with lasix gtt for
diuresis with improvement of symptoms. Cardiomyopathy felt most
likely to be [**1-30**] toxine from crystal meth vs viral. He was newly
diagnosed with HCV however seen by GI and not felt to be acute
infection. He had high spiking of fevers to 103 and initially
treated with vanc/gent, followed by ID however no infection ever
identified and abx d/c'd and fevers attributed to viral illness.

.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.4, HR 133, 120/86, RR 24
100%?. He triggered on presentation for tachycardia and
tachypnea. He had bedside ultrasound in the ED reportedly
showing "IVC full, no resp variation, fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch,
likely ascites. GB difficult to visualize". He was give 37.5mg
metoprolol, morphine 4mg IV x2, zofran 4mg IV x2. During CT scan
IV infiltrated about 15-20 cc contrast in L arm, ice applied. He
was started on IVF at 25 cc/hr.

1. Collapsed gallbladder with stable-to-minimally decreased wall

thickening/edema.
2. Mild ascites without pocket large enough to mark for blind
paracentesis. If diagnostic paracentesis is still desired,
ultrasound guidance is advised.

with
hepatopetal flow.

[**2137-6-15**], ECHO, Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. The basal lateral wall and apex
contract best (LVEF = <20 %). The strain pattern suggests
significant dyssnchrony. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. An eccentric
jet of mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation jet is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
