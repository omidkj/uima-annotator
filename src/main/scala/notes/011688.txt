Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
83 y/o M discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-9**] (admitted from [**Date range (1) 66815**]
for hypoxic resp failure), MMP including CAD s/p CABG, afib,
HTN, Parkinson's and chronic aspiration with admits in recent
past for GIB and PNA. Today he presents with hypoxia.
.
During an admission in early [**Month (only) 116**] for GIB, HCT stabilized and EGD
was not pursued based on family wishes. Had vanco for MRSA PNA.
On [**7-2**], he was readmitted to the ICU, intubated, and started on
Vanco and Zosyn emperically. Initially he was on pressors, which
were weaned off on the day of admission. He grew [**Month/Year (2) **] [**5-21**] blood
cx on [**7-2**] and pseudomonas and MRSA in his sputum [**7-5**], and
linezolid and zosyn were started with plan to treat until [**7-17**]
and [**7-16**] respectively. PICC was pulled, TTE showed no
vegetations. In addition to his respiratory and ID issues, he
had episodes of RVR for which metoprolol was titrated up.
.
He was discharged in stable condition with follow-up plans to
[**Hospital 38**] Rehab. At rehab he required frequent suctioning. The
rehab facility felt that his pulmonary toilet needs were more
than they could provide based on staffing and resources. He was
sent to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] due to oxygen saturations lower than
normal (low 90's on RA). No fevers or other complaints were not
noted.
.
ED Course: Vanc, Levo/Flagyl given in ED. Pt was initially
satting in low 90's on NC oxygen. NRB was added and sats
increased to 100%. Pt was admitted to ICU for monitoring given
his recent pneumonia, old age, comorbidities, and general
infirmity.

Past Medical History:
1. Parkinson's
2. chronic aspiration with g-tube
3. AFib on coumadin  (had been evaluated by cardiologist in
[**12-22**], and it was decided not to place him on coumadin given
history of multiple falls, but to rate control him with
metoprolol.  Had been on sotalol in the past)
4. CAD s/p CABG [**2157**], 4 coronary vein grafts
5. frequent falls
6. GERD
7. Hyperlipidemia
8. Myelodysplastic syndrome
9. Urinary obstruction (?BPH)
10. HTN
11. Antral gastritis
12. malignant melanoma right ear excised
13. multiple polyps (from ascending, transverse and sigmoid
colons - hyperplastic tubulovillous adenomas) seen on
colonoscopy [**3-/2164**]
14. Restrictive lung disease [**3-21**] to asbestos exposure
15. chronic vit B12 deficiency
16. BPH


Social History:
Patient lives in a nursing home.  Quit smoking in [**2128**] after 20
years.  Quit alcohol in [**2154**].


Family History:
diabetes in brother

Physical Exam:
VS: 97.9, 119/63, 82, 28, 100% on NRB --> titrated down to
94-95% RA
Gen: tachypneic, some respiratory discomfort
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, masked facies, MM mod dry
Neck: JVD not visible above the clavicle at 60 degrees. Neck
somewhat stiff, but no Brudzinsky's.
Lungs: anterior with rhonchi, posterior with poor air movement,
crackles throughout, worse at the bases, and scattered wheezes
CV: tachycardic, no appreciated m/r/g
Abd: soft, very thin, nd. g-tube site intact. +BS
Ext: No edema, 1+ DP bilaterally
SKIN: dry and cool
Neuro: MS: very few words, appears to answer questions with some
accuracy. Not oriented to place, person, or time. Dysphonia.
CN: No droop. PERRL. Tongue midline. Masked facies.
Motor: Moves all extremities, ?distal>proximal. [**4-21**] hip
flexors/biceps. [**5-22**] grip/dorsiflexion
Sensory: cannot assess.
Gait: defered

Pertinent Results:
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. Heart is normal in size. There is interval
improvement in diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities consistent
with improving mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, peripheral
opacities are seen in both lungs, which could represent
multifocal pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema, and also are
improving in the interval. Small bilateral effusions persist. No
pneumothorax is seen. IMPRESSION:
1. Improving peripheral airspace opacities likely representing
multifocal pneumonia rather than asymmetric pulmonary edema.
2. Improving mild pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 y/o M with CAD s/p CABG, AF, HTN,
Parkinson's and chronic aspiration recently admitted for GIB and
PNA readmitted for aspiration however saturating well on room
air. Hospital course by problem: .
.
# Aspiration/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, aspiration event vs
mucus plug / secretions. Lung function compromised by recent
MRSA PNA + now growing Pseudomonas, ? Pseudomonal superinfection
contributing. Stable on RA since admission.
- Completed course of zosyn for Pseudomonas for started
[**Date range (1) 66813**]
- to complete course of Linezolid, patient has one more dose to
complete (started [**7-4**])
- frequent suctioning, pulmonary toilet, CPT
.
# Bacteremia: growing [**Month/Year (2) **] in [**5-21**] blood cultures from [**7-3**],
repeat surveillance cultures negative, no vegetation on TTE.
- d/ced PICC and sent tip for Cx [**7-4**] showing no growth
- continue Linezolid for 2 weeks, started [**7-4**]
- source of [**Name (NI) **] unclear, urine cultures have been negative.
?Pulmonary source.
.
# Hypotension: resolved, likely [**3-21**] infection with sepsis.
Treatment as above.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: On BB as outpt. Has tried
Amiodarone in past but recently d/c's [**3-21**] concerns for side
effects. Not on anticoagulation given GIB. At last admission,
had repeated episodes of RVR with afib. During this admission
however HR well controlled on lower dose of beta blocker.
Discharging on 50 mg TID.
- will avoid sotalol as outpatient cardiologist suggested that
because of his CAD, Class Ic agents are contraindicated in this
clinical setting. It should only be restarted under supervision
of cardiologist.
.
# CAD: stable without active ischemia
- BB, ASA, statin
.
# H/O GIB: In setting of supratherapeutic INR. Currently off
Coumadin and Hct stable. Family refused EGD on last admission.
Currently stable with no recurrent evetns.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
.
# Parkinson Dz: c/b chronic aspiration
- Sinemet increased to QID from TID at last hospitalization.
Currently continuing at outpatient doses.
.
# Sacral Decub and Heel Ulcers: wound care and OOB to chair when
possible.  Tylenol for pain.
.
# BPH: Terazosin at 2mg was increased to 8mg prior to discharge
and oxybutinin was added then titrated back down to 4 mg qHS,
will continue this dose for now.
.
# Metabolic Alkylosis - Volume depleted, corrected with IVF
hydration.
.
# FEN: continue Tube feeds
.
# Code Status: DNR but not DNI. Patient wants intubation
.
# PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9780**], NP [**Telephone/Fax (3) 66809**]
