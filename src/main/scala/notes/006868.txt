Chief Complaint:
fevers/chills, gastrointestinal distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2145-5-7**] Fifth time redo sternotomy and aortic root replacement,
Bentall procedure, with a size #25 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] composite graft


History of Present Illness:
30 year old male well known to cardiac surgery with a history of
AV endocarditis with MSSA in [**2137**] and [**2140**], enteroccocus in
[**2142**], s/p AVR x 2 in [**2140**] and [**2142**] who presented to [**Hospital 57051**]
medical center on [**2145-4-2**] with 1 week of
intermittent crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, chills, diarrhea,
loose stools, headache and neck pain. He states his pain
originated 5-7 days ago, is sharp and constant in intensity, and
was not relieved by over the counter analgesics. The pain in his
head and neck with worse with changing positions. Upon arrival
to the OSH, he was febrile to 100.7, found to have a WBC of 9
wtih bandemia to 18%, with blood cultures growing GNR in [**4-11**]
bottles. He was started on vancomycin amikacin and cefepime
(vancomycin was discontinued after GNR were discovered on
culture). TTE demonstrated EF 55% with LVF, AV not well
visualized, but no vegetations observed. Now found to have most
likely recurrent
endocaridits given progression on TEE, continuing to spike
fevers and dital embolism secondary to vegetation. He was
referred to cardiac surgery for redo AVR x4/+/-possible Bentall.

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-5-7**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities
in the septal wall. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40)
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis.
The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent with a
normal tube graft.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. There is a
moderate-sized vegetation (1.4 cm x 1.8 cm on the aortic valve.
An aortic annular abscess is seen at the junction of the aortic
and anterior mitral leafllet. There is no flow within the
abscess. There are no flow connections from the cavity to
outside [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient is on epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusions.
Left ventricular function is moderately depressed (LVEF =
30-35%). The septum and inferior wall remain severely
hypokinetic.
Right ventricular function remains moderately depressed.
There is a mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic position.
No paravalvular leak is seen. There is a mean gradient of 6 mmHg
at a cardiac output of 7.0 L/min. The aortic valve vegetation is
no longer present.
An ascending aortic tube graft is seen.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
The aortic arch and descending aorta are intact
post-decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 30 year old man with a past medical history
significant for bicuspid AV, AVR x 2, Endocarditis x 3(MSSA and
enteroccocus) last AVR in [**2142**] who presents with shortness of
breath, cough, fevers, diarrhea/nausea and gram negative
bacteremia.
Initially, Mr. [**Known lastname 57041**] was treated with gram negative
bacteremia/possible PNA with zosyn and levaquin. However he
developed a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash and severe
eyelid swelling following his first dose of zosyn. Zosyn was
discontinued given apparent allergy and cefepime/Flagyl were
started instead. Blood and urine cultures were repeated and were
negative. TEE was obtained which initially did not show
vegetations, but on repeat studies, small echo densities were
seen on the aortic leaflets.  These were serially monitored and
were noted to increase.  As below, the patient developed sudden
severe foot pain which was felt to be secondary to a septic
embolic. Repeat imaging confirmed that the vegetation had
decreased in size.  He was continually monitored and the size of
his vegetation remained stable, however on a study from [**2145-5-4**],
it was noted that there was liquid pocket near the aortic root,
c/w an abscess.  He was taken to the OR for an aortic valve
replacement on [**2145-5-7**]. He [**Date Range 1834**] a fifth time redo
sternotomy and aortic root replacement, Bentall procedure, with
a size #25 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] composite graft.  See operative note for
full details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. He was
