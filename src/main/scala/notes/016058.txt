Admission Date:  [**2131-6-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-6-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2068-7-10**]     Sex:  M


CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Shortness of breath.
2.  Hypotension.

with no known history of coronary artery disease, status post
cholecystectomy, history of hypertension, history of
hyperlipidemia, questionable history of CHF, peptic ulcer
disease who presents to an outside hospital one day prior to
admission with one week of epigastric / chest pain. The
patient states that pain was worse after eating and was
persistent. Denies history of chest pain. Denies radiation to
epigastric. No vomiting, positive nausea, positive anorexia,
no subjective fevers at home.

At the outside hospital the patient was noted to have an
increased white blood cell count to 12.3, ALT of 258, AST
256, amylase 448, lipase of 1212, T bilirubin of 2.0.
Abdominal ultrasound was done at the outside hospital but
report was not available. The patient was then sent to [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent ERCP to treat
gallstone pancreatitis / cholangitis.

Pre-procedure the patient's blood pressure was 88/58, status
post 900 cc of D5 half normal saline given en route from
outside hospital. The patient's IVFs were increased and BP
rose to 96. After given Versed and Fentanyl the patient's
blood pressure dropped to 84. During the procedure, the blood
pressure was 75/53 and fluids were continued. By the end of
procedure, 1300 cc of normal saline were given and blood
pressure was 91/49. The patient then began to complain of
shortness of breath and was hypoxic requiring 100%
non-rebreather to maintain a saturation of 92%. The MICU team
was then called to further evaluate the patient for ICU
admission.

ERCP showed a common bile duct of 10 mm. After [**Last Name (LF) 40561**],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] pus was drained and stone was extracted. Medications
given during ERCP included Fentanyl 125 micrograms, Glucagon
0.2 mg, Midazolam 0.5 mg IV. The patient was also given
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

On review of systems the patient denied orthopnea, denied
dyspnea on exertion, denied chest pain, denied lower
extremity edema, denied melena, denied bright red blood per
rectum, denied shortness of breath, denied wheezing, denied
dysuria, pyuria in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peptic ulcer disease H pylori positive in [**2124**].
2.  Status post cholecystectomy approximately six years prior
to admission.
3.  Hypertension blood pressure approximately 140 at home.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Questionable history of chronic renal insufficiency.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Procardia.
2.  Avapro.
3.  Lipitor.

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY: No alcohol or tobacco use. The patient lives
at home with wife and children. He is retired.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure approximately 80 to
90/50, 02 saturation 92% on 100% non-rebreather, heart rate
120s, respiratory rate 25 to 30. HEENT - extraocular muscles
are intact. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
JVP about 10 cm. Neck is supple. Heart - tachycardic,
questionable S3, normal S1, S2. Lungs - positive bibasilar
crackles half way up, no egophony, no dullness to percussion.
Abdomen - status post cholecystectomy, open scar, slight
distention, positive bowel sounds, no tenderness, no rebound,
no guarding. Extremities - trace 1+ pitting edema, warm and
well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  Not available upon initial evaluation of
patient.

EKG - Sinus tachycardic at 147 beats per minute, axis
indeterminate, J point elevation in V1, V2, V3, V4, no acute
ST-T segment changes, 1 mm Q in II and F.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 62 year-old male with history
of peptic ulcer disease, status post cholecystectomy,
hypertension, questionable history of chronic renal
insufficiency who presents with ascending cholangitis and
gallstone pancreatitis, now status post ERCP with hypotension
and hypoxia.

1.  In terms of the patient's ascending cholangitis and
sepsis hypotension pre-procedure suggests that the patient
already had septic physiology prior to ERCP most likely from
a biliary source secondary to obstruction by gallstone.
Drainage already achieved by ERCP.  The plan was to continue
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for biliary
flora.

2.  Pulmonary edema - no previous history of CAD. Ejection
fraction is unknown, history of hypertension. Chest x-ray
consistent with pulmonary edema. It was felt that the patient
might have diastolic dysfunction exacerbated by tachycardia
or may have had a low ejection fraction prior to admission.
However the patient denied any symptoms of heart failure.
Plan was for echocardiogram in the A.M. and for possible Swan
placement to guide pressor / IV fluid treatment. The
patient's cardiac enzymes were also planned to be sent.
Aspirin was held because of recent procedure.

3.  Fluid status - it was felt that the patient would most
likely need fluid resuscitation for sepsis.  However the
patient's hypoxia was concerning. It was unclear at this time
whether this patient was in CHF or pulmonary edema secondary
to ARDS. It was thought at this time the Fenard ICU team
would attempt to give Lasix to improve hypoxia but suspected
that the patient would need to be intubated shortly and a PA
catheter placed for guidance of fluid resuscitation.

4.  Acute renal failure - the patient was anuric upon
admission to the Fenard ICU with a creatinine from outside
hospital of 2.8. Although it had been written on the outside
hospital records that the patient had a history of chronic
renal insufficiency, the patient and the patient's family
denied any such history. There was no baseline creatinine in
our computers to determine what his renal function was prior
to admission. A creatinine and urine electrolytes were
planned to be checked.

5.  Pancreatitis - the patient's amylase, lipase were planned
to be followed and along with hematocrit, calcium and
glucose.

6.  Pulmonary - the patient had pulmonary edema on chest
x-ray and by exam and hypoxia. It was felt that the patient
most likely would have to be intubated for his hypoxia and
pulmonary edema. An ABG was sent.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was quickly transferred to the
ICU from the ERCP suite. On arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU the
patient was pleasant, oriented times three although
respiratory rate had increased to 40 breaths per minute. O2
saturations continued to be in the 90s on 100%
non-rebreather. The patient's heart rate was also increased
to 130s to 140s with occasional PVCs. Although the patient
was anuric it was decided we would try a course of Lasix
first 20, 80 and then 160 mg IV given without any response.
Foley was placed however only 70 cc of concentrated urine was
obtained. It was then decided this was probably not due to
congestive heart failure but most likely secondary to
overwhelming sepsis and the decision was made to intubate the
patient. Anesthesia was called and IV fluids were started in
the patient's peripheral IVs.

The patient was intubated and became more profoundly
hypotensive post intubation. The patient received Etomidate
pre intubation. He became agitated and required Ativan and
Fentanyl and eventually needed four points restraints.  A
femoral line was quickly placed and IV fluids were run wide
open. The patient's blood pressure continued to drop into the
70s and Dopamine was started. Levo was quickly added as the
patient's blood pressure did not respond to Dopamine then
Neo-Synephrine. The patient received maximal doses of three
vasopressors and wide open fluids were also continued. One liter
of normal saline and one liter of D5 with three amps of bicarb
were running wide open at all times. Vasopressin was then added
at 0.04 units per minute and Epinephrine drip was also added as
the patient's blood pressure continued to drop.

The patient then had asystolic arrest, frequent doses of
epinephrine / Atropine bicarb were administered and CPR was
started and continued throughout administration of these
medications. The patient was very difficult to oxygenate and
large amounts of yellow, brownish fr
