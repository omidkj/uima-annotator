Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78304**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2171-9-16**] and taken to the Operating Room for an T10-L5 anterior
fusion through a thoracotomy.  Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The surgery was without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition.  She had a chest tube placed and during her
thoracotomy. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT
prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard
protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2
([**2171-9-17**]) she returned to the operating room for a scheduled
T4-L5 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part
procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note for
further details. The second surgery was also without
complication and the patient was transferred to the T/SICU in
stable condition for large blood loss. Postoperative HCT was 23.
She was transfused multiple units of PRBCs, platelets, and
plasma. A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the time
of the posterior surgery remained in place until the following
day when it was removed. She was kept NPO until bowel function
returned then diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was
transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet.
She was placed on around the clock tylenol due to hypotension
after taking opioid pain relievers.  Foley and chest tube were
removed on POD#3 from the second procedure. There was no
pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  She was fitted with a
TLSO brace to be worn when out of bed. Physical therapy was
consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital course was
otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain
control and tolerating a regular diet.
