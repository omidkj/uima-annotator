LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2164-11-11**] 5:12 AM
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture. No focal fluid
collections are identified. Within the right lobe of the liver,
there is an irregular hypoechoic focus measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.4
cm, which has through-transmission and ultrasound
characteristics of a cyst. Doppler evaluation of this area
demonstrates slightly increased vascularity and attention should
be paid to this area on subsequent examinations. The main portal
vein is patent with appropriate direction of flow. The anterior
right portal vein, posterior right portal vein, and left portal
vein are all patent with appropriate waveforms and direction of
flow. The main hepatic artery, left hepatic artery, and right
hepatic arteries demonstrate good upstroke and overall
waveforms. The right common, middle, and left hepatic veins
demonstrate slightly dampened and monophasic waveforms. The IVC
is patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unremarkable Doppler evaluation of newly transplanted liver.
Monophasicity of the hepatic vein waveforms noted.
2. Cystic lesion within the right hepatic lobe. Attention should
be paid to this area on subsequent examinations.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
