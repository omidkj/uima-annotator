Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98097**] is a 71F with a hx of SCLC and chronic eosinophilic
penumonia on 2L home O2 and Prednisone 5mg who initially
presented to an OSH ED with substernal/left sided non-positional
pleuritic CP with N/diaphoresis and SOB. She reports that these
symptoms came on suddenly in the morning while she was sitting
down. She describes the pain as [**6-22**], non-radiating, and worse
with deep breaths. She denies change in cough from baseline,
fever, chills, palpitations. Also denies recent leg swelling.
There, she was noted to have CT and CXR with infiltrate and
hypotension to 80s with concern for sepsis so was given
Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Lovenox 80mg SC and 1.5L NS and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. En route, she received SL NTG for CP
and ASA 162mg. BPs recorded at OSH 100s/60s->80s/40s.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: 96.9 94 79/47 16 97%2L. She began
maintainting SBP>90 after 4L IVF. They decided to treat
empirically for PE with lovenox given pleuritic CP. CTA not
obtained at that time due to iodine allergy. She was mentating
fine throughout course and was not in any respiratory distress.
Labs remarkable for WBC 15, lactate 1.0. She was given duonebs,
lovenox as above and levofloxacin 750mg IV out of concern for
PNA. Prior to transfer, VS: 98.9 96 102/51 24 100%2L. ECG not
looked at but revealed ST elevations II, AVF, later thought to
be PR depressions.


Past Medical History:
IPMT (intraductal papillary mucinous tumor)
chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:no prior pulm notes in our
system; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
Pulmonary HTN
gastritis
depression
herpes zoster
s/p appy
s/p cholecystectomy
.
Past Oncologic History per oncology notes: SCLC- routine MRCP
performed in follow up of her IPMT on [**2155-3-19**], which
showed a possible right posterior rib lesion. She had a chest CT
performed on
[**2155-4-23**], which showed a 2.7 x 1.7 cm soft tissue density that

extended to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. This

corresponded to the abnormality seen on the MRCP. In addition,
there were lymph nodes noted in the prevascular, peritracheal,
subcarinal, and mediastinal stationed in the right hilum.
FDG/PET
imaging showed intensely FDG avid dominant right lung nodule and

intensely FDG avid right hilar, right peritracheal, and
precarinal lymph nodes. She underwent mediastinoscopy and lymph

node biopsy showed small cell lung cancer. She was staged as
limited stage and has since completed four cycles of cisplatin
and etoposide with concomitant XRT in addition to prophylactic
cranial irradiation (PCI), completing on [**2155-10-10**].


Social History:
Lives with hsband. Formerly employed in formulating specs for
valve company. Quit smoking 45 years ago. Smoked 2ppd x 10
years. Denies IVDU. Has children who are healthy.

Family History:
3 brothers with CAD s/p stents palced in 60s-70s. Father died in
his 90s of "old age". has one brother with DM. Mother died of
heart problems in her 60s. No FH lung disease or other
malignancy.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING
.
TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion
.
CT chest: Preliminary Report -No acute PE. B/l pleural
effusions, moderate on the right, small on the left. Unchanged
radiation fibrosis in the right upper lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98097**] is a 71 year old female with h/o SCLC s/p XRT in
[**2155**], pulm HTN, Chronic Eosinophilic pneumonia on home O2
admitted with pleuritic chest pain and hypotension responsive to
fluids.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 98097**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1801**] presented with hypotension with SBP in the
80s, but this responded well to 5L IVF between the OSH and [**Hospital1 18**]
EDs- the [**Hospital1 18**] ED particularly noted that she maintained SBP in
the 90s after receiving fluid and so didn't require a central
line. Her blood pressure remained stable after admission and so
the etiology her hypotension was determined to be most likely
hypovolemia. Patient was started on stress dose steroids, given
home use of 5 mg prednisone, with plan for a taper. Her home
medication of felodipine was held.
.
The etiology of this patient's chest pain and shortness of
breath were less straightforward. Of note, at baseline the
patient has chronic eosinophilic pnemonia, with a recent flare
in [**Month (only) 547**]. However, this chest pain and shortness of breath were
new.
.
There was initial concern for pneumonia at the OSH, leading to
antibiotic treatment. The CXR at [**Hospital1 18**] did show rightward
deviation of the distal thoracic trachea with extensive opacity
extending radially towards the lateral right upper lobe,
pronounced volume loss in both lungs and blunting of the right
costophrenic angle. However, this was determined to be stable
from prior and not indicative of a new infectious process. In
addition, the patients white count was initially elevated at 15,
although it was unclear whether this should be attributed to
infection vs. steroid use. The patient remained afebrile
throughout her hospitalization.
.
Echo showed normal systolic function with a trivial/physiologic
effusion and so we were less concerned for a cardio-pulmonary
cause of her shortness of breath. There was concern for cardiac
cause of her chest pain given possible changes on her EKG (later
thought to be insignificant) but the patient ruled out for MI
with three sets of enzymes.
.
Next, PE was considered, given an elevated d-dimer. The patient
does have a risk factor of past SCLC, although her
chemo-radiation course was 2 years ago. However, CT-A (given
with pre-medication for iodine allergy) was negative for PE and
heparin drip, started empirically was stopped. Patient's chest
pain resolved and so may have been viral etiology:
costochondritis v. pericarditis.
.
Finally, Ms. [**Known lastname 98097**] was anemic with HCT 29 from baseline 33-35.
HCT remained stable throughout admission and
