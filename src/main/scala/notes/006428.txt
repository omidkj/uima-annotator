Chief Complaint:
Fever

CVVHD

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year-old male with PMH of diastolic heart failure
with an EF=65%, AS s/p mechanical AVR, AF on coumadin, CAD s/p
CABG, pulmonary hypertension, 3rd degree heart block s/p PPM,
severe COPD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for MRSA
bacteremia who was sent in from [**Hospital **] clinic with fevers.

His most recent medical course dates back to [**Month (only) 359**]/ [**2129**] when
the patient was admitted with MRSA bacteremia secondary to a
PICC line.  Hospital course complicated by left prostethic hip
seeding requiring OR washout and prolonged post-op course of
intubation that was complicated by several infections:
Pseudomonal pneumonia +/- upper resp tract infection; Prevotella
bacteremia; and tunneling sacral wound.  Hospital course also
c/b ARF with Cr peaking at 3.9.  Eventually the patient was
extubated and d/ced to LTAC with plan to continue vancomycin IV
x 6weeks and then a prolonged oral course of antibiotics.

Rehab course was c/b worsening L hip pain with evidence of
dislocation on an X-ray taken at his LTAC.  He was hospitalized
again briefly for relocation of hip with recommendations to
continue an abduction pillow between his legs until his follow
up appointment on [**12-6**].

The patient was at a routine follow up appointment at [**Hospital **] clinic
when found to have fever, tachypnea and AMS.  Per ID fellow,
vancomycin should be changed to linezolid with addition of
colisitin and Doripenem.  In the ED, initial VS 100.5 HR:88
BP:115/44 Resp:24 O(2)Sat:98.  CXR showed volume overload and
worsening b/l patchy infiltrates c/w volume overload vs.
infection.

IMAGING
=============
[**2129-11-29**]
- CXR: SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status
post median sternotomy and aortic valve repair. Left-sided
single-lead pacemaker device is noted with lead terminating in
the region of the right ventricle. A left PICC tip terminates
within the left distal subclavian/brachiocephalic vein. The
heart remains moderately enlarged. Worsening perihilar opacities
with vascular indistinctness is again noted compatible with
congestive heart failure, moderate in severity. Worsening
bibasilar opacities are also noted with small bilateral pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute
osseous findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure.
2. Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities which may reflect
atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Left PICC tip terminates within the distal left
subclavian/proximal brachiocephalic vein, unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 year-old male with PMH of diastolic heart failure
with an EF=65%, AS s/p mechanical AVR, AF on coumadin, CAD s/p
CABG, pulmonary hypertension, 3rd degree heart block s/p PPM,
severe COPD, recent MRSA bacteremia, prolonged post-surgical
intubation presents after recent discharge with persistent
fevers and altered mental status.  He was admitted to the ICU
for these symptoms.  His heart failure continued to worsen while
in the ICU, and he began to undergo multiorgan failure.  As his
condition was refractory to treatment, his family decided to
place Mr. [**Known lastname 43019**] on a morphine drip.  He expired on the morning
of [**2129-12-7**].
