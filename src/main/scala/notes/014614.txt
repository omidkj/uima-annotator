Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
69 year old female with extensive cardiac history who syncopized
on day of admission while having a BM.  Taken to OSH where,
while being monitored, had an episode of unresponsiveness.
Rhythm monitor showed VT, converted back to NSR with sternal
thump.  She was started on a lidocaine drip and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 18**] she had another episode of pulseless VT which
responded to another sternal thump.  It was learned that her
pacer had been changed approximately 2 weeks ago from DDD to VVI
45 at [**Hospital1 2025**], and therefore her pacer was interrogated here and
changed back to DDD at 70.

Subsequently she has been asymptomatic.  She denies any SOB, CP,
abdominal pain throughout.  She feels at her baseline.

On review of rhythm strip from OSH, patient had prolonged QT, U
waves, and torsades, and on admission K 2.9.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD - s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**2170**].  Last cath. at [**Hospital1 2025**] in
[**12/2176**] with clean coronaries, PCWP 39, PA 86/35, CI 1.9,
restrictive physiology based on RV,LV concordance.  ETT-mibi
also in [**12/2176**] normal.
2) AVR (porcine)
3) CHF, ascites, RHF (EF 72%)
4) CRF (bl 2.5-2.9)
5) Sick sinus syndrome - Had DDD pacemaker placed, changed to
VVI at 45 bpm two weeks prior to admission.
6) PAF - On coumadin
7) HTN
8) Hypercholesterolemia
9) DM 2
10) PVD, L CEA
11) Ischemic colitis, partial R colectomy
12) COPD
13) Pulm hypertension

Social History:
Divorced.  3 children.  Quit smoking [**2171**].

Physical Exam:
VS: HR 69, 144/48, 22, 98% on 2L
Gen: Obese caucasian female resting comfortably in bed.
Neck: JVP at 10 cm
Lungs: Fair air movement, CTA b/l.
CVS: Irregularly irregular, audible valve closure
Abd: NABS, tense, non-tender, non-palpable liver or spleen
Extr: Trace pedal edema

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-17**]:  Cardiomegaly and bibasilar atelectasis. Mild upper
zonal distribution without overt CHF.

Echo [**2177-1-19**]:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.2 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.4 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.00
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 280 msec
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *33 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right venticular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w
primary pulmonary process (PPH, pulmonary embolism, etc.).
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with hx CAD s/p CABG [**2170**] (normal cath and
ETT 2 weeks PTA), AVR, COPD and pulm HTN, pacemaker for SSS,
admitted with hypokalemia and torsades de [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting
of recently reprogrammed pacer DDD to VVI at 45 bpm.

1) Rhythm:  Pacer was changed to DDD at 70 on the night of
admission, and potassium was supplemented and kept in normal
range, without further VT.  Patient's rhythm on the morning
after admission showed pacemaker syndrome and failed atrial
capture.  It is suspected that her atrial lead is not working
properly.  She will need an EP study to check on atrial wire.
Her amiodarone was held and she was instructed to discontinue
this medication on discharge given the potential for QT
prolongation and recurrence of torsades - on admission she was
found to have a prolonged QTc (likely related to hypokalemia)
which is believed to have led to her torsades.

2) Hypokalemia:  Possibly related to recently increased dose of
lasix.  Lasix was held for the first 2 days of admission, and
restarted at half of her usual dose on discharge (20mg [**Hospital1 **]).  In
light of the decrease in lasix, we continued her aldactone at a
higher dose of 100 mg daily while in house, but have decreased
it to 50 mg daily on discharge (increased from her home dose of
25 mg daily).

3) Pump:  Worsening RHF with ascites, restrictive physiology per
report from [**Hospital1 2025**].  Repeat echo here showed right venticular
cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension c/w primary pulmonary process (PPH,
pulmonary embolism, etc.). Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation.  She should have further workup for her
pulmonary hypertension as an outpatient at [**Hospital1 2025**].

4) CAD:  Recent cath with clear coronaries, normal ETT.  We
continued her statin.  She is not on ASA for an unclear reason.
She was discharged on her outpatient beta blocker dose.

5) PAF: The patient's coumadin was held secondary to possible EP
study, however has been restarted as the EP study was postponed
to outpatient.

6) Depression:  Continued paxil.

7) DM: RISS while in house.  We have started an ACE-inhibitor in
this diabetic patient.
