Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
35yo M with h/o HTN, renal artery stenosis, and asthma, off all
medications x4 months as unable to afford them, who is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of hypertensive emergency
after presenting to OSH ED earlier in day with weight gain,
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, worsening bilateral lower extremity
edema, and general malaise, and was found to be hypertensive to
270/170.  Patient has previously been admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**6-/2194**]
for similar episode of hypertension, though per his report BP
was not this elevated.  Was discharged on regimen of amlodipine,
lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, and isosorbide monontriate,
but has not taken these medications for the past 4 months as he
does not have insurance and has been unable to afford them.
Work-up during that admission notable for renal ultrasound
demonstrating left renal artery stenosis.
.
Over past 6 months patient notes weight gain of unclear amount.
Has also had dyspnea, dry cough, orthopnea, PND.  Worsening
bilateral lower extremity edema over past week.  Also reports
bilateral ear discomfort and sensation that his equilibrium was
off.  Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED, where he was
found to be hypertensive with pressure 270/170 per report.
Started on nitro gtt and later transitioned to esmolol gtt. Also
given 80mg lasix.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], with pressure improved
to 170s/130s prior to transfer.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
triggered for HTN with VS 97 180/138 87 18 99% 2L. Patient
continued on esmolol gtt, nitro gtt.  Exam unremarkable.  Labs
notable for WBC of 12.9, Cr 2.9, Trop 0.09, proBNP 6684.  CXR
showed cardiomegaly, and patient was also felt to have evidence
of pulmonary edema based on imaging. EKG without evidence of
ishcemia.  Patient also had renal ultrasound which showed normal
appearing right renal artery, though left renal artery not well
visualized.  Admitted to ICU for further management, and just
prior to transfer VS: 86 174/119 24 96% 2L.
.
On the floor, patient states he is comfortable.  Denies any CP
or SOB at present, though reports intermittent SOB over past
week.
.
Review of systems:

which he reports resolved on its own after he drank glass of
water.  Had not occurred before, no recurrence.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies wheezing. Denies
chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or
changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes.

IMAGING:

[**2-13**] CXR: Severe cardiomegaly.

[**2-13**] Renal Ultrasound:Technically limited study showing normal
flow and resistive indices in the right main, upper and
interpolar renal arteries. The left main and intrarenal arteries
could not be adequately interrogated. An MRI may be obtained for
further evaluation if clinically necessary.

[**2-14**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global systolic
dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings are
most consistent with hypertensive heart disease.

[**2-15**] MRI abdomen: There are bilateral solitary renal arteries
without stenosis with conventional branching. The kidneys
demonstrate normal size, morphology and signal intensity. There
is an 8-mm cyst in the interpolar region of the left kidney.
There is a 1.6-cm hemorrhagic lesion in the upper pole of the
right kidney. Due to absence of contrast, presence of enhancing
or nodular components in this hemorrhagic lesion cannot be
[**Month/Year (2) 6349**]. The ultrasound did not demonstrate any suspicious
septation in this lesion. Adrenals are unremarkable without
lesion. Non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen and
pancreas are unremarkable.
