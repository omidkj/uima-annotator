[**Month/Day/Year **]:
1. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left  ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis with
some preservation of basal wall  motion. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**Name (NI) 5283**] sono:

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed.  The liver
demonstrates no focal lesion.  There are several calcified
gallstones without evidence of acute cholecystitis.  Flow in the
portal vein is anterograde.  There is no demonstrable ascites.
There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The left kidney measures 10.6 cm.  The right kidney measures
9.95 cm.  There are no stones, masses, or evidence of
hydronephrosis affecting either kidney.  The spleen measures
10.6 cm without focal abnormality.  The imaged portions of the
pancreas are unremarkable.  The tail is poorly visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1)  Possibly coarsened liver architecture, without focal lesion.

2)  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
GI: History of UGI bleed (NGT lavage positive on [**4-23**], clear on
morning of [**4-24**]).  GI following.  No evidence of ascites, portal
hypertension, or portal vein thrombosis on [**Date Range 5283**] u/s. Needs outpt
colonoscopy and EGD.  Will send home on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Please check
hematocrit this week.

CARDIAC:
.
A) Cor: Pt with troponin leak either from NSTEMI or
defibrillation, likely combination of the 2.  He has known CAD,
and would benefit from viability study prior to cath, which he
needs in the near future.  Will continue asa/bb/statin.  Restart
ACE. Denied chest pain during this hospitalization.

B) Pump: EF 15-20% with 1+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Severe global LV HK.  He
was not too volume overloaded during this hospitalization, but
did require lasix IV 80mg X 2.  Will d/c with lasix 80 daily and
lisinopril 5mg daily.  He may benefit from aldactone.

C) Rhythm: ICD failed to intervene during wide complex tachy
because WCT was not VT based on bedside interrogation here at
[**Hospital1 18**] by [**Doctor Last Name **].

ID: Leukocytosis on labs, but no obvious evidence of infection.
Started on azithro/CTX for Comm-acquired PNA; no consolidation
on CXR.  No ascites on abd u/s.
Stopped all antibiotics on hospital day #3 for lack of obvious
infection.
*
PULM: COPD; no active issues at this time. Extubated without
problem.  Had some hypoxia that cleared with diuresis.  He may
benefit from nightly CPAP.
