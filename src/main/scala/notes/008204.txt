History of Present Illness:
.
HPI (per floor/MICU notes, confirmed w/pt):
Briefly, 26 y/o F, flew from [**Country **] [**1-7**] for medical care,
who presents with severe hip pain, low back pain and 4 weeks of
urinary incontinence and fevers since [**2172**], although increasing
in frequency over the past few weeks. Also with occasional night
sweats, denies weight changes or change in appetite,
+intermittent nausea. Recent progression of urinary
incontinence, also associated with sensation changes in RLE. She
notes that for the past month she has been unable to feel when
she is having a bowel movement.
.
She denies known exposure to TB.
.
In ED, performed pan-spine MRI, which demonstrated collapse of
the superior and inferior endplates at L3, along with mild
enhancing epidural soft tissue changes posterior to the
vertebral body. In the right sacrum, there was a large area of
signal abnormality with adjacent soft tissue mass from S1 to S3
level, extending to the right iliacus muscle and ilium. There
also appeared to a thrombus in the IVC. CXR also suggested
bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules. She was also found to
have elevated LFTs, with ALT 48, AST 57, Alk phos 548, GGT 248,
tbili 0.8. She was admitted to the floor for further work-up.
.

Pertinent Results:
.
EKG: Q-waves, ST depressions and TWI in III. LAD, tachycardic,
normal intervals.
.
Micro: urine cx [**1-7**] with burkholderia cepacia
.
Imaging:
.
Pan-spine MRI:
CERVICAL SPINE:
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRI of the cervical
spine.
THORACIC SPINE:
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRI of the thoracic
spine. No evidence of disc herniation, bony metastasis or
epidural abscess. 1.2-cm nodular opacity in the right lower
lung.
LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION: The signal changes and associated soft tissue
extension at L3 level and within the sacrum are suggestive of
metastatic disease. The central post-gadolinium low signal seen
within the sacral mass appears to be due to central necrosis
within a tumor than an area of abscess. Probable thrombus within
the inferior vena cava. Further evaluation with abdominal and
pelvic CT recommended.
.
CT Torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive aggressive tumor involving the entire left and mid
scarum, right iliac bone, L3 and symphysis pubis which most
likely represent metastatic spread.
2. Marked involvement of the liver by large masses most likely
due to metastatic spread of unknown primary. For precise
evaluation of spinal involvement please review the MRI from
[**2175-1-8**]
3. Multiple pulmonary metastases.
4. Dermoid cyst, most likely in left ovary
.
Chest CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral massive central pulmonary embolism as described
above, involving right main, right ascending and descending,
left descending and their branches.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules in lower lobes, representing
metastasis as seen on the prior study.
3. Partially visualized heterogeneous masses in the liver
representing metastasis as seen on the prior CT scan. For
complete assessment of the abdomen and pelvis, please refer to
the official report of CT study performed a day earlier.
.
TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
LENIs:
GRAYSCALE AND DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE BILATERAL LOWER
EXTREMITIES: Normal flow, compressibility, and augmentations are
seen in bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins. There is no evidence of DVT.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
MRV [**1-9**]: 1.  Focal inferior vena caval thrombus at the L2
level.  The thrombus appears to be bland, superior in location
to the tumor-infiltrated L3 vertebral body.
2.  Multiple masses consistent with the patient's history of
metastatic disease.
3.  Splenomegaly
.
MRI brain:
1.  There is no definite evidence of intracranial metastatic
disease.
2.  Prominent pituitary gland with possible microadenoma.
Attention to this area should be paid on follow-up study.
2.  Heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the partially imaged
cervical spine.  This finding may be related to underlying
anemia versus an infiltrative process.
.
[**2175-1-20**] Repeat CT scan, Abd/Pelvis w/contrast:
1.  Thrombus in the IVC 8 cm below the tip of a suprarenal IVC
filter,
unchanged. 2.  No interval change in appearance of innumerable
soft tissue and bony metastatic lesions from prior exam dated
[**2175-1-8**]. 3.  New left lung base wedge-shaped opacity most
consistent with infarction
given the prior history of a left lower lobe pulmonary embolism.

.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
A/P:  26 y/o F, from [**Country 3587**], with h/o ovarian cyst/mass 6
years ago presenting with hip and back pain, decreased ability
to ambulate and urinary incontince, found to have widely
metastatic disease of unclear primary and bilateral PEs with
residual IVC thrombus, s/p IVC filter placement [**1-10**].
.
# Initial hospital course: On the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 13983**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a
torso CT, which confirmed the presence of soft-tissue density
masses, the largest in the left lingula, measuring 7.2cm x
6.5cm. There was also local septal thickening in the subpleural
posterior portion of the left lower lobe which could represent
focal lymphangitic spread. There was a 1.2cm hypoechoic nodule
in the thyroid. There was no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar
adenopathy, and no bony lesions in the chest.
Abdominal cuts demonstrated multiple large heterogeneous masses
involving the entire left hepatic lobe up to 6.5 cm in the most
distal portion of the lobe and 6 x 7 cm in the more medial and
lower portions with marked enlargement of the entire left lobe,
