Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Readmitted with fevers and seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2137-11-16**] Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old male who [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] replacement of the
entire ascending aorta and total arch with multibranched Dacron
graft in [**2137-10-3**]. His post-operative course was complicated
by seizures, initially with no clear etiology. He concomitantly
spiked fevers, and was found to have bacteremia with E. faecalis
(pan-sensitive) and treated appropriately with intravenous
antibiotics. Brain imaging revealed no acute process, and
seizures improved on antiepileptics and antibiotics, with mental
status gradually improving towards the end of his admission. He
was eventually discharged to ECF on [**2137-11-11**] on trach collar on
CPAP, off antibiotics. While at rehab, his ventilatory
requirements increased while he spiked a fever up to 103.4F,
with witnessed seizures, and acute renal insufficiency. Blood
cultures grew out CONS while urine culture grew out Proteus and
E. coli. He was subsequently started on Vancomycin and Zosyn,
and transferred back to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

[**2137-11-15**] Portable Chest X-ray:
In comparison to the previous chest radiograph of [**2137-11-11**], the small-to-moderate layering left pleural effusion with
left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. No newly developed
areas of consolidation or right pleural effusion. Tracheostomy
tube and cardiac pacing wires are unchanged in position. Slight
widening of the superior mediastinum is stable.
[**2137-11-16**] RUQ Ultrasound:
Gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. While
these findings can be seen in liver disease, in the appropriate
clinical setting, this may represent acute cholecystitis.
[**2137-11-16**] Chest/Abd CT Scan:
1. Markedly distended gallbladder containing stones, with wall
thickening and pericholecystic fluid, concerning for acute
cholecystitis. 2. Stable appearance of the chest with
post-surgical changes from ascending aortic repair and small
bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation. 3. Left inguinal
hernia containing a small amount of sigmoid colon, without
evidence of bowel obstruction.
[**2137-11-19**] Transesophogeal Echocardiogram:
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left and right ventricular systolic function
cannot be reliably assessed due to limited views (no gastric
views obtained due to known hernia). A mobile linear flat is
seen in the descending aorta, consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection, which was visualized at 40cm from the
incisors up to to the aortic arch. The laortic arch to the
ascending aorta was not well visualized. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with no masses or vegetations
seen. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets
consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with no mass or vegetation seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the tricuspid valve. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
pulmonic valve. A wire is seen in the right atrium entering the
right ventricle without any evident masses or vegetations.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-11-22**] 7:24 AM
Final Report
INDICATION: Status post aortic valve replacement.
COMPARISON: Recent chest radiograph from [**2137-11-20**].
In comparison to the recent chest radiograph, there has been no
significant change in the retrocardiac left lung base opacity
and the associated small left pleural effusion. The right
pleural surfaces are smooth without evidence of pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. There is stable postoperative
widening of the superior mediastinum unchanged since the prior
study. The cardiac size is mildly enlarged and stable since the
prior study. There is interval improvement in the pulmonary
vascular congestion.
Mildly twisted configuration of the tracheostomy tube is noted,
assessment of the tracheostomy tube position may be helpful. The
tube tip is positioned appropriately at a distance of about 7 cm
from the carina.
IMPRESSION:
1) No significant interval change in the left retrocardiac lobe
opacity, most likely representing atelectasis and unchanged
small left pleural effusion.
2) Mildly twisted position of the tracheostomy tube,
re-assessing the
tracheostomy tube position may be helpful.
 The study and the report were reviewed by the staff
radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] was admitted to the CVICU, and pan-cultures were
obtained. Due to hypotension, he was initially maintained on
Phenylephrine and Vasopressin. He was also started on Esmolol
gtt for rapid atrial fibrillation. The ID service was consulted
and initially recommended broadening antibiotic therapy. Work-up
was notable for rapidly rising
