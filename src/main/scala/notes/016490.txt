HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  (Per admitted [**Male First Name (un) 1573**] resident)
Ms. [**Known lastname 14575**] is a 53-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems, most notable of which is reported IgG deficiency,
renal agenesis, and a recent history of methicillin-resistant

The patient presented to an outpatient clinic on the day of
admission complaining of fevers, rigors, cough, and dyspnea.
The patient stated she awoke on [**2-10**] with a sore throat
and developed fevers to 101 degrees.  The patient's symptoms
improved by [**2-13**]; but on [**2-14**] her symptoms returned,
and she developed a cough productive of green sputum.  The
time.

On the morning of presentation, the patient complained of
rigors, shortness of breath, chest tightness with breathing,
rhinorrhea, mild headache, and bilateral ear pain.  The
patient was transferred to the Emergency Department for
evaluation and possible admission.

Her temperature in the Emergency Department was 100.1
degrees.  Blood cultures were drawn, and levofloxacin was
started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Suspected Munchausen's syndrome; the patient's primary
care physician and immunologist strongly suspect that the
patient has fabricated and/or exaggerated numerous elements
of her past medical history.  The patient has been admitted
to a number of hospitals in this state with a variety of
diagnoses.
2.  Recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia at an outside hospital ([**1-6**] through
[**2-20**] of [**2161**]).
3.  Congenital renal agenesis, with partial opposite
nephropathy.
4.  Reported IgG deficiency.
5.  Chronic pyelonephritis.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  History of multiple sclerosis by magnetic resonance
imaging in [**2149**]; stable.

ALLERGIES:  (?) PENICILLIN, SULFA, TETRACYCLINE,
AZITHROMYCIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications include
Cardizem, dyazide, Synthroid, Lipitor, Provera, Estrogen
patch.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a first grade teacher.  She
has spent many months in the last several years in a variety
of hospitals in the state.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   (Per admitting [**Male First Name (un) 1573**]
resident)  Temperature of 100.4, heart rate of 104,
respiratory rate of 16, blood pressure of 104/60, satting 98%
on room air.  In general, uncomfortable, with rigors, in no
acute distress.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed slightly
tachycardic, a regular rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, mildly tender in the left upper quadrant
and left flank.  Positive costovertebral angle tenderness.
Positive bowel sounds.  No rebound or guarding.  Extremities
revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pedal pulses were
2+.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.
Positive nuchal rigidity.  Positive photophobia.  Funduscopic
examination revealed no obvious papal edema.  Negative
Brudzinski sign was noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on presentation with complete blood count which revealed a
white blood cell count of 11.5 (with a differential of 83%
neutrophils, no bands, and 13% lymphocytes).  Hematocrit
was 32.5, platelets were 392.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium
of 139, potassium of 3.6, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 24,
blood urea nitrogen of 28, creatinine of 1.4, blood sugar
of 96.  Urinalysis revealed 0 white blood cells and 0 red
blood cells, occasional bacteria, 0 epithelial cells, a pH
of 5.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was unremarkable and
unchanged from prior study of [**2160-4-6**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 2399**] Medicine Service for further evaluation and
treatment of her above-noted symptoms.  At the time of the
patient's initial presentation to the Medicine Service (as
well as to the Emergency Department), the house staff were
unaware of the patient's history of suspected Munchausen's
syndrome.

Following admission, blood and urine cultures were obtained,
and the patient underwent a lumbar puncture which did not
reveal any evidence of meningitis.

Given the patient's history of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus as well as the concern for meningitis,
the patient was initially covered with broad spectrum
antibiotics including vancomycin, gentamicin, and
ceftriaxone.  Shortly following the patient's lumbar
puncture, the patient's peripheral intravenous line
reportedly fell out, and the intravenous line teams were
unable to obtain further peripheral access.  Thus, the
patient underwent placement of a right femoral line without
complications.

On [**2-17**], the patient became quite stridorous.  Although
her oxygen saturation remained normal, her symptoms were
worrisome enough that the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was treated with racemic
epinephrine for her stridor.  This intervention did not have
any significant effect.  The Ear/Nose/Throat Service was
consulted and felt that the patient exhibited paradoxical
vocal cord movement.  Her airway was not felt to be in any
danger whatsoever.  The patient was also deemed to have
bilateral otitis externa. Thus, she was treated with
ciprofloxacin Otic drops and ear wicks.

An abdominal CT obtained while the patient was in the
Intensive Care Unit revealed no evidence of pyelonephritis
nor hydronephrosis.  There was evidence of a tiny (1 mm)
nonobstructing calculous in the left kidney.

The patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit and was
transferred back to the medicine floor on [**2162-2-18**].
Although the patient continued to exhibit periodic stridor,
her oxygen saturation remained excellent throughout her
hospital course.  Her symptoms did not seem to respond
significantly to racemic epinephrine.

A Psychiatry consultation was obtained.  The patient was felt
to have an adjustment disorder with dysthymia.  The
Psychiatry team did not feel that the patient's condition
warranted antidepressants at that time.

Information relayed from [**Hospital6 14576**] revealed that
the patient's positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus history was related to a wound site infection (site
unknown) on [**2161-12-11**], as well as positive culture from
a line tip ([**2161-12-12**]).  There was no record at [**Hospital6 14577**] of any blood cultures being positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Regarding the patient's purported history of IgG deficiency,
several studies were sent including IgG (which was found to
be 895), IgA (which was found to be 163), and IgM (which was
found to be 201).  All were within normal limits.  The
patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone level was also found to
be within normal limits at 1.6; and, thus, she was maintained
on her outpatient dose of Synthroid.

The patient's antibiotics, by this point, had been weaned
down to levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. (for possible
bronchitis) and the above-noted Otic drops.

Over the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, she did
well.  Her femoral line was removed, and she ambulated
without difficulty.  The patient's Foley catheter was also
removed, and she subsequently produced ample urine output.
Also, the patient was eating well.  The patient was
discharged home on [**2162-2-21**] with a prescription for
levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin Otic drops.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's blood and
cerebrospinal fluid cultures remained negative.  Also, direct
influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus
antigen tests were negative.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was afebrile,
stable vital signs.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Suspected Munchausen's syndrome.
2.  Low-grade fever; cause unknown.
3.  Stridor, attributable to paradoxic vocal cord movement.
4.  Otitis externa.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow up with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at her
discretion.  Also, the patie
