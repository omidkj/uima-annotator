Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old male with a history of esophageal and
prostate cancers in remission and recent admissions in [**Month (only) **]
and [**Month (only) 359**] for pneumonia who presents with two days of rapidly
progressive shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow
and black sputum. The patient reports that his breathing was
last at baseline one week ago when he developed a productive
cough. He denies associated fevers, chills or night sweats. He
thinks that he has likely lost weight but he cannot quantify. He
developed shortness of breath two days ago which has been
rapidly progressive to the point that he is no longer able to
talk comfortably. He denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. He denies hemoptysis prior to the day of presentation.
He denies chest pain. He endorses myalgias and weakness. He
received both seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccines. He denies
known sick contacts.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.1 P: 75 BP: 117/90 R: 22 O2 sa
97% on NRB. He received one liter of normal saline. He received
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 and vancomycin 1 gram x 1. He had CXR
which showed bilateral infiltrates worse on the left side. He
was noted to have frank hemoptysis which he reports as
consisting of blood on a tissue. He was admitted to the MICU for
further management.

On arrival to the floor he is speaking in short sentences,
complains of difficulty breathing. He denies fevers, chills,
night sweats, chest pain, pleurisy. He endorses nausea and
vomiting x 1. He denies abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea,
dysuria, hematuria, leg pain, leg swelling or rashes. He
endorses myalgias. All other review of systems negative in
detail.

CXR admission
INDICATION: 59-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer
and multiple pneumonias in the past presents with shortness of
breath and cough with wheeze and rales. Evaluate for pneumonia.
COMPARISON: Multiple studies including most recent chest
radiograph of
[**2126-12-8**].
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: There is bilateral multifocal
airspace opacity which is most pronounced in the left upper lobe
and concerning for pneumonia.  There may be a small right
pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. Two crescentic
opacities projecting over the right upper mediastinum are likely
related to prior gastric pull-through. The aorta is slightly
tortuous, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
unremarkable. Hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are
normal.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity concerning for
pneumonia.

CXR [**2127-2-16**]
Final Report
STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2127-2-16**].

HISTORY: 59-year-old man with crack lung. Evaluate for acute
cardiopulmonary
process.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2127-2-13**].

There are again seen bilateral asymmetric airspace opacities
affecting the
left lung greater than the right. The opacities in the right
lung at the
upper lobe are slightly more apparent. There is a persistent
unchanged right-
sided pleural effusion. There is also some thickening of the
right apex,
which is unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but also
stable.



Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old man with a history of esophageal and prostate
cancers in remission and recent admissions in [**Month (only) **] and
[**Month (only) 359**] for pneumonia who presents with two days of rapidly
progressive shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow
and black sputum in the setting of recent crack cocaine use. On
balance, we think that this presentation is likely ??????crack lung??????
vs CAP.
.
# Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Initially concerning for PNA,
therefore pt was started on treatment for HAP given a recent
hospital admission two months ago. There was initially some
concern for sepsis given elevated lactate, therefore pt was
admitted to the ICU. While in the ICU, pt required
non-rebreather to maintain sats in the 90s, and was able to be
transferred to the floor on 2L NC after one day. He did not
manifest septic physiology or symptoms. He has had two
presentations for pneumonia since [**Month (only) **] of unclear etiology,
raising concern for atypicals and chronic processes. HIV,
legionella, influenza A/B, AFBs x3, PPD all negative.
Alternatively, interstitial pneumonitis and acute lung injury
from crack use is possible, perhaps with a superimposed
infection, a repeat CXR later in admission showed improvement of
opacities; however, the pt still had a
