Allergies:

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
 Recurrent Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation ([**5-30**])

History of Present Illness:
 This is a 69 y/o male with significant medical history of CAD
s/p MI and [**2146**] and [**2152**] CABG( LIMA to LAD, and Y graft with SVG
from the aorta to first OM and diagonal), systolic congestive
heart failure (EF-15% [**1-/2174**]), chronic atrial fibrillation,
severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, biventricular [**Company 1543**]
ICD, PVD s/p left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass who is transferred to CCU s/p
VT ablation on [**5-30**] due to hypotension.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2174-5-24**]
with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (while on Sotalol, beta
blocker, and ICD) associated with syncope while sitting in his
chair at home.  Device interrogation revealed an episode of VT
that was initially treated unsuccessfully with pacing and
required 1 shock of 30 joules. The patient's Sotalol was
increased, with beta blocker continued, and his Coumadin was
stopped in preparation for VT ablation.  The patient denies
chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness,
orthopnea, LE edema or any further episodes of syncope.
.
In the cath lab, found to have inferoposterior and
posterolateral scars, however he is presenting with hypotension.
 During the procedure two different ventricular tachycardias
were induced which degenerated into ventricular fibrilliation
and shocked, and both foci were radio frequency ablated.  The
procedure was done under general anesthesia,  and he recieved
2.5 L fluids. The sheath pulled in recovery room.  The patient
has poor lower extremity pulses at baseline and continues to do
so post ablation.  He is currently on  Dopamine 6 mcg/kg/min,
with systolic BPs in 90s.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 107693**]
Reason: eval lung fields



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   69 year old man with h/o CHF, vtach. underwent VT ablation,
VF arrested
   intraop. likely fluid overload. +crackles
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval lung fields



Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Suspected fluid overload.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
available for
comparison.

The current study demonstrates moderately enlarged cardiac
silhouette in a
patient after median sternotomy and CABG. The pacemaker
defibrillator leads
terminate in right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricular
epicardial
vein. There is bilateral hilar prominence with some minimal
perihilar
opacities, findings that might be consistent with mild volume
overload. In
addition, there are bibasal interstitial opacities that although
might
represent part of vascular engorgement, may also be attributed
to chronic
interstitial changes and should be reevaluated after diuresis.
Small amount
of bilateral left more than right pleural effusion is present.
There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.
