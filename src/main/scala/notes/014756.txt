Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-2-17**] - Aortic Valve Replacement(19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve)


History of Present Illness:
This 46 year old female has a history of a heart murmur since
age 5 and bicuspid aortic valve has has been followed with
serial echocardiograms. Over the past 6 months, she has noticed
a decrease in exercise tolerance with symptoms of fatigue, chest
heaviness and dyspnea on exertion. Despite her symptoms, she
remains very active with biking and walking. Her most recent
echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis with worsened
gradients. Given the progression of her disease and worsened
symptoms, she has been referred for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2164-2-17**] ECHO: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
POST-BYPASS:The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes. There is a
prosthetic aortic valve which is well-seated, with no AI and no
leaks.Residual mean gradient = 5 mmHg.Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) 5544**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Preserved biventicular systolic fxn. Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
She  was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-2-17**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent aortic valve replacement
using a 19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent mechanical valve. Please see
operative note for details. Of note, an ON-X valve was not used
due to size mismatch.

Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
one, she was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. Beta blocker was initiated and she was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  Heparin was
initiated as a bridge to Coumadin for her mechanical valve.  It
took several days for the INR to become therapeutic on Coumadin.


At the time of discharge on [**2-25**] the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.

Coumadin management will be arranged [**2-27**] as she no longer deals
with [**Location (un) 2274**].  Results if INR [**2-27**] to be called to our office and
we will speak with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**]. She would like to use [**Hospital **]
Hospital's anticoagulation service.  She's to take 2.5mg of
Coumadin 3/24&25.
