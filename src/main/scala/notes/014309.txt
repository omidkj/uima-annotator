History of Present Illness:
78-year-old NH resident with COPD on 2L NC, DM, CAD s/p multiple
PCI admitted after a mechanical fall. Was well until [**10-16**] when a
RLL infiltrate was noted on CXR. Treated with levofloxacin 500
mg x 7 days as an outpatient without improvement. Admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 17343**] for altered mental status and was treated with
levofloxacin 750 mg x 10 days (ended [**10-27**]) for pneumonia and
prednisone taper (ended [**11-7**]) for COPD exacerbation.
Reports having had a mechanical fall on the morning of admission
when he leaned forward on a folding food table that subsequently
collapsed. He denies head trauma, loss of consciousness, or
prodromal dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, sweating, chest
pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or nausea. He denies
having sustained any bodily injury. He endorses cough with brown
sputum that is unchanged in quality but increased in quantity.
He's had diarrhea that he cannot quantify or state when it
began. No fever, chills, sweats, weight change, abdominal pain,
vomiting, hematochezia, or melena. EMS records reflect episodes
of desaturation to 87%on 2L NC but documented recent
noncompliance with O2.
In the ED, initial VS 97.3 87 153/87 32 84%RA (although also
documented as 84%4L on triage notes). CXR showed an unchanged
small R pleural effusion and increase in a patchy RLL patchy
opacity compared with a study from [**10-24**]. Given vancomycin 1 g,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV, ceftriaxone 1 g, solumedrol 125 mg IV,
nebulized bronchodilators. BP 211/112 given SL NTG then SBP
86/50, given 500 cc with improvement in sbp 135 given another
500 cc bolus for a total of 1.5L in the ED. Vital signs prior to
transfer T 98.2 HR 113 afib BP 117/52 RR 20-22 O2sat 92%4L NC.
Upon arrival in the MICU, the patient is hungry but otherwise
without complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
78-year-old NH resident with COPD on 2L NC, DM, CAD s/p multiple
PCI admitted after a mechanical fall with radiographic evidence
of worsening healthcare associated pneumonia.  Hospital course
by problem:
.
#Healthcare associated PNA: On admission, the patient was
hemodynamically stable and afebrile with a mild leukocytosis and
no oxygen requirement above baseline.  His CT scan, however,
showed multifocal infiltrates, more prominently in the right
lung.  Our differential was a resistent organism or persistent
aspiration.  He was started on IV vancomycin and cefepime
empirically as he has failed extensive quinolone therapy and has
a macrolide allergy.  His sputum culture showed only commensal
flora and blood cultures are negative to date.  His sputum gram
stain did show gram negative rods and we were concerned for
pseudomonas or MRSA infection.  He should therefore get a 14-day
course of cefepime and vancomycin.  A PICC line was placed so
that the IV antibiotics could be given at his nursing home.  He
was also given chest physical therapy, producing large amounts
of brown-tinged sputum.  This should be continued if possible.
The patient was admitted on 2L of Oxygen by nasal cannula from
rehab.  It does not appear that he uses Oxygen normally at home.
 He can be weaned off of Oxygen as tolerated.
He was also evaluated for aspiration.  He reports that he
sometimes coughs while eating meals.  A bed-side swallowing exam
was normal.  A video swallow study showed trace penetration with
thin liquids but no signs of aspiration.  He should tuck his
chin while drinking thin liquids and take small bites.
.
# Type II diabetes: He was hypoglycemic at times, down to a
fingerstick of 44 one morning and 67 one day before dinner.  His
home NPH dosing was reduced to 25units before breakfast and
dinner, with improvement in his glucose levels. His sliding
scale insulin was reduced.
.
#COPD - He did not have signs of a COPD exacerbation and was
continued on his spiriva with nebulizers as needed.  While he
arrived on 2 liters of Oxygen by nasal cannula, he does not use
O2 at home and should be weaned off of this as tolerated.  He
was not given steroids.  He was not interested in quitting
smoking at this time.
.
#Atrial fibrillation - His aspirin dose was increased to 325mg
daily as he is not a candidate for warfarin given his frequent
falls.  His beta blocker was increased to give better rate
control, to 75mg twice a day.  This can be increased further as
an outpatient as tolerated.
.
#Dementia: The patient was continued on his home doses of
donezepil, paroxetine and mirtazapine.  He often sun-downed and
needed redirection, but antipsychotics or restraints were not
needed.
.
#Code status: The patient was DNR with possible intubation, as
documented in hi
