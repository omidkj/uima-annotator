Brief Hospital Course:
PT admitted for Laparoscopic R partial nephrectomy.  On POD 1 pt
had distended abdomen, tymapnic, with tenderness to palpation.
HCt dropped from 36 ro 26 without evidence clinically as pt was
normocardic and normotensive.  Ct scan showed no evidence of
acute bleed.  IR was consulted but decision was made not to
intervene.  Pt was transfused two units and decision was made to
transfer to MICU.  Over course of nest tow days pt was
transfused three more times, without incident.  Pts HCt
stablized on POD3.  Pt hd history of chronic AF, and during MICU
stay had two runs of Persistent PVC's and cardiology was
consulted.  Cardiology's recomendations were put in to effect
and pt did well.  Pt passed flatus and had a BM on POD 3, and
continued normal bowel movements throughout the rest to hospital
stay.  PT was cleared for transfer to floor on POD 3, but bed
was not available until POD 5.  ON POD5 foley was removed
without complication, pt voided, and JP drain output did not
significantly increase.  On POD 6 pt was cleared for discharge
with proper follow up.  JP drain Crt was 1.6 and fluid output
was minimal.  Jp was d/c'd prior to discharge.  PT's pain was
well controlled throughout hospital stay.
