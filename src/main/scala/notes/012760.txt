Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
tramadol / lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78 y/o female with history of non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy with EF of 15-20%, HTN, asthma, GERD, TIA who
presents with increased fatigue and shortness of breath.
Patient states she has been feeling more tired and dyspneic on
exertion.  She can usually walk 2 blocks without any SOB but
this has worsened in the past few weeks.  She consistently wakes
up in the middle of the night coughing and needs 2 pillows to
lie down comfortably.  No new swelling in abdomen or legs.
Patient did report some nausea this morning but no vomiting.
She had been maintaining a low sodium diet and taking all of her
prescribed medications.  She denies any recent fevers, chills,
diarrhea.  Patient also has chronic chest pain which has been
documented as below.  She does not monitor her BP at home but
per ED notes the BP determined by the EMS was systolic at 200.

She was recently hospitalized for concern of a LV thrombus on an
echo after complaints of chest pain- admitted and put on heparin
drip but no thrombus was confirmed on formal echo with contrast.
 She also received a recent right and left heart cath with
normal coronary arteries and recent echo showed focal LV
dysfunction at 15-20% down from 40% one year prior and mildly
elevated pressures.  Patient follows with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  She recently saw him as an outpatient on [**2130-8-1**] who
ordered HIV and hemochromatosis workup to assess etiology of
this non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He also increased her
metoprolol succinate to 50 mg daily as rate was in upper 70s.
Additionally, the prospect of ICD placement was brought up given
her low EF of 15-20%

In the ED, her initial vitals were Pulse: 77, RR: 18, BP:
138/48, and hypoxic in the 80s which corrected with BiPAP.  A
nitro gtt was started and patient received 80 mg lasix with 2 mg
Ondansetron for nausea.  Patient was transferred up to the CCU
with similar vitals and saturating in the high 90s on BiPap.
She had one episode of vomiting which was relieved with 4 mg
ondansetron and switch to face mask ventilation.  The history
was obtained from the patient and her husband.

TTE [**2130-8-9**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. The basal inferolateral wall contracts best (LVEF =
20 %). There is visual dysnnchrony. No definite masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
severe global hypokinesis c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-6-28**],
left ventricular systolic function is similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2125**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 y/o female with PMHx of HTN induced cardiomyopathy
who presents with symptoms clearly indicating a CHF
exacerbation.
.
#Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure:  Patient has lost
significant function in the last year as echo from [**2129**] with EF
of 40%, likely secondary to poorly controlled HTN.
