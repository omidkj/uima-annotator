Multiple smaller areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage throughout
both
cerebral hemispheres with more focal collection noted
paramedially adjacent to the left frontal lobe.

underlying fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and emergently brought to the OR where under
general anesthesia a right parieto-occipital craniotomy for
evacuation of an intracerebral hemorrhage was performed.  Pt
tolerated this procedure, was kept intubated and transferred to
TICU.  Her SBP was maintained 90-140.  Her vital signs were
stable.  On POD#1 she was following some commands on the right
but continued with left weakness. Post op CT showed good
appearance with decreased amount of hemorrhage. She did spike a
temperature and fever work up revealed pneumonia and she was
begun on antibiotics.  She had many secretions and in addition
to her depressed mental status she was not able to be extubated.
 There was a family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of
TICU. Pt's family appreciated information and decided to make
the patient DNR. She was placed on comfort measures only on the
evening of [**2110-4-29**]. She passed away in the AM of [**2110-4-30**].
