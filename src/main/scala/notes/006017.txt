CT Head:
1. 16 x 16 mm rounded slightly hyperattenuated mass lesion seen
centered about the right frontal lobe concerning for neoplasm
(likely metastasis given history).
2. Area of confluent vasogenic edema predominantly centered
about the right frontal lobe white matter, with associated mass
effect with complete
obliteration of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle
and near-complete obliteration of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle. Associated leftward midline shift of likely
greater than 1cm with subfalcine herniation.
.
CXR:
Stable chest x-ray examination consistent with prior lung
resection and likely radiation therapy. No superimposed acute
process identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 59 y.o female with h.o breast cancer, bladder cancer,
recent lung cancer s/p surgery and chemo who presents with
weakness, headache found to have new brain mets.
She was initially admited to the Oncology team and montiored in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Her mental status appeared to be waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**].  A CT
of the head was done and notable for 16 by 16mm mass in R
frontal lobe w/ associated edema and leftward midline shift of
1cm with subfalcine herniation. She was started on dexamethasone
6mg q4hours, she was loaded w/ dilantin for seizure ppx, her
Wellbutrin held due to increase seizure threshold. An MRI of the
head on [**2-13**] showed: Right frontal lobe enhancing mass at grey
and white matter junction, measuring 1.5 X 2.4 cm, could
represent metastasis given location. 1.8 cm leftward subfalcine
herniation. No evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from neuro-oncology saw the patient and recommended
surgical evacuation of the mass. She underwent a right frontal
craniotomy on [**2-17**]. She remianed stable post-operatively. On
[**2-20**] her MRI imaging was reviewed, this was stable. She was seen
by PT who evaluated her and worked with her daily in her
hospitalization. At the time of discharge the patient was
cleared to go home with PT.
