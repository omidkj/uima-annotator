Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 year-old female with a history significant
for stage IV sarcoidosis with combined restrictive/obstructive
disease, asthma, dCHF, and pulmonary HTN who was initially
admitted to the MICU with two days of worsening shortness of
breath and wheezing.  Productive cough w/ clear sputum and
SOB/wheezing that progressively worsened while visiting her
family in [**Doctor First Name 5256**] for [**Holiday 1451**].  However, she was
able to wait until she got off the flight back to [**Location (un) 86**] to come
to the hospital.
.
No intubations for asthma exacerbations in the past.  She was
last hospitalized about a year ago.  At [**Holiday 1451**] in North
[**Doctor First Name **], she notes recent contact with 2 young children with
URI symptoms.  She has received her influenza and pneumovax
vaccines. Upon arriving to the ED, her vitals were significant
for RR 36 and 99% on continuous nebs.  She was given
methylpredisolone 125mg IV and Levaquin/Ceftriaxone for a
concerning apical infiltrate on CXR.
.
In the MICU, antibiotics were broadened to
Vanc/Cefepime/Levaquin, in setting of advanced lung disease
secondary to sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, and severe
COPD, asthma, and a history of MRSA.  She was weaned from
continuous albuterol and iptratropium nebs to q4h and started
back on her home montelukast, albuterol MDI, and Advair.  Her
steroid regimen was changed to methylpredisolone 60mg IV q8h.
Upon transfer, her O2 requirement is at 1L O2 NC.

IMAGING / STUDIES:
CXR ([**2154-12-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis from end-stage pulmonary sarcoidosis.

represent a
superimposed infectious or inflammatory process.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year old female with a hx of end-stage sarcoidosis,
COPD/asthma, dCHF, and pulmonary HTN who was initially admitted
to the MICU with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure,
likely [**2-19**] to viral etiology vs. presumed apical pneumonia and
COPD exacerbation in setting of profound lung disease.
.
#. Respiratory: She has significant pulmonary fibrosis [**2-19**]
sarcoidosis as well as severe COPD and asthma, with yearly
admissions for respiratory difficulties. With new apical
infiltrates on CXR + wheezing with improvement on nebulizers,
COPD exacerbation on a background of profoundly diseased lungs
was considered to be the most likely cause. She was initially
admitted to the MICU due to hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory
failure (pH 7.23, pCO2 74) and started on continuous nebulizer
treatments, IV steroids, and broad antibiotic coverage.  Once
her neb treatments were spaced to every 4 hours, she was
transferred to the floor, where her antibiotics were eventually
narrowed to Levaquin alone for coverage of community acquired
pneumonia for a total 7-day course.  Pulmonary was consulted and
recommended a 12-day steroid taper upon discharge, as well as
her current home regimen of nebulized and inhaled
bronchodilators and sildenafil/verapimil treatments for
pulmonary hypertension.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] two weeks after discharge and will be sent home with
VNA for continued monitoring of her respiratory status.
.
#. Metabolic alkalosis: Likely compensation of CO2
retention/respiratory acidosis.  Her alkalosis continued to
worsen up until discharge, but her clinical condition improved,
satting well on 1L O2.  She is normally on 0.5L O2 at home.
.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: She remained euvolemic on exam, no
pulmonary edema on CXR, no JVD, and no LE edema.  She did
require a small dose of Lasix over one evening for worsening
shortness of breath.  Otherwise, she was stable on her
every-3-days regimen on furosemide.
