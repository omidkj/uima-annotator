Brief Hospital Course:
76 M with CML on gleevec, CHF EF 25%, CAD, chronic renal disease
(baseline Cr 1.1-1.7), presents with fatigue, lightheadedness,
and Hct 15 from slow GI bleeding.
.
# GI Bleeding:
EGD performed on [**8-29**] showed old blood in stomach with fresh
blood in duodenum but no source of bleeding. Serial Hcts were
checked, showing a slow GIB. Hct was maintained at >28 for
cardiac ischemia. He was guaiac positive in the ED with stable
VS throughout. His baseline hematocrit was 30, attributed to CML
and gleevec therapy. In the MICU, he received 5U PRBC. Iron
studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, with
normal B12 and folate. INR was unremarkable at 1.3, likely from
nutrition. Patient was placed on PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Plan is for patient to
follow up for Hcts intermittently, to monitor whether periodic
pRBC transfusions will be required. For cardiac ischemia, goal
Hct would be >28.
.
# Elevated INR:
INR on admission was 4.9, was brought down to <1.5 for EGD.
Patient is on coumadin, likely for severe left global
hypokinesis (apex was not commented) and history of CVA.
Coumadin was held during admission. Plan is to follow up with
PCP as outpatient regarding whether Coumadin should be
restarted.
.
# CML:
Follows with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**], and has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the past. Gleevec was continued throughout admission. In
response to Gleevec, patient had vomiting when he was not able
to eat meals, but he tolerated Gleevec well with no vomiting
when he was able to take his med with meals.
.
# CAD:
Patient was maintained on metoprolol, but not on ASA inhouse
because of possible interaction with Gleevec. Statin was
continued. Issue of restarting ASA should be addressed with his
PCP.
.
# CHF:
He has an EF 25% in [**2190**] with ICD in place. Repeat ECHO showed
unchanged LV function but worsening mitral regurgitation. He was
euvolemic on exam throughout admission.
.
# Depression:
Effexor was continued during admission.
