Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis Catheter placement, pheresis catheter placement and
removal

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78861**] is a 54 year old female with a history of
multiple myeloma s/p autologous transplant and dendritic cell
fusion vaccine protocol with progression of disease in the CNS
and has been treated with revlimid, velcade, deacadron and
cytoxan. She last received chemo last tuesday and now presents
with one day history of fever to 100.4. She denies any chills or
rigor. No cough, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. No dysuria. In
ED, she was febrile to 99.7 and physical exam revealed no focal
source. Labs revealed wcc of 0.9. She's pancultured and started
on vanco and cefepime. She's admitted for further management.

Past Medical History:
She first developed left posterior rib pain in [**2111**] and was
found to have multiple destructive rib lesions. CT-guided biopsy
showed plasmacytoma. She underwent radiation therapy, finishing
in 04/[**2111**]. Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and
a question of light chain in the urine. Bone marrow showed a
modest increase in plasma cells without clear evidence of
clonality.

In [**2-/2113**] she was found to have SPEP with monoclonal IgG kappa,
light chain in the urine. She had a bone bone marrow biopsy,
which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining
and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast. The
patient underwent a
repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in

the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9. She was referred
to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for
approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction. She also
participated in the dendritic cell fusion gene protocol. She
underwent 4 cycles of velcade and decadron.

Pt had auto-SCT [**2113-10-16**] on "Vaccination with DC/Tumor cells
fusion in conjunction with Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
in Patients with Multiple Myeloma" protocol. In [**2114-3-21**] the
patient had acute diplopia and was found to have a CNS
plasmacytoma and underwent radiation therapy. She is currently
C1D20 on Velcade.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Irregular menstrual cycles (one per year), found to have an
ovarian cyst.
- Status post breast augmentation in ([**2079**]) by direct silicone
injection
- Gallstones

Social History:
She worked in a library in periodicals but is taking a leave of
absence during treatment. She has been married for 20 years. She
has four children, three of whom live at home. She had smoked
one pack per day and stopped approximately 25 years ago.

LENIs [**2-11**]:
 No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2-8**]:
1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance in the anterior
portion of the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days
ago, could represent
inflammatory or early infection.
5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib,
right
scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of
multiple
myeloma.

VQ Scan: [**2-8**]
1. Limited study due to low tracer count on the ventilation
study.
2. Low probablilty of pulmonary embolism

Echo:
Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic
windows but appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very
small posterior pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.

Chest Xray [**2115-2-26**]: Right PICC terminating in the proximal SVC in
appropriate position. No evidence of active or inactive
tuberculosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
54F with multiple myeloma s/p cytoxan, revlimid, velcade,
decadron admitted for febrile neutropenia.

#. Febrile Neutropenia: Initially there was no clear source
clinically and imaging and cultures were not revealing. She was
started on cefepime and vancomycin.  Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for
recurrent temps. Culture data remained non-revealing.  She was
treated w/ vanc/cefepime, acyclovir and voriconazole.
Eventually antibiotics were discontinued and she remained
afebrile.

#. Acute Renal Failure: On admission she was noted to have an
elevated creatinine from her baseline. It was originally thought
that there may have been a pre-renal component due to reduced PO
intake following chemotherapy. She was given IVF hydration with
limited improvement in her creatinine.  She had a large amount
of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein in her urine and ultimately her renal
failure was felt to be due to progression of her multiple
myeloma.  She started hemodialysis without complication, and
also underwent 5 sessions of pheresis with no signs of renal
recovery.  She was discharged with outpatient HD scheduled at
[**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center at 11am on Tues/Thurs/Sat
schedule.

#. Multiple Myeloma: Her initial presentation and renal failure
were felt to be due to progression of her multiple myeloma.  She
underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and her IgG levels
decreased significantly.  She also underwent high dose
cyclophosphamide followed by 3 doses of Velcade, although the
fourth dose was held due to thrombocytopenia.  Given that she is
now on hemodialysis, it was planned that after discharge, she
would receive chemo if neccessary on dialysis days in the late
afternoon, at 7Feldberg if the clinic was closed.

#. Respiratory distress: She was initially extensively hydrated
on the floor in the setting of her presenting infection.  She
then developed respiratory distress thought to be secondary to
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload with
probable cardiac component (EF 40%, though this was poor quality
on echo).  She was diuresed aggresively (with metolazone and
lasix).  She was treated initially w/ clinda and primaquine for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this was d/c'd as CXR and O2 status showed interval
improvement with diuresis.  On her final CXR, there was no
evidence of volume overload.

#. AMS: She had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status during this
hospitalization.  Her c
