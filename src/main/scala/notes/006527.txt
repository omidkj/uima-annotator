Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the vascular surgical service. After informed
consent was obtained and carefully informing her of all the
potential risks of the procedure, she still decided to proceed
with the operation. Accordingly, she was taken emergently to the
operating room with the cardiac surgical team. She underwent a
1) Repair of contained rupture of thoracoabdominal aneurysm with
30-mm Gelweave graft.  Cold circulatory arrest. Atrial femoral
bypass 2) Graft from distal to the left subclavian artery at the
proximal anastomosis, distal anastomosis beveled include all the
visceral vessels on [**2141-2-26**].  Intraoperative fluids included 6L
crystalloid, 3700ml of pRBC, 2300 ml of FFP, 600ml platelets,
670ml cryoprecipitate. The chest was closed and abdomen was
packed opened due to her critical state. Please refer to
operative note for more details.

Postoperatively, she was transferred to the CVICU for
monitoring. She needed aggressive resuscitation. Chest tube
output was with 1L of sanguinous drainage after 1.5 hours. She
develped extensive subcutaneous emphysema to her chest
bilaterally. There was trouble attempting to ventilate the
patient. Chest X-ray showing completely opacified left lung.
Despite chest tube with high output, it was still clotted off
and required frequent stripping. The decision was to place
another tube to decompress the chest, subcutaneous air and
facilitate drainage. While attempting to place the chest tube,
massive clot exsanguinated from the chest. There was copious
amounts and profuse drainage. Patient's pressure began to drop
and she was coded for approximately 3 minutes. Level I
transfusion protocol was initiated. Pt's was still critically
unstable and hypotensive. The decision by all members of staff -
vascular surgery, cardiac surgery and ICU team was to withdraw
measures given already high morbidity.

She was pronounced dead at 218pm.

Medical examiner declined autopsy.
