History of Present Illness:
84 y/o woman with multiple medical problems including HTN, CAD,
Diastolic Dysfunction, and chronic pain [**3-17**] multiple issues
presents to the medical service with LLQ abdominal pain. She
visited the emergency department yesterday and was discahrged
after an evaluation was performeed. A CT scan did not identify a
likely etiology of her LLQ pain. Abdominal plain films
demonstrated no air-fluid levels, no free air. She was
discharged from the emergency room at that time. She called her
physicians, however, later in the day with continued symptoms of
LLQ pain, nausea and diarrhea x 1, and she returned to the ER.
.
Labs at that time were notable for a WBC of 12.8. She did spike
a temperature to 101.3 and was started empirically on Cipro and
Flagyl for presumed diverticulitis. Due to a history of
encarcerated hernia, her [**Month/Day (2) 3390**] wanted surgery to consult on the
patient. Surgery recommended serial abdominal exams and to
rescan in 48 hours if she is not improved.
.
She was seen by her [**Month/Day (2) 3390**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] in the ED, who agreed with
continued conservative management with IVF, bowel rest, and
antibiotics.

Imaging:
.
[**2103-10-12**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
.
[**10-12**] Bilateral LE Ultrasound: No evidence of lower extremity DVT
bilaterally.
.
[**2103-10-13**] CT Abd and pelvis w/o contrast:
1. Colonic diverticulosis but no evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
2. Unchanged prominence of the extra- and intra-hepatic biliary
tree in this patient status post cholecystectomy. Stable
hyperdense exophytic right renal lesion, incompletely
characterized without contrast. If not further worked up, this
can be attempted to be better defined with a dedicated MRI or
ultrasound.
3. Unchanged appearance of suspicious endometrial lesion better
described on previous vaginal ultrasound and continues to be
suspicious for underlying malignancy.
4. Mild tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe
representing an
infectious bronchiolitis.
.
[**2103-10-13**] AXR: No free intraperitoneal air. Nonspecific bowel gas
pattern,
without evidence for obstruction.
.
[**2103-10-14**] RUQ US:
1. No evidence of choledocholithiasis in the visualized portion
of the common bile duct; however, most distal aspect is not
visualized.
2. Chronic biliary ductal dilatation.
.
[**2103-10-14**] CT abd and pelvis w/o contrast:
1. Interval development of acute diverticulitis with perforation
in the mid descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**] and intra-abdominal free air.
2. No fluid collection or abscess.
3. Unchanged prominence of the extra and intrahepatic biliary
system.
4. Stable hyperdense exophytic left renal lesion, for which
workup was
previously recommended.
5. Unchanged appearance of suspicious endometrial lesion for
which workup was previously recommended.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (medicine)
and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (surgery) early morning [**2103-10-15**].
.
[**2103-10-16**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**10-15**], some atelectatic
changes persist at the bases. No evidence of acute focal
pneumonia. The various tubes remain in place.
Free air cannot be identified or unequivocally excluded on this
image. This would require CT or a lateral view.
.
[**2103-10-17**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**10-16**], there is slightly
more prominence of opacification at the bases consistent with
some combination of atelectasis and effusion. Tubes remain in
place.
.
[**2103-10-21**] CXR: Worsening volume loss and consolidation/effusion in
the left
lower lobe.
.
[**2103-10-24**] Bilateral LE Ultrasound: No evidence of right or left
lower extremity DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Diverticulitis with perforation: Pt was admitted for severe
LLQ abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. Pt underwent a series of imaging that initially
revealed no etiology for her symptoms.  She was started on
ciprofloxacin and flagyl for suspected diverticulitis.  With
persistence of symptoms over the first 48 hours of admission,
repeat imaging was performed.  The repeat CT scan of abdomen and
pelvis performed on [**2103-10-15**] revealed perforated diverticulitis.
Pt was taken to the operating room where a hemicolectomy with
diverting colostomy was performed without complication.  Pt was
