Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
cough and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular vein central venous catheter
PICC line
Cardioversion for a-fib


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 yo F w/ hx of COPD, htn, and two recent admissions
for PAF and CHF exacerbation who presents with exacerbation of
chronic cough and nausea with fever for two days.
Pt. states that she has experienced a chronic cough which is
mostly dry but with occasional clear sputum production for
around 5 months. This cough, however, does not limit her ADLs or
exercise tolerance as pt states she can usually walk "as far as
I want." About 3 weeks prior to presentation ([**7-5**])the pt
presented to [**Hospital1 **] for similar dyspnea and was admitted with a dx
of a-fib, anticoagulated, and cardioverted. She was discharged
on [**7-9**] to a rehab facility where poor monitoring of INR on
coumadin resulted in an INR of 9.1 when the pt. again presented
to [**Hospital1 **] complaining of DOE. During this admission, pt. was found
to have a CHF exacerbation with BNP=1425 in the context of a TEE
from [**7-6**] which had shown diastolic dysfunction. The pt. was
discharged to home on [**7-15**] and reports feeling "back to her
usual self" until two days prior to presentation.
Two days prior to presentation, pt reports increased cough with
wheezing along with severe nausea such that she "wishes she
could throw up" and fevers with rigors up to 102 degrees
accompanied by confusion. She denies associated CP, emesis,
diarrhea, dysuria, or urinary frequnecy. She reports decreased
PO intake (both food and fluids) during this time.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 100.4 with MAP = 51 and
HR= 65,RR=18 and O2 sat = 95 on RA . Sepsis protocol was
initiated; a LIJ CVL was placed, she received 5L IVF, and was
started on a levophed ggt. Blood and urine cxs were sent and pt
was subsequently broadly covered with levofloxaxin and
vancomycin.

Micro
[**7-23**] Blood culture: 4/4 bottles S.aureus (MSSA) sensitive to
clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, bactrim,
oxacillin
[**7-24**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**])
[**7-25**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**])
[**7-27**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**])
[**7-23**] urine culture negative

ECHO ([**7-27**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2134-7-14**], estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressures are now higher. There are no obvious
vegetations are visualized. The severity of mitral regurgitation
is slightly reduced. The other findings are similar.

Left lower extremity ultrasound ([**8-5**]):
No evidence of DVT in the left leg.

Hip X ray ([**7-27**]):
Prominent multilevel degenerative changes of the lower lumbar
spine, incompletely evaluated.  Mild degenerative changes of the
sacroiliac joints and hips.

Pelvic / L spine MRI ([**7-27**])
1.  No evidence of discrete fluid collections, abnormal
enhancement, or
underlying osteomyelitis.
2.  Soft tissue fluid consistent with anasarca, likely from
third spacing of fluid.  This may reflect underlying
hypoalbuminemia or fluid overload.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**7-30**])
1.  No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
2.  Non-occlusive thrombosis of the left cephalic vein within
the forearm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Sepsis: Blood cultures from [**7-23**] positive for MSSA, treated with
Nafcillin x 14 days starting [**7-26**] with end date [**8-8**].  Patient in
ICU requiring pressors and fluid boluses, then transferred to
the floor where she was afebrile and improving, she continually
diuresed much fluid.  Source likely IV catheter which was placed
upon previous visit to the ER in the left antecubital fossa.  No
evidence of pelvic abscess or osteo (checked given hip/groin
pain) or of seeding of valves (checked by transthoracic echo).
Blood cultures have been negative to date since [**7-23**].

Atrial fibrillation: in the setting of large fluid shifts
(diuresed negative 5 liters 1 day post ICU discharge) she
returned to atrial fibrillation rhythm after just being
cardioverted a few weeks ago.  Attempted rate control with
lopressor and diltiazem had little effect, patient was
cardioverted and started on Norpace to keep her in sinus rhythm.
 QTc was followed while on this drug and she showed no
significant QTc prolongation. Continue coumadin anticoagulation.

Hyponatremia: Thought to be due to CHF versus SIADH. Follow Na
as patient autodiureses. If still hyponatremic once euvolemic,
should be fluid restricted.
