Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Large L sided ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated
hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 71 y/o with a hx of aneurysm and resultant L sided
stroke, stomach CA (active) and Colon CA (in remission) who is
transferred for further management of ICH.  History is per pt's
family and OSH records, as pt. is intubated and sedated.

Pt. was in his USOH until [**2-24**].  That day he went to a coffee
shop and fell.  His family was not present during the fall, and
is unsure if any seizure activity was noted.  He was taken to
the ED where Head CT was performed and was negative, Neuro exam
was at baseline (R hemiparesis, but awake and alert).  Dilantin
was checked and was subtherapeutic at 7.5.  It was presumed that
the fall was [**2-14**] seizure and pt. was given a PO load and
discharged home in stable condition.  His family reports that he
was fine between discharge and today.

Today he woke up in his USOH, but at around 10:30A his wife
heard him fall in the kitchen.  She came in and found him on the
ground unconscious and called the paramedics.  She reports that
he woke up in the ambulance and when he arrived in the ER was
back to normal.  His initial neurologic exam is documented as
awake and alert, oriented to place and person, following
commands,  with R hemiparesis.  Dilantin was checked and was
10.7 (12:30)  In the ED at around 2 PM he got up to go to the
bathroom and fell when he got out of bed, per family because his
legs were too weak to support him.  On repeat exam he was more
drowsy, so Head CT was ordered, and showed a large L sided ICH
with interventricular extension and subfalcine shift.
Arrangements were made to transfer him to a tertiary care
facility.  His mental status continued to deteriorate, and on
repeat exam his was arousable to sternal rub only.  At around
17:00 he had a 10 minute GTC, which terminated with Ativan 2 mg
IV and Dilantin 400 mg IV.  He was transferred here for further
care.

On arrival here he had a GCS of 7.  Neurosurgery was consulted
emergently and Head CT was repeated (see read below) and showed
a 7 cm x 6.5 cm hemorrhage with extension to the lateral, 3rd,
and 4th ventricles.  Neurosurgery felt that given the size of
the hemorrhage there was no utility in EVD placement.  This was
discussed with family who agreed that they would not want EVD
placed at this time.  Pt. was intubated and sedated with
Propofol and R femoral CVL was placed.  Neurology was consulted
and patient admitted to neuro ICU.

Head CT, prelim rads read:
A large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left frontal
lobe measuring 71 x 56 mm in greatest axial dimension, extending
to the temporal lobe and basal ganglia, superimposed on large
area of encephalomalacia in the left cerebral hemisphere.
Extension of blood is seen into the lateral ventricles, third
ventricle, and a small amount in the fourth ventricle.
Extra-axial blood is also seen along the inner table of the
skull
overlying the left anterior falx, left frontal lobe, and the
anterior parietal lobe and superior temporal lobe.  It measures
6
mm in greatest axial thickness.  The hemorrhage causes some mild
rightward shift of the septum pellucidum and other midline
structures, approximately 6 mm.  The right cerebral hemisphere
is
notable for extensive hypovascular densities in the corona
radiata and centrum semiovale indicating chronic microvascular
change.  In the right frontoparietal scalp, a hematoma is seen
about 10 mm.  There is evidence of previous craniotomy on the
left, and two aneurysm clips in the region of the left middle
cerebral artery.  No acute fractures are identified.  Scattered
opacified ethmoid air cells are noted.  There are small polyps
versus retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses, one measuring 7
mm in the left, one measuring 7 mm on the right.  Cavernous
carotid arteries are partially calcified.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Large left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage superimposed
on extensive encephalomalacic changes, with extension to the
ventricular system including the third and fourth ventricles.

2.  6-mm subdural hematoma overlying the left frontal, parietal,
and temporal regions.  This may be related to the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or may be a separate event related
to the right-sided subgaleal hematoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 71 year old with history of aneurysm rupture and
resultant left-sided stroke, [**Doctor Last Name **] Syndrome with history of
stomach cancer (s/p XRT) and colon cancer (s/p resection) who
was transferred for further management of large intracranial and
subdural hemorrhage.  The bleed was ~150 cc in volume on CT,
which put him at a 30 day mortality of >90%.  On initial exam he
was arousable to sternal rub but did not follow commands, had a
R hemiparesis with some posturing to pain, and reactive pupils.
Given the size of his hemorrhage Neurosurgery consulted the
family and family declined an external ventricular drain.
Patient was admitted to the Neuro-ICU where his blood pressure
was controlled, neuro checks were performed every hour, he was
kept euthermic and euglycemic, his head was elevated and all
blood thinning products were held.  He was also continued on
dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.  A repeat head CT the
following morning showed no new bleeding. Renal team was
consulted and performed patient's routine hemodialysis.  On
[**2-28**], family meeting was held to discuss goals of care. Full
code for now and reintubate if needed. Plan was to wean to
extubate patient that weekend.  CTA of head did not show
extravasation of contrast but couldnot exclude bleeding from
clipped aneurysm site. Hemorrhage  remained stable. R MCA 5mm
aneurysm seen at bifurcation.  Over the weekend, patient became
less responsive despite holding propofol sedation and was not
moving his left side as he had done. Repeat head CT was
unchanged without any new bleeding involving the right
hemi
