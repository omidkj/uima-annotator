History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 97368**] is a 75 yo female with COPD on 2L of home oxygen,
with recently diagnosed PE on coumadin (INR 1.9 today), who
presents to the ER from [**Hospital1 **] with acute respiratory failure
as well as confusion, agitation and tremors. Her respiratory
status had acutely declined. An ABG on the morning of admission
on 3L O2 was 7.42/51/24 (O2 sat was 42% at that time). The pt
was placed on 35% O2 by venti mask  and her ABG improved to
7.45/43/74 with O2 sats of 95%. Her son states she has been
confused for 4 days, confirmed by [**Hospital1 **]. She had been given
ativan on day PTA for agitation (<2mg) and [**Hospital1 **] was
concerned that her MS changes could be due to medication. Of
note, haldol and morphine had been discontinued 2 days PTA.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (2) 97369**] for left ankle
fracture (medial malleolus, tibia and fibula) after a fall at
home and underwent an ORIF on [**2180-12-8**]. During her hospital stay,
she was intermittently delirious for a few days and her delirium
at that time had been attributed to morphine use and possible
ETOH withdrawal. She was also more hypoxic during that
hospitalization, from a baseline of high 80s on room air to 70s
on room air.  She was also tachycardic at that time, so a CTA
had been done and demonstrated multiple subsegmental pumonary
emboli. She was treated with heparin and then d/c'd to rehab
([**Hospital1 **]) on [**2180-12-11**] on lovenox and coumadin.
.
Additionally, during her previous hospitalization, she was
treated for a COPD flare with IV -> PO steroids, along with her
baseline inhalers. Her HTN was harder to control, requiring
increasing her lisinopril and adding metoprolol.  She also
required 2units of pRBC for a drop in Hct (is anemic at
baseline).  The new medications she was started on included
metoprolol, haldol, protonix, warfarin, tramadol, thiamine and
folate.  She was not taking folic acid and thiamine at rehab.
.
In ED, she was placed on a nonrebreather.  An ABG was
7.45/45/426.  She had an abnormal UA and was started on
levofloxacin for a UTI.  She was also transfused 2 units of pRBC
for an HCT of 22.5 (Hct on d/c [**2180-12-11**] was 30). She was admitted
to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Imaging:
[**2180-12-16**] CXR - The heart is enlarged, but there is no definite
pulmonary edema. There are emphysematous changes of the lungs.
Small calcified granuloma is again demonstrated in the right
upper lobe. Allowing for limitations of this study, there are no
gross areas of consolidations or there is evidence for presence
of pneumonia.
.
[**2180-12-16**] CTA - 1. The previously noted tiny nonocclusive possible
pulmonary emboli within the subsegmental branches of the left
lung are not as well visualized. There has been no interval
extension of these, or new occlusive pulmonary emboli. 2. Tiny
nodules noted within the right upper and lower lobes which are
again seen. In the absence of a known primary malignancy,
followup evaluation should be obtained in six months' time.
.
[**2180-12-16**] CT abd/pelvis - 1. No retroperitoneal hemorrhage is
seen.
2. Hypodensities within the kidneys are seen, which likely
represent cysts, and are better characterized on the prior exam.
3. There is an 8-mm nodule within the right lower lobe. In the
absence of a
known malignancy, followup evaluation should be obtained in six
months' time to evaluate for interval change.
.
[**2180-12-16**] CT head - There is no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of
normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is decreased attenuation in
the periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic small
vessel ischemic infarct. Soft tissue and osseous structures are
stable in appearance.
.
[**2180-12-21**] L ankle XR - Status post ORIF of bimalleolar fracture
with some callus healing.
.
[**2180-12-21**] LLE U/S - No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
.
[**2180-12-22**] CXR - Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. A small calcified
granuloma is again seen in the right upper lobe. There is no
pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. There
are no areas of consolidations. Ther is no evidence of
pneumonia.
.
[**2180-12-24**] CXR - The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is
unchanged. There of calcifications of the thoracic aorta. A
calcified granuloma is seen within the right mid lung zone.
There is no evidence for focal infiltrates. Calcifications are
seen at the right base as well. There is no signs of pulmonary
edema. No interval change since the previous study. No definite
evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
