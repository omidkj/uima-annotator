Admission Date:  [**2111-6-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-6-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2061-11-29**]       Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for rheumatic
heart disease and three mitral valve replacements with
porcine valve in [**2084**], replaced in [**2089**] with a Bjork-Shiley.
she had an MB thrombosis.  The patient had progressive
shortness of breath since around [**2099**].  Catheterization on
[**2110-12-19**] showed a right dominant system with no significant
flow limiting stenosis.  The resting hemodynamics revealed
severely elevated right-sided filling pressures and
moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures.  No
intracardiac shunt was present on oximetry.  Left
with extremely severe mitral regurgitation.  Final diagnoses
included that the coronary arteries were normal, extremely
severe mitral regurgitation via Bj??????rk-Shiley mitral
prosthesis, elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
with giant B waves with systemic level PA pressure, severely
depressed forward cardiac index, right atrial hypertension
with tricuspid regurgitation, left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, slight improvement in cardiac index, and slight
fall in PVR without change in PA pressure response to
intrapulmonary Adenosine administration.  The patient had a
porcine valve placed at the [**Hospital 3340**] Clinic on [**2111-2-9**] which
was a six week hospitalization.  The patient also had a
pacemaker placed.  Initially the patient had good symptomatic
improvement after the most recent mitral valve replacement
surgery and was doing well at home, able to walk and climb
stairs without getting short of breath.  However about one
month ago, the patient started to develop progressive dyspnea
on exertion.  She now gets short of breath with just minimal
exertion.  She denies orthopnea but reports paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  She also reports that the edema in her
lower extremities has gotten worse over the past month.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  There is a history of childhood
rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve replacement times three
as above, history of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter,
status post pacemaker placement, and status post TAB.
Echocardiogram on [**2111-4-23**] showed dilated left ventricle,
decreased ejection fraction, severe global hypokinesis,
significant pulmonary regurgitation, and mild mitral
regurgitation.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Procainamide, vitamin K.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix
120 mg p.o. b.i.d., Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril 25
mg p.o. t.i.d., Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, KCl 20
mEq p.o. t.i.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of heart disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies the use of tobacco,
minimal ETOH use, and no drug use.  The patient is married
and has a supportive husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (ON ADMISSION):  Vital signs revealed
temperature 96.9, heart rate 90, blood pressure 110/60, O2
saturation 94% on 4 liters nasal cannula, respiratory rate
20, weight 51 kilograms.  On general appearance, the patient
was pleasant and in no acute distress, lying flat.  The neck
revealed positive jugular venous distention to the earlobes
at 30 degrees.  On HEENT examination, oropharynx revealed
moist mucous membranes, clear.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
positive S3, regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the apex.  The lungs revealed slight crackles at
the bases.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds.  The extremities revealed 2+
edema in the lower extremities bilaterally.  Swan was placed
in the right groin.  On neurologic examination, the patient
was alert and oriented times three.

Electrocardiogram on admission showed V-paced rhythm at 92
beats per minute with left axis deviation and left bundle
branch morphology.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 49-year-old
female referred by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for cardiac
catheterization.  The patient was admitted off Coumadin times
two days and started on Heparin infusion and proceeded to
catheterization when INR was appropriate.  Cardiac
catheterization on [**2111-6-10**] revealed a right dominant system
with normal coronary arteries.  The LMCA, LAD, left
circumflex, and RCA were all free of angiographically
significant disease.  The resting hemodynamics performed at
baseline in response to studies and response to interventions
are noted below.  Upon entry there was evidence of elevated
right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 27
mmHg and LVEDP of 30 mmHg.  There was severely depressed
cardiac index and severe pulmonary hypertension with a PASP
of 66 mmHg.  PVR was 880 dyne seconds per centimeter.  The
Dobutamine at 7.5 mcg/kg/min and Nitroprusside titrated to 75
mcg/min were begun.  PASP decreased to 56 mmHg and PCWP
decreased to 19 mmHg from 25 mmHg.  The PVR decreased to 200
dyne seconds per centimeter.  The cardiac index increased
from 1.4 liters per minute per meter squared to 3.8 per
minute per meter squared.  The systemic arterial pressure was
98/51 mmHg.  These drugs were discontinued and Milrinone was
begun at low dose of 0.375 mcg/kg/min following 50 mcg/kg
load.  The PASP was 56 mmHg, PCWP 17 mmHg, PVR 463 dyne
seconds per meter squared, and cardiac index was 2.6 liters
per minute per metered squared.  The systemic arterial
pressure was 133/57/76 mmHg.  This study demonstrated
reversibility of pulmonary vascular resistance and a dramatic
response to inotropic and vasodilator therapy.  The left
ventriculography was performed demonstrating severely
impaired left ventricular systolic function with a left
ventricular ejection fraction calculated at 18%.  There was
anterobasal hypokinesis and anterolateral apical inferior and
inferobasal hypokinesis.  There was no significant mitral
regurgitation.  Fluoroscopy orthogonal views of the
ventricular pacing leads showed no prolapse of the right
ventricular lead via the tricuspid lead.  The final diagnosis
was that there was severe elevation of right and left heart
filling pressures with severe depression of cardiac index, no
left-to-right intracardiac shunt, no mitral regurgitation,
and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
interval further depression of left ventricular ejection
fraction dilatation.  There was also severe pulmonary
hypertension with partial reversibility after administration
of intravenous Dobutamine plus Nitroprusside and after
intravenous Milrinone.  The coronary arteries were all
normal.

After the patient had received the right and left
catheterization, she was transferred to the CCU Service for
Swan-guided [**Location (un) **] therapy and hemodynamic monitoring while
on Milrinone for inotropic support.  It was decided that a
Milrinone trial would be continued for a total of five days
and then an echocardiogram would be done to reevaluate her
heart function.  The initial Milrinone dose was 0.5
mcg/kg/min and the patient showed a good response with
cardiac index on Milrinone.  On the second day of her
Milrinone trial, her cardiac output and cardiac index were
falling which led to Milrinone increase to 0.75 mcg/kg/min.
Because of a drop in cardiac index, Milrinone was returned to
0.5 mcg/kg/min but Nipride of 0.5 mcg/kg/min was added.
Nipride was eventually increased to 1 mcg/kg/min due to lack
of PAP response.  On day #3, cardiac output and cardiac index
continued to decrease with an increase in SVR and the Nipride
was titrated to a MAP of 70 but did not hold pressure so the
Nipride was eventually discontinued and the Milrinone was
then increased back to 0.75 mcg/kg/min which led to cardiac
index and cardiac output coming back up and SVR back down.
While on the Milrinone trial, the patient was gently diuresed
to about 1 liter negative per day.  In addition, the patient
was maintained on Captopril, Coreg, and Amiodarone.

The plan was to wean the patient off Milrinone by day five
and reassess left ventricular function by echocardiogram.
