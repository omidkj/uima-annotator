Imaging:
[**2175-12-6**] CXR
CHEST, AP: A right subclavian catheter terminates in the deep
right atrium, 3-4 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction. There is no
pneumothorax. Dense left lower lobe consolidation is present,
with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung is
clear. The heart is normal in size. Mild prominence of the
bilateral hila likely reflects reactive lymphadenopathy.  There
is no radiographic evidence of pneumomediastinum.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation most compatible with pneumonia.

2. Right subclavian catheter in deep right atrium; please
retract 4 cm.
.
[**2175-12-7**] CXR
Right subclavian line tip is at the level of cavoatrial
junction.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. As compared to yesterday
there is
interval development of right basal consolidation accompanied by
pleural
effusion. Upper lungs are essentially clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

IMPRESSION: Newly developed right basal consolidation that might
represent
interval development of aspiration versus progression of
multifocal infection.
.
[**2175-12-11**] CXR
Both right and left pleural effusions are slightly smaller,
though still are both present. The right lower lobe
consolidation is also marginally improved.
IMPRESSION: Improving.
...
[**2175-12-9**]
CT chest w/ contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe progression of widespread pneumonia, now accompanied
by the small layering non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion. There is
no direct radiographic evidence that this represents empyema,
but if the fluid volume continues to increase, sampling is
recommended to distinguish pleural infection from reactive
exudate.
2. Although mild-to-moderate central adenopathy has been
relatively stable
(with the exception of enlarging right hilar node), moderate
splenomegaly has progressed substantially.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  20 y/o male with pneumonia, sepsis.
.
1) Pneumonia: left lower lobe PNA, but preceeded by extended
duration of malaise that could be consistent with slow
development of disease versus viral prodrome.  Initially, broad
spectrum antibiotics were started with vancomycin, ceftriaxone
and levofloxacin.  By morning of [**12-8**] was satting well on 3L NC
and he was transferred to the general medicine floor and out of
the ICU.  The patient grew streptoccocus PNA in his blood
cultures and his Abx regiment was narrowed to ceftriaxone.   He
was continued on Ceftriaxone, but he had fevers x2 on the floor
and there was concern that he may have loculations, empyema
formation or possible abscess. Repeat CXR PA and lateral as well
as lateral decubitus films argued against loculations, but he
continued to have fevers to about 101.  A CT scan was done and
it did not show any abscesses or empyema.  Serial cultures were
negative after the positive culture on admission.  Azithromycin
was added to his regimen and he remained afebrile for greater
than 24 hours.  He was discharged to home on cefpdoxime and
azithromycin and close follow up with your PCP.
.
# Sepsis: In context of infection and hypovolemia.  Got 9L fluid
over first 24 hours, with goal CVP > 8.  Off levophed at 4am on
[**2175-12-8**], maintained blood pressure well.  Pt was growing
streptoccocus PNA in his admission blood cultures, but serial
cultures were all negative.  His antibiotic course is detailed
in the above course related to his PNA.  The patient was
transferred to the general medicine floor and he remained
hemodynamically stable for the rest of his hospital stay.
.
# Renal Failure: In context of hypovolemia, dye load.  Cr
improved to normal with IVF and remained stable after successful
volume repletion.
.
# Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Possible hemolytic anemia in context
of atypical infection versus early DIC in sepsis.  Crit and
platelets have now stablized.  Full anemia workup was negative
for hemolysis and had a confusing picture with respect to his
iron studies, normal ferritin, low TIBC, low percent saturation,
low iron.  Unclear whether this was confounded by his infection
and it was decided to follow up when the patient was healthy to
better assess his anemia.  On [**2175-12-12**], after the patient was
discharged, radiology called back to report splenomegaly.  It is
possible that some of the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia
was secondary to sequestration.  Pt will be notified and he will
follow up by his PCP.
.
# Splenomegaly: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact by radiology on [**2175-12-12**]
that the patient was found to have splenomaegaly on CT of his
chest.  This could be secondary to his infectious process and
possible co
