IMAGING:

CT head [**2126-5-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. No evidence of fracture.
.
EKG with sinus tach at 100bpm and significant LVH. CXR showed
hypoinflation of L lung but no sign of pneumothorax.
.
CXR: on arrival to ED [**2126-5-8**] with hypoinflated left lung
on arrival to unit these changes have mainly resolved on 2nd CXR
[**5-8**].

CXR [**5-9**] however showed:
FINDINGS: There is a new consolidation of the left lower lung
with air
bronchograms. There is also a linear density in the right lower
lung that may represent an area of atelectasis, though a
developing consolidation is
possible. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The
patient has been
extubated and the NG tube removed.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lung pneumonia, likely aspiration.

hypoxic in setting of known GHB and ?other substance use.

HOSPITAL COURSE
# GHB Intoxication/Withdrawal - Patient arrived in the ICU
sedated with propofol and on the ventilator.  CT head showed no
evidence on intracranial hemmorhage.  Tox screen was negative
for alcohol, aspirin, tylenol. Sedation was weaned and he was
extubated on [**5-9**].  Afterward he was acutely delirious, which
was initially managed with haldol IV for agitation and ativan IV
for suspected GHB withdrawal.  The following day he was oriented
x 3 and answering questions appropriately, and ativan was
stopped.  His mental status continued to improve throughout
hospitalization and he felt himself to be at baseline at the
time of discharge.  He denied suicidality or self injurious
thoughts. He admitted to experimemtal GHB use.  He was
attempting to leave AMA 1 day prior to discharge but was able to
be convinced to stay for one more day to monitor PNA.

# PNEUMONIA - After extubation on [**5-9**], patient spiked a fever
to 101.5.  Repeat CXR showed LLL infiltrate.  Also noted to have
thick green respiratory secretions when suctioned on vent. He
was started on levofloxacin 750mg IV daily and metronidazole
500mg IV q8 for aspirtation pneumonia with planned 7 day course.
 Spo2 remained over 95% without supplemental oxygen.
Blood/urine/sputum cx showed no growth at the time of discharge.


# Hypernatremia - Na of 150 on presentation. Unclear baseline
but likely insufficient hydration in the setting of drug
