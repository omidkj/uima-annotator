Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**2112-9-27**]
CONCLUSION:
1.  Interval increase in the size of the abdominal aortic
aneurysm which is now leaking with free fluid in the abdomen and
pelvis, and a hematoma
surrounding the abdominal aorta.
2.  Extensive atherosclerosis present in the abdominal aorta,
its branches, and the iliac arteries.  There is a stable right
common iliac artery aneurysm.
3.  Stable subcentimeter low attenuation foci in the liver and
kidneys, likely representing cysts.
4.  Prior spinal fixation at L5-S1 and grade 1 spondylolisthesis
at L4-5 are unchanged.
5. A 12 x 11 mm spiculated opacity in the right upper lobe
anteriorly may be followed with a chest CT in 3 months to assess
stability/change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is a 79 y/o female well known to the Vascular Surgery
service, discharged on [**2112-9-26**] with stable Type I endoleak of
previous EVAR [**1-/2109**], presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 10/10
abdominal pain with radiation to back, nausea and vomiting, and
labile blood pressure from 80 to 250 SBP.  A CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis was performed in the ED and findings were
significant for a leaking AAA with surrounding hematoma as
reported above.  Efforts to control Ms. [**Known lastname 13894**] blood pressure
in ED were made using nipride and esmolol and were unsuccessful.
 A code was called in ED when Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] became asystolic. She
was resuscitated after 2 mins of CPR with no medication given,
and was subsequently intubated and transferred to the CVICU.
The family was informed of her diagnosis and consent for open
repair of her AAA was obtained.  She underwent an open
retroperitoneal AAA repair (suprarenal clamp inferior to the
SMA) with a bifurcated dacron graft with distal anastomosis to
endografts.

Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] this procedure well and was transferred to
the SICU directly from the operating room.  A PA catheter was
placed on POD 0 in the SICU for monitoring.  She was started on
empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn.  She made steady progress during
her CVICU stay and was consulted by Cardiology during this time
for management of her blood pressure.  She required a continuous
infusion of Nipride for SBP management during her stay.  She was
extubated and transferred from the CVICU to the VICU on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11
on POD 4 ([**2112-10-1**]).

Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] made steady progress suring her VICU stay but had
multiple episodes of intermittent bradycardia and sustained
hypertension requiring adjustment of her Nipride drip.  On POD
7, [**2112-10-4**], she was weaned from her Nipride drip and given a
regular diet.  She again had several episodes of intermittent
sinus bradycardia to HR 30 - 40's and a Type I block was
suspected.  Cardiology was consulted.  Her Foley was removed on
this date and she voided shortly thereafter.  She was restarted
on Heparin SQ.  Her antibiotics were stopped.  She got out of
bed several times to her chair.  She had no reports of pain and
her pulse exam was WNL.

On POD 9, [**2112-10-6**], Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, floor
status, from the VICU.  She continued to have bouts of
bradycardia and labile hypertension.  Cardiology was again
consulted for evaluation of the patient and she was ultimately
transferred to their service for placement of pacemaker. Ms.
[**Known lastname 12056**] was noted to have bradycardia and 2nd degree Mobitz I AV
block, with intermittent worsening to 2nd degree Mobitz II AV
block, so a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was placed on
[**2112-10-6**]. Her metoprolol dose was increased to improve control of
her labile hypertension. She was monitored by the cardiology
team overnight and the electrophysiologists interrogated the
pacemaker on the morning of [**2112-10-7**], which showed appropriate
firing. She was transferred back to the vascular service for
continued care.
