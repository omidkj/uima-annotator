History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
The history was obtained from Mr [**Known lastname 84568**] son [**Name (NI) **], as the
patient was confused and agitated. Mr [**Known lastname **] is an ambidextrous
man who writes with his left hand with a hitherto unremarkable
medical history, who presents with progressive right sided
weakness. It started off 5 weeks ago with a right facial palsy,
which his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 10851**] in NH thought was a Bells palsy.
However, the symptoms did not improve, and he started to
complain
of severe back pain, so much so that he resorted to sleeping in
a
Jacuzzi for 20 mins at a time. He went back to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
according to [**Doctor First Name **], he was given analgesia and sent home. On [**8-23**], his PCP ordered an MRI of the brain which showed a
1.5
cm soft tissue mass in the midbrain and a question of a small
acute infarct in the right posterior part of the pons. Mr [**Known lastname **]
then started to develop right sided arm weakness accompanied by
numbness two weeks ago, which has become progressively worse.
Last week, his right leg started to become involved in a similar
manner. In addition to these symptoms, [**Doctor First Name **] mentioned that his
father weighed ~220 lb 5 weeks ago, and then a few days ago he
was weighed at ~185 lb in an OSH. Last week on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
took
his father to CMC [**Location (un) 5450**] [**Name (NI) **], and he had a CT scan of his
brain which he was told showed nothing, and the MRI of his
entire
spine w/o contrast showed a questionable lesion (probable
hemangioma) at T7, otherwise there was a minor disc protrusion
at
T9/10. He was discharged home, however, he got worse over the
weekend, and his son took him into [**Hospital6 204**]
yesterday, and they transferred him to the [**Hospital1 **] ER for a stroke
evaluation. At [**Hospital1 189**] he had a CXR which showed atelectasis of
the R middle lobe which could be due to a lesion or infection,
and his CT head scan had a lot of movement artifact.

ROS: no fevers or chills according to his son, no other
neurological or systemic symptoms obtainable from Mr [**Known lastname **] due
to his mental status.

oral
mucosa

or vertebral bruit

Lung: Rhonchi heard in the right mid zone
aBd: +BS soft, has two subcutaneous lipomas in the right upper
quadrant, nontender
ext: no edema

Neurologic examination:
Mental status:Confused, agitated, thinks that he is in [**Country 480**],
then states that he knows that he is in America, somewhere.
Knows
who he is, and can identify his son.

Cranial Nerves:
Right eye looks ecchymotic, cornea looks cloudy, pupil
unreactive, in fundoscopy, question of debris in the anterior
chamber. Left eye 3-->2 mm. Blinks to threat. EOMS appear full.
Corneals in tact bilaterally.  Right lower motor facial nerve
palsy with a positive Bell's phenomenon.  Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetrical.  Shoulder
shrug looks asymmetric. Tongue deviates to the left.

Motor:
Evidence of weight loss. Tone increased in the right arm and
right leg. No observed myoclonus or tremor
right pronator drift
Left side appears strong, can keep his left arm and leg up for
30
s, will not comply with formal testing
Right side arm can stay antigravity for 5 s, and the right leg
for 10 s.

Sensation: Moves all 4 limbs symmetrically away from noxious
stimuli

Reflexes:
1 and symmetric throughout, apart from absent ankle jerks.
Right - Babinski
Left  - downgoing

Coordination: he would not attempt this, he could grab my neuro
tools to try and prevent me from his left hand, but could not do
this easily on the right side.

Gait: when he stands, he keels over to the right

Discharge Lab Data:

.
IMAGING:
.
CT Head ([**2102-9-27**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
CT C-spine, Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2102-9-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left lower lobe atelectasis. An obstructive
endobronchial lesion
cannot be excluded. Other etiologies would include mucous
plugging.
2. Gastric, cardiac and fundus mural thickening of unclear
etiology.
Differential considerations include inflammatory/neoplastic
infiltration.
Further evaluation with endoscopy may be considered.
3. Hepatic steatosis.
4. Splenic low attenuation lesions, not seen before. These could
represent
splenic infarcts. In the current clinical setting can not
exclude an
infectious component.
5. Moderate hiatal hernia.
.
MRI Brain ([**2102-9-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal cranial nerve enhancement most likely secondary to
the patient's diagnosis of Lyme Disease.
2. Abnormal signal surrounding the obex at the cervicomedullary
junction may also relate to the patient's Lyme disease but is of
unclear etiology.
.
Right Shoulder X-ray ([**2102-10-1**]):
No fracture, dislocation, or gross degenerative change is
identified. Mild
degenerative changes of the AC joint are noted.
.
CXR ([**2102-9-28**]):
ET tube tip is 3.2 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of
view below the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging
pleural effusions. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar
opacities consistent with atelectasis have improved on the right
and probably increased on the left. Cardiac size is top normal.
