 The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and
was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  Please see
operative report for details. Post operatively pain was
controlled with a PCA with a transition to PO pain meds once
tolerating PO??????s.  The patient tolerated diet advancement without
difficulty and made steady progress with PT.

limitations.

The patient received peri-operative antibiotics as well as
Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  The incision was clean, dry, and
intact without evidence of erythema or drainage; and the
