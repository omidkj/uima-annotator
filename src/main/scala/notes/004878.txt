of 22.6. Chest film demonstrated new right lateral infrahilar
patchy opacity, and UA suggested urinary infection. CT abdomen
done and demonstrated LLL consolidation, possible bowel wall
thickening, no free air.
Otherwise, she had no anginal symptoms, and her EKG was within
normal limits and unchanged. Initial set of cardiac enzymes
negative. She was given IVF wide open, and started on insulin
gtt. Electrolytes were repleted. She was started on broad
spectrum empiric abx with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl.
She was given 4L in total of NS.
.
Transferred to MICU for DKA, placed on insulin drip, electroytes
monitored, blood sugars trended down. Transferred to medicine
floor once stabilized.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2130-1-24**] 6:34 PM
1. Left lower lobe dense consolidation with air bronchograms,
incompletely imaged but concerning for underlying pneumonia.
2. Short segment of proximal jejunum demonstrating moderate wall
thickening of uncertain clinical significance. Although findings
may represent focal peristalsis, further characterization with a
small bowel follow-through is recommended on a nonemergent basis
once acute presentation has resolved to rule out underlying
inflammatory bowel disease.
3. 1 cm left adnexal calcification of unclear etiology.
4. Sigmoid diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2130-1-24**] 3:04 PM
New infrahilar patchy opacities concerning for pneumonia.
.
ECG	Study Date of [**2130-1-24**]  1:41:38 PM
Sinus tachycardia
Short P-R interval
Low lead voltage
Normal ECG except for rate
Since previous tracing, heart rate faster, anterior T waves
improved

Brief Hospital Course:
57yo woman with insulin requiring type II diabetes presents with
respiratory syndrome/pneumonia and found to be in DKA,
stabilized in MICU, now transferred to floor.
.
# DKA
As demonstrated by hyperglycemia, marked increased anion gap
acidosis and ketosis. Suspect that she has advanced insulin
deficiency as well as insulin resistance given her history and
her current presentation in DKA. Most likely precipitant is
acute infectious process; there is evidence of both PNA and UTI
on initial evaluation. Abdominal CT (-) for acute intraabdominal
process. Non-ischemic EKG, normal cardiac enzymes. Initially
treated with very broad spectrum Abx with
vanco/ceftriaxone/flagyl, switched to levaquin. Anion gap closed
yesterday, but continued insulin gtt b/c of persistently high
serum glucose, turned off prior to floor transfer and switched
to standing insulin with SSI. Hyperkalemia and acidosis
corrected. Urine and blood cultures no growth. Held metformin
given risk of lactic acidosis, restarted on discharge. [**Last Name (un) **]
consulted, cut down AM lantus to 50. Arranged f/u with [**Last Name (un) **]
nurse educator for insulin coverage on sick days.
.
# Pneumonia
CT chest revealed increased opacity noted lateral to the hila
bilaterally as well as superior to the left hila concerning for
worsening multifocal pneumonia. Initial leukocytosis now
resolved. Levoquin 10 day course. Symptomatic treatment with
guaifencin, nebs.
.
# Depression
Continued fluoxetine.
.
# Dyslipidemia
Continued lipitor.
.
# Back pain
Held sedating meds. Cleared by PT for home.
.
# Dispo
DC'd to home once blood sugars stable on diabetic medication
regimen.
As recommended by radiology, she should have non-emergent follow
up evaluation of jejunal thickening (SBFT) and left adnexal
cyst.
