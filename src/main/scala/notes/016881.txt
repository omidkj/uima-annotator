Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lung biopsy [**2168-7-18**]

History of Present Illness:
68 YOM with unknonw PMH found at the back of loading truck for
unknown amount of time by friends. AED placed and shock
indicated. NO rhythm strip. Had agonal breaths. EMS Arrived. No
more shocks aDVISED. ems SAID "BIZZARE WIDE COMPLEX" and
tachycardic. Went to OSH ([**Hospital1 2436**]) intubated and coold.
Continued to have wide complex tachy. Got ami x2 with amio gtt.
Life flight arrived and he was in NSR with LBBB.
.
Patient was Kept on Amio Gtt when arrived. A CXR showed RUL
consolidation which was interpreted as possible pulmonary
contusion. There was a concern for aspiration and started on
Levo and flagyl.
.
After discussion with the family he apparently had a cardiac
catheterization sometime in the last month at the [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 669**] VA
for unknown reasons. His wife reports that there were "some
plaques" but nothing to put stents in. Incidentally he was found
to have a pulmonary nodule and a CT was reccomended. He refused
at the time and was scheduled to have scan in one month.
.
In the ED he is intubated and sedated. Cooling procol was
initiated.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old man with idiopathic, non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy s/p cardiac arrest and rewarming protocol
currently with newly discovered lung, liver and pancreatic
lesions concerning for malignancy.

# Pulmonary Nodule with perihilar lymphadenopathy:
The patient was found, incidentally to have a pulmonary nodule
with perihilar lymphadenopathy.  Given his long smoking history
there was a concern for malignancy.  After review of other
masses in abdomen, the lung nodule was deemed the best place for
initial biopsy.  U/S and MRI was performed to assess Liver and
pancreatic lesions and it was felt, with conjunction of IP and
IR that biopsing the lung would be the best route.  Patient went
for bronchial lung biopsy on [**7-18**] wihtout complications.  Results
are pending at time of discharge

# Liver, and pancreatic lesions: An ultrasound was showed at
least 5 lesions in the liver suggestive of hemangiomas. An
abdominal MRI revealed multiple liver masses believed to be
benign cysts and others that are hemangiomas. One liver mass was
believed to be potentially malignant. The pancreatic tail lesion
was believed to be potentially malignant. After lung biopsy and
pending results, it will need to be determined whether to biopsy
the pancreas since the tail of the pancreas is more likely to be
a primary than metastatic. He will follow up with outpatient
oncology at the VA for a body PET-CT, brain MRI, PFTs, and
spirometry with DLCO (this will be set up with the patient's
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**].

# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has non-ischemic
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%; it is still
unknown as to primary etiology.  Pt is on his home-dose
lisinopril 20mg and will leave on home dose Metoprolol Succinate
200mg daily.  The electrophysiology service was consulted
regarding possibly ICD vs. life vest placement given PEA vs.
Vtach arrest.  EP recommended Amiodarone over ICD or Life vest
as it has shown to be non-inferior to patients who are s/p
cardiac arrest in preventing further arrests. He will take
Amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month followed by 200 mg daily
indefinitely. This plan was discussed with the patient's
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**], who agreed.

# Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: on Day 10 of
piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.
Finished course [**7-18**].  Resolved upon discharge

# Afib:  Will continue beta-blockers.  Warfarin had been held
since early in the admission, first due to elevated INR and then
for upcoming procedures.  Will continue the patient's warfarin
at discharge, but at a lower dose as he was both
supratherapeutic coming into the hospital and discharged on
amiodarone. We have contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 77893**], regarding the need for close INR follow-up.

# Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 44.0 and his
discharge hematocrit was 35.8. His nadir was 29.5 on [**2168-7-13**]. No
obvious cause of a normocytic anemia was found and the patient's
stool was guaiac negative.

# Hypertension: The patient's lisinopril and metoprolol were
continued throughout his hospital course to good effect.

Transitional issues:
# Outpatient oncologic workup: He will follow up with outpatient
oncology at the VA for a body PET-CT, brain MRI, PFTs, and
spirometry with DLCO (this will be set up with the patient's
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**].

# Atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation: We have
contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**], regarding the
need for close INR follow-up.

# Anti-arrhythmic therapy: The patient will take Amiodarone 200
mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month followed by 200 mg daily indefinitely. This
plan was discussed with the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**],
who agreed.

# The patient was instructed not to return to work until he sees
his outpatient cardiologist. The patient understood the risks
and confirmed that he will not drive his truck.

Transitional issues: Follow up on anemia as his Hct dropped
during the hospital course but rebounded at discharge.
Recommend check CBC once to ensure it has normalized.
