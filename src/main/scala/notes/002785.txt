Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ CVC placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, DM and T12
burst fracture complicated by lower extremity paralysis admitted
from a nursing home with fevers, hypotension and hypoxia.
.
The patient was found at her nursing home to be febrile to 101.4
104 140/90 tachypneic to RR 22, saturating at 85% on RA. She was
noted to have a cough and to be less interactive than normal. Of
note the patient was on Levofloxacin 250mg daily for 3 of a
total 7 day course for UTI. Reportedly the nursing home was
using a foley catheter more frequently in order to limit diaper
time as the patient had developed a diaper rash and this was
though to be exacerbating sacral decub. The patient is a poor
historian. She denies all symptoms.
.
On arrival to the ED, T 105 rectal HR 139-150 BP 102/76 RR 30
86% 3L improved to 100% on NRB. The patient's bp declined to
75/53. She had a right IJ placed, received Vancomycin, Zosyn and
5-6L of NS. She was started on levophed 0.06mcg/kg/min. MAP
ranged 66-89, CVP 10. She had 130cc of urine output over the
first 1 hour. Prior to transfer her reported vitals were 103
121/79 26 99% 6L

and distal right lower extremity. 5/5 strength in the bilateral
upper extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was originally admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2109-6-30**] due to
hypotension and hypoxia in the setting of fever and recent UTI.
As for the etiology of the sepsis, urologic was most likely
despite urine culture showing mixed flora (likely fecal
contaminate) at admission. All blood cultures from [**6-30**] to [**7-2**]
are still pending with no growth to date. Patient was originally
covered by pip/tazo alone and vancomycin was later added. Of
note, patient has a history of cipro resistant urologic
infections. To manage hypotension associated with sepsis,
patient was volume resuscitated with fluid boluses and then was
placed on norepinephrine which was D/C'ed due to 15 beats of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Hypotension was then
managed by phenylephrine, from which the patient was liberated
on [**2109-7-3**]. The hypoxia at admission was originally thought to
be related to sepsis vs. silent aspiration; however, there was
never frank CXR evidence of pulmonary infiltrate to support
asipration. The patient was relieved of supplemental oxygen on
morning of [**2109-7-3**]. The patient's sacral decubitus pressure
ulcer is longstanding and appears to be better than previous
descriptions in recent outpatient notes. There was no evidence
of infection of her sacral decub per wound nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].

After transfer to the medical service, the patient was
clinically stable, alert and interactive.  Since none of her
cultures grew anything and given pt's prior hx of MRSA urinary
infection and presumed bacteremia, the patient was discharged on
a total 14 day course of vanc and zosyn.
