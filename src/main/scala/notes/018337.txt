Pertinent Results:
[**1-30**] CTA:
1. Head CT shows diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and
hydrocephalus.
2. CT angiography demonstrates a 6-mm aneurysm arising from the
left internal carotid artery C6 segment, pointing superiorly
with a 4-mm neck. No other aneurysms are seen.

[**1-30**] Cerebral Angio:
Successful embolization of the supraclinoid left internal
carotid artery
aneurysm.

[**1-30**] CT C-spine: No fractures

[**1-31**] CT head: Interval increase in the amount of blood in the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricle, the third ventricle
and the fourth ventricle with a small amount of blood adjacent
to the catheter opening in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].


[**2-1**] CTA Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Stable diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both
hemispheres with
redistribution and resolution of the intraventricular component.

2. Evolution of scattered infarcts in the left fetal origin PCA
vascular
territory and left frontal lobe which are most likely embolic in
nature.
3. Diffuse narrowing of left PCA and bilateral distal A2 and M3,
M4 branches. In conjunction with the more recent CT performed at
the time of this report, this finding appears largely related to
technical issues, though an actual component of peripheral
vasospasm appears to be present.
4. Further decrease of the ventricular size with stable position
of right
frontal ventriculostomy catheter.

[**2-2**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

[**2-2**] CTA Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving scattered infarcts, involving the left PCA territory
as well as small lacunar area in the left frontal corona
radiata.
2. Mild spasm involving the left PCA and bilateral anterior and
middle
cerebral artery terminal branches.
3. Unchanged appearance of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage
with relatively small intraventricular component.
4. Stable size and configuration of ventricles.

[**2-2**] Angio- / Cerebral
FINDINGS: Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows filling
of the left
internal carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous
and
supraclinoid portion. The previously coiled supraclinoid
aneurysm stays
obliterated. The MCA is normal in caliber along with the
internal carotid
artery and the fetal PCA. The anterior cerebral artery is
smaller in caliber consistent with a right dominant A1.

Right common carotid artery arteriogram again demonstrates that
the right
internal carotid artery fills well along the cervical, petrous,
cavernous and supraclinoid portion. The anterior and middle
cerebral arteries fill well.  The anterior cerebral artery is
seen to be dominant and supplies both hemispheres.

IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 6739**] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral angiography which
revealed no
evidence of vasospasm. The previously coiled aneurysm continues
to stay
obliterated.

[**2174-2-4**] LENIES
CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.

[**2174-2-8**] CT BRAIN:
IMPRESSION: New focus of air in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral
ventricle with otherwise stable exam.

[**2174-2-8**] CT BRAIN:
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage is largely stable from prior
exam.
Ventriculostomy catheter has been removed. Intraventricular
hemorrhage has
significantly progressed from study obtained 11 hours prior, now
extending
into and filling the right lateral, third and fourth ventricles.
In addition, the ventricles appear increased in size. For
example, frontal horns of the lateral ventricles currently
measure 4.2 cm in diameter, previously 3.6 cm (2:11). The third
ventricle measures 1.4 cm, previously 1.1 cm (2:12). A locule of
gas involving the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle is
unchanged (2:12). Focal hyperattenuation with surrounding
hypodensity along the previous ventriculostomy tract, likely
represents hemorrhage with surrounding edema (2:13). Small
subgaleal hematoma, soft tissue edema and a burr hole overlying
the right frontal area is unchanged, likely post-procedural.

[**2174-2-9**] CT BRAIN:
IMPRESSION:
1. Similar extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and
right-predominant
intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Interval placement of left frontal approach shunt catheter
with significant improvement in degree of lateral
ventriculomegaly, more on the left.
3. No new hemorrhage, major infarct, or increased mass effect.

[**2174-2-11**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in dilatation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle with increase in the amount of blood
pooling in this region.
2. Persistence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and persistence of
blood products in the right ventricle as well at the right
frontal lobe.
3. Persistence of hypodensity in the left occipital lobe
consistent with a
chronic infarction.

[**2174-2-12**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Ventilation-acquired pneumonia in a
patient with
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AP radiograph of the chest was compared to [**2174-2-8**].

The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. The Dobbhoff tube
tip is in the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is
stable. The PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Right
lower lobe opacity has progressed consistent with either
atelectasis or infectious process. Upper lungs are essentially
clear. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen

[**2174-2-12**] LEFT SHOULDER
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Trauma, shoulder swelling.
Two limited views of the left shoulder were reviewed.
There is chronic widening of the left acromioclavicular joint,
8.6 mm. There is no acute fracture or dislocation.

Radiology Report CT Chest, ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date
of [**2174-2-18**] 1:47 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Ground glass opacity at
the right
lung base may represent aspiration in the appropriate clinical
setting. No
consolidative pneumonia.
2. 7-mm ground-glass nodule at the right apex. If the patient
has no risk
factors for malignancy, followup with dedicated chest CT is
recommended at
6-12 months. If the patient has risk factors for malignancy
(e.g. smoking),
dedicated chest CT is recommended in [**4-12**] months.
3. No evidence of infection in the abdomen or pelvis.
4. Massive amount of stool in the rectum.
5. Nonobstructing stone in the left kidney.

Head CT [**2174-2-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in dilatation of the ventricular system,
