Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4282**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Pleurex Catheter Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old female with a history of type II diabetes,
hypertension and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small
cell lung cancer who presents with three days of progressive
dyspnea.  She was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to this presentation when she noticed worsenign shortness
of breath and non-productive cough.  She initially attributed
this to her cancer but the shortness of breath progressively
worsened to dyspnea at rest.  It was not associated with fevers,
chills, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  It was not associated with leg pain or
swelling.  It was associated with non-productive cough, lethargy
and decreased PO intake.  She has never had dyspnea like this in
the past.  She presented to the emergency room.

She initial presented to [**Hospital6 84551**] where her initial
HR was 100 and her BP was 102/64.  Labs were notable for a WBC
count of 12.4, Hct 45.4, Plts 277, INR 1.16, Creatinine 0.7, CK
26, Trop < 0.03, BNP 13.  She had a CTA which showed a large
right sided PE, large right sided pleural effusion and right
sided collapse.  She received lovenox 60 mg SC.  She was
transferred here for further management.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.2 P: 101 BP: 104/76 R: 22 O2
sat 95% on non-rebreather.  She had an EKG which showed normal
sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF III, avF,
otherwise no acute ST segment changes.  She had a CXR which
showed complete opacification of the right lung.  She is
admitted to the MICU for further management.

On arrival to the ICU she reports that her dyspnea has improved
since arrival to the hospital.  She denies fevers, chills,
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, melena, hematemasis,
hemoptysis, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain, leg swelling.  She
endorses worsening non-productive cough and dyspnea on exertion
as above.  All other review of systems negative in detail.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
CXR: Complete opacification of the right lung field.

CTA (wet read): left sided subsegmental pulmonary embolism,
large right pleural effusion, right sided collapse.

EKG: normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF
III, avF, otherwise no acute ST segment changes.

Echocardiogram [**2171-12-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus and ascending levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild-moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

CXR [**2171-12-25**]: Again seen is complete whiteout of the right
hemithorax and worsening opacification of a previously seen
small area of spared lung parenchyma in the right upper chest.
Central air bronchograms are noted. The left lung is clear. The
aorta demonstrates normal contour.
Incidentally noted is contrast in the pelvis of the kidneys
consistent with recent IV contrast injection.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2171-12-25**]: : Grayscale and
color Doppler ultrasound were performed. There is normal
compressibility, color flow, and Doppler signal within the
common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins.

TTE:  Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-12-25**],
estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower. The other
findings are similar. The pericardial effusion has not changed
appreciably in size.

AP portable chest film, [**2172-1-8**]:
Small to moderate right pleural effusion has minimally
decreased. Right
supraclavicular catheter remains in place. Right chest tube is
in place.
There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse increase in the interstitial
markings in
