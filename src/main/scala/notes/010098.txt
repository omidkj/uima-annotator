normally does.  She then went to bed but spent the majority of

MICRO:
urine, blood, stool cx negative

IMAGING:
HEAD CT- 1. No acute intracranial findings.
2. Chronic atrophy and small vessel disease.

CXR- Possible calcified hilar lymph nodes, but no
consolidations.

PLAIN FILM SURVERY FOR PRE-MRI SCREEN
1. No metallic foreign body within the soft tissues and no
evidence of a
pacemaker.

2. No lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

3. Old healed fracture through the proximal left humerus and
right inferior
pubic ramus.

EEG
 This EEG telemetry showed a slow background on the left
side, relatively constant throughout and suggesting an
encephalopathy.
There was continued concern about the low voltage tracing on the
right
side, raising the possibility of widespread cortical dysfunction
or
fluid over that area, as on the previous recording.
Nevertheless, there
were no clear epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] YO RHW presented with decreased responsiveness, eyes deviated
to the right.

NEURO:
Patient presented with worsening alteration in mental status,
eyes deviated to the right. She had a negative head CT in the
ED, and was initially admitted for concern of stroke to the
stroke service. Her neurologic examination was nonfocal. She was
initially unable to undergo MRI due to concern for metal foreign
body in her eye, which no family member could provide history
of. While awaiting resolution of this question, patient was
found to be tachycardic, hypoxic and hypertensive. She then
began developed right facial twitching, which progresses to
generalized tonic clonic seizure that lasted about 3 minutes.
Seizure resolved with Ativan. She was then loaded with IV Keppra
and continued on maintenance dosing. Given severity of vital
signs changes, patient was transferred to ICU for 48 hours of
continuous EEG monitoring. She had no futher clinical seizres.
EEG showed encephalopathy but no seizures or epileptiform
changes. Patient was then transferred back to neurology floor.
She failed to improve her mental status. Repeat head CT was
unchanged.
It was thought that patient's decline was multifactorial due to
infection, seizure, and underlying suspectible brain with
atrophy and white matter disease. When she failed to improve
despite treatment of each of the factors, goals of care
discussion occurred. Palliative care was consulted. Patient was
made DNR/DNI and then discharged home with home hospice care.
She will continue taking standing Ativan for seizure ppx.

ID:
Patient had respiratory distress and fever upon admission. She
was started with CTX and azithromycin initially. CXR did not
show any infiltrate, although there was still high suspicion for
PNA. When patient failed to improve, abx coverage was broadened
to vanco, zosyn, azithromycin. Blood, urine, stool cx all
negative.

GI/FEN:
Patient's mental status was significantly altered and
speech/swallow thought her unsafe to take POs without
aspiration. Given goals of care, patient will continue to take
POs for comfort and pleaure as she wishes.

GOALS OF CARE: Palliative care consulted. Patient's daughter
(HCP) and son were in complete agreement about patient's wishes
to not pursue aggressive treatments. She was made DNR and DNI.
Decision was made not to pursue feeding tube. Patient was
discharged with home hospice.
