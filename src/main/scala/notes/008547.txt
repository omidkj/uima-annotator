CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old white
female status post gastric bypass surgery on [**7-2**] at [**Hospital 14852**] presenting with shortness of breath
and electrocardiogram changes at her primary medical doctor's
office on [**2133-7-30**].

The patient stated the sudden onset of shortness of breath,
swelling, dizziness, and urge to defecate at approximately
2 p.m. on [**2133-7-29**] after drinking a protein shake and
taking MiraLax (a laxative).  The patient reports voiding a
large amount of soft stool but still feeling as if he were
having a "panic attack."  The patient has no history of panic
attacks in the past.  The patient called his primary medical
doctor's office where practice assistant advised her to
relax.  The patient took a nap and felt better for a short
time, but later in the evening experienced weakness and
dyspnea on exertion on walking to her car.

The patient went to bed and had a usual night of sleep.  She
was awake two times for urination and awoke feeling tired,
very easily became short of breath with light activity.  The
patient went to her primary medical doctor's office where an
electrocardiogram was performed which showed changes, and the
patient was referred to the rule out pulmonary embolism.  At
no time did the patient experience fevers, chills, chest
pain, diarrhea, or constipation.  The patient did experience
a feeling of clamminess and palpitations during the initial
shortness of breath episode.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Grandfather with diabetes mellitus.  Mother

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a social worker.  She is
married with no children.  She has a Yorkshire Terrier.  No
history of tobacco, or alcohol, or illicit drug use.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:   Emergency Department course
revealed initial vital signs with a temperature of 96.7,
pulse was 89, blood pressure was 166/78, respiratory rate was
24, saturating 99% on 2 liters, weight was 325 pounds.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus
rhythm at 95 beats per minute, normal axis, T wave inversions
in II, III, and aVF, V3 through V6.  Q wave in III, aVF as
compared to normal study of [**2133-6-29**].

A CT angiogram was performed which showed filling defects in
both the right main pulmonary artery and the left main
pulmonary artery, positive for pulmonary embolism.

The patient was given 162 mg of aspirin, Lopressor 5 mg
intravenously times two.  Heparin was started per weight
based protocol.  The patient was also given MS Contin 120 mg
times one, Zantac 150 mg times one, and oxygen per nasal
cannula 2 liters.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature was 96.7, pulse was 77, blood pressure was
129/81, respiratory rate was 12, pulse oximetry of 98% on 2
liters.  In general, an obese female in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed moist oral
mucosa.  Neck was supple.  No tracheal deviation.  Pulmonary
revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
revealed a normal first heart sound, split second heart
sound.  A regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  The abdomen was obese, soft, positive bowel sounds,
multiple laparoscopic scars.  Extremities revealed no calf
vein tenderness, 1+ pitting edema over ankles and feet.  Feet
were warm.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.
No focal deficits were noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratory results revealed the patient had a white blood
cell count of 7.7 (with 65.6% neutrophils), hematocrit
was 42.8.  No elevated electrolytes on Chemistry-7.  Initial
urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.035, negative
leukocyte esterase, negative nitrites, no red blood cells,
total protein, and ketones of above 80.  Liver function tests
showed an alkaline phosphatase of 148, albumin was 4.4.  The
patient had an initial set of cardiac enzymes which showed a
CK/MB of 9, a troponin I was 8.2, and a creatine
phosphokinase of 130.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Elevated troponin and electrocardiogram
changes which were believed to be due to right heart strain
secondary to pulmonary embolism.  However, cardiac enzymes
were cycled.  The first set of cardiac enzymes revealed a
CK/MB of 9, troponin I was 8.2, and a creatine phosphokinase
was 130.  The second set of cardiac enzymes revealed a CK/MB
was not done, troponin was 6, creatine phosphokinase was 64.
The third set revealed CK/MB was not done, troponin I
was 3.5, creatine phosphokinase was 64.

The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**7-31**]
which showed severe right heart strain, severe right heart
hypokinesis; at which point the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team was called for evaluation for thrombolytic therapy.  The
patient was approved for thrombolytics.

Status post Medical Intensive Care Unit t-PA course, an
echocardiogram was performed on [**8-3**] which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and mild right
ventricular hypokinesis; improved function as compared to
earlier study.

The patient's heart rate and blood pressure was stable at all
times.  Telemetry course was significant only for infrequent
premature ventricular contractions.

2.  PULMONARY:  Status post bilateral pulmonary embolism, the
patient was started on heparin per weight based protocol.
The patient's oxygen saturations and respiratory rates were
monitored for further pulmonary embolism events, but were
always within normal limits.

The patient was evaluated by Medical Intensive Care Unit team
after transthoracic echocardiogram results and was given t-PA
therapy in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore, she
was there for approximately 30 hours.  The patient returned
to the floor on a heparin drip.  At no time did she
experience shortness of breath or tachypnea once on the
floor.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was status post Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass surgery.  The patient was given gastric bypass
level IV diet and on iron and Zantac prophylaxis while in the
hospital.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient found to have a left leg deep
venous thrombosis from midfemoral to popliteal vein on
[**7-31**].  Laboratory studies sent for hypercoagulability
workup including antiphospholipid antibody, protein C,
protein S, antithrombin, factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**], homocystine levels;
all the mentioned were pending.  Homocystine, however, was
within normal limits.

The patient was continued on heparin and started on
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.  When the patient was discharged
her INR was 2.2, and her heparin was stopped.  The patient's
hematocrit was initially 42 on admission, but then dropped to
36.1, and had since risen to 36.5.

5.  DERMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have oval
erythematous scaling patch between skin folds at the left
pannus on [**2133-8-3**].  The patient was given miconazole
powder.

6.  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2133-7-31**] for t-PA administration.  The patient received t-PA from
12 a.m. to 2 a.m. on [**2133-8-1**] without complications.
The patient had a subclavian central line placed in the
Medical I
