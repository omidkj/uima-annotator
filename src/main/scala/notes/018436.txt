CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mitral valve thrombus.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 10123**] is a 46-year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure, mitral
valve repair, complete heart block and asthma who was
admitted to the hospital for heparinization prior to a
planned redo mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient originally had a mechanical valve placed about 10
years ago, she developed complete heart block and had a
pacemaker placed after the mitral valve surgery. While she
was having her pacemaker replaced in [**2165-6-6**], she
developed a mitral valve thrombus, followed by a successful
thrombolysis, however, a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram)
done at that time, revealed the mitral valve failure, and she
was scheduled for surgery.  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 10123**] says her goal INR
since then has been 3 to 4.  She was recently admitted for
surgery but it was delayed because she had an INR that was
greater than 5.  She was discharged with daily INR checks and
told to return to [**Hospital1 **] MC when her INR was less than 3.5. On
the day of admission, her INR is 2 and she comes to [**Hospital1 **] MC
for heparinization prior to her catheterization and mitral
valve surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, complete
heart block, depression, allergic rhinitis, asthma, anxiety
and status post mitral valve replacement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco use.  Denies alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  CAD (coronary artery disease), her father
had a CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) in his early 60s.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 120/80,
respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 96 percent on room air. GENERAL:
Anxious young woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Sclera  anicteric.  Oropharynx pink.  NECK:  Supple
with no lymphadenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate rhythm with a late
systolic ejection murmur.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES: With no clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x4, responds
appropriately, follows commands.  Cranial nerves intact.
Strength was [**4-10**] throughout.  Sensation to light touch is
intact throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  PT is 18.4, INR is 2.1.  TEE on [**10-9**]:
Prostatic mitral valve leaflet is normal with only one disk
appearing to open. The gradients are higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zoloft 100 mg q. Nightly.

The patient states no known drug allergies.

The patient went for cardiac catheterization on [**10-11**]
that showed moderate to severe mitral stenosis with no
pulmonary hypertension, 1+ MR (mitral regurgitation) an EF
(ejection fraction) of 50 percent, and no  angiographically
apparent CAD (coronary artery disease)>

The patient was followed by the Medicine Service over the
next several days while awaiting for her INR to come down and
on [**10-14**], she was brought to the operating room where
she underwent mitral valve replacement.  Please see the OR
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had a
mitral valve replacement with a No. 27 St. Jude valve. Her
bypass time was 117 minutes with a crossclamp time of 84
minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic
intensive care unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient
was sent A-sensed and V-paced at a rate of 96 beats per
minute with a mean arterial pressure of 74 and a  CVP of 4
with epinephrine at 0.03 mics/kilogram/minute, Neo-Synephrine
at 0.5 mics/kilogram/ minute and propofol at 10
mics/kilogram/minute.  The patient did well in the  immediate
postoperative period, her anesthesia was reversed.  She was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on
postoperative day 1. The patient remained hemodynamically
stable, although she was noted to have periods of ventricular
bigeminy, and the electrophysiology service was consulted at
that time. She continued on an amiodarone drip, as well as a
Neo-Synephrine drip and she was kept in the Intensive Care
Unit for hemodynamic monitoring. By postoperative day 2, the
patient had weaned off her Neo-Synephrine drip.  She was
transitioned to oral amiodarone. Her chest tubes, as well as
temporary pacing wires, were removed.  She was begun on
heparin, as well as warfarin, and transferred to the floor
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  Her activity level was increased with
the assistance of the nursing staff as well as the physical
therapy staff.  Her warfarin doses were adjusted to attain a
goal INR of 3 to 3.5, and ultimately on postoperative day 5,
it was decided that the patient would be stable and ready to
be discharged home.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is
as follows: Temperature 98.9, heart rate 80 A-sensed, V-
paced, blood pressure 108/60, respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 95
percent on room air.  Weight on day of discharge 54.5,
preoperatively 53.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12.4, hematocrit 34, platelets
547, sodium 141, potassium 4.0, chloride 99, CO2 29, BUN 17,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 96, PT 22.8, PTT 38, INR 3.3.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x3.  Moves all
extremities.  Follows commands.  Nonfocal exam.  PULMONARY:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate
and rhythm, S1-S2 with a sharp click.  Sternum is stable.
Incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active
bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm with trace edema.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post redo mitral valve replacement with a No. 27
   St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.
2. Complete heart block, status post permanent pacemaker
   placement.
3. Depression.
4. Asthma.

q.daily x2 weeks, oxycodone 5/325 1-2 tablets PO q.4-6 hours
p.r.n., Sertraline 100 mg q.daily, albuterol 1-2 puffs q.6
hours p.r.n., warfarin as directed to maintain a goal INR of
3 to 3.5. The patient is to take 4 mg on [**10-19**] and [**10-20**],
then have an INR check on [**10-21**]. Further dosages to be
prescribed by  further dosage is to be prescribed by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].  Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. x1 week, then 400 mg b.i.d.,
x1 week, then 400 mg q.daily x1 week, and ultimately 200 mg
q.daily.  The patient is to take Lasix 20 mg q.daily x2
weeks.

She is to be discharged to home with visiting nurses.  She is
to have an INR check on Monday the 15th, with results called
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**].  She is to have follow-up in the wound clinic
