Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
A fib with RVR, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE
ICU monitoring


History of Present Illness:
52 yo male with history of a fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, morbid
obesity, transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of A
fib with RVR in the setting of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  The patient
presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief
complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an
episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a
course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent
productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive
of clear to white sputum.  Over the past two days prior to
admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as
dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports he was able to walk
approximately 100feet before becoming short of breath.  He does
report at times he has felt lightheaded, however has never lost
consciousness.  He reports this episode was very similar to when
he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  He
denies any orthopnea or PND.  He denies any chest pain or
palpitations.

EMS gave the patient diltiazem en route to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER as
his rate was in the 180's.   In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received
another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.  Cardiology
was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem
drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.  After this treatment, the
patient became transiently hypotensive to the 80's systolic.
The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still
in the ER.  He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and
continued on a drip following.   On admission to the floor, the
patient was continued on this regimen.  DC cardioversion was
discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  Upon
further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a
history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  At
this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was
discontinued.  The patient was also found to be febrile, have
leukocytosis and productive cough.  He was treated with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP,
however this was discontinued prior to transfer.  On transfer,
the patient's HR was in the 170's, but normotensive.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous

thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
# A fib with RVR:  As the patient had a history of WPW with wide
complex tachycardia, consistent with antidromic preexcitation in
[**2107-1-7**], we refrained from using verapamil and digoxin as could
have promoted conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, as
the patient had evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] on TEE, we refrained
from DC or chemical cardioversion with procainamide especially
since patient was stable on admission.  Instead the patient was
started on an amiodarone drip with beta blockers in an attempt
to control his rate.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment
with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis contributed to
patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.  As the patient
remained in a narrow complex tachycardia, the team felt
comfortable using diltiazem for rate control in addition to beta
blockers as his rate was not well controlled and the likelihood
of him converting into a wide complex tachycardia was low.  His
rate was eventually controlled on a diltiazem drip and the
amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient then spontaneously
converted into sinus rhythm with a wide QRS indicative of a
right posterior/inferior bypass tract consistent with WPW.  The
diltiazem was discontinued and the patient was controlled on
beta blockers alone. The patient was continued on a heparin drip
for anticoagulation from the time of admission and coumadin was
started during hospitalization.  The patient was discharged on
propranolol, as there is a possibility thyrotoxicosis could have
initially contributed to the A fib with RVR, and coumadin for
management of his A fib.  He will be seen as an outpatient to
discuss the possibility of ablation of the WPW bypass tract to
prevent further episodes of wide complex tachycardia.

# [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:  The patient presented with a TEE done at
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital which showed evidence of a left atrial
appendage thrombus.  Our TEE attending reviewed the echo and
could not rule out the presence of a thrombus.  The patient was
continued on a heparin drip during his hospitalization and
started on coumadin.  A TTE was done which cou
