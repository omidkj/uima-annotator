Admission Date: [**2152-12-12**]
Discharge Date: [**2153-4-2**]
Date of Birth:  [**2152-12-12**]
Sex:  F
Service:  NB


HISTORY:  This infant was born at 24 and 5/7 weeks gestation
to a 27-year-old G1, P0, now 1 mother with prenatal screen.
Mom's prenatal screen was blood type A negative, antibody
negative, GBS unknown, HBsAg negative, RPR nonreactive. Past
medical history for the mother was remarkable for asthma
which was treated with albuterol. Mother was diagnosed with
cervical incompetence during this pregnancy. She presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with vaginal bleeding on [**2152-12-7**] and found
to be in preterm labor with cervical dilatation. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at that time and given betamethasone.
She was treated with magnesium sulfate for the preterm labor
and her dilatation progressed and a decision was made to
proceed to vaginal delivery at that time. Mother received
intrapartum antibiotics for unknown GBS status while she was
in labor. Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery. There
was no maternal fever. The infant was born by normal vaginal
delivery with Apgar's of 4, 7 and 8 at 1, 5 and 10 minutes.
The infant was intubated in the delivery room after positive
pressure ventilation was given with bag and mask and then
transported to the NICU without incident.

Measures at birth was a weight of 765 grams, length of 31 cm
and head circumference of 23 cm.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:  Discharge weight of 3725 grams.
A head circumference of 35.5 cm.  Length of 48.5 cm.  Active
and alert, well-appearing female infant on nasal cannula
oxygen. HEENT: Anterior fontanelle soft and flat.  Sutures
approximated. Intact palate. Normal red reflexes bilaterally.
Neck:  Supple.  Normal facies. Breath sounds clear and equal
to auscultation with comfortable respiratory effort.
Cardiovascular: Normal rate and rhythm with no murmur, normal
pulses, pink and well-perfused.  GI: Abdomen soft and round
with active bowel sounds. No palpable masses. GU: Normal
female genitalia with mild edema. Musculoskeletal: Good tone.
Straight spine, intact hips, moves all extremities well.
Neuro: Normal reflexes, tracks and follows.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

1. Respiratory - Infant had respiratory distress syndrome
    on admission to the NICU and received 2 doses of
    surfactant therapy on the newborn day. The infant was
    started on caffeine citrate on day 4 of life and
    extubated to CPAP also later that day. The infant was
    then reintubated on day of life 12 for worsening
    respiratory distress. She had a presumed pneumonia on
    [**2153-1-7**] which is day of life 26 due to x-ray findings and
    was treated with antibiotics at that time. On [**2153-1-17**],
    she was started on diuretic therapy of Lasix 3 times a
    week for chronic lung disease. She was also started on a
    7 day course of dexamethasone on [**2153-1-23**] for chronic
    lung disease in the hope of extubation. She did extubate
    to CPAP on [**2153-1-24**] which is day of life 43.  Her
    caffeine citrate was discontinued on [**2153-1-31**] due to
    tachycardia at that time. She transitioned from CPAP to
    nasal cannula on [**2153-2-28**]. Initially she was on high flow
    nasal cannula and weaned over time to the present nasal
    cannula setting of 250 mL/min flow of 100% FiO2 oxygen.
    She continues on Lasix therapy with supplemental KCL
    replacement.  She was without any apnea of prematurity or
    desaturations > 5 days prior to discharge. Her last
    arterial blood gas was on [**3-19**] which revealed: pH 7.41;
    PaCO2 53; PaO2 95; Base Excess 6.

2. Cardiovascular - She had hypotension on admission to the
    NICU and received 2 normal saline boluses and also was
    started on dopamine. She received dopamine at 5 mcg/kg/min
    for 2 days and since that time has not had problems with
    her blood pressure.

    She has had 3 echocardiograms.  Initial echocardiogram was
    done on [**2152-12-15**] which showed no PDA, but noted was a
    right coronary artery that came off leftward and higher
    than usual, but from the right sinus and the left
    coronary artery was not seen well.  Follow-up
    echocardiogram was done on [**2152-12-22**] which showed again no
    PDA, but there is a comment on echocardiogram that there
    was a prominent venous structure bringing blood towards
    the left side of the innominate vein and there were 2
    left sided pulmonary veins going to the left atrium. An
    echocardiogram done on [**2153-3-15**], was found to be within
    normal limits and there was no comment regarding abnormal
    venous and coronary structures, but cardiology does
    recommend follow up after discharge at 1 month of age at
    [**Hospital1 **] Cardiac Clinic.  At that time, a repeat
    echocardiogram is recommended.

    At the present time of discharge, the infant is
    hemodynamically stable with no murmur and normal blood
    pressures, heart rate, and pulses.

3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The infant was made
    n.p.o. on admission to the NICU and IV fluids were via
    umbilical arterial and venous catheters. The infant had
    significant electrolyte instability within the first few
    days of life which required total fluid to a maximum of
    280 mL/kg/day. The infant also developed hyperglycemia
    and was treated with an insulin drip for the first couple
    of days. The electrolytes were unstable initially and
    slowly stabilized over the first few days of life. The
    UAC was discontinued on day of life 5, [**2152-12-17**]. The UVC
    was discontinued on [**2152-12-18**] at which time a noncentral
    PICC line was placed for PN enteral lipid therapy. Enteral
    feedings were initiated on [**2152-12-18**] and slowly advanced.
    The infant achieved full enteral feedings by [**2152-12-28**]
    which is day of life 16. PICC line was discontinued on
    [**2152-12-29**]. Calories were further concentrated to a maximum
    caloric density of 32 cal/ounce feedings of breast milk
    or premature Enfamil formula. She has been growing well
    and her calories have subsequently been decreased. She is
    presently at discharge ad lib p.o.  feeding of Enfamil 26
    cal/ounce and taking approximate 150 mL/kg/day. She is
    voiding and stooling normally and she has showed steady
    weight gain. Her most recent set of electrolytes on [**4-2**]
    were Na 137; K 5.1; Cl 100; tCO2 35.  At the time of
    discharge she is on potassium chloride supplementation
    due to chronic Lasix therapy.

4. Gastrointestinal - She was treated for hyperbilirubinemia
    for a total of 6 days and had a peak bilirubin level of
    3.4/0.4. She has had no other GI issues.

5. Hematology - Her blood type is A positive, DAT negative.
    She had an initial hematocrit at birth of 48 with a
    platelet count of 340,000. She has received numerous red
    blood cell transfusions with the most recent transfusion
    being on [**2153-2-28**], for a hematocrit of 23 at that time. Her
    most recent hematocrit was 28 with a retic count of 2.5
    and that was done on [**2153-3-19**]. She was started on
    supplemental iron on [**2153-1-1**] and she remains on iron at
    the time of discharge for anemia of prematurity.

6. Infectious Diseases - A CBC and blood culture were screened
    on admission due to preterm labor and prematurity. The
    CBC at that time was not left shifted, but the infant did
    receive 7 days of ampicillin and gentamicin for presumed
    chorioamnionitis and preterm labor. Blood cultures were
    negative at that time. No lumbar puncture was done at
    that time.

    She had a CBC and blood culture screened due to spells
    and reintubation on [**2152-12-24**]. At that time the blood
    culture was again negative. No antibiotics were given at
    that time.

    On [**2153-1-7**], a CBC and blood culture was screened due to
    worsening respiratory status and a chest x-ray consistent
    with patchy infiltrates. The CBC was benign at that time,
    but she was treated with 7 days for presumed pneumonia. A
