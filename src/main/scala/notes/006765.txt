HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
male with history of Mounier-[**Doctor Last Name 36849**] syndrome, tracheomalacia,
status post right main stem bronchial stent in [**2169-5-3**] and
left main stem bronchial stent in [**2169-1-2**] who presented
after noting increased dyspnea with onset in [**Month (only) 1096**].  The
patient reports having upper respiratory illness in early
[**Month (only) 1096**].  Since that time, he has noticed progressive
shortness of breath, worse with activity.  He was seen by his
primary pulmonologist in [**Location (un) **], [**State 531**].  Bronchoscopy
there showed extensive granulation tissue at the sites of his
previous stent placements with near airway occlusion.  He was
sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for stent
removal.  Left stent was removed with visualization of
extensive granulation tissue.  He has a history of chronic
cough associated with white light yellow sputum, reports no
change in sputum, character or frequency, over the past
several months.  He denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, lower extremity swelling.  No recent sick
contacts, fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former tobacco smoker
smoking one pack per day for 40 years and quit in [**2160**].  He
is a retired truck driver.  His is from [**Location (un) **], [**State 531**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.3 degrees,
blood pressure 153/93, heart rate 75, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturation 96 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.
General appearance, well-developed, well-nourished male,
comfortable, lying in bed, in no acute distress.  He becomes
breathless if there are several sentences.  HEENT exam showed
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, reactive to
light.  Sclerae anicteric.  Oral mucosa moist.  Neck was
supple without masses or lymphadenopathy.  No jugular venous
distension.  Lung exam showed coarse breath sounds throughout
with transmitted upper airway sounds.  Cardiac exam was
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2 heart sounds.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive normal active bowel sounds.  No
rebound or guarding.  Extremities were warm and well perfused
with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood cell count on
admission showed WBC 6.5, hematocrit 47.3, platelets 228.
Serum chemistries showed sodium 142, potassium 4.2, chloride
104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 13, creatinine 1.1, glucose 86,
calcium 9.3, phosphorus 3.8, magnesium 2.3.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG with normal sinus rhythm at 70
beats per minute with normal axis.  No left ventricular or
right ventricular hypertrophy.  There was right bundle-branch
block.  T-wave inversions noted in leads V1 through V3, aVL,
I and II.  No acute changes from previous EKG.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure
secondary to Mounier-[**Doctor Last Name 36849**] syndrome.  The patient has a
history of dynamic compromise of his trachea and bronchi.  He
has a prolonged history of dyspnea with minimal exertion.  He
underwent removal of right and left main stem bronchial
stents as performed by the Interventional Pulmonary Team.
There was significant granulation tissue noted around the
stents.  Additionally, the stents themselves were infected.
Therefore, he received a course of antibiotics consisting of
levofloxacin and Zosyn.  He was continued on nebulizers every
4 hours and every 2 hours as needed, Solu-Medrol tapered to
prednisone and guaifenesin for cough suppression.  During
this hospitalization, he did have several episodes of
respiratory distress necessitating noninvasive ventilation
and monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was stabilized
after noninvasive ventilation and helium respiratory therapy
and transferred back to the General Medicine Floor.  The
ultimate plan was for the patient to undergo
tracheobronchoplasty by the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team.  He
was taken to the operating room in preparation for planned
tracheobronchoplasty.  Preoperative bronchoscopy however
demonstrated overwhelming thick purulent secretions.
Therefore, tracheobronchoplasty was postponed so that the
patient could undergo serial bronchoscopy for pulmonary
toilet hoping to clear these infected secretions.
Ultimately, these secretions were cultured and grew
Stenotrophomonas.  Therefore, the patient was seen by the
Infectious Disease Service.  Plan was made for the patient to
undergo several weeks of antibiotic therapy to clear the
respiratory infection and then to return for repeat
bronchoscopy and possible tracheobronchoplasty at that time.

Hypertension.  The patient's blood pressure was controlled
with diltiazem, titrated to keep his systolic blood pressure
within a normal range.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The patient was continued
on his outpatient dose of Protonix.

Elevated liver function tests.  The patient was noted to have
an elevated ALT.  Unclear whether this was medication
related.  Reviewed his medication list physically, diltiazem,
levofloxacin, and Zosyn.  Pointed to the Zosyn as the most
likely culprit.  Hepatitis serologies were negative.  He was
screened for alcohol abuse history and denied excess abuse.
Iron studies for hemachromatosis were negative.

Thrombocytopenia.  After initiation of antibiotic therapy,
the patient's platelets slowly drifted down.  Heparin induced
antibody was sent and was negative.  It was unclear whether
this was related to HIT type 1 as the platelets rebounded
after discontinuation of heparin products.  It could also be
medication related as Zosyn causes thrombocytopenia as well.

Elevated MCV.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.

stable.  Breathing at baseline.
