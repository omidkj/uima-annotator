Findings
65 years old male for AAA with suprarenal clamp. Hasa multiple
DES in the RCA, LAD and CRX distribution. There is mild MR and
E/E' ratio is 9 suggesting normal LVEDP. The patient developed
anterior and inferior wall hypokinesis with suptrarenal clamp
that recovered after the clamp came off. There is right coronary
cusp calcification without any regugitation or stenosis.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately depressed LVEF. TDI E/e' < 8,
suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade
I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2106-8-3**]
The patient was scheduled for an open AAA repair. He had
cardiology clearance preop by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Intra-op the
patient required multiple blood transfusion for blood loss of
4500cc and hypotension. He was transferred to the CVICU for
immediate post op care.

[**2106-8-4**]
POD #1, Continued to be intubated and sedated. No overnight
issues. Aggressive pulmonary toilet. Plavix held (patient has
bare metal cardiac stents) for bleeding- this was cleared with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Neo gtt for pressure support. ICU monitoring.

[**Date range (1) 5287**]
Continued intubation and diuresis. CMV vent setting. Received 2
units of PRBC for Hct of 26. No active bleeding presently. Neo
weaned off. Good pain management. CPAP trials [**8-6**].

[**2106-8-7**]
Extubated, stable. Continued pulmonary toilet. OOB to chair.
Transferred to VICU.

[**2106-8-8**]
Some deliruim overnight. Received 2units PRBC for Ht of 26.
Continues to diuresis with IV lasix TID. Started on clear,
liquid diet and bowel regimen.

[**2106-8-9**]
Stable. Physical therapy working with patient and recommending
Rehab. Mentally intact. Rehab screening. Foley and central line
removed. Tolerating regular diet. Plavix 75mg po QD restarted.

[**2106-8-10**]
Rehab screening. 1-2 L NC of 02 (which is patient's baseline).

[**2106-8-11**]
Pt remains stable on 1-2L of O2. Diuresing well, change to oral
lasix today. Ambulating with PT. [**Hospital 25403**] rehab bed offer

[**2106-8-12**]
Pt has done well overnight with no acute issues. He is
discharged to rehab facility today.
