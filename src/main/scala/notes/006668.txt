Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents / Percocet / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure s/p intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation
flexible bronchoscopy with moderate sedation
percutaneous tracheostomy placement
PEG tube placement [**2140-1-19**]


History of Present Illness:
68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stensosis s/p
complicated respiratory failure history, transferred from OSH
with recurrent respiratory failure for consideration of
tracheostomy.  She presented with acute respiratory distress to
OSH one day PTA and was subsequently intubated for
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 105299**] hospital on [**2139-11-20**]
after acute respiratory distress and short PEA arrest at home.
Led to intubation.  Per notes treated for CHF and pneumonia.
She failed at least one extubation trial, and had subsequent
transfer, while intubated, to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 78750**] on the
thoracics/IP service.  She was extubated on the day of transfer.
 Bronch noted to have stable tracheal stenosis.  Did well on
nightly bipap and pulmonary toilet with O2 sats 90-92% on 4L
during day.  Discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab on [**12-15**].  Following
this rehab admission she was sent to a different OSH on
[**2139-12-21**], for acute CHF and at least one PEA arrest. Had AICD
placement and reports ?cardiac cath.  Intubated at least twice
during that admission.  Respiratory distress frequently
accompanied by elevated blood pressures.  Troponin during that
admission elevated to 0.4 with one episode of resp distress.
Also noted that anxiety seems to be a trigger, and was given
scheduled 1 mg Ativan prior to Bipap removal.  Following this
admission she went to a rehab facility again.  Discharged from
rehab to home on [**1-11**].  That evening (yesterday) she became
cyanotic at home reportedly after having a milkshake and Ativan.
 EMS brought patient to [**Hospital3 13313**] on bipap and she
was eventually intubated in the ED, uncomplicated.  On arrival
to ED, tachypneic to 30s with bipap at 20/4, sats in low 90s on
FiO2 1.  HR 80, BP 170/62 initially.  Prior to intubation given
flumazenil and narcan.  Lasix and bumex as well as IV ativan and
versed at OSH.  ABG at some point 7.15/76/84.  CXR per notes
with cardiomegaly, volume excess, new pacer.  Patient reports
also having an echo today but no report available.
.
On the floor, patient denies current respiratory difficulties.
C/o pain in the throat and at her pacer site.  Denies any chest
pain, N/V, diaphoresis prior to onset of her recurrent dyspnea.
Does endorse anxiety prior to symptoms onset.

chronic wean facility but unable to decannulate. Bronchoscopy
revealed tracheomalacia of subglottic region.
-Supraglottic edema from GERD

    **FINAL REPORT [**2140-1-16**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-1-16**]):
      ENTEROBACTER ASBURIAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML
