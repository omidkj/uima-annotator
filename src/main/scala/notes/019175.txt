History of Present Illness:
67-year-old female with past medical history of severe TBM
s/p Y-stent in [**7-9**], severe COPD (on home O2), CAD s/p MI, CHF,
hypertension, and severe anxiety, now transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital with COPD exacerbation and aspergillus in her sputum.
She has had frequent hospitalizations in the past few months for
dyspnea and COPD exacerbations. During these episodes, she
reports copious, thin secretions with an inability to cough. She
most recently was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2196-10-15**] for
COPD exacerbation and underwent bronchoscopy to remove
secretions. Initial bacterial studies revealed colonization
w/aspergillus and [**Female First Name (un) **], no infection, no atypical cells, no
evidence of HSV or AFB. CXR had revealed severe COPD with no
infiltrates. At this time, she was continued on her regimen of
aerosol treatment, started on Solu-Medrol, and placed on
levaquin
for possible infectious etiology of acute bronchitis. She was
discharged on [**2196-10-20**]. On [**2196-10-31**] she was readmitted to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for shortness of breath, fever (temp=101.2 F),
and chills. She was started on voriconazole for positive
aspergillus culture from sputum, and subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management, including rigid
bronchoscopy and removal of Y-stent.

Pertinent Results:
chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked consolidation in the left lower and right lower lobes
with more mild consolidation in the lingula and right upper lobe
could be consistent with aspergillosis. Followup chest CT is
recommended after treatment to ensure resolution.

2. Severe apical predominant emphysema, right greater than left.

4. Moderate aortic valve calcifications.

5. Tracheobronchial tree is patent; per report the tracheal
stent was removed prior to this examination.

6. 10-mm low-density rounded focus in the spleen is incompletely
characterized but likely represents a cyst. If clinically
warranted, an ultrasound examination could provide definitive
characterization.

7. Multiple mid-thoracic wedge compression fractures, difficult
to compare. Multiple healing posterior rib fractures.
