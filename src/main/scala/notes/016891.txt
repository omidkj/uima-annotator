none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 82 y/o female with grade II diastolic CHF, CAD, atrial
fibrillation who presents with increasing shortness of breath.
She reports that in the middle of night to early morning she
began to notice she could not longer lie flat in bed. Her
breathing was becoming more labored. Denies any chest pain,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting. No cough recently, no fevers,
chills. She lives in [**Hospital3 **], but no known sick contacts
around recently that she is aware of. She has chronic lower
extremity edema but does not feel it has been worse recently.
.
EMS noted her oxygen saturation was in the high 80s on a NRB.
They gave her 2 NTG SL and 80mg IV lasix. In the ED, her vital
signs were T 99.6, HR 119, BP 198/92, RR 34, O2sat 60% on NRB.
She was placed on BIPAP and her saturation improved to 92%. She
was placed on a nitro gtt. CXR suggested pulmonary edema. Prior
to coming to the floor she was taken off BIPAP and placed on 6L
NC as her respiratory status improved.
.
Currently, pt reports marked improvement in her breathing.
Denies CP, palpitations, nausea/vomiting. +constipation. No
dysuria, hematuria. +chronic bilateral lower extremity pain but
no change recently.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Patient is a 82 yo female with a h/o
diastolic CHF, AFib, CAD who presents with progressive SOB and
found to have a CHF exacerbation likely secondary to AFib with
RVR.
.
# Dyspnea: History and presentation suggests that she likely had
flash pulmonary edema causing her respiratory distress. Patient
was transferred to the MICU on arrival, where she was placed on
BIPAP.  The patient was placed on a nitroglycerine drip and was
given Lasix.  The patient diuresed significantly, and her O2
requirement decreased to 2L.  The patient was thus transferred
to the floor.  She was placed back on her home dose of Lasix 40
mg PO daily, and her O2 requirement decreased.  The patient was
ruled out for influenza, and her blood cultures did not show any
growth.  It was thought that the etiology of this patient's
flash pulmonary edema was AFib with RVR.  The patient was rate
controlled for this condition and did not have any further
episodes of dyspnea.
.
# Leukocytosis: The patient had a leukocytosis of 28.3 on
admission. Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, and
influenza cultures were drawn, which did not show any obvious
source of underlying infection.  It was thought that this
leukocytosis was a stress reaction; thus, the patient was not
started on antibiotics.  Her leukocytosis decreased with
oxygenation and adequate diuresis, and the patient remained
afebrile during this admission.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was found to be in AFib with RVR
on admission.  She was continued on her home dose of beta
blocker and verapamil, and her pulse decreased appropriately.
The patient continued to be adequately beta-blocked on this
admission.   She was monitored on telemetry, and her Coumadin
was continued, and did not have any acute events during this
admission.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a h/o MI. She denies
any chest pain on this admission, but it was thought that
cardiac ischemia may have been the etiology of her flash
pulmonary edema.  The patient's cardiac troponins were checked,
and they were negative x4.  She was continued on her home doses
of Metoprolol, Statin, ACE inhibitor, and ASA.
.
# COPD: The patient was continued on her home dose of
Fluticasone, Spiriva, and nebulizations as needed.
.
# Anxiety: The patient was continued on her home dose of
Alprazolam as needed.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection:  The patient's U/A on admission
showed small blood and 500+ protein.  The patient's urine
culture grew out Gram positive bacteria, consistent with
Lactobacillus or alpha streptococcus.  The patient was not
started on antibiotics for her asymptomatic bacteriuria.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI per patient.
