Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED upon first arrival Temp 102.4F and given tylenol.
Given Vancomycin 1g x 1 and Levofloxacin 750mg x 1.  Given
Albuterol and Ipratropium Nebs and solumedrol 125mg x 1.  UA was
negative.  Blood and urine cultures done.  EKG done without
evidence of acute ischemia.  Oxygen increased from 2L to 6L
(Oxygen sat 94%/6L). And she was admitted to ICU for further
monitoring.  After 1 day in the ICU she was deemed stable, and
though direct discharge from ICU was considered, decision was
made to monitor one more day on the general medical floor.
Course as outlined below:

# Pneumonia - Given fever, elevated white count with bands,
hypoxia and RML, RLL opacities consistent with pneumonia.  Most
c/w with CAP, no history of aspiration.  No h/o COPD.  Urine
legionella negative.  Did well the night of admit with minimal
O2 requirements, cough remained unproductive so no sputum
culture was obtained.  Throughout stay continued to deny SOB or
increased WOB, was afebrile throughout hospital stay.
Originally started on Levo/vanc for HAP and flagyl for possible
aspiration PNA.  Antiobiotics narrowed the morning of admission
at recommendation of pulmonary ICU attending to Levofloxacin,
renally dosed, with projected duration of 10 days for CAP, last
dose to be [**2190-9-10**]. On day of discharge o2 sat 93% RA.

# Elevated BNP - Did have some crackles in bases on lung exam
consistent with atelectasis, does not appear volume overloaded,
no peripheral edema.  Was monitored for signs of volume overload
but did not develop overt heart failure during hospitalization.

# CRI - Creatinine on admit at baseline.  CRI felt to be due to
HTN. Throughout stay was monitored for worsening renal function
but none was observed.  All medications renally dosed during
stay.  At discharge creatinine was 1.3 down from 1.4 on
admission.

# HTN - Well controlled at baseline.  Not an issue since admit.
Was continued on home norvasc dosing.

All other chronic medical issues did not necessitate medical
intervention or medication adjustments during her
hospitalization.
