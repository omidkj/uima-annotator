Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lumbar puncture, PICC

History of Present Illness:
85 year-old female with seizures, CHF (right sided), pulmonary
HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR,
severe TR, HTN, presents with fever, hypotension, seizures. She
has been at [**Hospital **] rehab recovering from a SBO surgery in the
spring and has been slowly worsening. She had a seizure 2 weeks
ago and was started on Keppra. Two days ago, her keppra dose was
decreased for a high peak and somnalence. On [**8-29**], she was
febrile to 102.8. She has had continued ventilator requirement.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 105.4 P 82 BP 96/60 R O2 sat 100.
She was hypotensive to 70s/40s from baseline 90s/60s but
responded to 2 L IVF. Exam showed unresponsive cachectic woman
with warm basilar ralles and cuts in teeth and mouth c/w
seizure. Guiac (+) stool. EKG showed new lateral downsloping st
depressions. ED doctor discussed code status with son, who
confirmed DNR, moving to CMO but wanted a last hurrah. Family
did not want a LP because it was too invasive and did not want a
CT scan because they did not want any surgeries to correct what
might be found. She was given Acetaminophen 650mg x2,
Piperacillin-Tazob, Vancomycin 1g, Acyclovir, Aspirin 600mg
Supp. Prior to transfer, vitals were HR 77 BP 81/49, RR 33
ovebreathing vent, sat 97% on RR 10, TV 359 PEEP 5, FiO2 40%.

CXR [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: There may be small bilateral pleural
effusions. Overall, however, no acute pulmonary process is
identified.
CT head [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: Relatively stable head CT examination
compared with [**2142-6-14**]. No CT evidence of acute cortical
stroke or hemorrhage. Incidental findings as above.
MRI head [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse hyperintensities in the
white matter indicate extensive changes of small vessel disease,
which have progressed since the previous MRI of [**2136-10-19**].
2. Ventriculomegaly and prominence of temporal horns which in
presence of
choroidal fissure widening is secondary to atrophy.
3. Chronic blood products in the left cerebellum indicate
previous hemorrhage
with bilateral small chronic cerebellar infarcts.
4. No evidence of acute infarct seen.
5. No evidence of abnormal parenchymal enhancement.

[**9-6**] MRI head
FINDINGS: Extensive periventricular and subcortical
hyperintensities are
identified with moderate ventriculomegaly and prominence of
temporal horns. Hyperintensities are also seen in the pons and
middle cerebellar peduncles. There is an area of chronic blood
products in the left cerebellum. There is no acute infarct seen.
No midline shift identified. Coronal images demonstrate
bilateral hippocampal atrophy with widening of the choroidal
fissures. No intrinsic signal abnormalities are seen within the
hippocampus. The hyperintensity seen on the superior aspect of
the right hippocampus appears to be due to enhancement of the
choroid plexus as the FLAIR images appear to have been obtained
following gadolinium administration.
Coronal MP-RAGE images demonstrate no evidence of abnormal
parenchymal
enhancement. There is mild diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement
seen, which is a nonspecific finding and could be related to
prior lumbar puncture. IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter indicate
extensive changes of small vessel disease, which have progressed
since the previous MRI of [**2136-10-19**].
2. Ventriculomegaly and prominence of temporal horns which in
presence of
choroidal fissure widening is secondary to atrophy.
3. Chronic blood products in the left cerebellum indicate
previous hemorrhage with bilateral small chronic cerebellar
infarcts.
4. No evidence of acute infarct seen.
5. No evidence of abnormal parenchymal enhancement.
6. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement is identified which is a
nonspecific
finding and could be due to prior lumbar puncture.
