Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**2195-9-14**] for cardiac catheterization,
which showed significant disease with progression of the left
main lesion - she had 60% stenosis of LMCA, LAD had 80% ostial
lesion then 70% mid-vessel stenosis, D1 with 60% origin, D2 with
50%, LCX with 70% in OM1, and RCA with 70% ostial lesion, with
patent stents distally. Given the progression of disease,
decision made to not intervene and refer for CABG. Of note, pt
quite hypertensive this morning upon arrival to cath lab. In
addition to being given all of her htn meds, she also was
started on a nitro gtt, which was continued through the
procedure. She had some CP, which resolved with control of her
BP. She was also pre-hydrated given her arrival creatinine of
1.8
  Following cath, she was maintained on the nitro gtt for
hypertention and transferred to CCU from CMI service for
management of hypertensive urgency and chest pain.

Patient then underwent an uncomplicated CABG x 3
(SVG->LAD,SVG->RCA,SVG->OM) on [**2195-9-16**]. Please see OP report
for details. Post-operatively she remained in the CSRU for close
management.

She was extubated by post op day one, and transferred to the
step down unit by post op day 6. She did have some post op a fib
for which she was placed on amiodarone and coumadin. Her
creatinine remained at her baseline of 1.8-1.9. Her leg incision
continued to drain moderate amounts of serous fluid. She as
placed on levofloxacin for minimal erythema surrounding the Left
knee incision. She was ready for dischrge on post op day eight
and a rehab bed became available on post op day 9.
