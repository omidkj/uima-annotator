Admission Date:  [**2151-12-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-1-13**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a significant past medical history of
hypertension, recent urinary tract infection, hypothyroidism,
who called EMS on [**2151-12-30**] after feeling unwell and
experiencing chest pain.  The patient was found to be
unresponsive and a junctional rhythm in the 40s with no
palpable pulse in respiratory distress.  She was intubated in
the field and received 1 mg atropine with a responsive heart
rate 80s, blood pressure 80/palp.  She was taken to the
[**Hospital 4068**] Hospital and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
as the patient was felt to be in cardiogenic shock.

Catheterization revealed three vessel disease (90% left
anterior descending, 90% left circumflex artery, presumed
occluded right coronary artery) and septic physiology (SVR
577, cardiac index 4.5, SCV02 82%).  The procedure was
complicated by a right iliac dissection necessitating a
brachial artery approach.  The patient was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis of unclear etiology.
She had a dirty urinalysis at outside hospital with negative
urine and negative blood cultures.  There was some concern
for aspiration in the setting of her intubation and she was
therefore treated empirically with levofloxacin and Flagyl.
She was extubated on [**12-31**] but had a new 02 requirement
felt likely to be secondary to pulmonary edema.  She received
six liters as part of her fluid resuscitation.  Diuresis was
complicated by a rising creatinine.

At time of transfer to the floor, the patient felt well and
denied fever, chills, headache, chest pain and shortness of
breath, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea or
vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post E. Coli urinary tract infection in [**2151-10-25**].

3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  Hypothyroidism, status post thyroidectomy.
5.  Appendectomy.
6.  Humerus fracture.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levoxyl 0.05 mg po q.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q.d.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Celebrex 200 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No illicit drugs times three.  Lives at home
with sister who is [**Age over 90 **] years old.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TIME OF TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:
Temperature 97.9.  Temperature maximum 99.4.  Blood pressure
110/80.  Heart rate 92.  Respiratory rate 20, saturating
93-95% on shovel mask.  General:  Pleasant female with mild
tachypnea.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: She is
anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Jugular venous
distention difficult to appreciate but EJ distended at 45
degrees.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs.  S3, S4 not appreciated.  Lungs:  Mild crackles at
bases bilaterally.  Positive expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen:

edema.  1+ pulses posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis
bilaterally, warm, right groin without bruit or hematoma.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are intact.  No gross, motor or sensory
deficits.

DATA:  Cardiac catheterization on [**12-30**] revealed three
vessel coronary artery disease with normal left main, 90%
left anterior descending, 90% left circumflex artery,
presumed occluded right coronary artery.  Supranormal cardiac
output with low SVR.  SVR 577, cardiac output 6.8, cardiac
index 4.5.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 13.
Dissection of right iliac artery.

Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**12-31**] revealed mild left
atrium dilation, moderately depressed left ventricular
ejection fraction at 35% with anterior septal and apical
hypokinesis to akinesis.  1+ aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.

CT of the head on [**1-10**] showed no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or hydrocephalus, changes consistent with age
related atrophy present.

CT of the chest on [**1-7**] indicated bilateral pleural
effusions and findings suggestive of pulmonary edema.  No
evidence of infection.

Micro:  Patient's Clostridium difficile negative times two.
>.....<culture positive for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus on [**1-7**].  Repeat urine [**1-10**] is contaminated by no evidence of Staph aureus.  Blood
cultures negative throughout her stay.  Sputum culture on
[**12-31**] negative.

LABORATORIES AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  White blood cell
count 17.2, hematocrit 30.2, MCV 95, platelet count 176,000.

29, BUN 53, creatinine 1.1, glucose 109.

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
functionally independent female with a history of
hypertension, hypothyroidism, recent urinary tract infection
found to be unresponsive by EMS who was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] from [**Hospital3 4527**] for
emergent cardiac catheterization secondary to concerns for
cardiogenic shock, but was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after catheterization revealed septic
physiology of unclear etiology.

1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was extubated on
[**12-31**].  She had a short Medical Intensive Care Unit
course as described in the history of present illness.
Patient was transferred to the floor with a significant 02
requirement and mild level of respiratory distress felt to be
secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of her
intravenous fluid resuscitation upon admission.  She was
transferred to the floor for ongoing diuresis, and her 02
requirement was weaned to 1-2 liters nasal cannula at the
time of this dictation.  She has had coarse upper airway
sounds and secretions which she has been unable to clear, but
she has had multiple chest x-ray's and a chest CT, which were
all negative for any evidence of infection.  AT various
points throughout her stay, she had mild desaturations into
the mid 80s, which responded to increased pulmonary toilet
and chest physical therapy as they were felt secondary to
aforementioned secretions.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient found to have three vessel
coronary artery disease and a depressed ejection fraction.
Also with non ST elevations myocardial infarction. Patient
was started on a cardiac regimen of aspirin, Plavix, statin
and low dose beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor as tolerated by
her blood pressure.  Family is aware of the patient's
diagnosis of three vessel coronary artery disease and
depressed ejection fraction, and are also aware that in
certain settings, these would be indications for coronary
artery bypass graft, and or ICD placement.  However, given
the advanced age of the patient, they were in agreement that
medical management be pursued at this time.

3.  Infectious Disease:  Patient admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with septic physiology but no clear
source.  She completed an initial seven day course of
levofloxacin and Flagyl, as well as a seven day course of
stress dose steroids.  She had a leukocytosis on the floor,
but remained afebrile throughout her entire stay.  Repeat
chest x-ray's and CT were negative for evidence of a
pulmonary etiology.  She had a urine culture on [**1-7**]
that grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus at
which time she was started on vancomycin to complete a 14 day
course.  A repeat urine culture on [**1-10**] was
contaminated but had no evidence of Staph aureus.

4.  Mental status:  On approximately [**1-8**] and [**1-9**], the patient was noted to have a decreased level of
alertness, although, she remained oriented times three.  This
prompted a head CT which revealed no acute process.  She also
had repeat arterial blood gases, which revealed very mild CO2
retention and no evidence of acidemia.  Her urinary tract
infection is resolving.  It was felt at the time that the
patient looked intervascularly dry and was given a trial of
intravenous fluids to which she responded well, and appeared
to be more alert on the following day.  She remained without
any focal neurological findings.

5.  Acute renal failure:  The patient had an epi
