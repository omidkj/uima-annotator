History of Present Illness:
This 56 year old gentleman with a history of hypertension,
asthma, hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse presents with increased L
chest pain s/p [**2122**]0 days ago. At that time the patient says
he had slipped on some ice and fell on his L side, developing a
bruise on his L side. He saw his PCP who believed he may have
had rib fractures and prescribed percocets for pain control. The
patient has not had any falls or trauma since that time, but
reports the pain has gotten worse; it localizes to the L side,
rating [**9-22**] and worsened by breathing. No radiation or
associated diaphoresis. No dyspnea, altough the patient says the
pain makes it harder to breath.
The patient reports he does not abuse alcohol and last had a
drink 3 days ago drinking 2 beers on Saturday night. He denies
any history of delirium tremens, blackouts, or admission to
detoxification facilities. Per his aunt and uncle, however, the
patient continues to be a heavy drinker. Furthermore, they
report on the day prior to admission, they had a phone
conversation with the patient and said that he was incoherent.
On review of systems, the patient reports he has not eaten in 2
days. He denies nausea, vomiting/hematemesis, melena, or brbpr.

In the ED, the patient was initially afebrile with SBP in 90's
and heart rate in 100's. O2 sat was 95 on room air. He was
complaining of L sided chest pain. Laboratories revealed a cr of
4 and a K of 5.5 with peaked T waves on EKG, bicarb 18. CK 6600.
Hematocrit returned as 38.5 down from 48 a week ago. CT scan
revealed RLL opacities in lung and small hematoma along L rib
cage. 2 rib fractures were seen in that area. WBC was elevated
to 12.1 lactate was 1.1. The patient received 6L NS and 1 unit
pRBC. Also rec'd bicarb and kayexelate. Blood pressure rose to
110 systolic, morphine 4mg IV was given for pain control.
Levofloxacin and flagyl were given due to concern for pneumonia.

CT Chest [**12-22**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Nondisplaced left ninth rib fracture, displaced left tenth
rib fracture, with associated left-sided soft tissue hematoma.
2. Poorly defined multi focal areas of ground-glass opacity and
consolidation seen scattered throughout the lungs, with smaller
nodular density is also seen. These findings possibly represent
infectious versus inflammatory process, although followup
imaging is recommended to document resolution.
3. Mediastinal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
with enlarged right hilar and right retrocrural lymph nodes
identified. Followup imaging is recommended to document
resolution.
.
[**12-29**] ECHO: Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen
(cannot definitively exclude).
.
CXR [**12-22**]: IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: Vague opacity in the right mid
to lower lung zone could represent pneumonia and is probably
unchanged.
.
CXR [**12-26**]: Multifocal airspace disease consistent with multifocal
pneumonia/aspiration slightly improved since the prior
examination
.
CXR [**12-31**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-24**] through
14:  Several of the nodular areas of consolidation seen
previously have cleared. Background interstitial abnormality,
probably edema, and mediastinal vascular engorgement are
unchanged. Tip of the left subclavian line ends at the junction
of brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 year old gentleman with hypertension, asthma,
hepatitis C and a history of alcohol abuse who presented s/p
[**2178**]0 days prior to admission with associated rib fractures.
He was found to be in ARF with hyperkalemia, with CK to 6600 and
admitted to the MICU originally for that reason found to have
DTs and briefly intubated for change in MS.
