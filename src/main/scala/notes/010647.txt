Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, fell and hit his head, presented to OSH with SAH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation
Percutaneous Gastric feeding tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 64 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
including CAD (s/p CABG, cath), a-fib on sotolol, with pacer and
ICD([**Hospital1 **]-ventricular) presents after transfer from [**Hospital 58921**] Center in NH.

His wife reports that they were at home on the night prior to
admission when she heard a loud noise in the kitchen.  The
patient had fallen down and hit his head on the counter.  She
found him lying down on the floor and reports that his eyes were
rolled back into his head, his arms were stiff and he was
"breathing funny."  This lasted about one minute and she reports
that it is similar to past episodes of "tachycardia."  When he
woke up he could not remember the episode, which was unusual,
but he knew who she was. She asked him what the date was and he
did not know.  He reports that he felt like he was moving slowly
and did not remember anything of the episode.

He states he was in his usual state of health, denies preceeding
chets pain, shortness of breath but did feel "foggy".  He said
the next thing he remembered was the EMS being in the kitchen
and felt back to himself once in the ED.

Of note, he has presented with syncope and/or nausea and fatigue
at least twice in the past ([**2187**] and [**2189**], both times with
monomorphic VT seen after interrogating his ICD).  However this
episode was different in that he did not return to his baseline
MS immediately after.

EMS was called and he was taken to the OSH.  EKG showed paced
rhythm.  A small SAH was found on CT (single sulcus in the left
in the region postecentral sulcus).  He was given fosphenytoin
and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation.

VS in the ED: afebrile, BP 101/58 trended down to 90/50, HR
60's, RR 18, 94-96%on room air.  He was noted to have a stable
head CT, with a white count of 11.4 and INR 2.1.  His first set
of cardiac biomarkers was negative, as was his chest x-ray.  His
SBP was slightly decreased from his baseline and he was started
on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone, continued on fosphenytoin, also
given 2 units of FFP (to reverse anticoagulation).  He was seen
by neurosurgery who recommended continuing seizure prophylaxis.
 He was admitted for syncope and monitoring of his
SAH-inititally to the ICU for transient hypotension.

==============
IMAGING
==============
CT head [**1-5**]
Small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the central sulcus
on the left. No mass effect. Compared to the outside hospital CT
study performed at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center on [**2191-1-5**] at 5:49
p.m., there has been no appreciable interval change.

CXR [**1-5**]
1. New mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular
congestion.
2. No overt pulmonary edema.
3. No evidence of pneumonia

CT head [**1-11**]
Resolution of a tiny amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
left central sulcus.

CT head [**1-14**]
IMPRESSION: No new hemorrhage. Large left MCA territory infarct,
which is not acute, but is new since CT of [**1-14**], as
mentioned in the evaluation by the stroke service in the [**Hospital 58922**]
Medical Record.

Chest X-Ray [**1-14**]
Complete white out of the left hemithorax is new associated with
mild cardiomediastinal shifting towards the left side. This is
consistent with collapse of the left lung, though consolidation
may coexist. Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in
standard position in the right atrium, right ventricle and left
ventricle. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no right
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. NG tube tip is out of view
below the diaphragm. Patient is post median sternotomy and CABG.

CT head [**1-15**]
IMPRESSION: Acute left MCA infarct without significant interval
change in mass effect or evidence of hemorrhage compared with
[**2191-1-14**].

CT head [**1-16**]
IMPRESSION: Continued evolution of acute left MCA infarct
without increasing edema or acute hemorrhage.

Carotid US [**1-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid
arteries.
2. Reversal of flow on the left vertebral artery, associated
with monophasic waveforms in the left brachial artery is
suggestive of left subclavian artery stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] presented after a syncopal episode associated with
loss of consciousness and head trauma.  His ICD was interrogated
on admission and found to have fired twice for VT while at home.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on head CT, anticoagulation
was reversed and he patient closely monitored (see below).
Electrophysiology service was consulted; ICD settings were
changed and Sotalol was started. He, however, had a new episode
of VT while admitted to MICU for which a code blue was called
but no ACLS was necessary as ICD fired multiple times. His pacer
was interrogated again and found to have fired over 10 times
before sinus rhythm was re-attained. the patient was transferred
to the CCU and Lidocaine was added to his medication regimen.
Over the next few days, heparin was started for anticoagulation
and several combinations of antiarrhythmics were utilized but
patient continue to experience repeated VT episodes terminated
by successful ICD shocks. Patient became increasingly anxious
about defibrillation and after informed consent was obtained,
underwent a VT ablation. Procedure was complicated by large
ischemic stroke (see below). He experienced one further episode
of VT after ablation which exhibited different morphology from
prior VT.  His medical regimen was again adjusted and no further
VT was noted by telemetry monitoring.  For details, p
