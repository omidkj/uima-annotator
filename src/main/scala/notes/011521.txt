Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC Filter Placement

History of Present Illness:
83F with history of epilepsy, peripheral edema, osteoporosis and
recent admission for atrial fibrillation referred to ED from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab for complaint of intermittant dyspnea, nausea x 7
days and worsening fatigue.  Additionally, she was ntoed to have
new hypoxia of 92-93% on room air.  She was sent from rehab to
rule-out PE.  Patient has some dementia at baseline, unable to
describe any further symptoms.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98 64 121/76 20 99% 2L NC.  EKG
with no ST or T-wave changes.  Initial labs BNP of 9605, WBC of
13.6, Ck 13, Troponin 0.03, Creatinine 103 (baseline 1.0), Na
123, potassium 5.5.  Chest X-ray showed widened mediatstinum and
volume overload.  CTA chest showed large filling defects in

CT Chest [**2194-5-7**] - 1. Massive PE with CT signs of right heart
strain.
2. Scattered bilateral opacities are consistent with multifocal
pneumonia.  3. No aortic dissection.  4. Large hiatal hernia.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular systolic function. Dilated,
hypokinetic right ventricle with pressure-volume overload,
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary
artery hypertension.
.
ULTRASOUND DOPPLER LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY [**2194-5-8**]:
There is echogenic thrombus identified within the left distal
superficial
femoral and left popliteal veins consistent with an above-knee
DVT. No flow or compression or augmentation demonstrated within
these vessels. The
proximal superficial femoral and common femoral vein on the left
side are
patent.

ULTRASOUND DOPPLER RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:
Normal flow, compression and augmentation demonstrated within
the deep venous system of the above-knee deep veins of the right
lower extremity.

IMPRESSION:  Above-knee DVT of the left lower extremity.
.
IVC PLACEMENT [**2194-5-8**]:

1. IVC gram demonstrating a single patent IVC.

2. Final scout image demonstrating good position with IVC filter
inferior to the renal veins.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated placement of the Eclipse IVC filter
below the level of the renal veins. No immediate complications
noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 female with past history of epilepsy, osteoporosis and recent
afib with rvr and esophagitis presented with dyspnea found to
have bilateral PE's.
.
# Submassive Pulmonary Embolism/DVT - Initially with bilateral
PE's, hemodynamically stable, on 2L oxygen by nasal canula.  Due
to high clot burden and recent GI bleed, Mrs. [**Known lastname 98674**] was
admitted to the MICU for close monitoring while initiating
systemic anticoagulation with heparin.  She was bolused with
heparin then placed on weight based scale.  PTTs were
therapeutic.  She was found to have left distal superficial
femoral and left popliteal veins consistent with an above-knee
DVT.  She underwent IVC filter placement by IR.  Echo showed
dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with pressure-volume
overload, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe
pulmonary artery hypertension.  She was Guiac negative.  She was
transfered to the floor and systemic anticoagulation was
initiated with lovenox. Her inciting event is unclear, but has
been more immobile of late since last admission.  No known
malignancy.  Her brea
