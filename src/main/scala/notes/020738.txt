none

History of Present Illness:
74 yo male admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and
NSTEMI. He has a h/o OSA on CPAP, MI x2, and a stroke 6 years
ago. He apparently is noncompliant with his meds at home, and
does not always use is CPAP. He had been more lethargic recently
and was found to be acutely confused yesterday. EMS was called
and the patient was reported to be cyanotic and combative. On
arrival to the outside hospital ED he was non-responsive. He was
given narcan and placed on mask ventillation after his VBG was
found to be 7.08/100/50. He was also found to have ruled in for
an NSTEMI by enzymes, and was started on IV heparin + ASA. A
subclavian line was paced and he was bolused with saline after
having
SBP's in to 60's to 80's. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Family reports ongoing gradual decline in respiratory status
over past months.

CXR [**2157-4-5**]
FINDINGS: AP upright portable view, which is technically
suboptimal due to the patient's inability to cooperate, and also
limited by the patient's body habitus. Lung volumes are low.
Heart size cannot be adequately assessed, and followup PA and
lateral views are recommended when feasible. The left diaphragm
cannot be seen, which is most likely secondary to the prominent
soft tissues. However, left lower lobe consolidation cannot be
excluded.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Left lower lobe consolidation cannot
be excluded. Followup PA and lateral views are recommended

EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Poor R wave progression
in leads VI-V3 of uncertain significance. Clinical correlation
is required. Is there past evidence of septal pathology? No
previous tracing available for comparison


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure -
Chronic OSA with likely obesity/hypoventilation syndrome
complicated by likely pulmonary HTN and right heart failure now
with further decompensation due to pneumonia vs MI vs PE vs
volume overload.
Antibiotics, levofloxacin/ceftriaxone, were started for empiric
treatment of pneumonia. Pt was continued on heparin for NSTEMI
and for the possibility of PE. A lasix drip was started to
promote diuresis given patients volume overloaded state.
Pt had extremely poor ventilation on admission (ABG 7.10/100/30
at 2am on [**4-5**])and had progressive worsening in his oxygenation
and ventilation in the next several hours. DNR/DNI code status
was confirmed with health care proxy and therefore patient was
continued on mask ventillation with BIPAP settings PS=15/PEEP=5
and no intubation was done.  Pt had increasing poor 02 sats. At
11:30 am a repeat ABG was 6.95/164/55.  The family arrived
shortly afterwards and a decision was made to transition his
care with comfort being the goal given his declining respiratory
status.  Pt was pronounced dead at 12:45pm.  His wife refused
autopsy.
2. Hypotension - Sepsis vs right heart failure.
- CVP = 30 on admission. This supported right heart failure vs.
massive volume overload.  Pt did receive a 500cc bolus shortly
after admission due to hypotension and had good response with
SBP> 130s
3. NSTEMI - heparin IV continued, ASA given.  Enzyme elevation
was felt to be related to demand ischemia.  An echo was ordered
but not done before patient's demise
4. ARF - Throught to be due to CHF. Urine lytes were sent for
evaluation
5. LFTs - Elevated transaminases without an elevated TB or Alk
Phos. ? secondary to poor perfusion +/- hypoxemia or also [**2-2**]
hepatic congestion.
6. Confusion - likely due to hypercarbia.  Tox screens were
negative
7. DM - RISS
8. Access - right subclavian  line placed at OSH
9. Code - DNR/DNI
