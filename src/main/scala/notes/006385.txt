Pertinent Results:
CXR [**11-27**]: Comparison with [**2123-10-31**]. There is interval increase in
bilateral pleural effusions. There is probably development of
underlying pulmonary vascular congestion, but the lungs are
somewhat obscured. The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG as before. An endotracheal tube has been inserted and
ends at the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube has been placed
and ends below the diaphragm, off of the bottom of the image. A
PICC line has been placed and terminates in the region of the
superior vena cava.
CXR [**12-1**]: New bibasilar opacities and associated atelectasis
with lung volume loss suggestive of either aspiration versus a
new infectious process such as pneumonia.
CT [**11-28**]/: 1. Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left with adjacent bibasilar compressive atelectasis. 2.
Small pericardial effusion. 3. Diffuse coronary artery
calcifications. 4. No evidence of sternal
osteomyelitis/parasternal fluid collections. 5. Cholelithiasis,
without evidence for cholecystitis.
ECHO [**11-29**]: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be
excluded. A left- to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include hypokinetic mid and apical portions of the septum,
anterior septum, inferior septum, inferior wall and anterior
wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 30929**] was admitted for sternal wound
infection. She was continued on antibiotics and wound cultures
were taken. Multiple radiologic studies were performed and she
was ultimately taken to the operating room on [**11-29**] for sternal
wound debridement and bil. chest tube placement for pleural
effusions. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following procedure she was transferred to the CSRU. VAC
dressing was placed by Plastics on this day. Infectious Disease
was consulted and antibiotics were changed to Nafcillin. Patient
was stable on post-op day one and was transferred to SDU in
stable condition. Chest tubes were removed per protocol and she
continued to receive antibiotics over the next several days. Her
creatinine rose on nafcillin, so this was discontinued and
vancomycin was started. On post op day #10 she was ready for
discharge to rehab with Vac dressing and continued IV
antibiotics for 6 weeks.She is to make her follow-up appts. with
ID and plastics as per discharge instructions. Creatinine should
be followed.
