RA, with LLL PNA on CXR.  She was also noted to have elevated
CKs to [**2131**]; case was discussed with cardiology who noted that

Brief Hospital Course:
1) TUBERCULOSIS:
Initially, pt treated for community-acquired pneumonia with
levaquin but was still febrile.  A chest CT showed b/l nodules
and tree-in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern concerning for mycobacterial infection
given ongoing remicade treatment.  She was place in isolation
and sputum AFB cultures were collected.  One was positive
verifying diagnosis of pulmonary TB.  She was started on 4 drug
regimen of INH, rifampin, ethambutol, PYZ.  However, she
developed a transaminitis so these were stopped.  After LFTs
normalized, she was started on alternative regimen of rifampin,
levaquin, ethambutol, and streptomycin.  After about one week of
this, INH was restarted ([**8-29**]).  Her LFTs were normal at
discharge and per ID consulting team, if LFTs remain normal, INH
can be continued, streptomycin can be stopped later this week.
Pt is still having fevers at disharge of around 101 but ID feels
likely due to resolving Tb.  No other signs of infection to
account for fever.
.
2) RESP FAILURE-
After being transferred to MICU pt went into hypoxic resp
failure, possibly from CHF or Tb.  She was intubated, diuresed.
She then wished to be extubated and made DNI.  This was done and
she did well post extubation.  Her resp status is good and does
not require suppl oxygen.
.
3) NSTEMI:
Pt had a NSTEMI in setting of respiratory failure and
tachycardia.  She was started on heparin gtt, nitro gtt, ASA,
beta blocker.  Her enzymes trended down.  She did not have any
further CP.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended cardiac
cath as outpt once acute issues resolved.  Cont ASA (Hct stable
despite G6PD), beta blocker.  STatin held due to hepatotoxicity
of Tb meds.
.
4) AVNRT:
Episodes of tachycardia felt to be AVNRT by cards.  Started on 3
nodal agents: dig, verapamil, and lopressor, and was rate
controlled on that.
.
5) Pancytopenia:
Has been up and down throughout hospitalization.  Pt has h/o
sideroblastic anemia and G6PD.  Bone marrow biopsy was done
which was unrevealing.  Felt to be due to systemic illness and
potential marrow suppression from meds.  However, stable counts
at discharge.  On epo and iron for anemia.
*
8) Rheumatoid arthritis (right hip):
Per Hip films, likely some avascular necrosis, but all appear
chronic. MRI showed progression of arthritis and fluid
collection which was tapped for infection but negative includ
AFB. Pt was seen by rheumatology, thought the rapid progression
may be secondary to TB.
- Cont oxycodone for pain control especially as holding
methotrexate
-Outpt rheum f/u.
*
9) h/o PE:  Pt had been off coumadin on admission though she
should have been on it.  Her CTA here did not show PE so it was
not restarted.  In addition, pt had intermittently high PTT
which was thought to be due to SC heparin so this was stopped as
well.
.
10) Incontinence:  C/w urge incontinence, started on ditropan.
.
11) CODE STATUS:  Initially full code, but after discussion with
pt in ICU and afterwards, she is DNR/DNI.
