ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13029**] was a 75-year-
old gentleman with multiple comorbidities who was admitted to
a referring institution with severe pneumonia and possible
COPD flare at the beginning of [**2165-12-16**]. He was managed
there with antibiotics and required some degree of steroid
therapy for his severe respiratory disease. During the
treatment of his pneumonia, he developed what was initially
was thought to be a colonic obstruction. This was evaluated
at the referring hospital by the surgical and
gastroenterology services and was found to be a colonic
pseudo-obstruction thought to be related to his pneumonia.
The patient failed to make significant progress in terms of
his colonic pseudo-obstruction. The family request transfer
to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further care.

He was initially transferred to the medical service for
management of his pneumonia and colonic pseudo-obstruction.
Gastroenterology and surgical services were consulted. Both
services concurred with nonoperative management of his
process and treating the underlying illness with correction
of any electrolyte abnormalities and minimization of any
narcotics, anticholinergic agents, which may exacerbate the
pseudo-obstruction. The patient was transferred on [**2165-12-31**].

His symptoms actually resolved on the day of transfer with
resumption of bowel function and passage of gas. This was
visible on his plain radiograph imaging. He did not require
any intervention for this. He was passing gas and having
loose stools first several days, but then began to develop
some increasing abdominal distention on [**2166-1-3**].
This was thought to be possible recurrence of his pseudo-
obstruction and again managed conservatively.

Over the course of the ensuing days, the patient was found to
have free intraperitoneal air on an abdominal x-ray from
[**1-7**] and [**1-8**]. As the patient did not initially
manifest systemic signs of sepsis, given as co-morbidities,
he was managed non operatively with antibiotics. His disease
progressed and he became progressively more ill and was taken
emergently to the operating room on [**1-9**]. Extensive
discussions were undertaken with the family and the patient
highlighting the high risk of the surgery. Given his
extensive co-morbidities and the high risk about morbidity
and mortality, they  understood and wished to pursue all
treatment. On [**1-9**]  he underwent an extended right
colectomy with an end-ileostomy. Please see the operative
note for further details.

His postoperative course was initially marked by prolonged
ventilator dependence and acute-on-chronic renal
insufficiency. His malnutrition and his  immunosuppression
from steroids hampered his initial recovery. He did develop
some degree of pneumonia and pleural effusions and given the
high likelihood that he would require mechanical ventilation
for some period of time, tracheostomy was placed on [**1-14**].

He continued to require full ventilatory nutritional support,
as well as antibiotic therapy for his pneumonia. Nutritional
support was provided with combination of initially TPN and
subsequently enteral feedings. On [**1-20**], he began to have
increasing drainage from his abdominal incision. This was
opened at the bedside and evidenced a fascial dehiscence. He
was taken to emergently back to the operating room for
fascial closure. Notably, at this time, there was no evidence
of healing taking place since the time of operation 10 days
prior,  highlighting his severe degree of immunosuppression
and malnutrition.

He was subsequently maintained in the ICU with the narcotics
for pain control and sedation. Full ventilatory support was
required. He failed multiple attempts at weaning despite
aggressive pulmonary toilet and attempts at diuresis. His
hemodynamics were relatively stable with occasional episodes
of atrial fibrillation; but otherwise no significant
hemodynamic instability. His  ileostomy continued to function
and never evidenced any ischemia. His renal function
continued to deteriorate somewhat with acute-on-chronic renal
failure developing. Most concerning was the development of
fungal infections in the sputum and urine.

Over the course of the ensuing week, the patient failed to
progress despite maximal medical therapy and nutritional
support. Discussions were had with the family to decide goals
of care with the patient. After several meetings, the family
made the decision to make the patient comfort measures only,
as he was in multisystem organ failure with progressively
worsening infections and with a very low likelihood of any
meaningful recovery. The patient was made CMO on [**2166-1-29**]. He was maintained on ventilatory support per the
family's request. His sedative medications and pain
medications were continued over the course of the ensuing
days. The patient progressively went into worsening renal
failure and this was followed by cardiac arrest on [**2166-2-1**]. The family was at the bedside.
