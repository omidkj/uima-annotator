LENIs

[**9-26**]: The paired peroneal veins within the left calf were not
well assessed due to overlying edema.  Deep venous thrombosis
therefore in these veins cannot be excluded.  No evidence of
deep venous thrombosis demonstrated elsewhere within the left
lower extremity.
[**9-29**]: No DVT in the left lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M history of DM, HTN, dCHF presented with severe HA, fever and
encephalopathy who was initially admitted to the MICU for
encephalopathy in setting of sepsis from cellulitis.  Also
question of left popliteal DVT.

# Fever/sepsis: Initial concern for possible
meningitis/encephalitis given presence of sepsis along with
altered mental status and headache. He was started on broad
coverage with Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Unasyn, and Acyclovir as LP was
difficult in the ED. Patient's lactate, temperature,
hemodynamics and mental status were all noted to improve
overnight. LP by anesthesia on hospital day two did not show
evidence of infection and acyclovir was discontinued. Patient
was noted to have left lower extremity cellulitis which was the
most likely source of his sepsis.

#Cellulitis: As described above, his fever/sepsis was likely
attributed to his lower left leg cellulitis. There was no
clinical evidence of necrotizing fascitis. After transfer to the
medical floor, he was continued only on Vancomycin and Unasyn
until [**2123-9-30**], when he was switched to po Bactrim/Keflex.
However, his cellulitis did not continue to improve on this
regimen.  Thus, the morning of discharge a PICC line was placed
and he will continue on IV Vancomycin at a [**Hospital1 1501**] for a total
course of 14 more days, ending on [**10-15**].  His leg should continue
to be elevated to promote venous return.

# Bacteremia: He was found to have G+ cocci in clusters (Staph)
on one blood culture.  This bacteremia [**2-25**] contaminant vs
cellulitis.  His continued coverage with Vancomycin is
sufficient to treat this.

# Shortness of breath/hypoxemia
He presented with shortness of breath/hypoxia requiri
