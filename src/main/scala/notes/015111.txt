Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressively worsening shortness of breath for 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial drain placement

History of Present Illness:
This 35-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic
colon cancer to lung and liver developed progressively worsening
shortness of breath for 3 days.  Due to the advanced stage of
malignanacy, she was discharged to hospice and recieved
palliative chemo and radiation recently for pain and spinal cord
compression.  However, she has had difficulty accepting her
teminal disease and since then has been on and off hospice.

During the past 3 days, she experienced shortness of breath with
progression. No fever, cough, chest pain or extremity swelling
is noted. And the day of admission, she woke up and felt like
she couldn't breathe so her family called the EMS.
On her way to the ED, her oxygen saturation was 82% under room
air and increased to 93% with non-rebreathing bag. At the ED,
she was in respiratory distress and could not speak in full
sentances. The vital signs were 97.6 120 160/105 22 93% with
NRB. Physical exam showed rales over her lung bileterally.The
chest x-ray revealed a large pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
A bedside echo demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with
matressing of the right ventricle and her pulsus was 20.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended pericardial drainage in
the cath lab.  IP was consulted as well and recommended
drainage.  She was given 750cc of normal saline to increase her
pre-load.  Given her immunocompromised status, she recieved
vancomycin and levofloxacin for potential pneumonia. Her labs on
transfer to the cath lab were: 114 155/108 35 99% NRB.  Per the
ED she was full code.


Past Medical History:
1. PPD positive -
had some treatment with INH, unclear if full course.
2. Metastatic colon cancer:
underwent left colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis on
[**2173-9-1**] followed by 2 months of FOLFOX and capecitabine.
Found to have metastatic disease in 09/[**2173**].  FOLFOX was started
on [**2174-9-7**]. Has since been on various chemo regimen including
Bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil,cetuximab Irinotecan .
.
 palliative radiation therapy to paravertebral soft tissue from
[**Date range (3) 13812**], with 3000 cGy of radiation.
.
started on mitomycin/capecitabine on [**2176-12-31**]. She progressed on
this therapyand required admission in [**2-21**] for a pain crisis.
During this hospitalization she was found to have left lower
extremity weakness and paresthesias and imaging demonstrated
progression with cord compression. She had been previously
radiated extensively to the area. She was started on steroids
with some improvement of the neurologic findings and received a
short course of Cyberknife. She also had radiation to the L-S
spine.
She was discharged with home hospice to begin after the
radiation
therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 35 year old female with end stage colon cancer with
diffuse mets who presented from home on [**5-1**] with gradually
worsening SOB and was found to have a large paricardial effusion
and white out of left lung. She underwent pericardial drainage
of exudative fluid and was subsequently admitted to the cardiac
intensive care unit. On admission she was found to be
significantly tachycardic and dyspnic with hypoxia.  Pulmonary
team was consulted and performed bed-side ultrasound which
demonstrated a small amount of pleural fluid which was felt to
insufficient to explain her degree of dyspnea. Her dyspnea and
hypoxia were rather felt to be attributable to extended
malignant involvement of her lung possibly worsened by
post-obstructive lung infection. It was thus reasoned that
pleural fluid drainage will have no theraputic or palliative
benefit.
.
After discussion with the patient, her family and the
out-patient oncologist decision was made to focus on comfort
measures only and code status was changed to DNR/DNI. Palliative
care services were consulted and patient was treated overnight
with Lorazepam and opioid drips for maximal comfort.
.
On [**5-2**] in the AM the house officer was called to the patient??????s
room, her mother and the mother??????s 2 sisters were at the bedside.
She was found to be without spontaneous breathing or pulse with
fixed dilated pupils. Death was pronounced at 09:00 AM.  Cause
of death was hypoxic respiratory failure which complicated her
end stage metastatic colon disease.
