ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure, for Milrinone taper.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
African American man who is admitted from the catheterization
laboratory after an attempted wean of his intravenous
Milrinone.  The patient is maintained on a continuous
infusion of Milrinone for systolic heart failure secondary to
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  In the spring of [**2148**] the
patient deteriorated and became hypotensive with shortness of
breath and fatigue.  These occurred with minimal exertion.
The patient improved on intravenous Milrinone, but was unable
to be weaned.  He was evaluated for trans pump, but was felt
to be not a candidate as he would likely require left
ventricular assist device and the patient will not accept
blood products as he is a Jehovah's witness.  The patient has
been maintained on intravenous home Milrinone since [**2148-1-16**].  Subsequently the patient underwent revision of his DDD
pacemaker to a synchronized pacing.  The patient reports that
this improved his symptoms dramatically.  Previously he could
only walk a few steps, after that he was able to walk
approximately one mile on the treadmill every other day
without fatigue.  The patient is able to perform activities
of daily living as well as a climb a flight of stairs without
symptoms.  He also notes he has lowered the head of his bed
to two pillows without symptoms.  Previously he had been
sleeping on three to four pillows or upright.  Currently the
patient denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower
extremity edema, chest pain.  He has no fevers or chills,
dizziness, upper respiratory infections symptoms or diarrhea.
 He has no urinary symptoms.  He denies blood in his stool.
He denies nausea or vomiting.  He does note an occasional
sensation of fluttering in his chest when he lays on his
back.  He states this is long standing.  The patient was
admitted for elective cardiac catheterization and for
attempted milrinone wean given his risk of sudden death and
infection.  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed in
the catheterization laboratory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy (please see history of present
illness for details).
2.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Hypertension.

in [**2148-1-16**].
5.  Chronic gastritis with a history of H pylori, which has

7.  Chronic renal failure.
8.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
9.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.
10.  History of left bundle branch block.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Captopril 12.5 mg po t.i.d.,
Aldactone 12.5 mg po q.d., Amiodarone 200 mg po q day, Coreg
12.5 mg po b.i.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po
q day, Protonix 40 mg po q day, Carafate 1 gram po t.i.d.,
Coumadin 4 mg po q day, which had been held prior to the
procedure.  Milrinone 0.33 micrograms per kilogram per minute
continuous infusion.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Jehovah's witness.  He is
married.  He is retired.  He has six children.  He denies the
use of alcohol or recreational drugs.  The patient quit
smoking 34 years ago.  He previously worked in construction.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of stroke, myocardial infarction,
diabetes, hypertension.  He has three brothers with cancer of
the lungs, stomach and throat respectively.  He notes they
are all smokers.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.3.  Heart
rate 75.  Blood pressure 116/64.  Respiratory rate 26.
Sating 99% on room air.  His pulmonary pressure is 34/13.
His cardiac index is 1.85.  The patient is in no acute
distress.  The mucous membranes are moist.  The JVD is at the
angle of the jaw while the patient is lying flat on his back.
There is a regular rate and rhythm.  There is an S3.  There
is also a heave along the left chest wall.  The patient's
Hickman catheter is without erythema or exudate.  The lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Bowel sounds are
present.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities there is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses
are palpable bilaterally.  He has a line in his right groin.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3.2, hematocrit 33.0,
platelets 180, INR 1.3, PT 14.2, PTT 29.9, sodium 139,
potassium 3.6, chloride 103, bicarb 28, BUN 21, creatinine
1.4 with a baseline of 1.4 to 1.7, glucose 110, calcium 8.5,
phosphate 3.5, magnesium 1.6, ALT 23, AST 27, alkaline
phosphatase 51, total bilirubin 0.5.  His Digoxin level is
1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient initially
had cardiac catheterization performed. This revealed a normal
filling pressures with marked improvement of the pulmonary
artery pressure compared with the prior catheterization.
However, the patient did have baseline depression of his
cardiac index on his Milrinone infusion.  The Milrinone was
decreased to half strength and there was no significant drop
in his cardiac index.  The patient was therefore transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.
 The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed while in the
catheterization laboratory.  His Milrinone was continued to
be tapered while the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit.
His hemodynamics were monitored q two hours.  The patient's
Milranone was successfully weaned off during the patient's
first day in the Coronary Care Unit, however, the patient was
noted to have a low cardiac index with falling blood
pressures once the Milrinone was taken off.  Therefore the
decision was made to restart his Milrinone at his previous
dose of 0.33 micrograms per kilogram per minute.  The patient
had his Swan-Ganz catheter removed under fluoroscopy.

2.  Rhythm:  The patient has a biventricular pacemaker.  He
had no issues during his stay in the hospital.  His Swan-Ganz
was removed under fluoroscopic guidance as he has a
pacemaker.

3.  Hematology:  The patient was started on heparin drip
after his procedure. His Coumadin was restarted while he was
in house.  He will continue to take his Coumadin once he is
discharged to home.

4.  History of gastritis:  The patient was continued on
Protonix.

5.  Renal:  The patient's chronic renal failure was at
baseline with a creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 while the
patient was admitted.

6.  Hypotension:  The patient was noted to be hypotensive
during this admission with systolic blood pressures ranging
from the low 80s to 90s.  The patient was asymptomatic with
these blood pressures.  He was encouraged to increase his po
intake.  He was encouraged to consume eight glasses of liquid
per day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Chronic gastritis.
5.  Chronic renal failure.
6.  History of left bundle branch block.
7.  History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
8.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  the same as admission medications.
It should be noted that the patient is continuing on his
continuous infusion of Milrinone at 0.33 micrograms per
kilogram per minute.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3510**] to have his INR
checked in three days.  He will also follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the heart failure clinic in three to four weeks.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.
