CXR [**3-11**]:
Pulmonary edema, small right pleural effusion, stable
cardiomegaly.

Repeat CXR [**3-15**]:

Substantial improvement in pulmonary edema with residual small
effusions.  Right lower lobe opacity most likely reflect
residual edema, and/or atelectasis. Infection is not totally
excluded


Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M with hx of ESRD, HTN, HL, CAD, Afib, GI bleeds, and
substance abuse who presents with fevers, chills and SOB, due to
healthcare associated PNA.

# Fevers / Pneumonia: On arrival to the ICU he was treated with
vancomycin, cefepime and azithomycin as above.  Nasal swab was
negative for influenza. Azithromycin continued for 5 day course,
vancomycin and cefepime total 8 day course.  Pt was afebrile for
>48 hrs prior to discharge.  After discharge, he should receive
two more doses of vancomycin (to be dosed with [**Month/Day (2) 2286**]) and
cefepime 500 mg IV q24H on Thursday [**3-16**] and Saturday [**3-18**].
.
# Hypoxemia: Likely secondary to PNA and fluid overload. Patient
was taken urgently to hemodialysis where 4.5L of fluid were
removed.  He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime and
azithomycin for suspected pneumonia.  His oxygen requirement
decreased to 2L NC after [**Month/Day (1) 2286**].  Continued to be hypoxic
after transfer to floor, and had rales on exam.  After two more
[**Month/Day (1) 2286**] sessions, patient was taken off oxygen and O2 sats were
mid 90s on room air.
.
# ESRD: HD was performed urgently on admission and 4.5L of fluid
was removed.  Given the dramatic improvement in his respiratory
status, repeat session was delayed.  Received 2 more sessions of
HD while inpatient.
.
# Atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia: Patient was continued
on home doses of amiodarone and diltiazem.  He had two episodes
of afib with RVR with rates in the 170s and was given diltiazem
10mg IV with excellent rate control.  Metoprolol was avoided in
the setting of his cocaine use.  He remained in sinus with rates
of ~100.  He was not anticoagulated given h/o GI bleed.
Initially, was on diltiazem 120 mg QID for frequent episodes in
ICU, however was decreased to home dose of 360 mg ER daily prior
to discharge.  Multiple episodes of 2:1 AV block were noted in
pt overnight, however this had been noted in the past so
diltiazem was continued.  He has a follow up appointment
scheduled with his cardiologist.
.
# Hyperkalemia: K was elevated at 5.4 on admission with no EKG
changes. He was given kayexalate with improvement of his K.  Was
no longer hyperkalemic.
.
# HTN: Patient was kept on diltiazem.  Lisinopril initlaly held
for increased Cr, but restarted after [**Month/Day (1) 2286**] at lower dose of
10 mg daily.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on his home statin.
.
# DM: continued on home insulin sliding scale
