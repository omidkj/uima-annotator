Successful PCI of mid LAD with a two overlapping Hepacoat stents

3.0x23mm proximal and 3.0x33mm distal. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA
comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
2. One vessel coronary artery disease of the mid-LAD.
3. Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction with elevated
right and
left sided filling pressures.
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertention (59/34 mmHg). Tricuspid
regurgitation.
5. Depressed cardiac output & index (4.2 L/min, 2.1 L/min/m2).
6. Successful PCI of proximal and mid LAD.

Echo [**8-9**]:
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 35952**] dilated. LV mod dilated. LV syst function is severely
depressed (EF 30%). Anterior, septal and apical akinesis and
lateral and inferior hypokinesis with preservation of basal wall
motion.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU after her catheterization.

1. CAD - 1 vessel s/p LAD hepacoat stent. CK peaked at 264. The
patient was started on integrilin for 18 hours and then was
started on heparin drip for anterior MI. The patient was started
on ASA, plavix, lipitor. Beta-blocker was added after the
patient's heart failure was better compensated. The patient had
no events on telemetry. She has remained in NSR. Course c/b hct
drop with guaiac+ stool while supratherapeutic on heparin (PTT
150); also, had prerenal azotemia during this episode. Coumadin
and heparin were d/c'd, to be held until patient is seen by a
Cardiologist as an outpatient and GI bleed has resolved with
stable Hct.

2. PUMP - EF 30% with apikal akinesis/wall motion abnormalities.
Patient had elevated R and L pressures likely due to ischemia.
She was diuresed with
