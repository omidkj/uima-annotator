Brief Hospital Course:
General Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment. On [**2136-2-24**], the patient underwent
sigmoid colon resection and end colostomy, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief stay in the PACU, the patient was
transferred in SICU for observation s/t tachycardia and low
urine output. In SICU patient's heart rate became regular
without intervention, he received 2.5 L bolus and his urine
function improved. Patient was transferred on the floor NPO, on
IV fluids and antibiotics, with a Foley catheter, and  Dilaudid
PCA for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with IV Dilaudid PRN
with good effect and adequate pain control. Neurologically
patient was stable. Alert and oriented x 3, follows all
commands, and moved all extremities. When tolerating oral
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient had an episodes of tachycardia postoperatively
with heart rate up to 120s. After receiving proper hydration
with IV fluid, patient's HR stabilized within normal limits. The
patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital
signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was extubated in OR. The patient remained
stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored. On [**2136-2-26**] patient lung sounds were found diminished
on right base, chest x-ray was obtained and showed new right
multifocal pneumonia. Patient was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV
Q24H. Patient continue with active pulmonary toilet, he started
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. On [**2-27**] repeat chest x-ray
demonstrated improving multifocal pneumonia. Patient was
continue on Ceftriaxone during hospitalization, and he will
continue on Ciprofloxacin 10 days after discharge.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids, and NGT to low suction. NGT was discontinued on [**2-27**].
TPN was started on [**2-29**], and patient continue on TPN until [**3-7**].
Diet was slowly advanced to sips on [**2-28**], and clears on [**3-4**],
which was well tolerated. Patient was advanced to regular diet
on [**3-6**] and tolerates diet well. Foley catheter was removed on
[**2-27**], patient voided without difficulties. Patient's intake and
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when
necessary. Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted
when necessary.

ID: Patient's WBC on admission was 15.8, he was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage. On [**2136-2-27**] Zosyn was
discontinued, patient was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gm qday,
Flagyl 500 mg tid, and continue on Vancomycin per Infectious
Disease recommendation. Patient remained afebrile during
hospitalization with elevated WBC. Patient's urine, blood x 2
and wound cultures were sent and remain negative. Patient will
continue on Flagyl and Ciprofloxacin x 10 days after discharge,
and he will follow up with PCP for routine CBC test.

Wound: Patient's midline incision was closed with staples
postoperatively and dry dressing was applied. Dressing was
removed on POD # 2, and wound was kept open to air. On [**3-2**]
patient was found to have significant erythema around incision
line, no exudate was notified. Staples were removed from the
central portion of the incision, wound cultures were sent to
microbiology, and wet-to dry dressing was applied. Dressing was
changed twice a day, cultures came back negative. Patient's
wound remains clear, no exudate or debrises, distal/proximal
staples remain intact. To improve wound healing and closure, [**Month/Day (2) 2993**]
dressing was s
