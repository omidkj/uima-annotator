UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT

Reason: eval for DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with Hcv cirrhosis and ESRD with asymetric LE
edema and SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for DVT
INDICATION: Right lower extremity edema.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Normal compressibility, color
flow, and Doppler waveforms are seen in the deep venous system
from the common femoral vein to the popliteal.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-8-12**] 8:59 AM
Reason: eval for chf

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man with SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for chf
INDICATIONS: 58-year-old man with shortness of breath. Question
congestive heart failure.

CHEST, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to [**2137-4-16**]. A
right internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the right
atrium, as before. There are perihilar alveolar opacities and
[**Year (4 digits) 1106**] engorgement with upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
vessels, consistent with moderate fluid overload or congestive
heart failure. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe is most
compatible with atelectasis. There are no definite effusions or
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema which may be due to
congestive heart failure or fluid overload.

PARACENTESIS DIAG. OR THERAPEU; GUIDANCE FOR [**Female First Name (un) **]/ABD/PARA CE

Reason: therapeutic paracentesis x 6L. no albumin necessary
afterwar

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with Hcv cirrhosis and ESRD and cirrhosis,
ascites. loculated, scarred peritoneum with 2 xplanted kidneys
in situ. h/o of US guided [**Doctor First Name 4397**] in the past. difficult bedside
tap.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
therapeutic paracentesis x 6L. no albumin necessary afterwards
INDICATION: Cirrhosis, ascites.

ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PARACENTESIS: Written and informed consent
were obtained. A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm
patient, site, and procedure. Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1022**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 4401**] performed
this procedure, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4401**], the attending radiologist,
present and supervising throughout.

A suitable pocket of fluid was located in the left lower
quadrant. The area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion. Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine were administered
for subcutaneous lidocaine. A 19 gauge [**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was
advanced into the abdomen, and 4 liters of fluid drained. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate
complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58M with ESRD on HD, PVD, HCV c/b cirrhosis and ascites,
seizure d/o presents with hypertensive urgency and acute onset
SOB likely from flash pulmonary edema.
.
# SOB: Flash pulm edema [**3-15**] hypertensive urgency in setting of
recent incomplete HD.  Admitted to MICU after urgent dialysis
with 3.6L removed with continuing o2 requirement, and started
home anti-hypertensives and transiently on labetalol/nitro gtts
overnight.  Had some BIPAP o/n as well and was quickly weaned to
NC.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 flat and RLE ultrasound negative for
DVT.  Weaned to RA and transferred to floor with stable blood
pressures. On floor pt's BP were stable and good.  Recieved HD
on Wed morning, slightly high BP afterwards, but this quickly
resolved with restart of home meds.  Pt. sent home on new,
higher nifedipine dose.  Cont' HD TIW.

- Otherwise, volume management at HD per renal
.
# ESRD: MWF HD schedule. HD removed 7.5kg prior to call out to
floor. Renal following. Continue nephrocaps, sevelamer,
sensipar.
.
# Anemia: Chronic due to renal disease. Hct decreased on
admission without known active bleeding. Recheck showed no
further decrease in levels.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Noted to have ECG changes and given insulin,
D50, calcium; ECG changes resolved s/p HD and K+ normal.
Continued monitoring of electrolytes showed no further
alterations in levels.
.
# CHF: EF 45%. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Volume
overloaded, manage with HD per renal. Continued BB, ACEi.
.
# HTN: Restarted home anti-hypertensives (changed toprol XL to
metoprol
