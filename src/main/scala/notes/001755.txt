Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 84 yo male with h/o HTN, CAD s/p stents LAD,
diagonal and OM1, ESRD on HD, and ICD for recurrent polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia, history of probable amiodarone-induced
lung toxicity admitted with firing of his ICD. Symptoms started
at HD where he had nausea and several episodes of vomiting. He
then felt that he was going to be shocked and was shocked 10+
times. He reports that this has happened before when his
electrolytes were off. He was sent to the ED where he was given
calcium gluconate 2 g x1, magnesium 2g x1 and was seen by the EP
service whow started amiodarone drip as well as lidocaine 50 mg
IV x1. Per ED resident, he had 2 further shocks while in the ED,
therefore he was transfer to the CCU. He remained HD stable and
AA0x3.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis (he did have a superficial spahenous
clot), pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative. He does report 3 [**Last Name (un) 940**] BMs the morning of
admission as well as nausea and vomitting. No abdominal pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo male with h/o CAD, CHF, ESRD on HD and polymorphic VT
presenting after being shocked by ICD likley in the setting of
fluid and elctrolyte shifts.
.
# ICD firing: Polymorphic VT s/p ICD firing. Per primary
nephrologist, patient has been challenging to control in regard
to electrolyte balance. Although he had been titrated to higher
potassium range in order to prevent further episodes. It appears
that viral gastroenteritis and diarrhea further decreased
potassium, down to 3.5 at dialysis per report. Patient was
repleted and controlled with IV amiodarone, which was
discontinued shortly after admisison. Patient has remained
stable and will not require any medication changes.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Hitory of stent to LAD, diagonal and
OM. Last cath on [**2140-5-18**] revealed patent stents. Medical regimen
of aspirin, statin and beta blocker were maintained this
admission.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 20-25%. Currently appears
euvolemic after dialysis. Fluid status to be controlled at
dialysis per routine, with special attention to potassium level.

.
# Gastroenteritis: Vomiting and diarrhea. Likely
gastroenteritis, with transient lyphocytosis which is now
resolved. Patient has not had any more emesis and bowel
movements have become less freqent. No risk factor for C. Diff
infection were found. Patient instructed to report to PCP if
symptoms do not improve in the next 48 hours.
.
# ESRD on dialysis: Followed as oupatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**]. Patient
will continue on current Dialysis schedule Tues/thurs/sat.
.
# Factor V leiden heterozygote: therapeutic on coumadin
.
# hypothyroidism: we continued levothyroxine
.
# h/o trapped lung: O2 sats stable, no intervention during
admission.
.
# HTN: well controlled on current regimen, no changes were made.

.
# FEN: renal, cardiac diet
.
# Prophylaxis: Therapeutic on coumadin
.
# Code: Patient remained DNR/DNI during hospitalization,
confrimed with patient and daughter
.
# Communication: Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27887**]
