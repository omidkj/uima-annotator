HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:

oxygen overnight.  The patient maintained her O2 saturation.
The patient is given Solu-Medrol IV and then switched to po
prednisone with albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.  Accolade
was added.  In-house we avoided an elevated pAO2 given the
respiratory history.

2. Congestive heart failure:  The patient was maintained on
her Lasix.

3. The patient had complicated course in the MICU, and was
called out .................. 2 liters.  Per report in the
evening, she had some dyspnea for which respiratory care was

PEA, V-fib event on the morning of [**4-26**].  Per report at 4:30
am, the nurses were called to beside to help with commode.
The nurse noted some shortness of breath and tachypnea, and
nurse was called.

Upon arrival of the code team, the patient was PEA and CPR
was initiated.  The patient was intubated and after 20
minutes, the patient obtained a pulse with a systolic blood
pressure of 100/40.  The patient then went into V-fib and
rapid atrial fibrillation.  Patient was returned to the MICU.

On [**4-27**], the patient developed jerks associated with
myoclonic status.  Neurology was consulted.
Electroencephalogram was performed, and the assessment and
plan was determination of postanoxic myoclonic status,
prolonged cardiac arrest followed by myoclonic status with
burst suppression, electroencephalogram nonresponsive
indicating hypoxic ischemic cerebral injury with very poor
prognosis.

DNR/DNI and on [**4-27**] the family communicated to the house
