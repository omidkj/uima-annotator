EKG [**2102-12-10**]: A.fib at 136 bpm, RBBB, deep TWI in precordial
leads (morphology unchanged to prior). A.fib new.

EKG [**8-25**]: Sinus tachy at 114, RBBB, right axis, normal
intervals
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-10**]
1.  Inflammatory stranding in the pelvis which could be related
to enteritis or sigmoid diverticulitis.  Diffusely dilated
stomach, small bowel, and large bowel with multiple air- fluid
levels including markedly dilated proximal small bowel.  This
appearance could be secondary to ileus however a component of
mechanical small bowel obstruction (more likely related to the
pelvic inflammatory process rather than the ventral hernia)
cannot be excluded. Close
clinical follow up is recommended.
2.  Cholelithiasis.
3.  Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
.
Portable CXR [**12-10**]
The mildly enlarged heart is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable.  No acute pulmonary infiltrate is
noted.  There are increased vascular markings of both lungs with
upper zone redistribution.  Mild bilateral pleural effusion is
detected.  There are severe degenerative changes on compression
fracture of thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature
suggesting early heart failure.
2.  No pulmonary infiltrate is identified to suggest pneumonia.
Mild
bilateral pleural effusion is noted.
.
Echo [**2102-9-8**]
EF >60%. The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo man with h/o seizure disorder, panhypopituitarism,
hypothyroidism presented with nausea, vomiting and dehydration
likely secondary to ileus, and complicated by new onset atrial
fibrillation with RVR, as well as UTI.  His Afib was treated
with a diltiazem drip.  It was thought to due to his infection
and dehydration.  He also required repeated fluid boluses to
maintain blood pressure and was started on aspirin.  He ruled
out for acute cardiac ischemia.  After passing his video swallow
he was briefly on metoprolol po; however, he was again
tachycardic that night with HR 130s and hypotensive.  The
diltiazem gtt was restarted.  It was not felt he would benefit
from cardioversion because he might not tolerate the TEE in his
tenuous state and would likely go back into atrial fibrillation.
 Hospital course was also copmlicated by acute renal failure and
hyponatremia, thought to be due to dehydration causing prerenal
azotemia and hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Nausea and vomiting was
due to ilius given his large ventral hernia.  This improved, and
he tolerated a po diet for a day.  Stool studies were sent and
were nondiagnostic.  He was continued on levothyroxine and
glucocorticoid as treatment of his panhypopituitarism.  Despite
these measures, he continued to decline with rapid heart rate,
hypotension, and hypoxemia.  His code status was DNR/DNI.  We
were unable to support him, and on [**2102-12-14**] he expired.  His
niece and next of [**Doctor First Name **] was notified.
