CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bacterial meningitis.
Acute MI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old man
transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of
bacterial meningitis (presumably Strep Pneumo), Strep Pneumo
bacteremia, status post acute MI who was having a cocaine
use, and FTT suggested of multilobar pneumonia.  According to
the discharge summary of the outside hospital, the patient
had been there on [**2114-9-19**] complaining of an earache,
headache and mental status changes including garbled speech,
inability to walk, and fever of 102.8, initial attempts with
p.o. unsuccessful.  The patient was empirically started on
ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  The patient was sent to CT
secondary to agitation requiring sedation, paralysis, and
intubation.  Head CT was remarkable for left frontal
encephalomalacia and bilateral frontal temporal edema.  Two
out of two blood cultures from admission to the outside
Hospital grew out Strep pneumoniae.  LP was successfully
performed on and it was most positive for bacterial
meningitis.  The patient was started on Decadron and was
transferred on Acyclovir prior to the result of the positive
blood culture, at the outside hospital patient also for a
chest CT which revealed the right lower lobe consolidation,
partial left lower lobe and right upper lobe consolidations
and small bilateral pleural effusion.

On admission to the outside hospital, the patient was in SVT
and heart rate in the 180s with initial CK and troponin were
positive.  Peak CK was greater than 9000, troponin greater
than 50, serum tox screen was positive for cocaine.  He had
no obvious ST elevation on his initial EKG.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-22**] and noted to have
oxygen desaturation requiring an increase in his FiO2.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Ceftriaxone 2 gm q.12 h.
2. Vancomycin 1 gm q.12 h.
3. Decadron 15 mg IV q.8 h.
4. Pepcid 20 mg q.d.
5. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
6. Heparin subcu 70/500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Nitro drip.
8. Ativan drip.
9. Morphine drip.
10.      Tube feeds.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 101.2, heart
rate 103, blood pressure 116/54, respirations 14, saturation
96% intubated.  Certainly, the patient is obese, young man,
intubated, sedated, and nonresponsive.  HEENT, normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils 1- to 2-mm bilaterally sluggish but
reactive.  No corneal reflex.  Heart regular rate.  Normal S1
and S2.  No murmurs.  Lungs, decreased breath sounds at bases
bilaterally, otherwise clear territorially.  Abdomen was
benign.  The patient had good distal pulses.  Decreased DTRs
throughout with equivocal Babinski's bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission, the patient had an
elevated white count at 17.4.

Brief summary, past medical history the patient was admitted
to the  Fenard ICU for 1 week followed by transfer to the
floor for the following week.  While in the intensive care
unit, the patient continued to have respiratory failure
secondary to pneumonia, he was successfully extubated on
[**2114-10-28**], and was transferred to the floor on the
following day.  When he was in the ICU, the patient was
continued on ceftriaxone.  The vancomycin was discontinued.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was afebrile and
tachycardic to 102.  Other vitals were stable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Infectious disease.  On arrival to the
floor the patient was clinically improving from Strep Pneumo
infection.  His mental status was clear and pneumonia was
resolving.  Head CT showed old changes but no abscesses.
Chest x-ray showed only a retrocardiac density which is
likely atelectasis.  The patient was continued on Ceftriaxone
for total  of 14-day course.  He used an incentive spirometer
and continued to improve throughout the remaining weeks of
his hospital admission.  Of note, HIV testing was done and
was negative. During his hospitalization, the patient was
incontinent of stool and urine.  However, stool and urine
cultures were positive and the patient was also negative for
C-diff.  His symptoms improved at the time of discharge.

History of myocardial Infarction:  The patient had an acute
myocardial infarction secondary to cocaine use.  He remained
hemodynamically stable with down trending CKs.  He was
started on aspirin and labetalol.  An echocardiogram done at
the outside hospital showed a low ejection fraction of 40
percent with some hypokinesis.  The patient is to have
outpatient cardiology followup with a repeat echocardiogram
in the near future.

Psychiatry:  The patient has a strong history of alcohol and
cocaine abuse.  Social work consult was done in-house to help
patient with these issues.

Left shoulder weakness.  This has been a new complaint.  The
patient will have an outpatient MRI to further evaluate this.

History of anemia:  Iron studies were negative for iron
deficiency anemia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumococcal meningitis.
Myocardial infarction.
Cocaine abuse.
Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Labetalol 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with his
primary care doctor Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34561**] in 2 to 3 weeks.  He
also is to follow up with having an MRI as an outpatient.  He
was instructed to attend AA, not to use drugs or alcohol.
