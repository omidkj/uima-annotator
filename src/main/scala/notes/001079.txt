Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16983**]
Chief Complaint:
79 yo m with aplastic anemia, Fournier's gangrene and history of
possible old TB exposure admitted [**1-1**] for a 5 day course of ATG
and initition of CSA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transverse colectomy with creation of Hartmann's pouch and
proximal revision of colostomy to an end colostomy.


History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with untreated aplastic anemia is being
admitted for ATG + cyclosporine treatment. Pt was found to have
a hematopoietic disorder in [**4-19**] when he went to his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
follow up after experiencing lethargy. Patient's marrow was
initially aplastic on [**2192-6-28**]. Since then, he has been tried on
IVIG and prednisone without significant effect. His medical
course has been complicated by line infection, perianal abscess,
retinal bleed and the findings of pulmonary nodules and
granulomatous disease. Hence, at this time he is finishing a 9
month course of INH. His CT Chest shows improved nodules
allowing him to undergo ATG + Cyclosporine at this time. At
home, he denies any fevers, chest pain, SOB or bodily pain.
Denies any rashes, bleeding.

Past Medical History:
1) Aplastic anemia dx [**4-19**] by bone marrow biopsy.  Given some
questions about a history of TB, he was treated with INH for one
month and then started on prednisone 60mg daily on [**2192-7-5**].  He
requires platelet transfusions weekly, and blood transfusions
every several weeks or so.  Complicated by retinal hemorrhage.
2) Pt remembers living in a sanitorium from age [**2-24**]. This
prompted an investigation for TB, with subsequent sputum and
bone marrow negative for acid fast bacilli.  However, given a
concern for this in face of starting steroids, pt is being
treated with Isoniazid and Pyridoxine since [**2192-5-29**].  Chest CT
showed evidence of granulomatous disease in the past, but no
active disease.
3) kyphoscoliosis
4) L inguinal hernia, reducible present for long time, not
painful


Social History:
Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) **].  Has two grown daughters nearby.
[**Name2 (NI) **] tobacco, quit 40 years ago
Rare alcohol when he goes out


Family History:
There is no history of blood disorders.
