Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Post-op care following thoracoscopic left ventricular lead
placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracoscopic left ventricular epicardial lead placements (2)
for BiVIDC
Removal of coronary sinus lead for BiVICD


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
83M s/p thoracoscopic LV epicardial lead placement x 2, removal
of coronary sinus lead [**6-24**]. Patient experienced increasing
shortness of breath over past year. States unable to climb one
flight of stairs without becoming breathless and "things that
took 20 minutes now took one hour" such as showering. Patient
also out of breath after walking about 15 yards. States that did
not have problems with PND and has always slept with 2 pillows,
mostly because of longstanding vertigo when lying flat. Patient
had BiVent placement [**5-18**]. He states that after leaving he had
couple of days of feeling better and then felt worse. LV lead
was found to be pacing the diaphram and device was turned off.
Patient went back to baseline functionality.
Post surgery, patient has had non-complicated course, with
removal of chest tubes and decreased pulmonary edema. His
creatinine increased from 2.4 baseline to 2.8. Today he states
that he feels dizzy, or lightheaded, when walking. The
lightheadedness does not occur immediately on standing but
usually starts when walking 10 yards. He also experienced it
when getting up and going to the bathroom and straining to have
a bowel movement. He states that the sensation is very similar
to other times in the past when he has felt lightheadedness on
standing, (not the same as his vertigo).

ROS: The patient admits to past history of some urinary
obstruction during hospitalizations and states that he
experienced this again yesterday, but improved with medication.
No nausea. No chest pain or history of chest pain. Reports no
history of leg edema.

leads are noted. Previously noted right IJ line has been
removed. There are bibasilar opacities, with interstitial
