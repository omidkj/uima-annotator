HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old

She was able to respond to simple commands when EMS arrived,
and was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 8.  She was brought to
[**Hospital3 3583**] where a CT showed a large putaminal capsular
bleed on the right hemisphere.  She was reported to be moving
purposefully, but not following commands at that time.  She
was loaded on mannitol and Dilantin, intubated, and sent over
for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

MEDICATIONS:  Were not known at the time of admission;

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  She had been losing weight recently, but
no recent illnesses, or injuries.

EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 140/36, pulse 60, respirations
18.  She was intubated and sedated.  She was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Nonicteric.  Neck was supple with no bruits.
Cardiac exam was irregular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was
soft with no organomegaly.  Extremities were warm and well-
perfused with no edema.  She had no response to verbal
commands.  She withdrew and localized to pain on the right.
She withdrew to left leg less than the right.  She withdrew
left arm quite weakly.  She blinked to threat.  Her left
pupil was surgical.  Her right pupil was 1 mm and minimally
reactive.  She had weak corneal's bilaterally.  Her eyes were
midline.  No doll's eyes.  She had a left facial droop and a
positive gag.  Motor exam - normal bulk.  She withdrew on the
right briskly.  Left leg withdrew less than right.  Reflexes
were 0/5 on the left upper extremity, and 3 plus at the left
patella, 2 plus at the left ankle.  On her right side, she
was 2 plus on her right upper extremity, 3 plus at the right
patella, and 2 plus at the right ankle.  Her toes were
tonically upgoing.

LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a White blood cell
count of 9.8, hematocrit 37.4, platelets 158.  Chemistries
showed sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 102, bicarbonate
29, BUN 24, creatinine 0.8, glucose 188, PT 12.7, PTT 23.2,
INR 1.1.  Her last gas was 7.44, 37, 238, 26 and 1.
CT HEAD:  Showed a large putaminal internal capsule bleed
measuring approximately 3.5 x 4.5 cm through 6 sections.
There was some small midline shift and near-effacement of the
lateral and third ventricles.  There were also multiple small
punctate calcifications throughout.

ASSESSMENT:  In summary, this is an 83-year-old woman with
hypertension, with a large putaminal internal  capsule bleed
likely secondary to hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the ICU here at [**Hospital1 **].  Blood pressures were controlled with a
goal of less than 160.  She was continued on mannitol to
reduce intracerebral pressures.  Her hospital course was
uneventful.  Ultimately, the family was planning on having a
PEG tube placed after she was transferred to the floor, but
then she unfortunately had an aspiration pneumonia event, at
which point the family converted her care to comfort measures
only.

On [**2149-11-17**] at 2:30 am, the on-call resident, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was called by nursing.  The patient was
found pulseless in the bed with no cardiac sounds, no pulse,
no respirations, and was pronounced expired at that time.
The family was called, and after discussion with the daughter
and her husband, the family decided not to pursue an autopsy.
