Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement, arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
80yo F with h/o chronic lung disease from h/o lymphoma and XRT
to the chest area in [**2133**], in remission since [**2134**], RLL
pneumonia in [**2-/2138**] and recurrent pseudomonas and MRSA PNAs
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory distress now
transferred to MICU here for further workup. She was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-4-1**] for hypotension and hypoxia, found
to have pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia and dehydration. She was
started on azithromycin and cefepime on [**2138-4-1**]. CTA of the
chest ruled out a PE but did show a possible narrowing of the
previously stented left main bronchus concerning for
endobronchial mass, LAD, or esophageal mass impinging on the
airways. She was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended
thin liquids and soft solids and suggested GI workup of
esophageal dysfunction which was deferred to o/p workup.  She
was taken off CFP after three days because she was stable and
finished a 5 day course of azithromycin prior to being
discharged to home on [**2138-4-7**].
 Her son emailed her PCP [**4-11**] and reported that since leaving the
hospital she had had poor po intake, coughing non-stop, and poor
uop. The PCP faxed her [**Name Initial (PRE) **] prescription for guaifensin with
codeine which she had been on before and recommended earlier
followup.
  She then vomited yesterday and was weak. Her son brought her
to [**Name (NI) 620**]. She was initially admitted to the floor even though
her lactate was 5 and 86% on 2L NC with bandemia on her
differential. They thought possibly aspiration PNA. Was doing ok
til this am when they tried to get her up to commode where she
had pre-syncope but when took [**Name (NI) 23415**] sounded like vaso-vagal
syncope. Started on IVF but because extremely crackly throughout
did CXR and was not fluid overloaded.  She was transferred to
ICU was placed on NRB and was given lasix and moved to MICU. At
first tried to take her off NRB but was low 90s/high 80s on 6L.
ABG: 7.2/72/66. So started bipap. Tachycardic in 110s, temp
100.1. BP 100/80. Mentating ok but ABG abnormalities persisted
so intubated. Peri-intubation was hypotensive and receiving 3rd
Liter NS now. Creatinine is only 1, calcium corrected is 12 with
known history of lymphoma. Has also a port from chemotherapy as
well as subclavian placed at [**Location (un) 620**]. Had abdominal pain prior
to intubation and with lactate elevation they wanted to do abd
CT but did not get to it. In addition they wanted a chest CT to
eval for PE and re-eval the esophagus and LAD seen previously
but did not get to that either. They did place an NGT at [**Location (un) **]
with lots of resistence and unclear if in right place per the
attending at the OSH. CXR read there pending.
.
En route received Fentanyl bolus. Also put out about 60mL urine
on the way over.
 On the floor, patient was initially 100% on 350X16 60% and 5 of
peep. BP was 108/80 on 7mcg/min levophed. She was not completely
sedated and with palpation of the abdomen had grimacing but did
not answer questions or follow commands.
.
Review of systems:
Unable given intubated but per son no diarrhea, fevers,
abdominal pain. Positive for [**Location (un) **] and profound weakness (able
to walk with walker normally and yesterday could not at all).

causing compression to the left main bronchus s/p stent in the

stent was removed in [**2135**].

CTA Torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Consolidation in the basilar segments of both lower lobes,
consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
3. Ascites and generalized mural thickening of the small and
large bowel,
most prominent in the ileocecal region. This is most likely due
to third
spacing of extracellular fluid.
4. The celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are patent,
with known
obstructive calcified plaque at the origin of the celiac artery.

5. Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as seen on CT
[**2138-4-3**], which is probably related to known history of
lymphoma. Lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen has increased in
comparison to CT [**2137-7-8**].
