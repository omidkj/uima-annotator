HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female
with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation
presented here with her second episode of significantly sharp
abdominal pain.  She describes having a prior episode for
which she had necrotic bowel, which was operated upon.  Her
pain began suddenly the day prior to admission prompting her
visit to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital,
where she was noted to have a concerning physical exam as
well as increased digoxin levels and increased INR level.
She was reversed in terms of her anticoagulation and
scheduled for the operating room, and then was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.0, heart
rate 82, blood pressure 135/78, respiratory rate 26, and
saturation 97 percent on room air.  Alert and oriented times
three.  Appeared somewhat toxic and nasogastric tube in
place.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was tense and tender
with rebound in the right lower and left lower quadrants,
also revealing a well-healed scar from prior surgery.  Rectal
exam was positive for melena and guaiac positive.  Distal
pulses were 2 plus.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was at this time the patient was
admitted for further evaluation and treatment at [**Hospital1 346**].  Patient was preoperatively
prepared.  Laboratories were drawn.  Hematocrit was 34.8.
White count was 9.8.  Electrolytes were within normal limits.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.  INR was 1.1.
EKG was done that revealed the heart to be in normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 85 beats per minute.  There was no
pneumothorax on chest x-ray.  CAT scan showed dilated loops
and contrast was making it to the right colon.

Patient was placed nothing by mouth and continued on the
nasogastric tube.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl were
started.  An A-line has been placed as well as internal
jugular venous central line.  Thus the patient was brought to
the operating room for acute peritonitis, where extensive
lysis of adhesions took place.  There was noted to be
volvulus and a loops of small bowel around an adhesion.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and blood loss was
estimated to be 100 mL.  Patient was transferred to the
Trauma Intensive Care Unit after this operation.  Patient was
also seen by the Vascular Service for consideration of
possible infarcted bowel.  They agreed with the plan to
explore the abdomen.

In the operating room, there was noted to be no signs of any
ischemic bowel and just the adhesions since bowel volvulus
was described previously.  The patient did have a troponin
level of 0.057.  Patient was also seen by Cardiology at this
time due to ST depressions seen on EKG on the day of
admission.  Digoxin was held as the level was 3.3, and was
noted to be well rate controlled in atrial fibrillation.  It
was decided that it would be best to re-anticoagulate her
when safe from a surgical perspective and to followup with
the primary cardiologist.  They also stated that this was
unlikely to be ischemic in origin.

On hospital day number three, postoperative day number two,
patient began to have increased pain issues.  Patient was
given Fentanyl and Dilaudid, and received mild improvement.
Patient was febrile at this point to 100.3 and antibiotics
were continued.  Pulses were followed.

Patient was extubated at this point.  Toradol was also added
for further pain control.  Antibiotics were stopped at this
time.  There was no source of infection that can be noted.
The patient was then transferred to the floor.  As we awaited
regaining bowel function, the patient was seen by Physical
Therapy, who initially thought the patient would need likely
stay in the rehabilitation facility and shortly thereafter
cleared her for discharge her to home, and on [**2175-2-13**], patient was stable.  All vital signs were within normal
limits.  Patient was tolerating a regular diet.  Was out of
bed and increasing her activity participating in incentive
spirometry.  Was urinating without difficulty and it was
determined that the patient could be discharged to home with
outpatient physical therapy and for her to resume her
previous medications as she had been taking them, and to also
resume her anticoagulation.
