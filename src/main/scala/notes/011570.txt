Chief Complaint:
Fevers, diarrhea and knee pain

Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22221**] is a very nice 45 year-old genlteman with s/p
CRT '[**63**] on prednisone and rapamune, DM2, HTN, and gout who comes
with fever of 104 at home and knee pain. He was in his prior
state of health until 3 days ago when he noted a fever up to 104
at home. Then, a few hours later he noted brown watery diarrhea
up to 4-5 per day in large quantities, without any nausea, vomit
or abdominal pain. His cough has been at his baseline,
non-productive and he was able to do his daily activities. He
did not take any medications. He was able to have a few sips of
water, but in general he had very poor PO intake. He noted
decreasing urine output. Yesterday he started noticing R knee
swelling, with pain and some erythema in the skin that matched
with his prior gout flaires. He did not notice any improvement
and his fevers continued, so he decided to come to the hospital.

In the ER his pain was [**10-5**], T 99.6 F, HR 137 BPM, BP 96/64
mmHg, RR 30 X', SpO2 100%. His initial abdominal exam reported
severe abdominal pain and inflammed R knee joint. Patient
initially received Flagyl and underwent non-contrast abdominal
CT scan that did not show any perforation, obstruction or acute
pathology. Arthrosenthesis shwoed 16,600 WBC with 98% PMNs, no
organisms as well as few needle-shaped negatively birefringent
crystals. Pt received "stress dose steroids" with Solumedrol 125
mg. His CXR showed a RML infiltrate. At this point patient
received Vanc/Levo/CTX. His BP was as los as 90/60 mmHg and
tachycardia up to 130s. He responded to 4 L NS fluid. Given that
CT scan showed pericardial effusion, cardiolgy consult was done,
who performed an echocardiogram that did not show signs of
tamponade. No pulsus was done. Transplant surgery and nephrology
were called, but did not see patient. T [**Age over 90 **] F, BP 110/66 mmHg,
SpO2 96% 2L. he is being admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.

Of note, patient undergoes labs every other week at [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital and results get faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2106**] and his PCP. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**4-19**] his creatinine was 3.54, gap of 14 with Na 139, K 4.7, Cl
103, CO2 22, BUN 70. Pt had normal LFTs (AST 28, ALT 17), PTH
149,  urine creatinine 37 and protein 109, HCT 30, PLT 189 and
WBC 9.2. Rapamune level was 13.3.

Imaging Studies:

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2183-4-24**]): Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-7-11**], a
previously very small pericardial effusion is now large in size.
No clear echocardiographic evidence for tamponade.

CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2183-4-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate simple-appearing pericardial effusion, new since
[**2181-7-27**].
2. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities consistent with aspiration
pneumonia.
3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction, free air or abscess
formation.
4. No abnormalities of the renal transplant on CT.
5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

Duplex ultrasound ([**2183-4-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to [**2182-10-12**], there are sharper upstrokes and
increased, abnormal RIs of the transplant renal arteries,
concerning for rejection.
2. No evidence of abscess formation at the right iliac fossa
renal
transplant.
