History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with PAF on coumadin, diastolic dysfunction,
multiple valvular abnormalities (TR, MR, AR) admitted to
neurosurgical service [**2171-1-30**] for ICH, and transferred to MICU
[**2171-2-9**] for lethargy, hypoxia, and hypotension.
.
She was transferred [**2171-1-30**] from OSH after presenting with fall
backwards onto her occiput from 2 stair height without reported
LOC.  She was on coumadin at that time.  On presentation to OSH
GCS 15 and head CT showed significant SAH.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
She was admitted to TICU [**2171-1-30**] for neurologic monitoring.  INR
was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.  While in the TICU, the
patient became increasingly lethargic and was only
intermittently oriented A&Ox3.  She was found to have
hydrocephalus and underwent external ventricular drain placement
[**2171-2-2**].  She underwent Dobhoff placement under fluoro [**2171-2-8**].
.
During her hospitalization, chest radiograph with pulmonary
edema, basilar crackles and patient was diuresed with Lasix.
She became hypoxic with decrease in blood pressures from
baseline, and she went to the SICU [**2-3**] for a Lasix drip.
Subsequently, she was called out [**2-5**] and her standing home Lasix
dose was increased.  On [**2-8**], she was noted to have increased
respiratory effort with a "wet" cough, with PO2 88-96% and
tachycardia.  LENIs were negative.  She received 300cc free
water boluses for tachycardia and subsequently for hypotension
in the 80's.  Medicine was called and on review of the imaging
studies and given the patient's hypoxia and hypotension,
recommended initiating Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for possible
aspiration pneumonia as well as a 250cc bolus x2 for SBP
70's-80's.  A discussion of possible intubation was held with
the son and the patient was made DNR/DNI.  Lasix was d/c'ed.
Cultures were drawn, and ABG showed 7.51/40/105/33 with a
lactate of 2.7.
.
Of note, during the hospital course, the patient had loose stool
[**2-6**] and had C. diff x3 which were negative.  Her standing bowel
regimen was d/c'ed.  Of note, she was started on tube feeds on
[**2-4**].
.
This morning, [**2171-2-9**], the patient was found to have BP 70/30s
and somnolent, minimally responsive to noxious stimuli.  MERIT
was called for further management and potential transfer to
medicine service.  On evaluation, the patient somnolent and a
hct drop from 36 -> 31 was noted.  She was written for 1 unit
PRBC and 250cc bolus NS was initiated in the interim.  Oxygen
saturation fluctuated between high 80's-100% on high flow face
mask.  Of note, per neurosurgery, external ventricular drain at
10 open.
.
On evaluation in the MICU, she is nonverbal.  She moans to
sternal rub and does hold her son's hand.

IMAGING:
[**1-29**] Head CT:
1. Multicompartmental hemorrhage with bifrontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage layering along the
basilar cisterns, and a small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage layering along the occipital horns.
2. Left occipital fracture. Note that the reference CT was made
available after initial review, and the bifrontal areas of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage are new since the reference CT. In
addition, the intraventricular hemorrhage is new since reference
CT and the layering subarachnoid hemorrhage has increased.

[**1-30**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased size and surrounding edema of the right frontal
lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Increased intraventricular hemorrhage in the right frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] and bilateral occipital horns.
3. Unchanged inferior left frontal lobe intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, right frontal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage, and
basal cistern subarachnoid hemorrhage.
4. Left occipital fracture, better visualized on CT from
[**2171-1-29**].
.
[**1-31**] Head CT:
1. Unchanged size of right frontal lobe intraparenchymal
