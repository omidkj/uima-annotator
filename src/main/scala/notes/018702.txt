HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
male patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who was referred for
outpatient cardiac catheterization after undergoing a
positive stress test.  He has a history of carotid artery
disease, and a stress test in [**2178-2-1**] revealed a
small mild anterior reversible defect.  The patient states he
has had chronic stable angina over the past several years
with angina occurring once every several days with exertion,
which was also responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin.

Recently, however, he has had two prolonged episodes that
occurred at rest and did not easily respond to nitroglycerin.
One episode lasted several hours and he subsequently saw his
primary care physician and his cardiologist, where he had a
stress test done on [**2181-8-6**], which was significant for chest
pain, ST depression in the V2 and V3 leads, leads 1 and aVL.
He did have dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath
associated with his angina.  He denies any claudication,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness, or
lower extremity edema.

His coronary artery disease risk factors include hypertension
and previous tobacco history.  He is nondiabetic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for spinal stenosis,
coronary artery disease, neuropathy of his feet, and severe
arm pain and tingling, which is treated with prednisone.  He
has no history of any transient ischemic attacks,
cerebrovascular accidents, or gastrointestinal bleeds.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a left carotid
endarterectomy in [**2178**] and two prior back surgeries.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aspirin, Toprol 50 mg p.o. once daily,
prednisone 5 mg p.o. once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
p.o. once daily, Imdur 30 mg p.o. once daily, M.V.I.,
Darvocet, Ritalin p.r.n., amitriptyline 75 mg p.o. q.h.s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2181-8-16**], which revealed an ejection
fraction of approximately 55%, 50% discrete right coronary
artery proximal stenosis, 95% mid RCA, 80% discrete stenosis
of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, 70%
of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, 70%
diagonal 1 stenosis, 80% midcircumflex, and 70% distal
circumflex.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for
coronary artery revascularization.

The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 on
[**2181-8-20**].  The patient received a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1, and a
sequential graft to the obtuse marginal #2, saphenous vein
graft to the diagonal #1, and saphenous vein graft to the
right posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well without any complications, and
was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable
condition.

The patient was kept intubated overnight and was successfully
extubated the following day on postoperative day one.  He was
subsequently transferred to the floor later that day on
postoperative day one in stable condition.

On postoperative day two he remained afebrile with stable
vital signs in a regular rhythm.  During the evening of
postoperative day two the patient was noted to go into atrial
fibrillation.  He was treated with Lopressor intravenous
push.  Amiodarone drip was started and the patient was noted
still to be tachycardic with little response to the
amiodarone.  A diltiazem drip was also started, as the
patient did have V wires in place.  The patient's blood
pressure remained stable during the entire episode.

On the night of postoperative day two the patient was noted
to be in some respiratory distress.  An electrocardiogram was
obtained, which did not show any acute changes.  The patient
was noted to have coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  A chest
x-ray was obtained, which revealed fluid overload.  Thus, 80
mg of intravenous Lasix was given with a good response of the
patient, both with urine output and symptomatically with
increasing oxygen saturation.  Thus, he was maintained on
intravenous Lasix during the rest of his hospital course, and
subsequently his oxygen saturation and breathing pattern
improved dramatically.

On postoperative day three the patient was noted to convert
to a normal sinus rhythm.  His diltiazem drip was
discontinued.  His amiodarone drip was changed to p.o.
dosing.

Currently the patient is postoperative day four.  He is doing
extremely well.  He remains afebrile with stable vital signs
and normal sinus rhythm.  His current Lopressor dose is now
at 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He is currently maintained on
intravenous Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. and is diuresing well with
decreasing oxygen requirement and improving oxygen
saturation.

Physical therapy was consulted.  The patient was noted to
require much assistance with ambulation.  Thus, it is
believed that a short rehabilitation stay will be of much
benefit to the patient in order to return to his preoperative
ambulatory status.

As he is currently awaiting rehabilitation placement, the
patient will be discharged to rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 5.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. x seven days and then once daily.
3. K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days then once daily.
4. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
5. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once daily.
6. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. once daily.
7. Dilaudid 2-4 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
8. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. x 3 days, then 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d. x 7 days, then 400 mg p.o. once daily x 7 days, then
200 mg p.o. once daily.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Albuterol nebulizers q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient should be ambulating with assistance until
able to ambulate at his preoperative status.
2. Aggressive chest physical therapy should be given.
3. The patient should be maintained on a cardiac diet.
4. He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in approximately three
weeks.
