[**3-22**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
1. Severe sigmoid diverticulitis, with a perisigmoid abscess,
which directly abuts the left posterolateral wall of the
bladder. While by size criteria, this is potentially drainable,
its location and approach is unfavorable for percutaneous
drainage.
2. Changes of chronic pancreatitis, with pancreatic
calcifications. 4-mm
rounded calcific focus in the pancreatic duct within the tail of
pancreas,
with dilated pancreatic duct distally.
3. Several cystic lesions in the pancreas, the largest in the
pancreatic
tail, which may represent dilated side branches from chronic
pancreatitis,
side branch IPMN, or small pseudocysts. These can be evaluated
with MRCP in six months on a non-emergent basis
.
[**3-23**] EGD:
Erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis (biopsy)
Inflammatory polyp in the cardia
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2119-3-24**] OPERATIVE REPORT:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Sigmoid phlegmon with pelvic
abscess.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Sigmoid phlegmon with pelvic
abscess.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Low anterior resection.
2. Hartmann turn-in.
3. Sigmoid colostomy.
4. Drainage of pelvic abscess.

ANESTHESIA:  General.

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  This was a 73-year-old woman who
entered the hospital in transfer from an outside facility
approximately 3 weeks earlier with lower abdominal discomfort
and an apparent sigmoid colon phlegmon on CT scan. She
appeared to have a contained abscess there. She had extensive
diverticulosis in the other areas of her colon on the CT
scan, and a presumptive diagnosis of complicated
diverticulitis was made. She was also found to have cystic
dilatation of the pancreas, potentially suggestive of
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia. I initially treated
the patient with antibiotics as an inpatient. Her white blood
cell count, which had been approximately 14,000, fell to
normal. Her pain resolved. Her diet was successfully
advanced. She was able to be discharged to home. There, she
completed a full course of outpatient antibiotics. I had seen
her as an outpatient a few days after cessation of the
antibiotics, at which time she reported having no abdominal
pain. However, she did complain of mild nausea and her family
reported a 20-pound weight loss over the previous few months,
with reportedly 6 pounds of weight loss only in the past 10
days since she had gone home. I had planned to obtain an
outpatient upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound for the
purposes of a potential transgastric biopsy of the pancreas.
While the patient had been hospitalized, a CEA had been sent
which was 14, three times normal. A CA19-9, however, was
normal.

Two days after I had seen the patient as an outpatient, I was
called to be told that she was extremely nauseated and unable
to leave her bed. Her family was quite alarmed. I
readmitted her to the hospital. Her white blood cell count was
again 15. A CT scan showed persistent inflammation of the
sigmoid with enlargement of her abscess, now measuring 4.5
cm. She was placed on antibiotics again. I obtained an upper
endoscopy to rule out any type of intrinsic gastric mass. It
showed mild gastritis only, there was no obstruction. I had
already decided to forego the transgastric biopsy. She was
started on intravenous nutrition.

I was concerned that nonoperative
management had only led to a progressive decline. It remained
possible that she either had an unusual form of perforated
colon cancer as opposed to severe diverticulitis. I decided
to not perform a preoperative sigmoidoscopy due to my concern
of inducing an acute perforation. Accordingly, approximately
48 hours after her readmission and following a mechanical
bowel prep, she was brought to surgery.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed in the
operating room of the [**Hospital1 69**],
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]. The patient was brought into the room and laid
supine on the table. She was successfully induced and
intubated for general endotracheal anesthesia. Pneumatic
compression boots were applied. A Foley catheter was
inserted. She was placed into lithotomy with appropriate
padded supports. Her preoperative ciprofloxacin had been
continued. She was also continued with her preoperative
Flagyl. In addition, for additional perioperative coverage,
she was given 2 grams of intravenous Kefzol and 100 mg of
intravenous gentamicin. We prepped the abdomen with Betadine
and sterilely draped.

I made a midline incision extending from the pubis to
slightly above the umbilicus. The patient had a prior
hysterectomy, and at the time of her exploration, I also
concluded that she had undergone bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy and appendectomy. Regardless, after opening the
abdomen, she had no evidence of ascites. There was no
carcinomatosis. There were no adhesions.

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24412**] retractor was placed. She had, as expected, an
intense inflammatory process in the left lower quadrant and
pelvis. Her sigmoid colon was extensively adherent to
multiple surrounding structures. She appeared to have a very
redundant cecum and right colon and the cecum and ileocecal
junction were extensively involved with the inflammatory
process. I engaged in a laborious dissection to separate the
cecum and ileum from the area of the sigmoid colon. We
entered at least two areas of abscess formation close to the
sigmoid mesentery. The patient also had a much larger abscess
which essentially was centered on the dome of the bladder.
However, after entering the inflammatory peel in the
perivesical abscess, I concluded that there was no actual
violation of the bladder itself. I could feel the patient's
Foley balloon with what appeared to be intact tissue, deep
within the abscess cavity.
