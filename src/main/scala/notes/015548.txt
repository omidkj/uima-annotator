HISTORY:  This was a 54-year-old male with past medical
history significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma status post
chemotherapy and status post mini-allogeneic BMT complicated
by graft versus host disease for skin, liver, GI, and lungs.
He was originally admitted on [**2193-2-18**] for shortness of
breath, increasing edema, and change in mental status to the
Medicine Service.  His hospital course was complicated by
atrial fibrillation and new flutter status post DC
cardioversion on [**2193-2-22**].  The patient had recurrence of his
aflutter on [**2193-2-26**] on amiodarone associated with
hypertension and was transferred to the CCU.  The patient had
aflutter ablation done on [**2193-2-27**] and a right- and left-
sided cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-28**] revealed
hemodynamics consistent with constrictive pericarditis.  The
patient was started on Natrecor and Lasix with minimal
diuresis complicated by hypertension and Natrecor was
discontinued.  On [**2193-3-4**], the patient had a cardiac MRI
which post MRI was complicated by a respiratory arrest
requiring intubation, transferred to the MICU.

The patient was eventually extubated on [**2193-3-7**] and placed
intermittently on BiPAP for hypercapnia and fatigue.  Due to
the patient's constrictive pericarditis possibly secondary to
his graft versus host disease, a pericardial stripping was
performed on [**2193-3-12**] for improvement in hemodynamics by
cardiothoracic surgery.  The patient did well post
pericardial stripping with excellent diuresis.  The patient
was transferred to the CCU for further diuresis after his
pericardial stripping.  The patient's phone numbers were
followed closely after stripping with improvement of cardiac
output over the next several days.  The patient occasionally
needed BiPAP for respiratory fatigue and hypercapnia.  The
patient was complaining of some difficulty swallowing and
sore throat on [**2193-3-17**] and his tube feeds were held due to
his difficulty swallowing and his need for BiPAP.  The
patient was noted on [**2193-3-18**] to have a desaturation in the
morning to 70 percent on 40 percent facemask, suctioned and
blood with some thin secretions were suctioned and the
patient's O2 saturations increased after suctioning.

It was felt that the patient may had an aspiration event and
was started on Flagyl and a speech and swallow evaluation was
ordered.  Given the patient's difficulty with his respiratory
status, it was unable to perform a swallowing study and the
patient was closely monitored with holding of tube feeds.
The patient required emergent intubation in the evening of
[**2193-3-18**] for respiratory distress.  Copious thin secretions
were removed.  The patient was noted to have secretions of
400 to 500 cc of bloody tube feeds.  The patient became more
difficult to arouse and blood pressure continued to drop and
the patient's oxygen saturations also declined.  The patient
was placed on multiple blood pressure support medications
including dopamine and Neo-Synephrine drips.  A stat
echocardiogram was obtained which showed no evidence of
tamponade.  Prior to placing his Swan-Ganz catheter to
evaluate likely septic physiology, the patient went into a
systolic arrest.  ACLS was performed with multiple
epinephrine, bicarbonate, atropine x20 minutes without
success.  The patient expired at 12:34 a.m. likely from
sepsis from aspiration event.  The family was informed of
events of the night and declined postmortem exam.
