HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 61975**] is an 83-year-old gentleman who
was admitted on [**2107-1-5**], with right foot ischemia
and right toe ulcer as well as left third toe ulcer. He was
started on IV antibiotics including Cipro and Flagyl and
Vancomycin preoperatively. On [**2107-1-5**], he had an
angio which showed an occluded right fem [**Doctor Last Name **] and left fem
[**Doctor Last Name **], but PDA was patent, as well as stenosis in his left PT.
On [**1-6**] he got a CT angiogram that showed bilateral
pleural effusions however no signs of PE. On [**1-7**] he
had vein mapping as well as PVRs as part of his preoperative
work up. He also had a cardiology evaluation. He was taken to
the operating room on [**2107-1-14**], for a right double
below knee popliteal to DP bypass graft with a left vein
patch angioplasty. Postoperatively he did well.

On postoperative day 1, he underwent dialysis. He was in the
vascular intensive care unit  for monitoring. After dialysis
he was noted to be somewhat hypotensive. The health officer
was called to evaluate him and noted that he had some mental
status changes as well as hypotension. He was immediately
transferred to the intensive care unit where upon evaluation
of the blood gases and mental status changes, he was
electively intubated and started on Neo-Synephrine and
Levophed for his blood pressure. At this point a cardiology
evaluation was obtained in order to help evaluate the
etiology for his hypotension. He was empirically started on a
heparin drip and per cardiology there are no plans for
catheterization. His pressures stabilized on Neo-Synephrine
and Levophed. He self extubated himself that evening and was
stable on nasal cannula. His mental status improved and he
was alert, oriented and following commands. On [**1-17**],
he got an echocardiogram which showed dilated left atrium,
low to normal left ventricular function and elevated right
ventricular pressure with systolic hypertension. Cardiology
continued to follow him during this time. He continued to
have increased pressor requirement without any clear
etiology.

He had a full set of blood cultures which were all negative.
He was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
There was some concern because of his right ventricular
increased filling pressure of pulmonary embolus. He had a CT
of the chest on [**1-19**] that confirmed no sign of any
sort of pulmonary embolus. At this point his heparin drip was
stopped. He continued to be sort of stable on pressors,
however we were unable to wean his pressors. We were treating
him as if he was having a septic physiology as well as
possible congestive heart failure. He remained stable on
pressors and alert and oriented, however on the evening of
[**1-26**] he complained of some back pain and discomfort
and some increased shortness of breath. At that morning he
was intubated for increased work of breathing. He had CTA of
his chest and abdomen. CT of his chest showed new pulmonary
infiltrate and CT of his abdomen showed some abdominal
ascites, however there were no signs of any intraabdominal
process that would be concerning.

He had a repeat echocardiogram on [**1-27**] that did not
show any significant change since his previous echo on
[**1-17**], however he did continue over the course of next
few days to have increasing pressor requirement and was
intermittently started on a vasopressor, maxing on his
Levophed and Neo-Synephrine. On the morning of [**1-29**],
he was maxed out on both Neo-Synephrine, vasopressor and
Levophed with hypotension,  systolic pressures in the 70s.
No secrecy concern that he had not been improving without any
clear etiology. It was determined to repeat his accuracy with
some changes in his cardiac function however at this time. It
was noted the enzymes had not been continuously cycled and
his troponins remained stable, however elevated likely
secondary to his renal failure. A repeat echo that afternoon
showed significant left ventricular dysfunction consistent
with possible myocardial infarction. Cardiology was consulted
and felt that he was not a candidate for a balloon pump, or
catheterization, or sort of intervention at this time, and
recommended medical management.

We switched his pressors over to milrinone and attempted the
[**Hospital1 **] without success. He continued to do poorly with
pressures in the 70s. We had a lengthy discussion with the
family and went over his echocardiogram with the family and
cardiology to explain this new finding in that his overall
condition had continued to deteriorate over this period. The
family at this point wished to continue with full medical
support. He started to have worsening metabolic acidosis and
we attempted to try some CVAs, however his pressures would
not tolerate this, so he received bicarbonate for his
acidosis. We continued to increase milrinone while he was
maxed out on Neo-Synephrine, vasopressor and Levophed. His
pressures remained in the 70s but stable. On the evening of
[**1-29**], his pressures started to decrease below 70s, and
then systolic pressures in the 60s. He was maxed out on all
of his pressors.

At this point the family was concerned and felt that if
situation got worse they did not want to resuscitate him or
proceed with any cardioversion or chest compressions. He was
made DNR on [**2107-1-29**], at 11:30 p.m. At this point
his pressures maxed out on 4 pressors and continued to
dwindle into the 50s. Family again called at [**1-30**] at 1
a.m. with concern that he was not getting better and wished
to make him CMO and felt that he would not wish to have any
further intervention and that it would be within his wishes
to make him CMO.

At 1 a.m. to [**2107-1-30**], he was made CMO and his
pressors were all weaned off. He expired at 1:36 a.m. on
[**2107-1-30**]. It was discussed with family for
postmortem and the family declined and they also declined for
any autopsy. They felt that they were happy with his overall
care and felt that the intensive care unit  was quite
supportive during his entire course. Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26687**] were informed of both his DNR and CMO
status when they occurred.
