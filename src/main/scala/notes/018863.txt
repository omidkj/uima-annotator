Imaging:
[**2191-2-10**] CXR - Hyperinflation reflects severe emphysema. Heart is
normal in size, and there is no pulmonary edema. Tiny left
pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2191-2-11**] Cardiac cath -
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant vessel
revealed
3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD had mild proximal
disease and a
90% thrombotic lesion in distal vessel?first septal branch (twin
LAD
system). The LCX was a small vessel and had an 80% distal
stenosis. The
RCA was a dominant vessel with mild proximal disease. The PDA
had a 90%
stenosis. The ramus intermedius was  a small vessel with mild
diffuse
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and low
cardiac
index of 1.6 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. After IC administration of nitroglycerin, flow through the
ramus
intermedius and the LCX improved dramatically suggesting a
componenet of
vasoconstriction.
5. Successful POBA of the distal LAD with a 2.0x15mm balloon
with
excellent results (see PTCA comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Low cardiac index .
5. Acute Anterior MI.
.
[**2191-2-10**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia with Left axis deviation and late
transition. Since previous tracing, no significant change

[**2191-2-11**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M w/ PMH of COPD, CAD, HTN and hypercholesterolemia, who
was admitted for STEMI and was found to have coronary vasospasm
and elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization.
.
# Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an ST elevation MI and went to the
cath lab for POBA to LAD. The most notable finding on his
catheterization was that his coronaries appeared to be diffusely
spastic and could be dilated with the administration of IV
nitro. His cardiac enzymes peaked at CK of 214, CK MB of 8, and
trop of 0.08 on [**2-10**]. He was continued on aggrestat, since he had
been started on it at the OSH, for a total of 18 hours
post-cath. He was on a nitro gtt on arrival to the CCU, but was
able to be weaned to PO meds shortly thereafter. He was started
on aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for his acute coronary
syndrome, an ACE-inhibitor for aid in cardiac remodeling, and
diltiazem and isosorbide mononitrate for relief of coronary
vasospasm. Given his pulmonary disease, no beta-blocker was
given. He tolerated these medications well, with no side
effects.
.
# Pump: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had markedly elevated filling pressures by
R heart catheterization and received IV lasix during the
procedure. However, he had an ECHO on [**2191-2-10**] which showed a
normal EF of 60%. He appeared euvolemic on exam with minimal
diuresis on PO lasix, so it was felt that his respiratory
symptoms and dyspnea were most likely due to his underlying
pulmonary disease. Prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an
episode of hypotension after getting his PO lasix dose. He was
given additional PO fluids and his BP responded well, so his PO
lasix was discontinued since it was felt that he was euvolemic,
perhaps even hypovolemic, and his ECHO appeared to have a
preserved EF (though likely has diastolic dysfunction). He was
advised to follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who can
decide if he needs to be restarted on lasix.
.
# Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was monitored on telemetry and remained
in NSR through the majority of his stay.
.
# COPD: At the OSH, he was given IV steroids, ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for a COPD flare. However, on admission to the CCU,
he had no evidence of a COPD exacerbation (no wheezing, his O2
sats were stable on his home O2 requirement, and had no
dyspnea), so he was not continued on steroids or antibiotics. He
was continued on his home COPD regimen (inhaled steroids, long
acting anticholinergic, and albuterol). Once his cardiac enzymes
had peaked and he was transferred to the stepdown unit, he was
able to ambulate w/ PT and maintain stable oxygen saturations.
He was discharged home with home PT to help improve his
functional status.
.
# FEN: He was put on a low sodium, heart healthy diet. He was
not given any additional IVF after his post-cath hydration. His
electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted to keep his K
>4 and Mg >2.
.
# PPX: He rece
