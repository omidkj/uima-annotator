Right upper lobe nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-12-21**]: Right video assisted thoracoscopy, decortication of

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109238**] is a 86-year-old gentleman who had undergone a left
lower lobectomy for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer many
years prior. On
surveillance CT scan he was noted to have an enlarging lesion in
the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. This was
concerning for a second primary lung cancer and he was brought
to the operating room today for resection. Given his
diminished pulmonary function, we determined that should this
prove to be a cancer we would not perform a lobectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109238**] was admitted on [**2195-12-21**] for  Right video assisted
thoracoscopy, decortication of lung and wedge resection of right
upper lobe.  He was extubated in the PACU and required CPAP
overnight for decreased oxygen saturation.  His chest-tube was
placed to suction.  The chest tube site oozed heme and was
monitored closely. The hemtocrit remained stable at 36-38.  His
pain was manged with a Dilaudid PCA.  The foley remained in
place.  On POD1 the Geratric Service was consulted to assist
with his medical management. The chest-tube was placed to
water-seal and serial chest film showed a small stable
pneumothorax. He was continued on hydrocortisone which converted
to PO prednisone on POD2.  He transferred to the floor. His
foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.

He was noted to have moderate agitation / sundowning during the
nighttime, and frequent reorientation was required by the
nursing staff.

His chest tube had a stable leak and was continued to suction
until [**2195-12-23**] (POD 2) when it was placed to waterseal -- still
with a leak. His follow up chest x-ray was stable. His leak
substantially decreased on POD 3, and he underwent a clamping
trial on POD 3. His POD 4 AM CXR was stable with no increased
pneumothorax, his chest tube was then pulled and follow up CXR
was stable. He continued to have an oxygen requirement in the
hospital and was discharged on home oxygen therapy.

His pain was well controlled at discharge and his incision site
was clean/dry and intact and with resolving amounts of crepitus.

He started his home dose of coumadin on his final hospital day
and was discharged stable, on his home regimen with close
followup from his PCP.
