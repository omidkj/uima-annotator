Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Decompensated heart failure with failure of outpatient
management

Medical ICU admission
Arthrocentesis left knee ([**7-28**], [**7-30**])


History of Present Illness:
79M with history of severe systolic CHF, atrial fibrillation,
CAD, DM; presents from rehab with dyspnea and edema concerning
for CHF exacerbation. Patient was recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 36573**] on cardiology service for similar problems of acute on
chronic systolic CHF. Diuresed with lasix gtt up to 20 mg/hr
with 500 mg diuril. Improved symptoms and transitioned to
torsemide 20 mg twice daily. Creatinine 1.4 at discharge (range
1.4-1.7 during hospital course).
.
Since recent discharge to rehab, pt has had some dizziness,
fatigue and occasionally hypotensive with SOB. On [**7-17**] his
Torsemide was incrased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. On [**7-18**] he had an acute
episode of SOB and was dizzy/fatigued., he was given zaroxylyn
2.5mg PO and 40mg IV lasix w/relief. He was evaluated by
neurology at the rehab who felt his symptoms were most likey [**3-5**]
CHF. Today, the Torsemide was increased to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] and was
subsequently transferred for ongoing hypotension and SOB.
.
Currently patient reporting shortness of breath. Denies CP,
palpitiations. + PND. denies LH, dizziness.

[**2142-7-19**] ECG: Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2142-7-9**] no change.
.
[**2142-7-19**] CXR: Findings suggestive of a developing right lower
lung and possibly also left lower lung pneumonia.
.
[**2142-7-20**] CXR: No interval change in bibasilar lung findings.
Considerations would include ongoing CHF, though basilar
pneumonia can have a similar appearance.
.
[**2142-7-21**] CXR:  In comparison with the study of [**7-20**], there is
little overall change. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists in the patient with what clinically appears to be
pulmonary vascular congestion. However, the possibility of
supervening areas of consolidation cannot be excluded. Lateral
view would be most helpful if the condition of the patient
permits.
.
[**2142-7-21**] [**Month/Day/Year 461**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe global
systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-5-14**],
mitral regurgitation is more clearly visualized, although its
severity may have been similar on the prior study. Pulmonary
pressures are higher to
