Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation; right IJ central venous
catheterization; right radial arterial catheterization; R
thoracentesis; bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 yo male with h/o DM who has not seen a doctor in
2 years and has been off meds presenting with SOB x 1 week per
his family. His family reports that he was in his usual state of
health until 1 week ago when he noted increasing SOB.  His
family urged him to go to the hospital, but he refused. Over the
past 3 days he has been persistently SOB with orthopnea, and
became confused the evening prior to admission at which time his
family finally convinced him to come to the ED.  He denied
fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain, HA or CP.
.
In the ED, initially T 98.2 BP 157/93 HR 113 RR 36 O2 sats 84%
on 5 L, 100% on Bipap with 100% FiO2. CXR revealed large right
sided pleural effusion. Elevated LFTs prompted an abdominal CT
scan which did not reveal any hepatobiliary or other
intraabdominal pathology, but confirmed the pleural effusion.
He became progressively more tachypneic and required intubation.
He became hypotensive to 80s/60s after intubation and was
started on pressors and vanco/levoflox/ceftriaxone prior to
transfer to the ICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
DM
Chronic lower extremity ulcers

Social History:
Lives alone. Does his own shopping, pays bills, drives. No ETOH,
quit smoking 20 years ago after smoking 1.5 ppd for many years,
no drugs. Retired airport worker. His family lives around the
corner but says that he is "very private.

Family History:
Father died at 92, mother died at 76 from ? bowel perforation.
GF with lung cancer. No other family h/o malignancy or cardiac
disease.

Physical Exam:
GEN: obese, intubated, sedated; does not respond to command but
responds to pain
HEENT: scleral icteris, pinpoint sluggish pupils bilat;
edentulous, ET tube in place; excoriation over bridge of nose,
right eye hematoma
NECK: R IJ. dressing c/d/i, no erythema
CV: RRR, nl S1 & S2 no m/r/g
PULM: diminished breath sounds at right base, bibasilar crackles
R>L, no wheeze
ABD: +BS, soft obese abdomen, NTND, no hepatomegaly
EXT: multiple discrete tibial ulcerations with central necrosis
bilat; ext warm, dry, good cap refill,  1+ symmetrical LE edema.
R radial A-line
NEURO: Moving all extremeties equally in response to agitating
stimulus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Shock - Cardiogenic or septic, or both, in origin. Patient was
given massive amounts of IVF for blood pressure support which
compounded poor cardiopulmonary substrate. CVP was monitored via
a right IJ CVC. proBNP was markedly elevated. TTE revealed
severely diminished LV function with an EF ~20% and an LV
thrombus. It was thought that this may represent profound
ischemic CMP from past silent ischemia in the setting of DM
neuropathy. He did not tolerate inotropic therapy due to
tachycardia, nor did his blood pressure tolerate substantial
diuresis. He continued to have a significant pressor requirement
throughout the first six days of his hospital course. He was
treated with stress-dose steroids, ABX coverage for CAP and
anaerobic coverage for possible aspiration PNA. Blood, sputum,
and pleural fluid cultures have not grown to date.
.
Hypercapneic and hypoxic respiratory failure - Large right
layering pleural effusion seen on initial chest imaging was
noted to have underlying compression atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
ABX started given fever, leukocytosis, and possible
parapneumonic effusion.  Underwent ultrasound-guided right-sided
thoracentesis and bronchoscopy, which revealed sanguinous lung
tissue but no evidence of an underlying malignancy. Continued to
require significant ventilator support due to substantial fluid
overload and poor cardiac function.
.
Transaminitis - Thought to respresent shock liver vs. hepatic
congestion, although could not rule out ETOH.  CT Abdomen did
not reveal any evidence of cirrhosis, NASH, or liver mass. Viral
and autoimmune serologies, and serum and urine tox screens, were
negative. He was given a banana bag, and his LFT's were
monitored as they trended down.
.
Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia - Likely secondary to hepatic
insult. Reversed with FFP prior to thoracentesis. Considered
DIC, but fibrinogen WNL (as were platelets initially on
admission). Did not display any S/Sx of bleeding.
.
Head wound - Concern for an unreported fall, particularly in the
setting of a coagulopathy, prompted a noncontrast head CT to
rule out hemorrhage or skull fracture. The exam was negative for
both.
.
LE ulcerations - Derm was consulted and recommended biopsy of
skin lesions, which revealed a neutrophilic dermatosis such as
Sweet's syndrome or pyoderma gangrenosum. He did not receive
high-dose steroids in light of more critical comorbid issues.
.
DM - Started on RISS, but poor glycemic control required
eventual insulin gtt.
.
.
After reviewing prognosis during a family meeting with
physicians and nurses in attendance, it was decided to make the
patient CMO. At the family's request, the ETT was removed and
the patient died at 2:35 pm on [**2143-7-30**]. Examination confirmed
death and the family was notified. Consent for autopsy was
obtained from the patient's brother, [**Name (NI) 2174**] [**Name (NI) **].
