HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 29-year-old
woman, with a history of diabetes, hypothyroidism, asthma,
schizophrenia, who was living in a long-term care facility.
She presented to us as a direct admission for a scheduled
bronchoscopy with stent placement scheduled for [**6-11**].  It
was difficult to obtain a history from the patient, but her
caregivers from her facility report that she has had about a
one year history of airway obstruction, and has had an MR at
an outside hospital, and reports are to be faxed to [**Hospital1 18**].
Caregivers report that the patient has occasional wheezing
and difficulty "getting air in."

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for shortness of breath,
wheezing, chest pain, fevers, or chills, and is positive for
a loose tooth.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Diabetes mellitus, diet controlled,
2) Hypothyroidism, 3) Asthma, 4) Schizophrenia, 5) Bipolar
disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  1) cogentin 1 mg tid, 2) armour thyroid 60 mg 2
tablets q morning and 1 at night, 3) Vitamin C 3 tablets tid,
4) lithium 300 mg tid, 5) magnesium oxide 400 mg tid, 6)
Seroquel 200 mg 2 tablets [**Hospital1 **], 7) trazodone 150 mg 1 tablet q
hs, 8) depakote 500 mg tid, 9) zinc 50 mg qid, 10) Effexor
XR 150 mg qd, 11) Carnitor 330 mg 1 tid, 12) Creon 20 mg 1

100 mg qd.

ALLERGIES:  1) penicillin, 2) sulfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for smoking, alcohol use, or
illicit drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5, blood pressure
135/90, heart rate 96, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 98%
on room air.  Generally, the patient is awake, smiling,
verbal but difficult to understand speech.  HEENT -
oropharynx is clear.  Mucosa moist.  Sclerae anicteric.  Neck
exam supple, no lymphadenopathy.  Trachea midline.  No
thyromegaly.  Cardiac exam - normal S1, S2, regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary exam - fine
inspiratory wheeze in the right upper lobe.  Clear to
auscultation otherwise, and good aeration throughout.
Abdominal exam - obese, soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities - no edema.  Vascular
exam - 2+ pulses, dorsalis pedis and radial arteries
bilaterally.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 7.9, hematocrit 41.0,
platelets 151.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 97,
bicarb 34, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7, glucose 148, calcium 8.9,
phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 1.7.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) PULMONARY:  A CT airway was
done on the day of admission which showed a right-sided aorta
with the arch posterior to the airway causing airway
compression.  A bronchoscopy with stent was performed, and
stent was placed at the distal trachea.  It was difficult to
assess whether there was improvement in patient's symptoms
after this procedure.

An MRA was done which showed right aortic arch with
left-sided descending thoracic aorta.  The trachea and
esophageal were displaced anteriorly by the aortic arch.  The
trachea was narrowed by the proximal left common carotid
anteriorly and aortic arch posteriorly, and there was a
possibility of aortic regurgitation.  Overall, the study was
considered to be technically suboptimal due to very limited
patient cooperation, and it was recommended that further
anatomic information be obtained via a contrast enhanced MRI
in which the patient is under conscious sedation.  Also in
terms of the aortic regurgitation, a cardiac echocardiogram
was probably necessary to evaluate the situation.  Lastly, a
barium swallow with small bowel follow through was performed
which showed compression of the esophagus by the aortic arch.

Throughout her stay, the patient continued to have oxygen
desaturation overnight with her oxygen saturation in the
mid-80s which was improved when put on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Due to the large body habitus of the patient and
the desaturations overnight, it was very possible that the
patient was experiencing obstructive sleep apnea, and a sleep
study was recommended to further evaluate.

On the anticipated day of discharge, pt demonstrated increased
difficulty breathing with worsening stridor.  Plain films and
urgent ENT fiberoptic evaluation demonstrated subglottic
narrowing.  The patient was thus transferred to the ICU for
closer monitoring of her respiratory status.  The interventional
pulmonology team was closely involved in this decision to
transfer.
