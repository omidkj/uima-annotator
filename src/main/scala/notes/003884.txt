Chief Complaint:
PCP: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], MD
.
REASON FOR MICU TRANSFER: Respiratory Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of Breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20802**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. F with diastolic CHF (EF 55% on [**9-2**]
echo), recent PE on [**2-/2181**], recent GI bleeding attributed to
colon diverticuli seen on colonoscopy during recent [**Hospital1 18**]
hospitalization in [**2181-9-25**], transferred from OSH ([**Hospital1 **])
with respiratory failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema.
.
From [**10-11**] - [**2181-10-16**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
rectal bleed for 2 days.  On presentation, pt [**Name (NI) 4650**], stable Hct,
and supratherapeutic INR 3.8.  Rectal exam with gross blood in
rectal vault.  No other episodes of rectal bleeding in hospital.
Transfused 2 pRBCs and given vitamin K for colonoscopy. [**Last Name (un) **]
showed diverticuli.  Hct stable.  Patient was discharged without
anticoagulation after discussing risk of GI bleed, fall risk and
benefit of coumadin.  Was also diuresed while in hospital with
[**Hospital1 **] lasix (from home daily dose of lasix).  Discharged to
[**Location (un) 5481**] on [**2181-10-16**].
.
The patient was admitted on [**2181-10-17**] to [**Hospital3 **] after
episode of acute shortness of breath at [**Hospital1 1501**].  Per Patient Care
Referral form, pt found pale, unable to breath with oxygen
fluctuating between 60 and 70%, was on 2 L NC and then increased
to 5 L NC. Transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She was intubated for
this.  No documentation of DNR/DNI was with her at OSH.  CXR
showed pulmonary edema. Given lasix IV but limited by
hypotension this AM to SBP 70s.  Gave 200 cc IVF bolus ---> SBP
110.  Troponins now 0.04 --> 0.29 --> 0.38 (cutoff 0.5). EKG
initially in atrial fibrillation in ED and given cardizem x 1
with conversion to NSR. EKG this AM without ischemic changes [**Name8 (MD) **]
MD.  Bedside echo was ordered, but no report yet. Cardiology
consulted and believed may be due to ischemia but hesitant to
anticoagulate due to recent GI bleed. Noted to have leukocytosis
that has been trending up to 18,000 today. Pt was cultured and
placed on zosyn and vancomycin for broad coverage.  Noted to
have a UTI also.  Attempted CPAP trial this morning, but she
failed by report from MD.
.
Currently, pt is sedated and intubated.
.
ROS: Cannot obtain as intubated and sedated.

MICROBIOLOGY: None.
.
STUDIES:
OSH EKG [**10-17**]: atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities
.
OSH PCXR [**10-17**]: R pleural effusion, pulmonary edema.  Suggest CHF
or volume overload.
.
CXR (my read): slightly congested pulm vasculature, R pleural
effusion, no overt infiltrate.
.
EKG: NSR at 80 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no Q waves
.
TTE [**2181-8-28**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-26**],
pleural effusions are new. The other findings are similar.

CXR - PORTABLE CHEST, [**2181-10-21**]
FINDINGS: Pulmonary vascularity appears engorged, but there is
no overt
evidence of pulmonary edema. Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural
effusions
are again demonstrated with adjacent areas of basilar
atelectasis. Interval removal of endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. F with diastolic CHF (EF 55% on [**9-2**] echo), recent PE on
[**2-/2181**], recent GI bleeding attributed to colon diverticuli seen
on colonoscopy during recent [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization in [**Month (only) **]
[**2181**], transferred from OSH ([**Hospital1 **]) with respiratory failure
attributed to flash pulmonary edema.

# Acute Respiratory Failure/Flash Pulmonary Edema:  She required
intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of
flash pulmonary edema.  She was diuresed aggressively and
extubated.  She was also managed with a lasix gtt, nitro gtt and
labetolol.  Her blood pressure medications were titrated and
blood pressure was well controlled on captopril and metoprolol.
Her lasix was restarted at a lower dose after the acute
decompensation but will likely need uptitration of this
medication.

# Acute Renal Failure: She had ARF likely in the setting of
diuresis.  Her creatinine returned to her baseline of 0.9-1.0.

# CAD/diastolic heart failure:  She had no evidence of acute
events and was continued on a beta blocker, aspirin, statin,
beta blocker and aceI.  Her lasix was restarted at a lower dose
after the acute decompensation in her respiratory status but she
will likely need uptitration of this medication (was on las
