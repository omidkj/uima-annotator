   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2121-10-28**] for elective bronchoscopy
and stent removal. He was taken to the OR and tolerated the
procedure well. He was intubated in the OR, and remained
intubated in the TSICU d/t tracheal swelling from manipulation
and for  planned further bronchoscopy for additional stent
removal. While in the TSICU, he was taken back to the OR for
multiple bronchoscopies and stent fragment retrievals on [**12-17**], [**11-3**], and [**11-6**]. On [**11-6**], a tracheostomy was placed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as a temporizing measure for the tracheobroncial
malacia d/t tracheobronchomegally. The patient had a sputum
culture that grew serratia, moraxella and psuedomonas and he was
started on vanco and Zosyn. He remained afebrile while in the
TSICU.

He was transferred to the floor on [**11-7**].

On [**11-10**] he had an episode of  desaturation into the low 80s.
His saturation returned to [**Location 213**] after suctioning of his trach,
and he was considered stable at that time. Placed on RTC
mucolytics w/ no further episodes.

Fever: on [**11-10**] he spiked a fever to 102.2, WBC ^ 23.8. Blood,
urine, and sputum cultures were sent at that time. ID was
consulted and zosyn was changed to meropenum based on
sensitivity data. vanco was continued.
[**11-11**] WBC 19.7
[**11-12**] WBC 18.7, temp 101.
[**11-14**] WBC 10.2, afebrile. vamco d/c'd [**11-13**]. On meropemum for
total of 14 days- course to be completed on [**2121-11-25**].
