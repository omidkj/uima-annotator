Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
coronary artery disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization, coronary angiogram
emergent coronary artery bypass grafts x 4
(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM1,SVG-OM2,SVG-RCA) [**2191-10-11**]

History of Present Illness:
This 67 white female with recent chest pain, jaw tightness
presented to an outside hospital where catheterization showed
3vessel CAD. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention.  In
the cath lab, the circumflex artery was
dissected.  She is referred for emergent revascularization.  She
is not a
candidate for IABP given her peripheral vascular disease.  She
is
hemodynamically stable.

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. No definite valvular pathology or pathologic
flow identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer she was taken to the cath lab for
percutaneous coronary intervention.  The circumflex was
dissected and she remained hemodynamically stable.  Given her
peripheral vascular disease an IABP was not an option and
emergent operation was undertaken. She tolerated the surgery
well, weaned from bypass on NeoSynephrine, Propofol and
Nitroglycerin.  She awoke intact, was weaned from the ventilator
and extubated.

Beta blockade and diuresis were instituted. Pressors had been
weaned. Physical Therapy was consulted for mobility and
strength. Plavix was continued for her peripheral vascular
disease.  A stay at rehab was recommended for further recovery.
She was begun on Combivent for her dyspnea and diuresis was
continued as her CXR appeared to demonstrate fluid overload
despite her weight at preop level. She felt better with diuresis
and brochodilators.

On [**10-18**] she was transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) 18348**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] at [**Hospital3 **].
Arrangements were made for follow up.
