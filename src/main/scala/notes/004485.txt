History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23239**] is a 40 year-old female with OSA/OHVS, COPD, CHF,
morbid obesity with tracheostomy since [**2116-2-8**].  Admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-16**] for hemoptysis [**1-11**] viral tracheitis.  Patient
underwent f/u bronchoscopy last month which was normal except
for mild-mod TM.  Her OSH pulmonologist attempted to decannulate
her a few weeks ago and she developed stridor.  The Trach was
replaced and she underwent a bronch which demonstrated tracheal
stenosis. Patient was admitted [**2116-8-17**] for flex bronch and
evaluation of tracheal stenosis. She was s/p
decannulation and t-tube placement [**2116-8-31**].  Initially improved
dyspnea and voice quality w/ t-tube capped, however, last
Thursday developed acute SOB and inability to vocalize and
required admission to [**Hospital **] med center.  Bronch demonstrated
significant subglottic stenosis (proximal to t-tube) and no
mucus
plugging.  Now unable to cap t-tube w/o dyspnea and loss of
voice. Her 02 saturations remain in the mid 90's and with mucus
plugs upon admission requiring immediate suctioning.  She is
being admitted for bronchoscopy and T-tube removal with trach
placement.

CXR [**2116-9-13**]
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right upper lobe
collapse is
persistent. Aeration of the right mid lung zone is improved.
There are low
lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.

CT airway [**2116-9-10**] IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal study as described in the body of the report.
2. No significant change in degree of tracheomalacia.
Significant
bronchomalacia. Air trapping.
3. Rounded opacity in the right lower lobe might represent area
of rounded
atelectasis but given its change in its appearance compared to
the prior study evaluation with PET-CT might be appropriate to
exclude neoplasm.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was re-admitted for evaluation of subglottic
stenosis. Upon arrival to the floor she required immediate
suctioned for a mucus plug. Her sats during the night remained
in the high 90's and breath sounds with scattered wheezes.  On
[**2116-9-10**] she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which revealed
moderate amount of secretions in the first limb which were
suctioned. The proximal limb of the T-tube
thick mucous secretions were seen extensively occluding most of
the lumen of the T-tube. Several attempts were made to remove
this but it was not successful because of the sticky nature of
the mucous plugging. On [**2116-9-11**] she was taken to the operating
room for Flexible bronchoscopy, Trachea tube removal,
Tracheostomy tube Portex #6, cuffless, placement and Tracheal
wash.  While in the PACU she developed respiratory distress
secondary to tracheal tube displacement with saturations in the
70's. The trach was immediately replaced, she was suctioned and
her sats increased to the 90's.  She continued to develop mucus
plugging and was taken back to the operating room for Removal of
tracheostomy tube, Placement of tracheostomy tube, Portex #8
uncuffed and Flexible bronchoscopy.  She was transferred to the
SICU for frequent pulmonary toilet and suctioned with vent
support. Her saturation remained in the 87-90s tachypneic
w/respiratory rate in the 40's and low tidal volumes requiring
more pressure support. On [**2116-9-12**] her white count was elevated
likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.  Her CXR showed left
lower lobe opacity and multifocal right atelectasis. She was
started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn and diuresed. A sputum
specimen was sent and grew STAPH AUREUS COAG +.  Over the next
few days she continued to do well and was weaned to trach mask
with sats above 90%.  On [**2116-9-15**] her trach was down sized to a
#6 cuffed.  Her saturations remained above 90%, respiratory rate
20's, able to expectorate own secretions, lung sounds clear. She
was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Manor in stable condition on a
diabetic diet.  She will follow-up with her PCP & pulmonologist
as an outpatient.
