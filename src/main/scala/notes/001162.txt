History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old female with past medical history
significant for Bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, multiple suicide attempts, h/o alcoholism, PTSD, COPD
on home O2, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy who presented to ED via
EMS after being found disoriented and wandering around her
housing complex barefoot with 1 empty and 1 full bottle of
clonazepam. She had 1 empty bottle of clonazepam filled [**7-14**]
with 0 tablets and a 2nd bottle of clonazepam filled with 39
pills (filled yesterday, so 21 tablets gone). She is supposed to
be taking up to 4 pills per day per [**Month/Year (2) **]. Patient states on
further history that she dropped "a bunch" of her clonazepam
tablets fell on the floor. She repeatedly denies any overdose.

She was initially very agitated and unable to give detailed
history. She also c/o pain all over her body pain and was
slightly tremulous at rest. Per patient, she also complained of
having recently run out of her home 02 a "few days ago" which
she takes for history of COPD.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 100.1, HR 83, BP 116/86,
RR 20 and O2 sat 99% 2L . She denied fevers, cough, dysuria or
abdominal pains on ROS in ED. She was a limited historian
however, and difficult as she refused FSG and refused attempt at
LP. Despite negative ETOH level she claims she has been drinking
a bottle of wine daily but also made several confusing
statements about timeline of her ETOH use so it is unclear if
she actively using alcohol now. CT head and CXR in ED were both
negative. EKG also showed normal intervals, NSR with no
concerning ST changes. While in ED, she received 1.5L NS IVFs.
2mg Ativan, 5mg Haldol and 50mg Benadryl for agitation which
slowly improved through the afternoon. She was also given 1x
dose 2g Ceftriaxone to cover possible urinary source and
meningitis per ED resident although given no headaches and
normal neuro exam there was limited concern for meningitis as
her AMS improved in the ED.

Given notice of recent TSH of 50 that has been untreated an
endocrinology consult was also called from [**Location **] and patient was
given 200mcg IV levothyroxine. Per report, endocrinology service
did not feel she was in overt myxedema coma but felt her
metabolism of recent drugs likely impaired given her severe
hypothyroidism.

On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial vital signs were: T 99.3F, BP
107/58, HR 77, RR 22 and O2 sat 98% on 2L NC. She seemed mildly
confused and very easily agitated and refused to answer multiple
questions. In no apparent distress.

ECG [**2137-7-28**]: Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, likely left
ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-4-6**] findings are
similar.

[**2137-7-28**] CXR PORTABLE AP:
INDICATION: 60-year-old female with altered mental status.

COMPARISON: [**2137-6-5**].

CHEST, AP: The lungs are clear, other than some mild
retrocardiac
atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. There are no pleural effusions. No acute fractures are
identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2137-7-28**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large areas
of edema,
large masses or mass effect. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
is preserved.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. Mucosal thickening/mucous retention cyst is noted
within the left maxillary sinus.  Otherwise, the visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Visualized
soft tissues of the orbits and nasopharynx are within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
60yo F with h/o bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, PTSD, fibromyalgia, multiple suicide attempts, COPD on
home O2, cervical neck fracture (in chronic brace), and severe
OA who presents with altered mental status after questionable
overdose.

Questionable Overdose/AMS: Head CT in ED was within normal
limits and neuro exam also non-focal. No evidence of infection,
the patient also admits to ETOH so her initial presentation
could have been withdrawal and seizure but no w
