received 2 U PRBC transfusions. His bleeding persisted in small
amounts and then he put out 200 cc of blood at 3 pm and 300 cc
at 6:30 pm on [**2152-5-30**]. A tagged RBC scan on [**5-31**] revealed

.
Angio [**6-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Selective and superselective celiac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
arteriograms demonstrated no active bleeding. No intervention
was performed.
.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**]:
There was blood throughout colon but given fresh blood seen in
the sigmoid colon the source of the bleed is most likely a left
sided diverticulum.
Continue to follow serial hcts and transfuse for goal hct> 30
If bleeding continues will need to consider L hemicolectomy. If
bleeding becomes brisk would do repeat angiography
.
Tagged RBC scan [**6-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No active GI bleeding at the time of study

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 M w h/o DM, HTN who p/w BRBPR, likely [**2-3**] to diverticula
with no source identified on colonoscopy or angio.
.
* GIB: The patient started having BRBPR on [**2152-5-28**].  Tagged RBC
scan at OSH showed bleeding in the distal colon and his hct
trended down from 30 to 25 there per report. He was transfused
two units of PRBCs and transferred here.  Upon arrival patient
was hemodynamically stable, with stable hct. Overnight he
started having melena and his hct began to trend down.  He was
urgently taken to angiography, but no mesenteric source of bleed
was identified. On [**6-2**] he had a colonoscopy which showed
multiple diverticula, which were thought to be the source of
bleeding, but the source of the bleed was not able to be
identified. The patient continued to have melanotic stools and
required a total of ~ 10 units of PRBCs over 4-5 days.  Surgery
was consulted and intially were going to perform a left
hemicolectomy. A tagged RBC scan was done to help dilineate
where the bleeding was, but the scan did not show a source for
bleeding. An abdominal CT was also done to r/o RP bleed, after
angio in the setting of dropping hcts. The CT was negative for
bleed. The patient stopped having melanotic stools on [**2152-6-5**], so
he was not taken to surgery. His hct remained stable and he did
not require further transfusions, and was subsequently
transferred to the floor. While on the floor, the patient
required no further transfusions. His diet was advacned to a
regular diet. His hematocrit remained stable.
.
*HTN: The patient had a histpry of HTN and SBPs during his
admission here were as high as 190s.  His BP meds were initially
held b/c of concern for bleeding. However, his pressures were
significantly elevated, so he was started on a small dose of an
ACEI. When his bleeding stopped his ACEI was uptitrated and a BB
was added to his regimen, with better control of his pressures.
He was also treated with PRN hydralazine. While on the floor the
patient's blood pressure was stable on captopril and lopressor.
He is to be discharged on an approximately equivalent dose of
Toprol and lisinopril.
.
* DM: The patient has a history of DM.  His oral hypoglycemics
were held at admission and he was covered with a RISS and had
QID FS. Fingersticks had been stable, but started to rise when
he started TPN. The insulin in his TPN was increased at that
time. After transfer to the floor the patient's TPN was
discontinued as he was able to tolerate a regular diet. His home
oral hypoglycemics were started the day prior to discharge.
.
*Thrombocytopenia: The patient's plts trended down initially
during his admission this was thought to be dilutional.  His
platelets slowly began to trend up during his stay and remained
stable.
.
* F/E/N: The patient received IVF when he was actively bleeding
and was kept NPO. He was started on TPN on [**6-7**].  He was advanced
to a clear liquid diet on [**6-9**]. His TPN was discontinued as he
was able to tolerate a regular diet.
.
* PPx: The patient was placed on pneumoboots. Initially he was
on no bowel regimen because of active bleed. Docusate was added
because of constipation. Though initially on a PPI, this was
discontinued because no evidence of UGI bleed.
.
* Code status: Full
.
* Comm: [**Name (NI) **] communication was kept with the patient's
sister-in law-[**Name (NI) 11556**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 67374**]. Her husband [**Name (NI) **]
was contact[**Name (NI) **] for all necessary consents.
