and gout presenting today with fevers. He was in his USOH until
yesterday afternoon after his HD session when he developed a
[**First Name3 (LF) **] to 102.5 while awaiting his ride home. He took tylenol and
contact[**Name (NI) **] his physician who recommended [**Name9 (PRE) **] evaluation but he
deferred until today. He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2184-3-4**] after an admission for placement of a tunnelled HD
catheter and had been doing well. He notes fatigue but denied

Studies:
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2184-3-17**]
FINDINGS: A right subclavian tunneled line is in standard
position. There is no evidence of infiltrate. The heart is
enlarged, but there is no evidence of volume overload or
pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2184-3-19**]
FINDINGS: No evidence of acute fracture or other bone
abnormality. There is extensive calcification of vascular
structures throughout the leg, ankle, and foot, suggesting
underlying diabetes. Small inferior calcaneal spur.
.
MR ANKLE W/O CONTRAST LEFT  [**2184-3-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Edema in the fat surrounding the Achilles with some mild
tendinosis of the Achilles tendon itself.
2. Mild degenerative change in the tibiotalar joint and mid
foot.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2184-3-23**]
 The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
inferior wall and moderate global hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened (especially the non-coronary cusp) but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations identified. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild/moderate mitral
regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
TEE (Complete) Done [**2184-3-31**]
The TEE probe could not be passed into the esophagus due to the
patients inability to comply with swallowing instructions and
strong gag reflex. Anesthesia support is suggested for the
future.
.
CT TORSO W/CONTRAST  [**2184-3-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of infectious source.
2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions are identified.
3. Sub-cm right thyroid nodule.
.
IN-111 WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY  [**2184-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: No scintigraphic evidence for a focal site of
infection.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-3-31**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
81M Cantonese speaking PMH of ESRD, DM2, Afib on coumadin, and
CAD presenting after an episode of [**Month/Day/Year **] to 102.5 following
[**Month/Day/Year 13241**].
.
# [**Month/Day/Year **] of unknown origin:  Infection was a concern as pt is
chronically on steroids for gout.  Pt initially spiked fevers
with dialysis, and a line or line pocket infection was suspected
and he was started on vancomycin.  However, bcxs prior to
initiation of antibiotics as well as subsequent blood cxs and HD
catheter tip culture were all negative. HD line was removed [**3-20**]
but pt continued to spike fevers.  Vancomycin was discontinued
for suspected drug [**Month/Day (1) **]; however, fevers continued.  The Renal
team also tried multiple dialysis membranes for concern of
dialysis membrane reaction; however, pt continued to spike.  He
initially complained of L leg pain, and MRI of L ankle was
benign. Ultrasound of fistula did not show an abscess. ID was
consulted. The following studies were also sent and negative:
HBV VL, CMV VL, monospot, HIV, and strongyloides. CT torso did
not show obvious source of infection.  He had an TTE that did
not show evidence of endocarditis, and TEE was attempted but the
probe could not be passed through the oropharynx.  Tagged WBC
scan was neg.  His methylprednisolone was even tapered to reveal
a possible infectious source.  Oncologic causes were also
considered.  He had slightly elevated LDH but had pan-scan did
not show any pathologic adenopathy to suggest lymphoma. SPEP was
without monoclonal spike.  Pt's family deferred a bone marrow
