Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 yo woman admitted to the Urology service
for management of urosepsis.  She was doing well on IV
antibiotics.  On the day before anticipated discharge, a midline
catheter was placed and one hour later she was found on the
ground, unresponsive and without a pulse.  A code was called and
she was thought to be in PEA arrest.  After chest compressions,
intubation, and three shocks, she regained a pulse in sinus
tachycardia.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Echo showed
severe LV akinesis.  A CTA ruled out PE.  Pt developed myoclonus
secondary to anoxic brain injury.  A head CT three days later
showed cerebral edema and herniation.  At this point, her family
decided to withdraw care.  She died comfortably on [**2127-5-4**].

The cause of Ms. [**Known lastname 22033**] unexpected and untimely death is not
clear.  An air emboli was considered, but the midline catheter
was placed about an hour before her unresponsiveness, the timing
of which is too long for air emboli.  Also, there was no
thrombus or air on CTA.  Our best formulation is that her
cardiac arrest may somehow be related to her prior cardiac
disease. She has had an ~18 year history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrilliation. She was started on Profathenone, Diltiazem, and
Toprol at [**Hospital1 756**] on [**3-18**], and was discharged with
prescriptions for these medications on [**3-20**]. However,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was not taking these medications as an outpatient,
and did not inform her doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 **] that these
medications were recommended to her. As a result, these
medications were not restarted at [**Hospital3 **].  It was also
possible, as we discussed with the family, that Ms. [**Known lastname **] had
post-partum cardiomyopathy given her echocardiogram findings,
perhaps predisposing to a dysrhythmia.  However, cardiomyopathy
was not noted on autopsy, but rather a massive LV infarct that
may have been secondary to a primary event that remains unclear.
