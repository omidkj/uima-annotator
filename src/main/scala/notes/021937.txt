Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical service and an NG tube
was placed for decompression. A CT scan showed signs of a
complete obstruction with some loops of small bowel which had
some retained delayed intravenous contrast suggesting some sort
of vascular compromise. She was taken to the operating room for
an exploratory laparotomy and approximately 3 feet of small
bowel was resected (see op note for details). Intraoperatively,
the patient had hypotension requiring pressors. Postoperatively,
she was transferred, still extubated, to the SICU and was
vigorously resuscitated. The patient was extubated on post op
day 3. The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on
post op day 5. She remained NPO awaiting return of bowel
function. The morning of post op day 6, the patient developed a
rapid heart rate (160-180), hypotension, and diaphoresis. She
was immediately resuscitated and transferred to the SICU. EKG
showed A-fib with rapid ventricular response. She was
cardioverted with Amiodarone after which she remained in sinus
rhythm with a normal blood pressure. Anticoagulation was
initiated with a heparin drip and Coumadin, aspirin and
Diltiazem were also started. The patient began passing flatus on
post op day 8 and was given a diet of clear liquids. She
continued to do well and was transferred back to the floor on
post op day 10. Her psychiatric medications were restarted on
post op day 10. She was deemed ready for discharge to
rehabilitation on post op day 14. She was discharged on Lovenox
until a therapeutic INR is reached on warfarin.
