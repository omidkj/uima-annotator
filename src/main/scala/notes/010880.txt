Admission Date:  [**2184-3-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2184-4-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2147-3-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36 year old Caucasian
male with no past medical history who presents with a one
week history of subjective fevers, chills, and aching bones.
The patient was in his usual state of health until
approximately ten days prior to admission when he had several
alcoholic drinks and lost consciousness.  One and a half days
later the patient developed a sudden onset of chills and
rigors and noted that he had to turn the heat up in his
apartment to stay warm.  The patient subsequently developed
arthralgias/myalgias with bony aches and pains.  The patient
then developed a cough he describes as dry, productive of red
bloody mucous.  The patient also endorses an episode of
emesis, nonbloody as well as nonbloody diarrhea with
abdominal pain.  The patient saw his primary care physician
the following day and was diagnosed with a viral syndrome and
prescribed relaxants for right-sided back pain.  The patient
continued to have fevers, chills and a slight dry cough but
on the day prior to admission felt short of breath and called
his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] primary care physician
encouraged the patient to present to the Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked one to three packs per
day for 20 years, but quit three years ago.  He currently
smokes two cigars per day.  The patient drinks 12 beers per
week, at least one per day.  The patient is originally from
[**Location (un) 311**] and came to the United States three years ago.  He is
currently in a monogamous relationship with his girlfriend
and denies any history of illicit drug use or male sexual
partners.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination temperature
was 98, blood pressure 100/60,heart rate 120, respirations
44, 94% on 6 liters.  General:  The patient appears to be in
moderate respiratory distress and is unable to speak in full
sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Dry
mucous membranes with cracked lips.  Neck:  No evidence of
lymphadenopathy, no jugulovenous distension.  Lungs:
Decreased breath sounds halfway up with dullness to
percussion in the right lung field.  There is also evidence
of bronchial breath sounds in the right lung field, halfway
up to the apex and occasionally in the left lung fields, the
patient has increased work of accessory muscles.  Cardiac:
Hyperdynamic heart sounds, tachycardiac, regular rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen:  Normoactive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:
Palmar erythema, mild clubbing of the digits in the upper
extremities, no evidence of edema, cords or calf tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 18.2, hematocrit
40.4, platelets 295, MCV 48% neutrophils, 49% bands, 2%
lymphocytes, 1% monocytes.  Chemistries, sodium 131,
potassium 4.1, chloride 93, bicarbonate 20, BUN 37,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 118, and anion gap of 18, lactate
2.9.  Arterial blood gases 7.39/37/82.

Chest x-ray:  No evidence of cardiomegaly, there is a
wedge-shaped area of the right middle lung and extensive
interstitial opacification of the right lung field, no
evidence of pneumothorax.  Chest computerized tomography
scan:  Extensive consolidation of the entire right lung with
few areas of aeration, small subpulmonic pleural effusion, no
empyema, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypoxia with respiratory distress - The
patient was initially transferred to the General Medicine
[**Hospital1 **] from the Emergency Department and was initially covered
with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  The patient was
adequately oxygenated by nasal cannula but over the night of
admission became increasingly hypoxic with use of accessory
muscles and increased work of breathing.  The MICU team was
consulted and the patient was transferred to the MICU for an
hypoxic respiratory distress.  Over the patient's first day
in the MICU he continued to have increasing respiratory
distress and during a short period of chest physical therapy
was noted to desaturate down to 70%.  Given this desaturation
as well as tachypnea to the 40s and 50s, the patient was
urgently intubated by Anesthesia and placed on assist control
ventilation on [**2184-3-23**].  The patient tolerated assist
control ventilation but required high levels of sedation,
given occasional agitation and biting on the endotracheal
tube.  His FIO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure were
titrated down as tolerated and the patient had increasing
oxygenation and ventilation suggested by frequent arterial
blood gas measurements.  The patient's sedation was
eventually able to be weaned down with occasional use of
Haldol for confusion and agitation, and the patient was given
several spontaneous breathing trials which he tolerated quite
successfully.

2.  Septic shock - The patient was noted to have a blood
pressure that dipped to the 90s/40s with some evidence of
end-organ hyperperfusion/failure and was initiated on
goal-directed therapy for presumed septic shock.  The
patient's Apache score was calculated at 19 and a trial
Xigris was considered.  However, a lumbar puncture was
performed and as Xigris must be started 12 hours after lumbar
puncture the patient missed the window for Xigris therapy.
The patient was given a seven day course of Hydrocortisone
and Flutricortisone for relative adrenal insufficiency.  He
was kept on low dose fluids and remained normotensive and
hemodynamically stable throughout his MICU stay.

3.  Pneumonia - The patient had four out of four blood
culture bottles grow Streptococcus pneumonia, resistant to
Tetracycline and Erythromycin, and sensitive to Ceftriaxone,
Penicillin and Bactrim.  The Infectious Disease Consult
Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they recommended switching to
Penicillin as it is bactericidal and the treatment of choice
for Streptococcus pneumonia.  The patient will receive a 21
day course for his necrotizing Streptococcus pneumonia.  As
noted above, the patient's respiratory status improved
dramatically throughout his MICU stay with improved aeration
on lung examination and improved consolidation on
radiographic imaging.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was
started on tube feeds which he tolerated at goal.  His
electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.  The
patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis on admission
to the MICU, likely secondary to septic shock and
overwhelming Streptococcal septicemia.  In addition, the
patient was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis likely
secondary to aggressive diuresis in the setting after his
aggressive volume resuscitation.  The patient was given
[**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel for his metabolic alkalosis which eventually
resolved.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as well as her
discharge medications and follow up plans will be dictated at
the time of discharge from this hospital.
