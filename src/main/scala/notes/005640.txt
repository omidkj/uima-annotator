Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of two drug eluting
stents to the mid LAD

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o gentleman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
dyslipidemia, PAF woke up this morning around 3:45 AM with
severe SSCP with radiation to back.  Patient had associated
diaphoresis, N and vomitting.  He walked across to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
and was found to be in anterior STEMI.  He was given ASA 324mg,
Plavix 600mg, Integrillin bolus, Heparin 7500u and a sl nitro
with no change in symptom.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**]
cath lab for emergent cardiac catheterization.  On arrival he
was awake and alert, and chest pain free.  Integrillin gtt was
started.
.
During cardiac catheterization he was found to have mid LAD
lesion and recieved Xience x 2.  LV gram showed LVEF of 45% with
moderate anterolateral hypokinesis.  His angioseal was
unsuccessful and was placed on clamp.  Patient was transfered to
CCU for further management.
.
On arrival patient was asymptomatic.  On review of systems, he
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2118-10-3**] Cardiac catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The RCA had
minimal
irregularities but was free from angiographically significant
disease.
The LMCA was normal without flow limiting stenosis.  The LAD was
patent
proximally, and had a 95% mid vessel stenosis just prior to a
large
diagonal branch.  The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities but
was
from from angiographically significant disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressure with LVEDP of 19mmHg.  The central aortic pressure was
normotensive at 132/81 mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.  The
LVEF
was calculated to be 45% with moderate anterolateral
hypokinesis.
4. Successful PTCA and placement of overlapping 3.0x18mm and
3.0x8mm
Xience drug-eluting stents were performed in the mid-LAD.  The
proximal
region of the stent was post-dilated using a 3.25mm diameter
balloon.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection,
and no
residual stenosis.  IVUS showed well-expanded stent coverage of
the
lesion, no apparent dissection.  (See PTCA comments.)
5. Closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy using a 6 Fr
Angioseal STS device was not successful.  Manual and mechanical
compression were applied for hemostasis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Placement of drug-eluting stents in the mid-LAD.

[**2118-10-4**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior, mid anteroseptal akinesis/hypokinesis
although views are technically suboptimal for assessment of
regional wall motion (estimated ejection fraction ?45%). Cannot
assess for apical thrombus. There is a moderate resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old man with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
presented with anterior STEMI treated with PCI to the mid LAD.
.
# CORONARIES: Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction. Two
drug eluting stents (Xience) were placed in the mid LAD.
Integrilin was given perioperatively. The patient was started
and will be continued on the following medications: Aspirin 325
daily, Plavix 75 daily, Metoprolol 100mg three times per day,
Lisinopril 10 daily, Atorvastatin 80 daily.
.
# PUMP: LV gram showed anterior wall hypokinesis with an
ejection fraction of 45%. Echo on discharge showed estimated EF
of 45% and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with anterior, mid anteroseptal akinesis/hypokinesis (poor
study). He had no signs of CHF during his hospital stay. He is
currently on an ACE.
Repeat ECHO should be done in 6 weeks to assess for wall motion
changes.
.
# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation after knee replacement in the past. During the
admission he was in sinus rhythm. His CHADS score is 3 so he
should consider anticoagulation with warfarin as an outpatient.
We deferred beginning warfarin as an inpatient given the failed
angioseal on his femoral site and will treat with Aspirin and
Plavix in the interim.
.
# FEMORAL ECCHYMOSIS: Failed angioseal at the catheterization
site. No evidence of hematoma. Hematocrit was stable during the
admission.
.
# DIABETES: Pt was on glyburide and metformin as an outpatient.
Changed to sliding scale insulin as an inpatient. Sugars well
controlled. Restarted on oral hypoglycemics at discharge.
.
# PROPHYLAXIS: On Heparin 5000u SQ tid as an inpatient.

Medications on Admission:
Metoprolol 50 mg po TID
Lisinopril 5 mg
