Studies:
.
Echo [**2117-12-18**] - Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
CT Head [**2117-12-18**] - No acute intracranial process. Ethmoidal
and left maxillary fluid.
.
CTA Chest [**2117-12-18**] - Left greater than right lower lobe
opacities most suggestive of substantial atelectasis. No
evidence for pulmonary embolism.
.
CT Chest [**2117-12-25**] - Bilateral pulmonary emboli with embolus
straddling the left main pulmonary artery. Worsening opacity
within the lower lobes representing a combination of atelectasis
and consolidation. Samll bilateral pleural effusions.
.
RUQ US [**2117-12-28**] - Minimally distended gallbladder without
gallstones or evidence for cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 60973**] is a 53 year-old male with PMH of schizophrenia,
smoking and COPD who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2117-12-18**] for acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure
attributed to pneumonia. MICU course complicated by bilateral
PE.
.
## H. flu Pneumonia / Respiratory failure: The patient initially
presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital with hypoxia and somnelence.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] a trial of bipap but became acutely agitated. Initial
ABG showed 7.30/76/55. The patient was intubated and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 18**], Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 60973**] was treated with steorids and
nebulizers for a potential COPD exacerbation and CTX, azithro
for CAP. Initial CT chest was negative for PE. Over the
subsequent days the patient was noted to be requiring high
levels of PEEP to maintain oxygen saturations.  Diuresed without
significant improvement. ECHO with bubble study was
unremarkable. The patient grew H. Flu sensitive to ampicillin
from his sputum and was changed to Ampicillin monotherapy. All
other cultures remained negative. On [**2117-12-23**], the patient was
noted to be having desaturations and PEEP was increased. Started
spiking persistent fevers >101. CXR unchanged but was broadened
empirically to Cefepime and Vancomycin for hospital-acquired
pneumonia coverage. Fever work-up included HIV, [**Doctor First Name **], HBV, HCV,
Lyme, Monospot- all of which were negative. Given lack of
progress and continued hypoxia and fevers, the patient [**Doctor First Name 1834**]
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis on [**2117-12-25**], which revealed multiple
pulmonary embolisms. Started on a heparin drip. Soon after the
patient was noted to have a morbilliform drug rash and the
heparin was switched to argatroban/warfarin. Tobramycin was
added for continued fevers and concern for VAP. The patient's
drug rash worsened the following day, and Cefepime was switched
to Meropenem. The patient's antibiotic course was completed on
[**2117-12-31**] after which he remained afebrile. On [**2117-12-29**], the
patient was extubated but could not manage his secretions and
was re-intubated. Plan was for trach although on [**2118-1-1**], the
patient self-extubated. He was subsequently weaned to room air,
transferred to the floor, and has done extremely well from
respiratory standpoint. He is no longer on antibiotics.
.
## HIT/Pulmonary embolism: Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 60973**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] CTA on initial
evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**]. This was negative for PE. Was placed on
subcutaneous Heparin for DVT prophylaxis. On repeat CT scan on
[**2117-12-25**], multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli were noted. The
patient had no evidence of right heart strain. Initially started
on heparin drip although this was changed to argatroban/warfarin
due to a developing drug rash. Continued on Argatroban until
[**2117-12-30**] when he was switched to Lovenox for a planned trach.
A HIT Ab was sent and found to be positive. Given new PE and
thrombocytopenia, he most likely had Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. His INR was therapeutic (goal INR [**3-18**]) on
Warfarin prior to transfer out of ICU. He will have his INR
checked 3 times per week by VNA, which should be faxed to his
PMD, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 2358**], so that he can adjust the
Warfarin dose as needed.
.
## Agitation: He had agitation while in the ICU, which was
likely due to ICU delirium and being intubated. He required a
fair amount of sedation on the vent. He responded to PRN Haldol
and his home Psychiatry meds. His agitation resolved after he
was extubated.
.
## Transaminitis: AST and [**Hospital3 **] rose during the admission, which
was likely due to antibiotics given the time course. There was
no record of sustained hypotension to predispose to shock liver.
AP and TBili were not elevated, so cholestasis was unl
