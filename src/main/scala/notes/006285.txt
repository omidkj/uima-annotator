Chief Complaint:
motor vehicle accident with chest pain

cardiac catheterization with stent placement


History of Present Illness:
71M with h/o bipolar d/o, no known CAD who was the restrained
driver involved in a two car MVA at 8PM on [**2146-8-16**]. Pt does not
recall event but stated that he was wearing seatbelt and airbag
deployed. Pt c/o severe anterior and substernal CP at OSH which
was relieved w/ med rx. Noted to have bruising in lateral left
chest wall. ECG at [**Hospital3 **] had ST elevation anteriorly
(2-3mm, in leads V1-3 w/ hyperacute T waves). Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for trauma and MI. In [**Name (NI) **] pt received UFH 5000 Units bolus
plus 1000 Units/hr, IV lopressor 5 mg, ASA 600 mg PR. Bedside
echo revealed depressed LVEF.
CKs peaked at 4773 on admission.

HomeMeds: Lithium 300 mg qd

Past Medical History:
bipolar disorder, stable on lithium.

Physical Exam:
Gen: intubated, sedated man with obvious facial laceration and
ecchymosis
HEENT: ETT in place, trachea midline
Neck: difficult to assess JVD
Heart: S1S2 tachycardic, no murmurs appreciated
Lungs: loud upper airway sounds
Abdomen: obese, soft, nondistended
Extremities: no edema, 2+ pulses
Neuro: sedated

Pertinent Results:
-peak CK 4773 at admission on [**2146-8-17**];
-baseline creatinine in high 1 range, increased to low 2 range
this hospitalization but stable;
-total cholesterol 242, TG 605, HDL 30 on [**2146-8-16**]

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M w/ h/o bipolar d/o, no known CAD who was involved in a
two car MVA on [**2146-8-16**] intubated.  ECG on admission showed [**3-10**]
mm STE V1-V4 w/Q waves, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression II, III, AVF.
Emergently brought to cath lab which showed LM distal 40%, prox
LAD 80% stenosis, subtotal mid, diffuse dz distally; LCx: 2.0 mm
OM1 w/ 90% stenosis and 50% stenoses in long OM2; RCA
chronically occluded mid vessel w/collaterals from LCA. S/p
Hepacoat stent to prox LAD and mid LAD.  Wedge 28. PA diastolic
26.

1. CAD: s/p cath with stents x2 of prox LAD and mid LAD.  Pt
started on ASA, Plavix x1 month, s/p Integrilin x18 hrs. Started
metoprolol and titrated to 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] (changed to Toprol XL 150
qd prior to discharge). Lipids elevated including triglycerides
605.  Started Lipitor 80 mg qd, plan outpt follow-up.

2. CHF: elevated L-sided filling pressures at cath. Clinically
also overloaded initially. Echo ([**8-18**]) showed LV cavity
moderately dilated, LV syst fxn severely depressed with EF 20%;
severe hypokinesis of anterior free wall, interventricular
septum, and posterior wall; dyskinesis of the apex. Focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
2+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 29640**] which was switched to lisinopril 5 qd at
discharge.  Creatinine bumped slightly so spoke to PCP who will
check in [**2-8**] days after discharge. Pt was given lasix for
diuresis in hospital but stable without lasix x 2 days and
creatinine slightly increased as above so not discharged on
Lasix.  Plan outpt follow-up including renal checks.

3. Rhythm: plan outpatient follow-up with electrophysiology
clinic for evaluation regarding ICD given severe LV dysfxn.
Etiology of blackout prior to accident most likely massive MI,
which may have caused arrhythmia.  Stable on telemetry in
hospital.

4. Anticoagulation: on heparin due to anterior akinesis seen on
echo and started on coumadin.  INR close to therapeutic at
discharge, plan outpt follow-up with INR checks.

5. Trauma: from MVA. Spine was cleared by trauma surgery.
Plastic surgery sutured face laceration.  Given pain medications
as needed.

6. Bipolar d/o.  Pt's outpt lithium initially held peri-accident
but restarated & pt tolerated well.  Plan follow-up with outpt
psychiatrist.

7. Pulm. Pt was stable on ventilator & successfully extubated 1
day after admission.  Pt stable on room air for remainder of
hospital stay.  Pulm contusion likely contributing to initial
dyspnea.

8. Code status: Full.
