Allergies:
Codeine / Zofran

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for acute renal failure, nephrolithiasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
placement of left nephrostomy tube
cystoscopy

History of Present Illness:
70 y/o M with a PMHx of nephrolithiasis, COPD, UC, HTN who was
admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hosp on [**10-2**] for 3d of worsening L flank
pain. No f/chills. Able to take POs. An U/S showed 11mm calculus
in mid-portion of L kidney and 8mm in lower pole. Nml R kidney.
Evid of mild-mod hydronephrosis; creat elevated to 2.0. Made
NPO, placed on PCA which was weaned to Percocet PO prn. Foley
placed with initial hematuria now clearing.
.
Today, c/o dull discomfort in abd, not severe. +constipation
without BMs x4d c/b bloating. Tol POs. No CP, SOB, cough.

Shortly after admission, transferred to the ICU with the
following admit note: 70M PMH nephrolithiasis, COPD (FEV1 of
1.17 on continuous 2-2.5L O2 at home, UC, CRF (baseline
creatinine 1.5) who was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hosp on [**2178-10-2**] for
three-day history of worsening L flank pain and hematuria.  He
was found to have an 11mm calculus in mid-portion of L kidney
and 8mm in lower pole with mild-mod hydronephrosis.  Creatinine
as 2.4.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and has been
followed by Urology during admission.  The patient was not
believed to be a candidate for a surgical procedure given the
requirement of general anesthesia and intubation.  US-guided
percutaneous nephrostomy placement was attempted [**2178-10-7**] but
was unsuccessful.  Per report, during the procedure the
patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s after initiation of
propofol and was slow to improve despite 700cc NS bolus (not
well documented).  Radiology has suggested a CT-guided procedure
as the next step.
.
Since admission, the patient has triggered three times.  The
first was for AF with RVR responding to lopressor and diltiazem
with conversion to NSR.  The second and third were for anxiety,
hypoxia, and SVT, again responding to lopressor and diltiazem.
.
On transfer, the patient complains of left-sided flank pain.  He
states his breathing is at baseline.  He complains of
constipation.  He denies fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting.

Past Medical History:
1) COPD on 2L home O2 (FEV1 1.17L (35% pred) in [**2175**]),
steroid-dependent
2) HTN
3) UC
4) BPH
5) Nephrolithiasis
6) Stage III CKD Cr 1.5 thought due to recurrent nephrolithiasis

Imaging:
RENAL U.S.  [**2178-10-5**] 12:56 PM
IMPRESSION:
Moderate-sized left inter-to-lower pole collecting system
calculi with mild left-sided hydronephrosis. No distal
ureteral/bladder calculi could be identified, however, exam is
limited due to bladder decompression from decompressed Foley.
If outside imaging is available, comparison would be helpful.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-10-6**] 8:46 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Left proximal ureter obstructing stone with moderate
hydronephrosis and proximal ureter dilation.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Bladder stone
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-10-8**] 4:55 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. 1-cm left renal stone with 5-mm obstructing left ureteral
stone with mild hydronephrosis; perinephric fat stranding likely
due to recent intervention. No perinephric fluid collection or
bowel perforation.
2. Persistent mildly dilated large bowel proximally with gas and
liquid stool. Air bubbles along the dependent cecal and
ascending colon wall are most likely luminal but the possibility
of a component of pneumatosis cannot be completely excluded in
this patient with mechanical ventilation and sepsis.
3. Large urinary bladder stone.
4. Bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis and severe
bullous and centrilobular emphysema. Increased opacity in the
left lower lobe could be superimposed pneumonia.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-10-12**] 2:10 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumatosis.
2. Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Interval placement of percutaneous nephrostomy catheter, with a
left renal stone and two left ureteral stones. Large bladder
stone. Diffuse anasarca. Diverticulosis.
3. Bilateral effusion and atelectasis with consolidation in the
right lung base, unchanged.

ECHO Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
