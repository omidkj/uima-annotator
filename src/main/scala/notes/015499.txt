Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
88M PMH HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital ED where he
had been admitted for respiratory distress, s/p intubation by
EMS. Per his daughters, he was in his USOH, other than a URI
with mild cough, up until this afternoon, when in the evening he
called his daughter c/o acute onset shortness of breath. When
they found him, he appeared to have "facial swelling," felt
warm, and was struggling to breath. EMS arrived and intubated
him. Prior to this event, he reportedly had no F/C/NS, chest
pain or SOB. He was very active, and reportedly walked 2 miles
without difficulty 2 weeks ago.
*
In [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED, he was initially found to be hypertensive to
239/130. he was noted to be very agitated and was given
initially 4mg ativan IV, then succinylcholine 60mg IV. He was
then given tylenol 650mg, toradol 30mg, zosyn 3.375 IV. He
continued to be agitated, and was given 4mg ativan more, as well
as diprivan 20mg bolus then drip at 10mcg/kg/hr. ABG prior to
transfer 7.30/56/477.
.
On further review after extubation, he had noted a productive
cough x 2 days and wheezing. Also URI symptoms. Denies h/o
asthma or emphysema. No chest pain.

.
BLOOD CX: NO GROWTH TO DATE
.
EKG:
Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Q-T interval
prolongation.
Occasional ventricular ectopy. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECHO [**2188-3-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW CHEST [**2188-3-27**]: ETT tip is 4.3 cm above
the carina. NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm. There is
mild pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is
consistent with atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Note is made that
the right CP angle was not included on the film. There is a
suggestion of small left pleural effusion.
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2188-3-29**]:  There is a moderate
right pleural effusion and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion, simple in nature.  There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is a 1 mm
opacity along the inferior right major fissure, possibly
representing a tiny subpleural lymph node. No other nodular
opacities are visualized. The central airways are patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. There are
calcifications of the aortic valve, and coronary artery
calcifications. No lymph nodes within the axillae, mediastinum
or hila meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.  In
the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the visualized portions
of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands
are unremarkable.  The examination is not tailored for
evaluation of the structures, and assessment is limited without
IV contrast.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic
lesions.
Irregularity of the left scapula may be related to a remote
injury.
Coronal reformatted images were generated and confirmed the
described
findings.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate right pleural effusion and small-to-moderate left
pleural
effusion, simple in nature.  No pulmonary edema at the current
time.
2.  Calcifications of the coronary arteries, aorta and aortic
valve.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory failure: Suspect secondary to bronchospasm in the
setting of parainfluenza tracheobronchitis with perhaps an
initial component of CHF.  Patient was extubated on hospital day
# 3.  His bronchospasm was managed with combivent and flovent
inhalers.  He also received 5 days of levofloxacin for question
of bacterial superinfection.  Urine legionella and sputum
culture were unrevealing.  Patient received pneumovax prior to
discharge and was up to date on the influenza vaccine.  He was
stable on room air at the time of discharge without wheezing.
.
2) Left sided CHF: TTE showed EF >55%.  Creatinine bumped with
diuresis despite mild CHF noted on initial CXR.  I suspect the
failure was due to his underlying pulmonary process.  He
received initial diuresis in the ICU but this was not continued
given a rise in his creatinine.  On the day of discharge, he
appears euvolemic and his blood pressure is well controlled.
.
3) Acute rena
