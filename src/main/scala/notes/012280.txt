Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Referred for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stenting of the inominate artery intervention and right carotid
stenting


History of Present Illness:
50 year old female smoker with history of hypertension, COPD,
and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted to an outside
hospital with high grade bilateral ICA stenoses in the setting
of recent TIA symptoms, now transferred from [**Location (un) 11248**]
Hospital for cardiac catheterization.

She was admitted to [**Location (un) 11248**] [**Hospital3 **] after carotid
duplex studies revealed bilateral severe to critical ICA
stenosis, reportedly done for asymptomatic carotid bruits.
However, on further questioning she reported a history of [**3-30**]
minutes of right eye blindness in [**2165-5-25**] which resolved
spontaneously that she didn't tell anyone about.  She also
describes several episodes over the ensuing months of diminished
function of her left hand, including episodic numbness as well
as episodic weakness and clumsiness.  She had two of these
episodes just 1 week prior to admission.  She also tells me that
just yesterday at the outside hospital she had a period of right
eye "blurriness."

At [**Location (un) 11248**] she had a CT of her head which demonstrated an
old right parietofrontal cerebrovascular accident.  She was
started on IV heparin.  An MRA of the neck demonstrated probable
stenosis in the right brachiocephalic artery, high grade
stenoses in the proximal aspect of both internal carotid
arteries, irregularity in the proximal left subclavian artery,
and narrowing in the proximal right vertebral artery.  It was
felt that the patient should have an arch aortogram and
simultaneous cardiac catheterization to evaluate the coronary
anatomy and possible need for coronary artery bypass graft.
Given the complex combination of imaging and possible catheter
based operative interventions, it was felt that the patient
should be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On review of symptoms, she describes the episodes above.  She
denies any prior history of stroke, though as above, head CT
demonstrates a chronic versus subacute right parietofrontal
infarct, and she does seem to be having TIAs as above.  Denies
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, or myalgias.  She has chronic joint
pains.  She has a chronic cough, but denies hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.  She denies exertional buttock or calf pain, however her
legs do "ache" at the end of the day - she is on her feet all
day at work.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for occasional chest pain
for years, not associated with exertion.  She is on her feet all
day at work and never gets chest pain.  She does have chronic
dyspnea on exertion but denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema.  She has had intermittent palpitations
for years.  Denies syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1) ICA stenses, bilateral, as above.
2) Hypertension
3) Hypercholesterolemia
4) COPD and chronic bronchitis.  Current smoker of [**11-26**] packs per
day.
5) Prior substance abuse, none since [**2155**] when she underwent a
recovery program.  She used to abuse various substances
intranasally, and smokes crack.
6) Diverticulosis, status post hemi-colectomy in [**2160**].
7) Urinary frequency
8) Hip pain
9) Recent endometrial thermal ablation for dysfunctional uterine
bleeding.  Underwent simultaneous bladder suspension for
incontinence.

Cardiac Risk Factors: (- ) Diabetes, (+) Dyslipidemia, (+)
Hypertension

Cardiac History: None.

Percutaneous coronary intervention, not applicable.

Pacemaker/ICD, not applicable.


Social History:
Social history is significant for the presence of current
tobacco use, 1-2 packs per day. There is no history of alcohol
abuse.  She used IV cocaine in the past, but not in more than 10
years.  She used to smoke crack frequently, but has been clean
for 10 years.  Works at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and resides in the
[**Last Name (un) 72904**]-[**Hospital1 6930**] area with a significant other in a monogamous
relationship.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Her parents both had COPD.


Physical Exam:
T 97.1.  Blood pressure was 100/80 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse
was 78 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18
breaths/min, and she was 98% on room air. Generally the patient
was well developed, well nourished and well groomed. The patient
was oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.

There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with
JVP of 6 cm.  The carotid waveform was dminished and she had
bilateral carotid bruits.  There was no thyromegaly. The were no
chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.  The respirations
were not labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The
lungs were clear to ascultation bilaterally with normal breath
sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.

Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a [**11-30**]
systolic murmur at the LUSB.  There were no rubs, clicks or
gallops.

The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal or femoral bruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue
showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 1+  Femoral not palpable,  DP 2+   PT 2+, radial
not palpable.
Left:  Carotid 1+  Femoral not palpable,  DP 2+   PT 2+, radial
1+

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2166-3-24**]:  COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
single
branch vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery
had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The
LAD had
mild disease and a 70% stenosis in a small diagonal.  The LCX
had mild
disease.  The RCA was a very small caliber vessel.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately to severely

elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 26 mm Hg).
Systemic
arterial pressures were mildly elevated (aortic pressure 154/76
mm Hg)
and were approximately 60 mm Hg higher than her cuff pressure.
There
was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback of the
catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Peripheral angiography revealed severe great vessel disease.
 The
right innominate artery had a 90% proximal stenosis and the left

subclavian artery had an 80% stenosis.  No right renal artery
was
visualized and the left renal artery had a 30% stenosis.  There
was
diffuse aortic atherosclerotic plaquing with a significant
distal aortic
shelf.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel branch coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately to severely elevated left sided filling pressures.

3. Severe stenosis of the right innominate artery and left
subclavian
artery.
4. No angiographically apparent right renal artery.
5. Severe aortic atherosclerotic disease with a significant
shelf-like
plaque in the distal segment.
.
MRI/A Abd/pelvis/extr [**2166-3-25**]:
1. Oclusion of the right main renal artery with associated
marked atrophy of the right kidney.

2. Atherosclerotic plaque along the course of the infrarenal
aorta up to the aortic bifurcation, without aneurysm.

3. No evidence of in-flow or out-flow arterial vascular disease
involving the lower extremities.

4. Sludge and/or stones within the gallbladder.
