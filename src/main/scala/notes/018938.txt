History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 53917**] is a 74 year-old male with a history of CAD status
post 2-vessel CABG in [**2182**], status post porcine AVR for aortic
stenosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 30-35% on last echo,
chronic atrial fibrillation now off Coumadin following a GI
bleed, and a history of bilateral fibrothoraces status post
right thoracotomy and total lung decortication, with persistent
left fibrothorax, who presents with increased dyspnea on
exertion. Of note, he is scheduled for left-sided decortication
on [**11-4**]. He was also recently admitted at [**Hospital3 4107**] for
pneumonia, treated with antibiotics. Shortly thereafter, he was
admitted with an upper GI bleed, at which time his Coumadin was
discontinued ([**2185-9-17**]). An EGD was performed.
.
Since his last discharge in [**Month (only) **], he notes that he has been
experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion. He was placed on
home oxygen about one month ago, titrated from 2L/min to 3L/min
over the past week. He reports no dyspnea at rest, and claims
that he can only go up/down 3 stairs versus 1 flight 6 weeks
ago. He denies orthopnea, and reports stable use of 1 pillow. He
also denies PND. + LE edema since discharge, now improved versus
a few weeks ago. He reports a mild non-productive chronic cough.
No chest pain. No fever or chills. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] on [**10-26**],
who increased his Lasix from 20 [**Hospital1 **] to 40 [**Hospital1 **], but he only took
one dose prior to presentation.
.
In ED, T 98.6, HR 86, BP 100/58, RR 22, Sat 98% on 3L NC. A CXR
showed possible mild interstitial edema and a known left-sided
effusion. A CT chest was subsequently obtained, negative for PE
or dissection, but remarkable for a large stable left-sided
effusion. He was seen by thoracic surgery, who recommended
admission to medicine, with an impression of CHF.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD status post MI [**2167**], s/p PTCA [**2167**], s/p 2-vessel CABG in
[**12/2182**], with LIMA to LAd, SVG to OM1. Pre-CABG cath with distal
50% LMCA stenosis, proximal LAD 80% stenosis with diffuse mild
mid vessel plaquing, distal LAD wrapped around the apex. OM1 40%
stenosis at origin and 40% stenosis proximally. LCx had a 70%
stenosis after OM1, 80% stenosis before LPL and LPDA and 80%
stenosis between LPL and LPDA. RCA proximal 90%.
2. CHF, last echo [**2-/2184**] with EF 30-35%, 1+ AR, 2+ MR.
3. Aortic stenosis status post porcine AVR [**91**]/[**2182**].
4. Hypertension
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Chronic atrial fibrillation, Coumadin D/C'd [**2185-9-17**] [**2-3**] GI
bleed.
7. Bilateral fibrothoraces and history of recurrent pleural
effusions. Approximately 6 months after CABG/AVR, developed
right hemothorax, 6 unit bleed, and thoracentesis for over 3000
cc. Effusion reaccumulated on right, tapped again, complicated
by bleeding. Status post right right thoracoscopy with
evacuation of pleural clot and small thoracotomy with total
decortication of the right lung. Pleural biopsies benign, fluid
cytology benign. Has left fibrothorax, which has been followed,
but recently plan was to proceed with left-sided decortication.

8. Thrombocytopenia. He reportedly had a BM biopsy (done by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 4223**], but this report is unavailable. Treated with
Prednisone without improvement. Baseline platelets 75-100K.
9. Status post admission for UGI bleed [**9-/2185**], Coumadin D/C'd.



Social History:
Extensive smoking history, 1 pack a day since age 18, quit in
[**2167**]. Mild asbestos exposure while removing a boiler. He worked
in the shipyards for 1 year as a carpenter. He lives with his
wife. They have 4 children; his daughter is a nurse.

CXR: IMPRESSION:  Stable large left pleural effusion with
adjacent atelectasis.  Question mild superimposed edema versus
technique.
.
ECHO [**10-28**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall  motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-2-19**],
left ventricular systolic function appears similar (was
underestimated on prior report). Tricuspid regurgitation is now
more prominent. Mitral regurgitation is similar.

CTA Chest: [**10-28**]
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple
mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which are pathologically
enlarged, including a prevascular node measuring 12 mm in
shortest diameter seen on series 3, image 39, previously 8 mm in
diameter.  There are enlarged pretracheal nodes that today
measure 8 and 9 mm respectively seen on series 3, image 31,
previously 6 and 7 mm respectively.  There is no hilar or
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There are a few areas of
subpleural linear nodular thickening likely representing
residual pleural fluid.  There is no appreciable effusion on the
right, significantly improved compared to prior study.  There is
