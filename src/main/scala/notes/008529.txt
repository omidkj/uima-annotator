Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachael intubation [**2202-9-21**] - [**2202-9-25**]

History of Present Illness:
69 year-old woman with history of DM2, CAD s/p CABG, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, PE in the past, on Coumadin and IVC filter
who presented as Outside Hospital transfer for hypoxemic,
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**9-13**] after 3 days
of melena, and was found to have a Hct of 5.1 and INR of 3.66.
She was transfused 3 units pRBC, 2 units FFP. The next day she
had a desaturation to the mid 70's on room air, and had crackles
on exam, raising question of CHF exacerbation so she was started
on Bumetanide. By [**9-18**], she required a nonrebreather and was
started on a Lasix drip, with net negative fluid balance.
Despite diuresis she decompensated even more, requiring BiPAP,
and had worsening infiltrates on CXR which were concerning for
aspiration PNA vs ARDS. On [**9-20**], Vanc, Cipro, Imipenem/Cilastin
were started. She had worsening respiratory status so she was
intubated on [**9-21**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
and management.

Of note, her bicarb on admission was 35. Per family members, she
has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and she has some sort of
underlying lung disease.
TTE at OSH showed EF of 65%, no valve abnormalities; PA pressure
was 66mmHg. BNP 400.

-Hx PE, pulm HTN, on Coumadin and s/p IVC filter
-PAF on Coumadin

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar consolidations, could be
atelectasis
however given out of proportions consolidations relative to
small effusions, the possibility of infection should be strongly
considered.
2. Low ET tube, extending up to the carina and just at the
proximal right
main stem bronchus.
4. Unchanged right adrenal mass, could be an adenoma.
5. Extensive vascular and coronary calcifications.
6. Multinodular thyromegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old woman who presented from outside hospital status
post GI bleed while supratherapeutic on Coumadin, whose course
was complicated by respiratory failure.  The patient's
respiratory failure was from MRSA pneumonia causing ARDS.  With
antibacterial treatment and volume management, the patient was
able to be extubated and weaned down on oxygen to her baseline
of requiring 2L 02 by nasal canula.  She had no GI bleeding
during this hospitalization and her hematocrit remained stable.

Problem list:
# Respiratory failure [**2-23**] MRSA pneumonia causing likely ARDS
(PaO2:FiO2 being <200mmHg, bilateral infiltrates on CXR) on
underlying COPD. Heart failure was not likely a significant
factor given BNP 400 and TTE revealing normal pump function., as
well as TTE findings showing normal pump function of the heart.
She was treated initially with broad spectrum abx with vanco,
cipro, imipenem until sputum cultures grew MRSA.  She was
narrowed to Vanco only to complete an 8-day course.  She
returned back to her baseline oxygen use and was discharged on
2L oxygen.

# GI bleed, melena, tagged blood scan revealing bleed in left
colon: Melena suggests upper GI bleed such as PUD.  Tagged blood
scan results indicate lower GI bleed such as AVM.  Given no
active bleeding, [**Hospital **] clinic follow up and consider upper and
lower endoscopy for diagnostic evaluation.

# Diastolic heart failure, mild overload from not giving home
lasix.  Patient given some gentle diuresis and restarted on home
dose of lasix.  Euvolemic at the time of discharge.

# History of PE with IVC filter in place: Patient had both GI
bleeding and evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. In consultation
with the patient PCP and GI decided to not to restart
anticoagulation given the risk of bleeding.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Patient was in normal sinus
rhythm throughout hospitalization. Metoprolol was continued.

# HTN: Patient was hypertensive in ICU and was continued on
Metoprolol and started on hydralazine. Hydralazine was
discontinued when patient was on the floor and Lisinopril was
started.

# COPD: Patient has history of COPD. On 2L home oxygen
chronically. She was continued on oxygen and given albuteral and
ipratropium nuebulizers as needed. She was at her baseline
oxygen use (2L) at time of discharge.

# Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient was placed on sliding scale
insulin. Glucose was well-controlled throughout hospital course.
