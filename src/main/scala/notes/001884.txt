Admission Date:  [**2172-5-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2172-6-4**]


Service:  CARDIAC CARE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
male who began to have a tired feeling in his chest on the
night before admission.  It began around midnight and was
accompanied by belching.  When EMS arrived the patient was
alert and oriented times three and in no acute distress.
They assessed the patient as hypertensive and his blood
oxygenation levels were 96% on room air, electrocardiogram
changes showed ST elevations in leads 2, 3 and AVF.  On the
way to the hospital the patient became unresponsive, went
into ventricular tachycardia, which subsequently went into
ventricular fibrillation.  The ambulance was stopped and the
patient was shocked at 200 jewels.  The patient subsequently
went into asystole and then spontaneously converted into
sinus rhythm with occasional runs of ventricular tachycardia.
The patient regained consciousness.  The patient was brought
to [**Hospital3 3583**].  There was a question of a possible
seizure at [**Hospital3 3583**].  Treatment with Dilantin was
begun.  The patient was intubated.  Lidocaine and nitro was
given.  The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 188**] via helicopter, intubated, normotensive and acidotic.
In the catheterization laboratory the patient had a mid left
anterior descending coronary artery 90% stenosis.  After
stenting the lesion dropped to 0% occlusion.  The proximal
left anterior descending coronary artery was 80% stenosed.
After stenting the lesion dropped to 0% stenosed.  The origin
of the left anterior descending coronary artery was found to
be 40% stenosed and that was left alone.  TIMI three flow was
achieved.  In addition, the left circumflex artery had a 60%
large obtuse marginal stenoses.  The ramus had large mild
irregularities.  The right coronary artery had a 70% proximal
right stenosis right after the conus.  Two stents were placed
in the left anterior descending coronary artery.  His right
heart catheterization data, his right atrium had pressures of
21/18, right ventricle had pressures of 45/14.  His pulmonary
artery had pressures of 46/26 and his wedge pressure was 26.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission
the patient's blood pressure was 139/74, heart rate 87,
respirations 19.  The patient was sating 96% on the
ventilation.  The pulmonary arterial pressures at that time
were 39/18 with a mean of 23. His cardiac output was 5.9 and
his index was 2.94.  In general, the patient was lying in bed
sedated on propofol and intubated.  His pupils were equal,
round and reactive to light.  His neck had no JVD.  There was
on lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination demonstrated a
normal S1 and S2 and a 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur that
radiated to the axilla.  His chest examination showed some
rales at the bases.  Abdominal examination demonstrated
obesity, nontender and bowel sounds were hypoactive.  His
extremities were warm.  There was no edema and his dorsalis
pedis pulses were 2+.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 20, creatinine 1.4,
CPK 1383, troponin of 9.4 and an MB index of 21.5.
His chest x-ray demonstrated enlarged and elongated thoracic
aorta, diffuse pulmonary edema in a mid to apical portions of
the lung.  His echocardiogram demonstrated a normal left
atrium, normal right atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic function was mildly
decreased.  Ejection fractions estimated to be 35%.  The
mitral valve was found to have 1+ regurgitation.  The aortic
valve had mild regurgitation.  The anterior septal wall was
found to be hypokinetic.  The anterior free wall was also
hypokinetic.  The apex was found to be akinetic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day two the patient experienced
worsening of his electrocardiogram changes and went back to
the catheterization laboratory and had an 80% lesion in the
proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stented.
Immediately following the procedure the patient was placed on
an intraaortic balloon pump.  The patient came back to the
Coronary Care Unit floor intubated.  On hospital day three
the patient spiked a temperature to 101.8.  Flagyl and
Levaquin was started for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.  By
hospital day four the patient was extubated.  Aortic balloon
pump was removed and he was transferred to the regular floor.
By hospital day five the day of discharge the patient had an
occasional low grade fever.  The medications that he was
being treated with included Plavix, Fluvastatin, aspirin,
Metoprolol, Lisinopril and prn doses of Lasix.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Acute myocardial infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
2.  Fluvastatin 80 mg po q.d.
3.  Flagyl 500 mg po q 8 hours times two more days.
4.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q 24 hours times two more days.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 75 mg po t.i.d.
7.  Haldol 2 mg po t.i.d.
8.  Famotidine 20 mg po t.i.d.
9.  Furosemide 40 mg po q.d.
10.  Lisinopril 40 mg po b.i.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with his
primary care physician within one week.  The name of the
rehab facility that the patient is being transferred to is
[**Hospital1 **].
