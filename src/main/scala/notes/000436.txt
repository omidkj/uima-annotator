History of Present Illness:
44 year old female with h/o HTN initially admitted to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital on [**2194-12-11**] with 7 days of cough, fever, and 1 day of
change in mental sttatus. Her family/friends noted she had
slurred speech, few episodes of talking out of contexted causing
them to bring her to the ED. She was covered with
ceftriaxone/vancomycin for presumed meningitis (LP attempts
unsuccessful) and admitted to the ICU, where she was
subsequently intubated for hypoxia (O2 sat 80s RA) and change in
mental status. CXR should multifocal opacities, and antibiotics
were broadened to CTX/vanco/levo/doxy/ayclovir/metronidazole.
Over the course of the next few days, she developed
transaminitis (LFTs 600s), ARF (attributed to ATN, initiated
dialysis [**12-15**], [**12-16**]), thrombocytopenia (plt 23 from 90s on
admit), lactic acidosis (lactate 5). All bcx, spcx, ucx, BAL
NGTD. Antibiotics narrowed to levofloxacin/linezolid/doxycycline
(?when). On [**12-12**], pt was noted to be diffusely mottled. Over
the course of the next 4 days, she developed diffuse, dependent
purpura with areas of necrosis/skin sloughing. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**12-16**] given concern for TEN. Currently, the
patient is intubated and sedated.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 44 yoF w/ h/o HTN presents with rapidly progressive change
in mental status in the setting of fever. Course c/b multisystem
organ failure (renal, respiratory, liver) with coagulopathy and
diffuse purpura fulminans.
.
.
1) Purpura Fulminans: Seen by dermatology and biopsied upon
transfer with prelim path consistent with microthrombi.  The
felt that findings are most consistent with purpura fulminans,
most commonly seen in setting of sepsis/DIC/meningococcemia. DDx
includes TEN (although minimal total-body exfoliation), toxic
shock, scalded skin syndrome.  Initially duoderm dressings
appllied and as skin started exfoliated and denuding, was
cleaned with saline and silvadene with telfa applied to denuded
areas.  She had significant weeping of the wounds and was
supported with IVF and albumins were monitored and last albumin
was 2.4.  She was treated for her possible underlying infection
as below.  Negative vaginal exam for tampon (vag cx, speculum
exam negative at OSH).  As area of skin involved progressed, she
will be transferred to a specific burn unit to manage and
monitor her skin breakdown.  she has been on heparin gtt to
prevent further microemboli and per rehumatology and hematology
should be started on IVIG and steroids to treat possible acute
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome which may also cause this
presentation of microemoli.
.
2) Sepsis: Improved hypotension off pressors X >24 hrs prior to
transfer and no need for pressors while here and no evidence of
lactic acidosis. Potential infectious sources include menignitis
(including meningococcus given rapid clinical deterioration),
pulmonary source (given report of cough, patchy infiltrates on
CXR).  Given presentation meningococcus was leading infection
although Lp attempts at OSH and unable after repeated attempts
and here not attempted given antibioitcs and rash covering back
with thrombocyopenia.  Initially broadly coverage again per ID
reccomendations with Ceftriaxone/vanco/acyclovir/ampicillin to
cover meningitis, levofloxacin to cover atypicals, doxycline to
cover for tick-[**Location (un) **] disease(RMSF).  eventually levofloxacin,
ampicillin and acycovir were stopped as not clinically
consistent with those diagnoses.  Ct of chest/abd/pelvis with
contrast did not reveal any abscesses, large PEs or other
infectious processes, although was consistent with ARDS.  Crypto
Ag(-), histo Ag(p), erhlichiae Ab(neg) per ID.  cultures here
including daily blood, urine and sputum have been negative.
tissue culture with 1+PMn, but no anaerobic gorwth and aerobic
cx still pending.  Head MRI negative for septic emboli or
temporal enhancement suggestive of herpes encephalitis, but did
have scattered foci of FLAIR signal hyperintensity, nonspecific,
which may relate to post infectious/inflammatory process,
demyelination, or subacute or chronic infarction.  TTe and TEE
without signs of vegetations.  IVF boluses used to maintain CVP
>12, MAP >65.  She was initially on droplet precautions, but no
longer needed as has been treated over 24hrs.  She was continued
on sepsis dose steroids and then transitioned to steroids to
treat possible auto-immune source of rash even though [**Doctor First Name **] and
ANCA were negative.  She is currently on ceftriaxone 2gm IV
q12hrs, vanc 1 gm pre levels<15, doxycycline 100mg IV q12.
.
3) Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to shock liver, trending
down while here Hepatitis A, B, C serologies (-) at OSH; EBV
serologies indicating prior infection, and again repeated here
although still pending.  RUQ U/S did not shouw evidence of
portal thrombosis and unremarkeable liver and s/p ccy.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia: Plt 21 on admission and prior to d/c back
up to 40.  thought to be secondary to DIC (although PT/PTT wnl,
D-dimer high, FDP and fibrinogen normal here) vs sepsis,
consumption in the setting of widespread purpura.  HIT was
negative.  Also initially concern for TTP, given ARF, MS change,
fever, but with no shistocytes on smear, no haptoglobin less
likely.
.
5) ARF: Sediment at OSH c/w ATN, likely secondary to
sepsis/renal hypoperfusion. Renal U/S at OSH (-).  she continued
to require daily HD here for fluid management.  As infection
resolves, she may recover renal function, although currently
seems unlikley.
.
6) CHF: Grossly total body fluid overloaded (in the setting of
aggresive fluid resuscitation) although CVP 7, however given
concern for sepsis/lactic acidosis, would not actively diurese
at this time, particularly as patient is ventilated.  normal EF
on TTE, and as started weeping from wounds, slowed down diuresis
attempts.  She was started on afterload reduction with
hydralazine, isordil and low dose metoprolol.
.
7) Rahbdo: she had persistently elevated CKs likely from
mircoemboli to muscles as well.  Continued on IV hdration an
