HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 82-year-old man
with history of borderline hypertension recently discharged
from an outside hospital approximately two weeks ago with a
new diagnosis of CHF.  The patient was sent home on CHF
regimen of Digoxin, Coreg, Lasix, and Zestril.  The patient
was feeling well at home until [**7-5**], when the patient
reported the sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain,
diaphoresis, while reclined in his chair.  The patient denied
nausea or vomiting.  After arrival in the ED and receiving
40  mg IV Lasix and sublingual nitroglycerin times two, the
patient became suddenly hypotensive with blood pressure
69/pulse, heart rate 71.  The patient was sent to MICU and
started on Dopamine drip with good response.

Cardiology consultation:  Echocardiogram revealed
biventricular failure.  The patient ruled out for MI.  The
patient did have slightly elevated troponin of 0.6.  Swan
catheter placed revealed cardiac index of 1.8 to 1.9; wedge
pressure of 8 to 9 mmHg and elevated PA pressure of 70 to 80
systolic.  VQ scan was performed indicating the high
probability of PE.  Thrombolysis was considered by the MICU
team, however, after consideration and discussion with the
patient Heparin was started.  The ICU course was complicated
by periods of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The
patient was stabilized and transferred to the General
Medicine Floor on [**7-8**].

On the medical floor, the patient complained of mild
exertional shortness of breath, denied chest pain, nausea or
vomiting.  The patient denied any history of orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, or recent
immobility prior to this admission.  The patient did report
one episode of right upper quadrant pain the prior day in the
MICU, which lasted ten minutes and it was now resolved.

5.  Captopril 25 q.d.
6.  Coreg 12.5 q.d.

8.  Tylenol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient denied any drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with wife.
[**Name (NI) **] is a retired lobsterman.  He denies any tobacco use.  He
has occasional ethanol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  There was no family
history of MI, sudden death, or coagulopathy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Temperature 99.8, blood pressure 132/80, respiration rate 20,
oxygen saturation 93% on two liters.  GENERAL:  The patient
was alert and oriented times three.  The patient appeared
comfortable.  HEENT:  MMM, PERRLL, EOMI.  Neck was supple.
JVP approximately 5 to 6, no bruits.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  1/6 systolic
ejection murmur at LUSB.  PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with slight crackles at bases.  EXTREMITIES:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no calf tenderness.  ABDOMEN:
Soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel sounds, no
organomegaly.  VASCULAR:  2+ DP pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies revealed the following:
On [**7-8**] CBC illustrated a WBC of 13.5, hematocrit 42.9,
platelet count 185,000.  Chem 7:  Within normal limits.  ALT
55, AST 47, alkaline phosphatase 104.  Chest x-ray:  [**7-5**], no
evidence of failure or pneumonia.  Echocardiogram:  PA
pressure 70, EF 35%, severe LV/RV hypokinesis.  Paradoxical
septal wall motion.  VQ:  High probability multiple PE.  EKG:
[**2157-7-6**]:  Sinus rhythm at 84, normal axis, LVH with
4 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression laterally.  On [**2157-7-7**] EKG sinus
rhythm at 78, normal axis, LVH with less marked ST
depression.  PT 14.3, PTT 53.8, INR 1.4, CK times 3 negative.
Blood culture/urine culture negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  PE/PULMONARY:  The patient had high probability PE on VQ
scan likely leading to right heart failure, congestion.  The
patient's oxygen saturations gradually improved to about 95%
to 96% on two liters with slight desaturation on room air to
approximately 94%.  Heparin was continued as the patient was
started on Coumadin 5 mg PO q.h.s. until a therapeutic INR
was reached.  PSA screen for malignancy as a possible cause
for the coagulopathy revealed PSA of 3.6.

#2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has biventricular
dysfunction on echocardiogram associated with acute PE.  The
patient's decreased RV function was likely secondary to PE.
The patient's LV dysfunction likely secondary to a
combination of severe RV dysfunction on inherent changes in
the left ventricular associated with CAD/ischemia and
hypertension.  The Department of Cardiology was consulted.
The patient's CHF was well controlled with cardiac regimen of
Digoxin, Captopril, Coreg, and Lasix.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry for episodes of PVCs and short runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  It was decided that
further workup of LV dysfunction in the form of repeat
echocardiogram and/or catheterization would be more accurate
after improvement in RV function.

#3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had episode of right
upper quadrant pain associated with elevation in LFTs.  Right
upper quadrant ultrasound revealed large amounts of sludge
within the gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis, and
normal appearance of the liver.  The patient was encouraged
to follow a low-fat diet and followup with PCP for possible
future cholecystectomy.

#4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially had elevated
WBCs, which gradually resolved, likely secondary to stress
response.  Urine culture and blood culture were negative.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  PE.
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
5.  RV failure.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.
2.  M.V.I. one PO q.d.
3.  Pantoprazole 40 PO q.d.
4.  EC ASA 325 mg q.d.
5.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg PO b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg PO q.d.
7.  Senna one tablet p.o.q.h.s.
8.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
9.  Tylenol 650 mg PO q.4h. to 6h.p.r.n. less than two grams
per day.
10. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.5 mg sublingual q.5 minute
p.r.n. chest pain; maximum of 3, then medical doctor.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged with home
oxygen (2 liters) and with VNA.  The patient has a follow-up
appointment with primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 10:30
am the following day ([**7-15**]).  At this time, the patient will
have his INR rechecked and evaluate for continuation of
Coumadin therapy.  Due to elevated INR of 3.9, Coumadin was
held until the follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
