Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 87 yo lady with complex PMH most notable for CAD with
known 3VD (not a PCI/CABG candidate), diastolic HF, severe AS
(VA 0.8), colon CA s/p colectomy and a questionable history of
COPD who presents to ED with SOB.  Pt initially treated as COPD
exacerbation with the administration of steroids.  However Pt
with a ECG showing possible STD in anterior leads and TropT
2.09, as well as a CXR consistent with CHF.  Pt decompensated
and required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation as well
as started on Nito gtt and given a dose of Lasix IV.  Given
NSTEMI, hep gtt started and Pt given an ASA.  Initiation of
these modalities resulted in improvement of symptoms.  Pt
transferred to CCU for further monitoring and management.

ROS:  One to two days of "indigestion" and belching that seemed
to resolve after SL NTG. Additionally, Pt described worsening
SOB over the past 12-24 hours with no clear precipitant.  Denies
any CP, DOE, syncope.

Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease (3VD no prior intervention)
 2.  Colonic adenocarcinoma; status post right colectomy.
 3.  History of myocardial infarction.
 4.  Severe Aortic stenosis (0.8)
 5.  Congestive heart failure (LVEF 60%).
 6.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
 7.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
 8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 9.  History supraventricular tachycardia.
10.  Status post appendectomy.
11.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.


Social History:
Pt is widowed and lives alone in a senior housing unit, with
recent visits by her 4 adult children.  Quit Tob 50 years ago,
no EtOH.

Pertinent Results:
FINDINGS: The heart and mediastinal contours are stable. The
aorta is unfolded. There is increased hilar and perivascular
haziness, consistent with interstitial edema. There are
bilateral pleural effusions. There are again demonstrated
pleural plaques. There is left retrocardiac atelectasis versus
consolidation. Osseous structures are unchanged, again with
evidence of old left proximal humerus fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1) Congestive heart failure
2) Bilateral pleural effusions
3) Left retrocardiac atelectasis versus consolidation pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] is an 87 year old female with known 3VD non-surgical
and PCI candidate in the past, diastolic heart failure, severe
aortic stenosis who was admitted to CCU with NSTEMI and CHF. She
was called out to the floor as soon as her cardiac issues
stabilized.

1) CAD:  Pt with cardiac catherization in [**2146**] which showed 3VD
unable to be intervened upon and a non-surgical candidate who
has been medically managed.  The patient's home regimen includes
BB, ASA, statin.  On presentation to the ED, Ms.[**Known lastname 110790**] had a
NSTEMI given positive cardiac enzymes.  The patient did well
with nitroglycerin, however given her severe AS it was minimized
and stopped upon arrival to the CCU.  The patient also started
on heparin gtt and continued overnight until it was stopped in
light of being pain free and CE trending down.  Overnight BB was
held given severe CHF and restarted in AM as Pt improved
steadily. Once stable, Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] her beta blockade
which was titrated down for bradycardia. She was also restarted
on an ACE I once her renal function improved.

2) Pump: Pt with diastolic dysfunction with LVEF 60% on recent
echo, however limited forward flow given AS/MR.  The patient was
clearly volume overloaded in heart failure, some of which may
have been secondary to dietary indiscretion. Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] did
well with CPAP temporarily and was gentled diuresised with
Lasix.  Afterload reduction was kept to a minimum given severe
AS.  The patient also not on an ACEi as outpt given preserved
systolic function and not started on one initially on admission
given [**Doctor First Name 48**]. She [**Doctor First Name 8337**] gentle diuresis well without
hypotension. A new echo  was obtained which showed an EF > 55%
and she was started on an ACE I to prevent remodeling.

3) Valves:  Pt with severe AS (area 0.8 cm2) and moderate MR on
recent echo.  Pt was minimally afterload reduced and gently
diuresised.

4) Rhythm: NSR without active issue during hospitalization.

5) Resp: Pt in respiratory distress on presentation. Initially
treated as COPD exacerbation in ED with little improvement.  CXR
consistent with CHF.  Pt decompensated requiring initiation of
CPAP, nitro gtt and lasix.  Pt respnded well and had good
resolvement of symptoms.  Pt clearly vol overloaded with CHF.
Upon arrival to CCU, Pt taken of CPAP and did very well on just
a ferw liters via NC.  Resp status improved as diuresis
continued. At discharge, she had no oxygen requirement.

6) Renal: Pt with normal renal function at baseline (Cr 1.1),
however on presentation Cr was 2.0.  Pt was making good urine
and electrolytes all normal.  Pt most likely suffering from [**Doctor First Name 48**]
secondary to decreased perfusion in the acute setting. Her renal
function improved with a creatnine of 1.5 at discharge. Her
creatinine continued to trend down despite adding an ACE I at
the end of her hospitalization.

7) Anemia:  Pt with Hct 30 on admission below baseline that
trended down to 26 the following morning for which she recieved
a unit of PRBCs. She also received another unit before discharge
and [**Doctor First Name 8337**] both transfusions well.

8) Rheumatoid arthritis: Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] was continued on her
prednisone. Her methotrexate is Q week and so was not
administered.

The patient received both the flu vaccine and pneumovax before
discharge. Ms. [**Known lastname 110790**] was discharged in good condition to her
home with VNA services.
