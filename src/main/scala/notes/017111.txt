History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 38 year-old male with ESRD awaiting initiation
of HD, HTN, dCHF with a recent admission on [**3-20**] for fluid
overload presented yesterday with new onset of fever, chills and
pain on his L calf. Pt states that he was feeling well since his
discharge on [**3-20**] until yesterday morning he had a itch on his
left calf which he developed a small abrasion on his skin.  He
then developed sharp pain on his L calf that only lasted a few
minutes and resolved. He also noted that his legs were getting
more swollen. He then started to feel tired and febrile in the
early afternoon hours with rigors.  He presented to the
emergency room for further evalution.

In the ED, initial VS 99.8 89 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 61599**]0%. He then developed
temp to 102.8 with a repeated BP of 180/80. His exam was notable
for L calf skin abrasion tender to palpation, tender to
palpation over right LN in groin. His labs were notable for for
creatine of 5.5 (prior last week was 5.0), bicarb of 20, phos of
5.1. WBC of 13.7 (N:91.6 L:3.1 M:3.7 E:1.4 Bas:0.2). His Cxray
showed no pulmonary edema or consolidation. UA x 2 were
negative. The second UA was neg, but had few bacteria. He had
blood culture x 2. He was given dose of Vancomycin 1gm. He was
then admitted for further evalution.

On the floor, his initials vital signs were 101.4, 155/73, 101,
18, 99% on RA.  Overnight he remained febrile with a Tmax to
102.  This morning on evaluation, he is shovering stating he
still has severe chills.  He notes pain in his left groin.  He
is also sleepy, but arousable and interactive when asked
questions.

Of note he was admitted on [**3-20**] for a 40lb wt increase over 3.5
weeks. This was thought to be related to worsen renal function
and dCHF. He was given intermittent lasix 60 IV boluses-
diuresed 10 L and lost ~ 5 pounds prior to discharge. His dose
of Torsimide was increased to 40mg, with instructions to
increase dose if his urine output decreases. He notes that for
the last few days he had decrease in urine output and he took
120mg of Torsimide today. He had a R forearm fistula done in
[**Month (only) 958**] which is pnd maturation so he can be started on HD. He
also had a phlebitis on his left arm in [**Month (only) **] with subsequent MSSA
bacteremia with Nafcillin.

Brief Hospital Course:
38M with ESRD, HTN, dCHF & admission 1 wk ago for volume
overload now p/w RLE cellulitis.
.
# SIRS and RLE CELLULITIS
Patient initially admitted to the medical floor.  On admission
pt had fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis so he met SIRS
criteria. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime with a
presumed source of lower extremity cellulitis as patient's
symptoms began after skin abrasions from itching his lower
extremity & tender bilateral LAD suggests systemic spread. BCx
were sent prior to initiation of vancomycin in the ED, NGTD. On
HD 1, he was becoming increasingly somnolent and was transferred
to the MICU for concern for impending septic shock.  He remained
stable in the MICU overnight and was transferred back to the
floor the same day.  Infectious Disease was consulted, and
recommended switching the patient to oral antibiotics on HD 3.
A regimen of doxycycline and keflex was started (Bactrim was
avoided because of patient's ESRD and history of G6PD). The next
day, patient became incredibly nauseous and stated that he had a
similar reaction to doxy ion the past.  Because Clindamycin
carries a high risk of C diff and does not have good coverage
against MRSA in our area, it was determined that we would give
the patient one more dose of IV vancomycin.  Because of his
ESRD, the dose would remained in his system for 48-72 hours. We
then prescribed him 3 days of Clindamycin to begin on [**4-1**] to
complete a total 10 day course beginning on [**3-25**].  The keflex
was disonctinued.  Patient was discharged in stable condition,
feeling well. All blood cultures remained negative.
.
# ESRD
Awaiting initiation of HD, s/p recent fistula placement on [**2-24**].
Records demonstrate recent, steady increase in Cr & increasing
diuretic requirement, suggestive of acutely-worsening renal
fucntion. Last Cr 5.8/BUN 85. Dry weight estimated between 260 -
285 lbs; 128.9 kg at discharge last week and 129.4 here. No
clinical signs of uremia or florid volume overload on admission,
although increasing somnolence on floor, subsequently resolved)
might be [**1-1**] mild uremia. Renal consult service followed the pt
closely and was prepared to initiate HD via a temp HD line
should he require urgent dialysis. At this time, it was felt
most appropriate to await maturation of new R radial AVF, which
was evaluated by transplant surgery while here. Fistulagram also
performed, which showed high velociti
