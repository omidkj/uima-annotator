History of Present Illness:
82 yo RH woman with h/o Afib (not on coumadin [**1-7**] multiple
falls), HTN, PD, CAD, recent IVH [**1-7**] fall who presents after
being found down.  She was speaking to her son-in-law this am
~9am who found her initially to be speaking normally (although
conversation was brief but able to ask about her daughter who is
out of the country) - incidentally she called him.  However,
soon
after the call, he was answering a question and then noted no
response on the other end of the telephone.  He called her name,
but heard no response.  A friend had been planning to pick her
up
at 10 am, so he figured the phone was having technical
difficulties and that he would be contact[**Name (NI) **]/seen by the people
she was supposed to meet.  He didn't hear anything and presumed
that things were ok.  ~12:30, her daughter in law came by her
apt
to see how she was doing.  When she knocked, she heard someone
(the pt) trying to say something but not really saying anything
clearly.  She called 911 and the fire dept responded, broke open
the door and found the patient dressed (ready to go out per
children), unable to communicate - not making word salad, but
only word that was understandable was "no" with r sided
weakness.
As a result, she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was SBPs in
150.  she could follow simple commands, but was not moving her
RUE.  she also appeared to have trouble getting words out per ED
staff. She was then intubated for airway protection. CTH was
attained which revealed hypodensity involving LMCA territory
with
small amount of hemorrhage concerning for hemorrhagic conversion
of infarction and neurology service was contact[**Name (NI) **].

Incidentally, the patient's children describe her as having
gradual worsening of her language with worsening word finding
difficulties over the past year.  After a recent admission for
IVH, she has also had a tendency to sit with her eyes close
(although awake) per their report.

Per family, patient with h/o TIA with dysarthria and L hand
"shaking" lasting minutes.  they don't recall results of workup
from [**2140**].
