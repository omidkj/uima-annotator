CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2123-1-9**] 10:18 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: F/u head CT.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old woman s/p assault with head bleed.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
F/u head CT.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post assault with head bleed. Followup.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with [**2123-1-4**]. Again
seen is a large right subdural hematoma overlying most of the
right temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral convexity. It
is not significantly changed in size. A small amount of
subarachnoid blood seen at the vertex of the right parietal lobe
again identified. Small amount of low density fluid outlining
the right frontal cerebral convexity is again noted, slightly
increased, now measuring approximately 5 mm in greatest axial
dimension, as opposed to 3 mm previously. Though it exerts mild
mass effect on the underlying right frontal cerebral cortex, it
does not cause significant shift of midline structures. Large
amount of encephalomalacia in the inferior right frontal lobe is
again identified. An 8 mm focus of high-density material
representing blood in the medial inferior right frontal lobe.
Tiny amount of blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. No
hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular or territorial infarct is
identified. Small amount of extra-axial blood outlining the
right side of the falx again noted. Significant scalp hematoma
along the right parietal region. Bony structures are notable for
bilateral parietal bur holes and frontal bur holes. Frontal,
ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses are almost completely
opacified. Bilateral mastoid air cells are also almost
completely opacified. There is partial pneumatization of both
features apices. Many of these air cells are also filled with
fluid.

IMPRESSION: Slightly increased frontal low density subdural
collections since the previous study. The previously noted
bilateral high densitu subdurals are unchanged. No other
significant new abnormalities.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2123-1-11**] 3:11 PM

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)

Reason: assess pneumonia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old woman with (+)sputum cx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess pneumonia
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM

History of cough.
Right subclavian CV line is in mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Heart
size is within normal limits. There has been significant
resolution of the bibasilar opacities since the prior study of
[**2123-1-7**], with minimal residual atelectasis in the left
lower lobe. A small focal ill-defined opacity is present in the
right midzone, not clearly identified on the prior film and of
uncertain cause, but recommend revaluate on short-term followup
exam. to determine if additional workup such as chest CT is
indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the TICU where she was monitored closely.
She had repeat CT of head which showed stable SDH. Sh remained
intubated until [**1-7**]. her exam improved daily. CXR on [**1-6**]
showed concern for pneumonia and she was started on levaquin.
Diet was advanced and tube feedings were stopped.  She was
transferred to the floor on [**1-9**].  On 27th cxr showed improved
PNA with samll opacity in right midzone/ She had RUE weakness
during this stay which is improved to 5/5 strength however she
remains with poor position sense in that RUE.  We recommend she
follow up with her PCP for EMG for eval of that rue in about [**7-23**]
weeks from date of injury.  For this weakness she had an EEG to
r/u sz / and then contunuous EEG / results= OBJECT: BDESIDE EEG,
[**Date range (1) 70722**]. RULE OUT SEIZURES. THERE WERE
NO PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
FINDINGS:
ROUTINE SAMPLING: Began on the morning of [**1-7**] and showed
a
widespread, but also a bit slow, [**7-22**] Hz background in most
areas,
including frontal. There were also some bursts of generalized
delta
slowing. Modest amounts of additional focal delta slowing were
evident
in the left anterior quadrant. The background patterns persisted

throughout the recording.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular tachycardia with a
rate of
approximately 105.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clear epileptiform
discharges.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were four entries in these
files.
These showed some lead artifact and movement artifact but no
electrographic seizures.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Intermittent recording showed a slow background with an anterior

predominance. This suggests medication effect. Focal
abnormalities (in
the left fronto-central region) were less common than on the
previous
day's recording. There were no epileptiform features. Overall,
the
medication effect or encephalopathy appears less profound than
on the
previous recording.

She also has noted on CT /thyroid nodules/which we recommended
f/u with PCP for as well. She is maintained on dilantin for this
injury as well as history of sz. PT/OT evals done/.
She is improving daily and is being set up for d/c to extended
care facility.
