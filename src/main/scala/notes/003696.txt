Brief Hospital Course:
Pt arrived in trauma bay with GCS of 3. Multiple attempts to
intubate pt failed. LMA placed until pt brought to OR for trach.
No scans were initially performed on patient due to hemodynamic
instability. Pt brought immediately to OR for exploratory
laparotomy, BOLT, and trach. See results section for list of
traumatic injuries. CT chest showed large PTX for which a chest
tube was placed in the right apex. Pt underwent multiple
surgeries spanning 2 days. Exploratory lap negative for
significant findings. Pt tolerated the surgeries well. However,
the post operative course was complicated by O2 desaturation in
the PACU down to the low 80's. Xray did not show changes in
pneumothorax. Pt placed on NRB with adequate improvement of O2
sat. ICU stay complicated by + sputum cultures for GNR and high
fevers. Started on 3 antibiotic regimen therapy x 7 days and
improved. Pt improved on the floor, satting well on trach mask.
Floor stay complicated by delirium/altered mental status from
?etiology. White count was elevated. Patient remained afebrile,
urine negative. Sputum cultures positive for GPC and GNR on [**5-26**]
and started on Zosyn and Vanc. White count improved. Mental
status seemed to improve with decrease of ativan use and
antibiotics for presumed PNA (aspiration vs CAP). Pt was able to
sit without sitter, and plans made to discharge to rehab for
further care.
