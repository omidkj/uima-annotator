Pertinent Results:
[**8-29**] Echo: PREBYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect of PFO is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). 6. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. 7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
normal appearing. Mild (1+) tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 8.
There is no pericardial effusion. 9. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2186-8-29**] at 859. POSTBYPASS: 1. Patient
is on epinephrine and phenylephrine 2. Left ventricular function
remains unchanged. 3. A well seated, well functioning
bioprostetic valve is seen in the aortic position. The mean
gradients is 24 mmHg 4. Aortic contour is smooth after
decannulation. 5. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notified of these findings at
1148.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Normal AVR gradient. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or
electrodes. Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The leaflets are not well-seen, but
the transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiolo
