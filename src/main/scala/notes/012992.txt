History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo M w/ h/o MVR/AVR [**1-12**] rheumtic heart disease,
A fib, CHF, s/p BiV pacer, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, CKD
baseline Cr 1.6, obesity who presents with chest pain which
started [**10-7**].  It was described as epigastric and associated
with nausea, vomitting, diaphoresis and "sour feeling". It
improved with maalox in ED. He had 2 sets of cardiac enzymes
which were negative.  His nuclear stress did show a "moderate
fixed defect of inferior wall, moderated reversible defect of
inferolateral wall, new partially reversible defect of anterior
wall. A cardiac catherization was done on [**10-11**].

On arrival to the floor, pt has no compliants. He does state he
has had increasing DOE for the last 10 days or so which his
inhalers initially helped. Pt also c/o mild ankle edema just
during the day today.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

EKG [**2123-10-8**]
Ventricular paced rhythm. The underlying rhythm is probably
atrial
fibrillation

[**2123-11-8**]:  KUB

 IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged air filled loops of large and
small bowel, representing unchanged ileus

CXR [**2123-10-8**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

Stress test/perfusion scan:  [**2123-10-8**]:

IMPRESSION: Uninterpretable ECG for ischemia. No anginal type
symptoms
reported. Appropriate hemodynamic response to Persantine.
Nuclear report
filed separately

IMPRESSION: Abnormal study. There is a moderate fixed defect of
the inferior wall with associated hypokinesis, a moderate
reversible defect of the inferolateral wall, and a new partially
reversible defect of the anterior wall.
New, moderate left ventricular enlargement. Left ventricular
ejection fraction 37% (previously 47%).

CARDIAC CATH [**2123-10-13**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent, flow-limiting
coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA was normal in apperence.  The LAD had mild
lumenal
irregularities with small caliber branch vessels.  The LCx was a

co-dominant vessel with minor irregularities.  The RCA had mild
disease.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Non-obstructice coronary artery disease.

EGD [**2123-10-15**]
Impression: Granularity in the antrum compatible with gastritis
(biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

COLONOSCOPY [**2123-10-15**]
Impression: Polyp at 15cm in the Rectosigmoid junction (15cm)
(polypectomy, endoclip)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

PATHOLOGY FROM [**2123-10-15**] POLYPECTOMY
1.  Stomach, antrum, biopsy (A):
Focal superficial iron deposition in the lamina propria,
consistent with iron pill gastropathy (confirmed on iron stain).
2.  Polyp, rectosigmoid, polypectomy (B-C):
Adenoma.

FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-10-18**]
Impression: Blood in the up to 30cm from the anal verge. There
was no blood proximal to this. (endoclip)
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 30cm from anal verge

FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-10-21**]
Impression: Post-Polypectomy site with friable mucosa but no
stigmata of recent bleeding. (injection, endoclip)
Prior endoclipped site (clipped on [**2123-10-18**]) appeared clean
without any friable mucosa, stigmata or recent bleeding, or
active bleeding.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 20cm from the anal verge

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2123-10-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. High-density material within the rectum may represent stool,
although
blood cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation with stool sample
or physical exam recommended.
2. Two fat containing midline abdominal wall hernias appear
grossly
uncomplicated by CT although minimal stranding may represent an
element of
strangulation. Clinical correlation with point tenderness
recommended.
3. Distended bladder.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) [**2123-10-24**]
