had a chest x-ray consistent with multifocal pneumonia and
given one dose of Levofloxacin.  She has a new bandemia and
white blood cell count.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Lymphoma, B cell, status post CHOP, Rituxan in [**4-28**].
2.  Crohn's disease, status post total colectomy thirty-five
years ago with an ileostomy.
3.  Hepatitis C cirrhosis.
4.  Anemia secondary to chronic blood loss.
5.  History of pelvic abscess with drainage in [**5-27**].
6.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the nose.
7.  Depression.
8.  Vaginal bleeding.
9.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Ampicillin - rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco or intravenous drug
use.  Health care proxy [**Name (NI) 553**] [**Name (NI) **].  Lives in [**Hospital3 12272**] facility.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile on admission,
blood pressure 116/74, 80% in room air, 94% on nonrebreather.
No jugular venous distention.  The oropharynx is clear.
Chest - egophony left lower lobe, right upper lobe rhonchi
throughout.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops. The abdomen is benign.  Extremities
showed no edema.  Neurologic examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, left shift with 82 polys, 8
bands, 4 lymphocytes, white blood cell count 27.0, creatinine
0.8, blood urea nitrogen 25, hematocrit 46.1.

Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia. Electrocardiogram
normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute, normal axis and
intervals, no ST changes.  No T wave inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypoxia - The patient was admitted to Medicine, however,
her hypoxemia continued to progress.  She had increased
dyspnea and large a/A gradient.  She was started on
antibiotics which include Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin to cover
pneumonia.  She was added Bactrim.  CTA to evaluate for
pulmonary embolus was negative.  The patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress, also
attributed to her pneumonia.  She was intubated for airway
protection and increased work of breathing, likely due to
infection.  She was adult respiratory distress syndrome as
well as possible lymphoma Rituxan toxicity.  Her INR was 2.5
so pulmonary embolus was thought to be less likely.  She was
continued on her antibiotics of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
She was sent for bronchoscopy to check cytology as well.
The patient was growing out gram positive cocci in the blood
cultures.  Her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin.  She was started on pressors for hypotension,
Neo-Synephrine and Levofloxacin and was bronchoscoped. She
remained hypotensive.  Her white blood cell count continued
to increase to 36.0.  Her creatinine increased to 1.7.  Her
Legionella fungal cultures were negative.  Sputum culture was
2+ gram positive cocci in clusters.  She became septic.
Source was considered to be her pneumonia.  She was continued
on her antibiotics.  She was also added on Gentamicin.  The
patient expired on [**2173-12-9**], and time of death is 1830
despite maximum therapy.

2.  Hematology - The patient was in DIC, elevated INR, liver
failure.  She had cirrhosis and her acute renal failure
decreased urine output, likely the sepsis despite maximum
therapy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sepsis.
2.  Multilobar pneumonia.
3.  B cell lymphoma.
4.  Liver failure.
5.  Acute renal failure.
6.  Staphylococcus pneumoniae bacteremia.
