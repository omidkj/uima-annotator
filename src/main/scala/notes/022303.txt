Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 year old female with recent admission and
drainage of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with
supratherapeutic INR, end-stage renal disease on dialysis,
diabetes, and diastolic heart failure who presents from dialysis
after developing acute onset of palpitations.  She was in her
usual state of health and went to HD today.  After ~2 hours into
the session and ~2.5kg removed, she noted the sudden onset of
palpitations in her chest.  These were not associated with
shortness of breath or chest pain.  She stated that she has felt
something stuck in her throat since yesterday when she ate
grapes.  She denies abdominal pain, rash, fevers/chills/sweats
or dysuria.
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were 98.4  150  139/55  18
98%2L.  She received 1 L of NS and 3 doses of 5 mg IV metoprolol
with her blood pressure dropped to 100s systolic.  She had a
bedside TTE that showed no significant pericardial effusion, and
preserved biventricular function.  A CTA chest was done that was
negative for pneumonia or PE but showed only small to moderate
left-sided pleural effusions.

old diffuse TW flattening.

Imaging:
[**2136-10-4**] CXR - Left retrocardiac patchy opacity, which could
represent
atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.

[**2136-10-4**] CTA chest:
1. No large, central pulmonary embolus seen.
2. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, with related
compressive
atelectasis.
3. Mediastinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 13 mm in short axis.

4. Endplate changes at T9-10 suggestive of prior infection,
corresponding to findings on prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) 23840**] of [**2136-6-12**].
.
[**2136-10-7**] Bilateral Femoral Vein US: Bilateral lower extremity
DVTs (left greater than right), likely chronic given some
re-canalization. Common femoral veins are patent bilaterally.
.
[**2136-10-7**] Femoral Vascular US: 1. Very small, 10 x 6 mm probable
pseudoaneurysm in the right common femoral artery, but with no
clear connection to the venous system. 2. High velocities within
the right common femoral vein suggesting abnormal communication
from the arterial system either via fistula not seen, or small
malformation (also not definitively seen).

.
[**2136-10-9**] CTA Femoral vasculature: 1. Imaging findings are more
compatible with diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation rather
than arteriovenous fistula. But if patient has had prior
procedure in the area, both diagnosis should be considered. 2.
Uterine fibroids.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Superventricular Tachycardia: This was thought to be from
ectopic atrial focus, although other causes of SVT remain on the
differential.  Initially attempted to control tachycardia with
esmolol drip without effect.  Tachycardia rapidly resolved
following a dose of Adenosine 6mg. EP consult was obtained to
consider ablation of ectopic atrial focus.  Pt agreed to
ablation.  Coumadin was held in preparation for the procedure.
Once INR fell below 2.0 pt was started on heparin gtt. Because
of history of manipulation and HD cath placement, the evaluation
for her procedure included a femoral vascular ultrasound. The
decision was made at this time not to proceed with the procedure
and to medically manage her tachycardia.  She was started on
metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  Pt did not experience any additional
episodes of tachycardia after the initial episode in the ICU
that was responsive to adenosine. She will follow up with [**Hospital **]
clinic.

#. R femoral AV malformation/fistula: Ultrasound showed
possibility of right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and distal
bilateral femoral vein DVTs which appeared to be chronic.
Vascular Surgery was consulted to determine safety of using R
femoral vein for the procedure. They recommended CTA of femoral
vaculature.  This did not show a pseudoaneurysm rather a
possible AV fistula or AVM.  Pt will follow up with vascular
clinic.

# Coagulopathy: Unlikely to be a true coagulation disorder.
History of bilateral DVTs (also seen on current US) and
bilateral IJ clots are more likely attributed to multiple
manipulations and foreign bodies related to her dialysis. Upon
reviewing old records she was not on Coumadin from [**2136-5-17**]
until discovery of IJ occlusion in [**2136-8-17**]. Pt's home
coumadin regimen was held for the potential of having the
ablation performed.  She was started on a heparin drip that was
continued until coumadin was restarted and INR returned to
therapeutic levels. Pt was not increasing to therapeutic level
on 2mg (home regimen), increased dose after 5days to 5mg, and
also because pt was started on Rifampin. Pt was therapeutic on
discharge, and was d/c on 9mg of coumadin QD. Pt needs close
follow up on INR, especially with recent change in bactrim dose.

# MRSA Abscesses: On presentation pt had a single self draining
abscess on her back.  Throughout her hospitalization she
developed several other large abscesses on her back.  General
surgery was consulted and a single large abscess in the central
thoracic region was I&D'd.  Culture of abscess revealed MRSA.
Pt was started on Vancomyci
