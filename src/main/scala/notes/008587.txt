Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision.
Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF55%.
The bioprosthesis in the native aortic position is stable,
functioning well. No perivalvular aortic regurgitation.
The residual peak gradient is 35 and mean gradient is 20mm of
Hg.
Intact thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2145-10-29**] where
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement with 21-mm Magna
Ease [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tissue valve.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact.
She remained on milrinone for pulmonary hypertension and was
diuresed wiht IV lasix. Beta blocker was initiated.  Acute
Kidney Injury developed and Toradol was discontinued. The
patient continued to make adequate urine and Creatinine returned
to baseline quickly.
She developed a brief episode of post-op atrial fibrillation,
which converted to Sinus Rhythm with Amiodarone and DC
Cardioversion.  She continued to vascilate between Sinus Rhythm
and A-Fib and was started on Coumadin.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery. The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.

By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was ambulating,
yet deconditioned.  The wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Doctor Last Name 11622**] House Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.  She will remain on Coumadin for AFib.  INR should
be closely monitored and Chemistries should be repeated at the
end of the week in light of her recent kidney injury.
