REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.0 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.1 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 60 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.1 cm
Aortic Valve - Valve Area: *0.7 cm2 (nl >= 3.0 cm2)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Low normal
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Focal
calcifications in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS
(AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation
is seen.

POST-CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. Bioprosthesis
in the aortic
position appears well seated. Leaflets are only very poorly seen
and can not
be commented on. There is trace valvular aortic regurgitation.
Can not
completely rule out a small perivalvular regugitant jet. The
peak gradient
across the valve ranged from 25 to 37 mm Hg. The mean gradient
was about 18 mm
Hg. Effective valve area was in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 cm2.
Thoracic aorta
appears intact.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2113-10-3**] 8:58 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o effusion
INDICATION: 68-year-old woman status post CABG. Rule out
effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2113-9-30**].

FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
Sternotomy wires are stable. The lungs are clear. There is no
pneumothorax. Minimal left- sided pleural effusion. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal. The osseous structures are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Minimal left-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**9-28**] and underwent AVR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to
the CVICU in stable condition on neosynephrine and propofol
drips. Extubated that evening and transferred to the floor on
POD #2 to begin increasing her activity level. Pacing wires and
chest tubes removed without incident. Made good progress and
cleared for discharge to home with services on POD #5. Pt. is to
make all follow appts. as per discharge instructions.
