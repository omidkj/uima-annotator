[**2137-2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with
patient in supine position is analyzed in direct comparison with
a similar preceding study obtained three hours earlier during
the same date. The right subclavian approach central venous line
has now been repositioned and its termination point is overlying
the SVC at the level of the carina. It is partially obscured by
the orthopedic hardware, but the position is now deemed to be
correct. No pneumothorax has developed and no other
placement-related complication is identified. Lungs remain
unchanged without evidence of CHF or acute infiltrates
.
[**2137-2-27**] CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No convincing evidence of rectovesicular fistula. 2.
Nonspecific wall thickening of the distal colon and rectum is
suggestive of a focal colitis.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
4. Small left-sided pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.
5. Foci of air within the bladder lumen, likely intraluminal.
However, a focus of intramural air cannot be entirely excluded.
If the patient appears toxic consider emphysematous cystitis

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 64 yo F w/ NH patient with chronic, indwelling
foley, mental retardation, recurrent osteomyelitis of thoracic
spine s/p fusion [**2136**], recurrent UTIs, DM, HTN, who presented
from nursing home with fever to 101.5 and urine c/w UTI.  In the
MICU the patient req. pressors for blood pressure support, CVL
and Art line placed. Pressors off in less than 24 hours.
Transfused 2 unit pRBC.
.
# Fever: Most likely secondary to UTI in patient with chronic
indwelling foley plus found to have c difficile.  She also has a
history of chronic osteomyelitis and should be on chronic
suppressive therapy.  Her urine grew mixed flora so she was
covered for other organisms that she previously was infected
with including VRE and Enterobacter, sensitive to daptomycin and
imipenem, respectively.  She received 10 days of treatment.
During her prior hospitalization, she was noted to be "rigid"
when on linezolid, thus we avoided this antibiotic and covered
vRE with daptomycin.  Foley was also replaced during this
hospital stay.
-finished 10 days daptomycin/imipenem today.  Start
dicloxacillin now for lifelong suppression osteomyelitis.
-follow up appointment in [**Hospital **] clinic
-patient should get trial of foley removal in future and see if
can void on own.
.
#Clostridium difficile colitis: Colitis seen on CT scan abd and
stool positive for c diff.  Started on flagyl and stool is
slowly improving in consistency.  Has rectal tube in place to
protect decubitus ulcers.
-should get 14 days more of flagyl
-remove rectal tube in next few days as output slows and more
formed
.
# Anion gap acidosis: Positive ketones with hyperglycemia, most
likely DKA in face of sepsis.  Improved and closed with IV
hydration and insulin drip.
.
# Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Most likely from diarrhea.
Improved with less output.  Should repeat in 1 week to follow up
resolution with improvement in diarrhea.
.
#. Abdominal pain: Chronic in nature, no clear source of pain.
Decreasing hematocrit in setting of [**Month (only) **] Hct concerning for
retroperitoneal bleed, no evidence on CT abdomen of bleed.
.
# Acute renal failure: Improved to baseline Cr 0.9 with IV fluid
hydration, likely prerenal.
.
# Hypertension: Hold metoprolol for now
.
# NIDDM: Required insulin drip on admission but only needed diet
control with occasional sliding scale insulin after.  Continue
to follow.
.
# Decubitus ulcers: Seen by wound care and plastics while here.
Patient will need continued [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes (and
should get pain medication prior to changes) and frequent
turning.  Did not need debridement at this time.  Should be
followed carefully by wound care specialist as outpatient.
.
# FEN: Continued to use PEJ tube which required replacement on
[**2137-3-4**] by IR and was working at time of discharge.  Seen by
swallow therapy and found to be safe to take thin liquids and
ground solids with assistance.  Can give diabetic diet with such
consistency and continue to see if can transition back to more
full diet support orally.
.
# Anxiety: Patient appears to have a lot of anxiety and may have
had some mild delirium while in hospital.  Very talkative and
interactive by time of discharge but quick to cry or become
frustrated.  Seen by psych who agreed with continued buspar and
to use seroquel prn additional anxiety.
