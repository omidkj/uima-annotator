effusions.  Chest was clear.  Heart was regular, rate, and

descending artery, 90% proximal stenosis of D1, and a 94%
stenotic LCX, abnormal left ventricular systolic function,
and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall, and reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, elevated resting rate
and left heart filling pressures.

Pulmonary consult was obtained for a patient having a cough
with occasional production of green sputum.  By pulmonary

tolerated the procedure without complications and was
extubated on postoperative day #1, who continued to have
respiratory issues with desaturations down to the 80's with
