Chief Complaint:
New Afib

None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 F w/ pmh of recent admission for lower GI bleed,
hypothyroidism, p/w DOE and new afib.  She has noticed an
irregular HR since about Monday and had experienced increased

her PCP today for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] previously-scheduled visit after recent
admission.  He did an EKG which showed afib so he sent her to
the ED.  No CP.  + Mild SOB at rest but she thinks she has this
baseline from years of smoking.  No PND or orthopnea.  She
thinks she has had intermittent afib for ? yrs.

In the ED, initial vitals 97.9, 132/69, 98, 18 96% on RA.  Had
CTA given elevated d-dimer but no PE.  Admitted for new afib and
new DOE.  Bedside u/s tr ant effusion

ECHO:
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Diastolic function could not be reliably assessed
because of atrial fibrillation. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

2. Marked left and right atrial enlargement, likely related to
tricuspid and mitral valve pathology, perhaps on the basis of
rheumatic heart disease, as evidenced by moderate mitral annular
calcification; the marked left atrial enlargement could
certainly account for atrial fibrillation (is this truly
"new"?).

3. Mild-to-moderate background centrilobular emphysema. 1-2 mm
left upper lobe pulmonary micronodule with high probability of
being benign; in this patient of advanced age, CT follow-up is
likely not necessary.

4. Small left pleural effusion and mild interstitial edema.

[**2101-2-25**] EGD w/ small hiatal hernia
.
[**2101-2-25**] Colonoscopy:
Flat Lesions A single medium angioectasia was seen in the cecum
measuring 1.5cm.The angioectasia was cauterized with good
hemostasis.There was slight oozing upon cauterization that was
successfully controlled. Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula
were seen in the sigmoid and descending colon.Diverticulosis
appeared to be of moderate severity.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 F with hypothyroidism, h/o GIB bleeds who presented with afib
w/ RVR and dyspnea and developed melena and acute blood loss
anemia after aspirin started for afib. Patient had a MICU stay
for the GIB. Hospital course summarize below.

Patient was found to be in afib on admission. She was rate
controlled with metoprolol and started on aspirin only after
long discussion given her recent hospitalization for GIB. She
has a h/o TIA and it was thought that maybe she had PAF and
would benefit from anticoagulation over the risk. After being on
aspirin, she developed melana on [**2101-3-7**] and acute blood loss
anemia with a nadar HCT of 21. She received 7 units of PRBC in
the MICU before her HCT stabilized at 27. She was transferred to
the medical floor at this point. She was prepped and had a
colonoscopy which showed an oozing AVM in the cecum which was
cauderized. She was given 1 more unit of PRBC (total 8units) to
bring HCT up to 30. She will need GI follow up. (During last
recent admission for GIB, she was treated with cauderization of
another AVM in the cecum. An EGD then showed no source of
bleeding.)

.
# Afib: As above, this was thought to be likely paroxysmal given
her history of TIA. She could not have a cardioversion as it was
thought the PAF was going on for at least one week.  The cause
of her afib is likely atrial dilitation secondary to lung
disease from tobacco use.  She was started on aspirin only given
her history of GIB (rather than coumadin), but as above, this
was complicated by another GIB. She was initially rate
controlled with metoprolol which was discontinued in the setting
of the GIB and restarted once that was stable.  She likely can
not be anticoagulated in the near future. This issue of
anticoagulation should be addressed as an outpatient.
Metoprolol was restarted once bleeding was stabilized. She was
discharged on metoprolol 25mg TID.

.
# Dyspnea: Mild acute on chronic diastolic CHF on exam initially
was likely from afib with RVR.  CTA in the ED ruled out PE, but
did show some emphysema.  ECHO suggested chronic diastolic
dysfunction.  Again the BB will help the cardiac function. No
ACEI given no systolic dysfunction and BP range around 100
systolic.  Furosemide was started to help control her fluid
status (20mg every other day).

.
# acute blood loss anemia: as above. HCT stable at around 30 at
time of discharge. She also given iron at discharge to help with
the iron deficiency componenet of her anemia.

.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine
.
# Depression: continued fluoxetine

Discharged home with PT after PT eval.
