Please see previous dictated summary for initial history and
hospital course.

Briefly, [**Known lastname 450**] [**Known lastname 1007**] is the former 624 gram product of a
24 and [**5-23**] week gestation pregnancy, born by cesarean
section.  Her initial hospital course was complicated by
respiratory distress syndrome, a right pneumothorax with
pneumomediastinum, patent ductus arteriosus, treated with
Indomethacin.  She was transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] on
[**2114-7-6**] for a ligation of her patent ductus arteriosus.  She
returned to the [**Hospital1 69**] neonatal
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.  This dictation covers
the period from [**2114-7-6**] to [**2114-10-19**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 4051**] has chronic lung
disease.  She was initially on the conventional ventilator
postoperatively with ventilator setting of peak inspiratory
pressure of 22 over a positive end expiratory pressure of six
and intermittent mandatory ventilatory rate of 30 and an
oxygen requirement of 35 to 50%.

She was extubated to continuous positive airway pressure on
[**2114-7-13**] and remained on that therapy through [**2114-9-17**].  With
her evolving chronic lung disease, she was treated with
diuretics.  Lasix was initiated on [**2114-9-15**].  Later Diuril and
Aldactone were added.  Since [**2114-9-17**], she has been on nasal
cannula oxygen, approximately 300 to 600 cc flow of 100%
oxygen.  She has respiratory rates from 40 to 100's with
baseline mild retractions.

2.) Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname 4051**] has a known atrioseptal defect
identified by echocardiogram.  A repeat echocardiogram showed 3-4
mm ASD with RVVO, left ventricular hypertrophy with mid-cavitary
obstruction with gradient 25 mmHg.  This could eventually lead to
left to right ASD shunting.  She is followed by the
cardiology service at [**Hospital3 1810**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and should be re-evaluated in two weeks.

3.) Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 4051**] was restarted
on enteral feeds postoperatively.  Her maximum caloric intake
has been 32 calories per ounce.  She is currently on Neosure
32 calories per ounce with additional Promod protein
supplement, 2 calories by concentration, 4 calories by medium
chain triglyceride oil and 4 calories by Polycose.  She has
been slow to all p.o. feeds and is being evaluated for
possible eventual need for a gastrostomy tube.

[**Known lastname 4051**] is on potassium chloride supplements, [**Name (NI) 47872**] with
her diuretics.  Her most recent set of electrolytes were on
[**2114-10-5**], showing a serum sodium of 137 meq/lt; potassium of
5.7 meq/lt; chloride of 98 and a total carbon dioxide of 30.
Discharge weight is 3.535 kilograms with a corresponding length
of 52 cms and a head circumference of 34 cms.

4.) Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 4051**] has been treated for reflux
with Reglan and Zantac.  She also receives prune juice for
constipation.  As previously noted, she may need eventual
gastrostomy tube placement, depending on her ability to
maintain adequate oral intake.

5.) Hematology:  [**Known lastname 4051**] received two additional blood
transfusions during this period. Her most recent hematocrit
was on [**2114-9-29**] and was 37%. She is blood type 0 positive,
Coomb's negative.

6.) Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 4051**] developed [**Known lastname **] of her
nasal bridge from [**2114-8-5**]. She was evaluated by the
otorhinolaryngology service at [**Hospital3 1810**], Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 47873**].  She was treated with two weeks of antibiotics.  The
first week was Oxacillin and Gentamycin and the second week
was Vancomycin and Ceftazidime.  Blood cultures were
negative.  The [**Known lastname **] resolved.  There have been no other
infectious disease issues.  Of note, [**Known lastname 4051**] is Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization positive.

7.) Neurology:  Previously performed head ultrasounds were
within normal limits and there was no evidence of
periventricular leukomalacia.  [**Known lastname 4051**] has maintained a normal
neurologic examination during the remainder of her admission.

8.) Sensory/audiology:  hearing screening has not yet been
performed.  Ophthalmology:  Initial screening examination for
retinopathy of prematurity was performed on [**2114-7-11**].  At that
time, [**Known lastname 47874**] eyes were immature to zone two. A subsequent
examination two weeks later showed stage I ROP.  [**Known lastname 4051**] has
been followed weekly since that time.  On [**2114-8-23**], she was
noted to have stage II disease to zone two and she has
continued with stage II disease in zone two through her most
recent examination on [**2114-10-15**] which showed one clock hour on
the right and two clock hours on the left.  Recommended
follow-up in one week which would be due on [**2114-10-22**].

Her ophthalmologist through [**Hospital3 1810**] is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and she can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43283**].

9.) Psychosocial:  [**Hospital1 69**]
