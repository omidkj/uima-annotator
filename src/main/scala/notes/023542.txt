[**2178-4-7**] knee films:FINDINGS: Two views are provided, with no
comparisons on record. The patient is status post below-knee
amputation with the proximal tibial and fibular margins, sharp
and regular. The soft tissue stump is, overall, unremarkable in
appearance. There may be a small superficial ulcer, anteriorly,
with no evidence of deeper subcutaneous emphysema or gas-filled
tract reaching the underlying bone. There is amorphous
radiodense material in the deep soft tissues between the stump
margin and the fibular resection site, which may represent
heterotopic ossification, dressing material within the deep
ulcer, or less likely, retained surgical material. The knee
joint, itself, is unremarkable, with no effusion or acute
osseous abnormality. Noted is vascular calcification.

IMPRESSION: Status post below-knee amputation, with sharp
surgical margins. There remains probable ulceration, anteriorly,
and amorphous radiodense material may represent implanted
dressing/sponge, but should be closely correlated clinically.
There is no definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
[**2178-4-7**] CXR: Study is markedly limited secondary to significant
patient rotation. There is a hemodialysis catheter, with the tip
in the SVC. There is a right pleural effusion, an area of
increased opacity in the right lower lobe which is difficult to
assess due to the marked rotation. No definite pneumothorax
seen.

IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to patient rotation. Right
pleural effusion, and questionable opacity in the right lower
lobe
.
EKG:Sinus tachycardia. Modest low amplitude lateral T waves are
non-specific and may be within normal limits. No previous
tracing available for comparison


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo male with multiple medical problems, recent sepsis and R
knee [**Name (NI) 6024**] who was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and
unresponsiveness.
.
Given the patient's elevated lactate, it was thought that his
hypotension was most likely due to sepsis.  Early goal-directed
therapy was initiated in the ED and continued on arrival to the
ICU.  The patient was given broad spectrum antibiotics including
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn given recent instrumentation
and possible new opacity on chest x-ray.  Vascular surgery was
consulted in the ED to evaluate his surgical wounds.  It was
felt by the surgery team that his wound was most likely not the
source of infection as the site appeared relatively clean, with
no frank pus.  Plain films were done and did not show any
evidence of osteomyelitis, emphysema, or effusion.  Renal was
also consulted as he was a dialysis patient.  It was felt that
he did not require acute HD at that time, and it was recommended
to pursue CVVH overnight if the patient became more overloaded
with fluid resuscitation.  His elevated troponin in the setting
of ESRD and hypotension was thought to be from demand rather
than ACS, as his CK enzymes were flat and his EKG did not have
any ST changes suggestive of ischemia.  An echo was ordered to
assess for any wall motion abnormalities and it was planned to
obtain his medical record from the VA to better understand his
cardiac history.
Although the patient was found to be unresponsive in the ED, he
was awake and oriented x 2 on arrival to the ICU.  He was able
to follow commands and answer some questions.  He repeatedly
remarked "just let me go".  The need for the IVF, antibiotics,
and possible pressors was explained to the patient multiple
times.  His daughter and HCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] by phone and she
arrived to the ICU about two hours after the patient was
admitted.  She explained that the patient was DNR/DNI and that
we "should listen to him and just let him go".  She stated that
she did not want central line placement, pressors, or
antibiotics.  She explained that he had endured a prolonged
hospitalization at the VA, and that he had wanted to stop all
care at that point, but that she pushed him to hold on and
continue.  She said now she just wanted to honor his wishes.
Another daughter was also present for the conversation, and it
was discussed with both family members and the patient about
what the cause of his hospitalization was thought to be, what
role the antibiotics and IVF played in treating him, and that if
these measures were to be stopped, he would most likely die.
Both the patient and the family expressed understanding of these
risks, but still wanted to stop care and make him comfortable.
The overnight intensivist was notified of the patient and his
family's wishes and the plan to withdraw care; agreed with the
decision as the patient and family were competent.  The patient
was given a dose of morphine to help with his progressing
respiratory distress.
The patient became apneic, bradycardic, and eventually
asystolic.  He was pronounced dead at 10:17 pm.  His family
members were present at the bedside.  The overnight intensivist
was notified.  An autopsy was offered and decli
