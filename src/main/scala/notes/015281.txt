Service:  GYNECOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] initially presented
with increased urinary frequency over the past couple of
years as well as incontinence.  On examination, she was noted
to have an enlarged mass.  The patient had an ultrasound
revealing an 18 x 13.6 x 20 cm echoic mass consistent with a
large right ovarian mass.  She also had a 7 x 8 x 4 x 5.5 cm
cystic mass in the left ovary.  The uterus appeared normal
and had a 4 mm endometrial stripe.  The patient has a
significant cardiac medical history as well as diabetes
mellitus.  She was seen preoperatively by her primary care
provider as well as her cardiologist and received medical
clearance.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed
myocardial infarction 7/[**2176**].  The patient presented to an
outside institution with congestive heart failure and mild
chest pain.  The patient was noted to be having an acute
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzyme and EKG changes.  She
was then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**]
where she underwent cardiac catheterization.  She had a stent
placed in the LAD.  The patient has a history of congestive
heart failure, hypertension, pacemaker placed in [**11/2176**],
type II diabetes mellitus which is insulin requiring, and
sleep apnea.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg q. day, Atenolol,
Captopril, ASA, NPH Insulin 40 units q.a.m. and 35 units
q.p.m.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This patient was initially from [**Country 11150**] and
does not speak English.  The patient has a very supportive
family.  The patient denies tobacco, ethanol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs were stable.
In general, the patient was in no acute distress.  HEENT
examination revealed nonicteric sclerae.  Lymph node survey
was negative.  The lungs were clear to auscultation.  The
heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was
soft and distended.  A large mass was palpated in the midline
approximately 4 cm superior to the umbilicus.  The mass
appeared mobile.  Pelvic examination revealed a small uterus
with a normal appearing cervix.  The rectovaginal examination
was notable for the large mass.  No rectovaginal nodularity
was noted.  The extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing,
or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative hematocrit was 37.5.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE
Serous cystadenoma:  On [**2177-2-20**], the patient was taken to
the Operating Room and underwent an examination under
anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omental
biopsy, and aspiration of cyst.  Greater than 2 liters of
serous fluid was aspirated from the right cystadenoma.  The
patient had a normal uterus and fallopian tubes.  The patient
received a total of 2,300 cc of intravenous fluids
intraoperatively and had 55 cc urine output.  The total
estimated blood loss was 50 cc.  The patient did very well
intraoperatively and there were no complications.  The
patient was extubated and moved to the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit.  Immediately upon arrival to the PACU, the patient was
noted to have rales and clinically appeared to be in heart
failure.

Cardiac:  As previously mentioned, shortly after arrival in
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was noted to
clinically be in congestive heart failure.  The patient had
bilateral crackles halfway.  The patient received 40 mg of
intravenous Lasix with a mild diuresis.  Several hours later,
the patient still appeared clinically to be in congestive
heart failure and a chest x-ray confirmed this diagnosis.
The patient's breathing became more and more labored and the
decision was made to re-intubate and transfer the patient to
the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was managed in the
Intensive Care Unit from postoperative day #0 until
postoperative day #4.  The patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  The CKs were in
the 200 range and the MB fraction was negative.  The patient
was started on Lasix 40 mg IV b.i.d. and she had a good
diuresis.  On postoperative day #2, the patient was changed
to 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  By postoperative day #2, the patient
had diuresed well and her vital signs were stable.  In
addition to the Lasix, the patient received intravenous
Lopressor, Enalapril, aspirin, and Nitroglycerin paste.
There were no EKG changes.  On postoperative day #3, the
patient was extubated.  On postoperative day #4, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  The patient's Lasix was weaned
from 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 40 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient was
continued on her cardiac medications and remained stable.

Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated on postoperative day
#3.  Immediately after extubation, the patient was noted to
have expiratory wheezes.  Respiratory care was involved
throughout her hospitalization and the patient was started on
Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers.  Once being transferred to
the floor, the patient also was on Flovent and Atrovent
metered dose inhalers.  The patient's pulmonary examination
improved during the hospitalization and her lungs were clear
on the day of discharge.

Infectious disease:  Early on postoperative day #3, the
patient spiked a temperature to 100.8.  She had a chest
x-ray, a urine culture, and a blood culture sent.  Blood
cultures are still pending at the time of this dictation.
The chest x-ray was equivocal but did not show an obvious
area of consolidation.  The patient was noted to have thick
yellow sputum from her endotracheal tube.  A gram stain of
her sputum showed 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
The final respiratory culture was sparse growth.  The patient
was started on Levofloxacin for a seven day course.  The
patient had no further temperature spikes.

Endocrine:  The patient has a history of type II diabetes,
insulin requiring.  On postoperative day #1, the patient was
on an insulin drip.  By postoperative day #3, the patient was
not requiring any further insulin.  After the patient started
tolerating p.o., the patient was changed to an insulin
sliding scale.  The patient's blood sugars were between the
high 100s and low 300s.  Once the patient was tolerating a
regular diet, the patient was started on NPH Insulin at her
usual regimen of 40 units q.a.m. and 35 units q.p.m.  During
the hospitalization, she was followed by her primary
endocrinologist.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was
initially NPO and on postoperative day #5 was advanced to
clears.  The patient was then started on a low sodium, [**Doctor First Name **]
diet.

Genitourinary:  The patient had a Foley catheter until
postoperative day #5.  The Foley catheter was removed on
postoperative day #5 and the patient had no difficulty
voiding spontaneously.

Hematology:  During the Intensive Care Unit stay, the
patient's platelets were noted to drop from the 170,000s down
to 115,000.  Of note, the patient was on Zantac at this time.
There was a question as to whether or not the
thrombocytopenia was induced by Zantac.  The patient's Zantac
was discontinued on postoperative day #4 and her platelets
trended upward after this time.

Postoperative:  The final pathology result returned serous
cystadenoma.  The omental biopsy was negative.  From a
postoperative standpoint, the patient did very well.  Once
transferred to the floor, she began ambulating to chair with
assistance.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Bilateral serous cystadenoma;
postoperative congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day, Flovent 4
puffs b.i.d., Albuterol 2-4 puffs q. 4 hours p.r.n.,
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. x a total of 4 days, Digoxin 0.25 mg
p.o. q. day, Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Captopril 12.5 mg
p.o. t.i.d., Nitroglycerin paste 1 inch q. 6 hours, ASA 325
mg p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 40 units subq. q.a.m. and 35
units subq. q.p.m.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to home
with followup by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5166**] in two to four weeks.  The
patient was also to follow up with her
