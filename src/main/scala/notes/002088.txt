CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2110-5-6**] 9:21 AM
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis without other abnormalities.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2110-5-13**] 5:32 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left main pulmonary embolus of unclear chronicity.
2. No significant change in appearance of peri-pancreatic air
and fluid collections.
3. No change in multiple hypoattenuating renal lesions.
4. Interval decrease in hypoattenuating liver lesions likely
indicative of subcapsular fluid collection.
5. No significant change in right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
6. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
ECHO [**2110-5-14**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2110-5-15**] 9:59 AM
IMPRESSION: Left cephalic vein thrombosis in the mid distal
upper arm. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2110-5-16**] 12:40 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to prior exam from [**2110-5-13**], there is decreased
size of collection containing fluid and gas within the
pancreatic bed. Extensive peripancreatic stranding and fluid
extending down the root of the mesentary is grossly unchanged.
Small fluid collections are seen surrounding the residual
pancreatic tissue within the head and neck consistent with
pseudocysts, not significantly changed from prior exam.
2 Arterial vasculature including the celiac, hepatic, splenic,
left gastric, gastroduodenal arteries are intact. The portal
vein is patent. The splenic vein and SMV are not visualized and
likely obliterated, unchanged.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural
effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2110-5-16**]  11:36:36 AM

non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing ST-T wave
changes are
new.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2110-5-19**] 3:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased size of left pleural effusion with associated
relaxation atelectasis. There is increased size of perisplenic
fluid collection.
2. No significant change in size and appearance to pancreatic
collection containing fluid and gas with an intraluminal drain.
No fistula is demonstrated, however, for better evaluation of a
fistulous connection, injection of contrast into the drains
would be of use. Of note, this should only be performed after
the current contrast within the bowel has passed.
3. Cholelithiasis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2110-5-22**] 4:16 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there
is again evidence of increased opacification at the left base
consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. Much improved
lung volumes since the previous study. Right subclavian catheter
tip lies either at the cavoatrial junction or into the upper
aspect of the right atrium itself.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2110-5-25**] 4:21 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in size of a pancreatic gas and
fluid-containing collection with two drains well positioned
within the collection. No evidence of oral contrast
extravasation to suggest a fistula.
2. Stranding extends from the pancreatic collection to the
descending colon, however, there is no definite evidence of a
fistula.
3. Complex pseudocyst about the pancreatic head is approximately
unchanged in size but contains new focus of gas, possibly
tracking from the adjacent collection.
4. Unchanged large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Unchanged subxiphoid calcified mass.
.
ERCP BILIARY ONLY BY GI UNIT  [**2110-5-30**] 1:25 PM
IMPRESSION: No contrast filling of the pancreatic or biliary
ducts.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-6-4**] 7:34 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable severe left pleural effusion with mild left to right
shift of the cardiomediastinal structure and stable left lower
lobe atelectasis.
2. Right internal jugular line tip is in the right atrium and
needs to be positioned.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2110-6-9**] 10:19 AM

IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or small bowel obstruction is
visualized. No pneumoperitoneum is noted.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2110-6-13**] 1:27 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval decrease in size of gas- and fluid-containing
collection in the pancreatic bed. Consideration may be given to
slightly retracting both drains which are coiled several times
within the collection. No new collections are seen.
2. Interval progression of ascites, which is now moderate in
amount.
3. Increased anasarca.
4. Chronic thrombus seen in left sided pulmonary arteries,
unchanged since [**2110-5-13**].
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2110-6-14**] 11:29 AM
NG tube tip is in the stomach. The side port is just distal to
the GE junction. Multiple surgical clips project in the left
hemi abdomen. There is no evidence of obstruction. Few small
bowel loops are prominent on the right side, measuring up to 25
mm. Patient has known ascites.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
