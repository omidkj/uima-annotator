History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a PMH of CAD, moderate AS,
and COPD admitted with acute onset dyspnea. The patient has a
history of multiple hospitalizations for acute heart failure
felt related to anemia, transient ischemia
leading to acute-on-chronic [**Age over 90 7216**] dysfunction and pulmonary
edema. He has been followed in cardiology clinic and has
declined further attempts at revascularization. He was recently
admitted from [**Date range (1) 62048**] with acute CHF and was diureses,
discharged home on increase dose of lasix (20mg daily). He was
again admitted from [**Date range (1) 29263**] for dyspnea and lasix was
increased further to 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
The patient presented to the ED with complaints of sudden onset
dyspnea over the past 1 hour prior to presentation. He denied
chest pain, denied palpatations. No fever/chills. +[**4-16**] word
dyspnea. +b/l lower extremity edema. He reported recent increase
in rhinorrhea. Initial vitals: T 97.5, HR 96, BP 102/60, RR 28,
O2 100% on neb. He was given levaquin 750mg IV and solumedrol
125mg IV as well as combivent neb. O2 sat found to be 100% on 4L
following neb and pt reported improvement in dyspnea. He was
then given lasix 20mg IV with subequent decrease in BP to 89/39.
Given ASA 325mg. BP improved to 99/53 without intervention. ECG
unchanged from prior. BNP elevated to 7291. Response to lasix
not recorded. He is now being admitted to the CCU for further
management, concern for brief episode of hypotension.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2124-3-8**] 2:44 PM There is a
new infiltrate at the right lung base. In addition there is
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette consistent with congestive heart failure
which has increased compared to prior. There is probable
background interstitial lung disease. Cystic degenerative change
of the left humeral head is noted as before. No soft tissue
abnormality is detected. IMPRESSION:  1. Findings consistent
with congestive heart failure. 2. Possible infiltrate in the
right lung base. 3. Probable underlying interstitial lung
disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a PMH of CAD, moderate AS, and COPD
admitted with acute onset dyspnea. He has had multiple recent
admission for SOB. This admission seems to be related to
bronchospasm. Improved with bronchodilators. BNP is well below
baseline of recent admissions. There is concern that he is
having transient ischemic events leading to worsening [**Age over 90 7216**]
dysfunction which is exacerbating his symptoms. Ultimately he
was both diuresed and treated with bronchodilators and inhaled
steroids and anticholinergics. He was discharged clinically
doing well with close follow up. Pt refused rehab and was
discharged home.
.
#. Dyspnea - The patient presents with acute onset dyspnea,
similar to prior admissions. His description seems consistent
with bronchospasm and he improved with a combination of
bronchodilators, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled steroids, and
diuresis. His symptoms are complicated by CHF given evidence of
volume overload on exam and CXR. BNP elevated though decreased
from prior. The patient has no evidence of CE elevation or new
ischemic ECG changes. He likely has episodes of transient
ischemia leading to acute-on-chronic [**Age over 90 7216**] dysfunction and
pulmonary edema as described prior. He was discharged on
Spiriva, albuterol, and his home diuretic regimen.
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease - s/p BMS to OM2, D1, Left circumflex
in [**2122-11-16**] for unstable angina - pt has declined further
attempts at revascularization. No current acute ischemic changes
on ECG. Troponins negative x3 sets. Continued ASA, metoprolol,
and statin at home doses.
.
#. Moderate Aortic Stenosis - careful diuresis given increased
preload dependence. Continued BB and ACE-I as above, on ACE I as
outpatient.
.
# Gout: On allopurinol. Started cholchicine at home dose for
exacerbation s/p diuresis.
.
#. COPD - scheduled for outpatient PFTs. Started patient on
spiriva with albuterol PRN with improvement of symptoms (see
above).
.
#. Chronic GI Bleeds ?????? Stable. Pt has had GIB in past on Plavix.
HCT stable this admission. On PPI.
