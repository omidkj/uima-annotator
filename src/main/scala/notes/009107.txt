Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPap

History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with a history of prostate cancer, COPD with an FEV1 33%
predicted, and cirrhosis presents from his group home with
cough. Patient is a poor historian, but reports 2-3 days of new
onset cough productive of clear sputum. He denies fevers,
chills, dyspnea, PND, chest pain, and LE swelling. EMS
documentation noted an initial peripheral saturation of 50% with
altered mental status, which approved on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, initial vital signs noted that patient was
99.7, 118, 114/53, 24, 100% NRB, and exam noted diffuse
wheezing, and occasional scattered rhonchi. Xray revealed a
possible retrocardiac infiltrate, so he was treated with Vanco 1
g IVx1, Ceftriaxone 1 g IV x1, and levaquin 750 mg IV x1, as
well as solumedrol 125 mg IV x1 and combivent nebs x1. On
transfer, VS were 101 bpm, 106/57, 15, 100% NRB.
.
In the ICU, the patient reported breathing feels at baseline. He
continues to deny chest pain.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
- Schizophrenia (followed by [**Hospital1 2447**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4135**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 65647**])
- Prostate Ca on lupron since [**2154**]
- Anemia of chronic disease with macrocytosis.
- Cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by the liver center until
recently, but he no longer wishes to see hepatology. It is
thought to be probably secondary to prior alcohol abuse.
- COPD with FeV1 33% in [**2154**]
- compression fracture status post vertebroplasty.
- very large inguinoscrotal hernia, for which he has deferred
surgery.
- Pyruvate kinase deficiency
- splenomegaly.
- status post cholecystectomy.

Social History:
Lives at a group home for his schizophrenia ([**Street Address(1) 65648**])
which has help daily, but not at night. Ex-wife [**Name (NI) 2411**] is still
quite involved. Smokes 1 PPD for "a long time", approximately 20
years. Reports prior history of etoh abuse, approximately 10
beers per day for about 20 years. Denies IVDU.

Family History:
He has 4 sisters that he does not keep in regular contact with.
Unsure of what his parents died from.

[**2158-6-20**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage. Late R wave
progression. Minor T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2157-10-7**] the atrial ectopy is not seen at a faster
rate.

CXR [**2158-6-21**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, an area of parenchymal
opacity has newly occurred at the right lung base. Although, the
area could correspond to atelectasis, the possibility of early
pneumonia should not be discarded in the appropriate clinical
context. Minimal new retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal
overhydration that is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly. No
pleural effusions.

[**2158-6-21**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal
free wall contractility. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-12**], the
findings are similar with normal biventricular systolic
function, dilated right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2158-6-23**]):    No MRSA isolated.
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2158-6-21**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2158-6-20**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS
CONSISTENT WITH
                                    OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2158-6-22**]):
      MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE, BETA-LACTAMASE NEGATIVE.
MODERATE GROWTH.
         Beta-lactamse negative: presumptively sensitive to
ampicillin.
         Confirmation should be requested in cases of treatment
failure in
         life-threatening infections..


Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with a history of prostate cancer, COPD with an FEV1 33%
predicted, and cirrhosis who presented from his group home with
hypoxia found to have a pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation.
.
#. Pneumonia, Hypoxia: Diagnosis supported by leukocytosis, high
normal temperature, symptoms and consolidation on CXR in the
setting of a respiratory culture which grew H.flu. He was
initially covered for HCAP with double gram negative coverage
with 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluroquinolone, and
vancomycin for MRSA coverag
