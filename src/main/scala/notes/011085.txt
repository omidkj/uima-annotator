Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital6 1597**] s/p IV TPA for
consideration of IA TPA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Nasogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76yo handed woman who is transferred from OSH
where she received iv tPA following a R-MCA stroke for
evaluation for intraarterial tPA.

On the day of presentation, the patient woke up around 6 am. She
wa fine until about 8.30 am. At that time, she was dressing and
fell to the left, unable to stand up. Per EMS she had dense
L-hemi and gaze preference. She complained of a pressure type
feeling across the R-temple. She was brought to OSH where she
had NIHSS 19 (details not available). She underwent CT and MRI
head with perfusion and diffusion that showed a clot in the R-M1
segments and a distal embolus in the ACA. The patient received
iv tPA at 11.08 (bolus of 5.7mg then 51mg over an hour; all per
protocol). She was noted to improve some with respect to her
ocular movements (no longer gaze preference) and L-leg movements
(able to move upon command). She said her pressure feeling
across the R-temple was improving
some.

She then was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she arrived at 13.40.
Upon arrival she was awake, alert though feeling tired. She can
tell what happened the morning of presentation (that she fell),
but does not understand what is going on. No pain other than the
mild pressure at the R-side of her head. Her NIHSS was 12. BP
125/53, heart rate regular.

She was seen in the past by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic for
lightheadedness, thought to be due to her antihypertensive
medications.

MRI/MRA ([**8-16**]): Acute infarction involving the territory of the
right lateral lenticulostriate arteries. No flow signal
demonstrated within the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral
artery.

CT: ([**8-17**]): Acute hemorrhage within the area of infarction
involving the
right lateral lenticulostriate territory, with intraventricular
extension of hemorrhage into both lateral ventricles, the third
and fourth ventricles. Minimal leftward subfalcine shift of
midline structures is noted.

ECHO ([**8-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.

EEG:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is a continuous
mixed
[**3-31**] Hz theta and 3 Hz delta frequency slowing seen in the right
posterior temporal region with phase reversing around T4 and T6.
In
addition, there are frequent sharp epileptiform discharges
occasionally
followed with a slow wave recording.
BACKGROUND: Over the left hemisphere shows a 10 Hz moderate
voltage
alpha frequency rhythm with normal anterior-posterior voltage
gradient.
The entire background over the right hemisphere is slow and
disorganized. See above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed because the patient is
intubated.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed because this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: Normal transitions of the sleep architecture were not
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
continuous mixed theta and delta frequency slowing over the
right
posterior region. This would be due to continuous mixed theta
and delta
frequency slowing over the right posterior temporal region with
frequent
epileptiform sharp discharges occasionally followed with slow
waves.
This finding suggests a structural abnormality involving
subcortical and
cortical structures in this region. Considering electrographic
seizures, a long term monitoring might be of benefit.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 76yo woman transferred from OSH where she received
iv tPA following a R-MCA stroke. She developed asystole,
bradycardia and HTN, and was found to have hemorrhage into the
stroke. See hospital course below for details:

Neurologic: Received IV-TPA at 2.5 hours at OSH. NIHHSS went
from 19->12 and then stabilized. Was admitted to ICU where
pressures were maintained
