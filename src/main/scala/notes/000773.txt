Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old male with
no known previous diagnosed coronary artery disease and a
history of diabetes mellitus who was transferred from [**Hospital6 27375**] for cardiac catheterization after he
developed shortness of breath with difficulty breathing.  He
had been noticing increasing dyspnea on exertion.  When he
presented to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital he was found to be in
congestive heart failure.  He was then started on Lasix, an
ACE inhibitor and enteric coated aspirin.  It was thought
that the shortness of breath was secondary to ischemia.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] on the [**2-14**] for a cardiac catheterization for
subsequent work up after he had an electrocardiogram that
showed recent T-wave inversions in V4 to 6.  The patient had
noticed a prior episode about two weeks before presentation
and again six months prior.  The patient had had no chest
pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus
2.  Hypertension
3.  Hypercholesterolemia
4.  Vitiligo
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency
6.  Anxiety

MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q hs
2.  Enalapril 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
4.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd
5.  Lorazepam prn
6.  Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  His temperature was 97.3??????, pulse 66, blood
pressure 175/85, saturating 97% on three liters O2 by nasal
cannula.
APPEARANCE:  Pleasant middle aged white male lying
comfortably in bed.
NECK:  Jugular venous distention about 7 cm, no carotid
bruits.
LUNGS:  Slight basilar crackles bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, 2+ groin pulses, no bruits.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace bilateral edema.

LABS:  His white blood count was 9.0, hematocrit 36.5,
platelets count 163.  PT 13.3, PTT 41.9, INR 1.2, calcium
8.8, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.9.  ALT 9, AST 9.  His
troponin was 0.22.  His CKs were negative.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, no
ischemic STs.  Echocardiogram done on the [**2-15**] showed
an ejection fraction of 30% with left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Cardiac catheterization done the [**2-15**]
showed three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was taken to
the Operating Room on [**2173-6-17**] where a five vessel
coronary artery bypass graft was performed.  He tolerated the
procedure well.  It was found postoperatively that the
patient was found postoperatively to have some upper and
lower extremity weakness with decreased bilateral hand grips.
Over the course of the next few days, his neurologic status
noted some improvement, however he continued to have some
clumsiness on his left side.  Neurology was consulted and he
was thought to have had a perioperative stroke.  Head CT was
performed and he a had a bilateral complex duplex study done.

Head CT showed multiple chronic lacunar infarcts with a
possible lesion in the right parietal area.  Carotid duplex
showed greater than 90% right ICA stenosis with significant
plaque and 60% to 69% stenosis on the left internal carotid
artery with moderate plaque.  The patient was continued on
aspirin which he had been on pre and postoperatively.  He was
transfused to keep his hematocrit above 30 and blood pressure
was managed above 140 systolic.  The patient otherwise had an
uncomplicated postoperative recovery with respect to his
cardiac status and is found to be stable for discharge to an
acute rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post five vessel coronary bypass grafting
2.  Perioperative stroke
3.  Diabetes mellitus
4.  Hypertension
5.  Hypercholesterolemia
6.  Vitiligo
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with vascular surgery
in three weeks and follow up with neurology, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 623**], #[**Telephone/Fax (1) **], in six to eight weeks.  The patient
is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] in three to four weeks.
