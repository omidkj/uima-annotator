Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
 Patient intubated and history is per report and record review.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single
cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia,
streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced
hepatitis who presents with fever and productive cough. The
cough started 3 weeks ago and has been productive of green
sputum, and associated with mild shortness of breath,
nausea/vomiting (attributed to Gleevec), and fatigue. She saw
her oncologist on [**2114-11-6**] for a followup, was afebrile with O2
sat 91,RA, and was noted to have a WBC of 11.2. She was started
on azithromycin and advised to return to clinic in 3 days.
Today, she noted difficulty breathing and fevers/chills/night
sweats, as well as cough, with symptoms worse the past two days.
She also reports anorexia and [**7-1**]# wt loss. Her O2 sat was noted
to be 86 on RA, improving to 95 on 3L NC. Blood cultures and flu
swab were obtained and she was referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were: 99.5 88 120/76 28 96% on 5L
NC. On exam, she was dry with diminished breath sounds and right
sided crackles, and tachycardia. A CT of the chest was ordered
looking for possible PCP and showed evidence of infection with
multifocal airspace opacities. She was started on vancomycin and
aztreonam, in addition to continuing her current azithromycin.
While in the ED, her respiratory status worsened, becoming more
tachypneic and hypoxic requiring intubation. Her recent vitals
(prior to intubation) show RR 32, HR 124, 127/83 and O2 sat of
76,RA -> 96,3L. She received 4L IVF in the ED. Cannot perform
ROS as pt is intubated and sedated.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
====================
Diagnosed with [**Location (un) 5622**] Chromosome positive pre-B cell ALL
in [**2113-11-25**]

administered. Fluid non-diagnostic but as high suspicion for CSF
disease started on twice weekly methotrexate
---[**2113-12-28**]: CSF sample from confirmed CNS involvement of ALL
---[**2115-1-1**] CSF sample from  was negative for ALL so IT MTX
discontinued
- [**2114-1-17**]: Part B hyperCVAD of cycle 1 was started (IT chemo
was
limited to D6 ara-C on [**2114-1-22**] to minimize neurotoxicity)
- [**2114-2-2**]: Cycle 2 (Part A) of hyperCVAD started
- [**2114-3-5**]: Cycle 2 (Part B) hyperCVAD chemotherapy started
- [**2114-4-5**]: IT MTX administered

Radiology:
CT Chest w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: New-onset airspace opacification with air
bronchograms of the
right upper lobes, lower lobes and middle portion of the right
middle lobe
with patchy diffusely distributed opacification in the left lung
with an
associated right pleural effusion, suggests the possibility of
an infectious process, such as multifocal bacterial pneumonia.
However, considering the patient's clinical history of recent
bone marrow transplantation, an atypical pneumonia must be
included in the differential diagnosis (fungal, mycobacterial,
viral organisms). Pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage are
less likely, as the patient's history does not have
corroborating symptoms for the same.

TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and
single cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia,
streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced
hepatitis who presents with pneumonia/sepsis and respiratory
failure.
.
# Respiratory failure:
Consistent with ARDS in setting on severe PNA. Very large A-a
gradient on admission. Placed on ARDS-NET protocol.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was negative, and flu
cultures were negative. TB was ruled out with negative BAL,
despite patient's history of latent TB. Sputum cultures did not
show any bacteria. On Bronchoscopy, nothing significant was
visualized in the airways. BAL was negative for PCP; there was
some concern that inhaled pentamidine could make a BAL appear
falsely negative and diagnosis could require a tissue biopsy,
but the beta-glucan was also negative, which was reassuring for
rule out of PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had been started empirically on
treatment doses of bactrim for PCP until the first beta-glucan
returned negative.  She was restarted on prophylactic doses of
bactrim, per BMT recommendations. Since her LFTs were beginning
to rise, bactrim was discontinued, as she has a history of
elevated LFTs in the setting of this medication.
.
Cardiac causes of respiratory failure were considered, but a TTE
showed hyperdynamic function with LVEF> 55%, mild pulm htn,
trivial pericardial effusion, and no valvular disease, so this
was not likely to cause a compromise in respiratory function.
.

The patient was very difficult to oxygenate for much of her ICU
stay.  She was often desynchronous with the ventilator, often
over-breathing the ventilator on volume control but not able to
tolerate pressure control or pressure support ventilation
modalities intitially. Eventually, she was able to tolerate AC
settings with increased sedation, and only brief trials on
pressure support with less sedati
