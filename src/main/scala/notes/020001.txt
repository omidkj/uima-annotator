Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, difficulty breathing.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 44 yoM w/ HTN and ESRD on HD presents c/o 2 days of
left-sided pleuritic chest pain. He describes the pain as
constant, "like I'm drowning," worse with inspiration/cough, no
change with exertion or position. No associated with
palpitations, light-headedness, or diaphoresis. He also notes
cough productive of white sputum and hemoptysis, rust colored
sputum, associated with SOB X 2 days. The pt also noted LE
edema, PND, and orthopnea. He missed dialysis yesterday, as his
mother was ill. The pt does not remember the names of his BP
medicines. He reported bitemporal headache x 1 day, but denies
numbness, tingling, change in vision.  He had also expereienced
several episodes of n/v in the days prior to admission. No
fevers, chills, abdominal pain, melena, BRBPR, recent NSAID use.

   On arrival to the ED, the pt was noted to have BP 190/140,
with LE edema. He received 8 mg IV morphine, metoprolol 10 mg IV
X 1, 40 mg IV lasix, and was started on a nitro gtt,
subsequently transitioned to a labetolol gtt. A CTA was (-) for
PE. CXR was c/w mild CHF. Concombinant PNA was also considered,
given the h/o hemoptysis, n/v, cough.  He received ceftriaxone 1
g IV X 1. At around 4 a.m., he had an episode of coffee-ground
emesis just prior to transfer to MICU.
   Despite hematemesis, hct remained stably low at 23-25 over
the three day period since admission. Trops were slightly
elevated, thought [**1-16**] subendocardial ischemia from hypertensive
emergency. SOB improved after fluid status corrected by
dialysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the ED, the pt was noted to have BP 190/140, with
LE edema. He received 8 mg IV morphine, metoprolol 10 mg IV X 1,
40 mg IV lasix, and was started on a nitro gtt, subsequently
transitioned to a labetolol gtt. A CTA was (-) for PE. CXR was
c/w mild CHF. Concombinant PNA was also considered, given the
h/o hemoptysis, n/v, cough.  He received ceftriaxone 1 g IV X 1.
At around 4 a.m., he had an episode of coffee-ground emesis just
prior to transfer to MICU.
   Despite hematemesis, hct remained stably low at 23-25 over
the three day period since admission. Trops were slightly
elevated, thought [**1-16**] subendocardial ischemia from hypertensive
emergency. SOB improved after fluid status corrected by
dialysis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
44 yoM w/ ESRD on HD p/w hypertensive emergency and respiratory
distress [**1-16**] fluid overload and acute CHF after missing HD, and
likely non-adherence with BP meds. By transfer to medicine
service on HD #3, pt was breathing comfortably with BP above
ideal, though controlled. The pt remained in house for the last
3 days of the hospital course only for titration of BP meds. The
pt was switched off of beta blockers because of history of
cocaine use.
.
1) Hypertension: Admitted with HTN emergency. MAP in ED was 160
with papilledema, chest pain, CHF. Controlled with nitro gtt,
then labetolol gtt, transitioned to PO meds, mainly metoprolol.
Switched metoprolol to Dilt for rate control of sinus tach and
also or BP control, because of cocaine use, and concern of
unopposed alpha stimulation. Control was much improved with PO
meds. HR with improved control on max dose dilt.
-BP control now with max dose dilt and Imdur, as well as ACE.
-fluid management with regular HD schedule as outpt.
-note: pt was previously on Cozaar and atenolol alone.
.
2) Respiratory distress. By HD #3, pt was transferred to
Medicine from MICU, breathing comfortably. Initally in MICU, pt
was initially on 100% NRB satting in low 90s, ABG 7.17/45/109.
Likely metabolic acidosis with inadequate respiratory
compensation. He was then placed on CPAP and oxygenation
improved.
.
3)Chest tightness: Pt claims that he was never stressed or
cathed. Pt has had episodes of chest-tightness. Cardiac enzymes
(-) x 3.
-maintain good BP control. Continue ASA
-instruct pt to avoid cocaine use.
-consider outpt stress
.
4) Hemoptysis: Resolved. PE was ruled out with CTA. Pt completed
abx x 2 days for possible PNA.
-scheduled for oupt CT scan [**8-5**].
.
5) Anemia/Coffee ground emesis: hct remained stable for 5 days
in house. uremic plt dysfxn and CRI were contributing, retic
0.5. Ddx includes gastritis, PUD, [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Last Name (un) **] tear (h/o
retching and EtOH abuse), esophagitis.
-considering outpt EGD
-continue Protonix 40 mg IV BID
.
6) ESRD:
-renal following. continue HD.
-continue renagel and calcium
-closely monitor lytes in the setting of hyperkalemia
.
7) CHF: [**Month (only) 116**] have had some subendocardial ischemia given small
trop leak, was likely [**1-16**] fluid overload and hypertension.
-continue HD
-BP control
.
8) Anemia: Most likely chronic anemia [**1-16**] ESRD with superimposed
UGI bleed. Retic 0.5 reveals that pt is significantly
hypoproliferative.
- HCT stable over the last week.
- EPO with dialysis.
.
9) Hematuria: ongoing bleeding, likely due to foley trauma.
Evaluated by Urology.
-follow bleeding
.
10) F/E/N:
- monitor fluids and electrolytes closely with renal failure
.
11) Ppx: Protonix, pneumoboots
.
12) Access: 1 PIV,
.
13) Code: Full Code
.
14) Communication: patient, mother (number in chart)
