History of Present Illness:
ADMISSION NOTE TO TSICU SERVICE:
86yo M on coumadin for AFib who recently [**First Name3 (LF) 1834**] excision
of a 4cm R inguinal cyst by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] on [**2149-5-20**], c/b wound
infection s/p bedside I&D on [**2149-5-28**]. On that return he was
noted to have altered mental status, improved with drainage,
antibiotics, and rate control of his AFib, permitting discharge

by the medical service on [**2149-5-31**]. He was placed on a lovenox
bridge to coumadin at that time. According to the records from
rehab, he had another episode of unresponsiveness on [**2149-6-1**],
which resolved spontaneously. On [**6-3**] had another episode of
unresponsiveness, reportedly hemodynamically stable, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. On arrival here
described by [**Name8 (MD) **] RN as awake and interactive. After placement of

nasal cannula, developed epistaxis, which has been only
partially
relieved with afrin and packing by the ED staff. Has already
undergone neurosurgical evaluation for small SDH, who feel
likely
artifact / chronic and not causative for his current mental
status changes. Surgical consult called due to large R flank
hematoma and anemia (prior baseline 40). There is no
documentation or knowledge of a flank hematoma noticed prior to

today. No history of trauma is known.

INITIAL NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE (in setting of acute obtundation)
prior to transfer to Neurology Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year-old right-handed man with a past
medical history including myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], hypertension,
atrial
fibrillation (coumadin/lovenox dc'd [**6-4**]), COPD, recent
pseudomonal wound infection, and recurrent episodes of decreased
responsiveness who developed an acute change of mental status in
the setting of anemia.
.
Records show that Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a right inguinal cyst
removal [**2149-5-20**] at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  He subsequently presented to
the [**Hospital1 18**] with confusion on [**2149-5-28**] and was ultimately found to
have a right inguinal pseudomonal infection with wound
dehiscence.  Following an incision and drainage, empiric
treatment with cefazolin was transitioned to a seven day course
of ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  The discharge summary notes that,
despite the myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], the patient has tolerated these
agents well in the past.  He was discharged to rehab on [**2149-5-31**].

.
The primary team indicates that the patient had at least two
episodes of unresponsiveness while at rehabilitation.  One event
lasted 5-10 minutes; as it occurred on the commode, the syndrome
was attributed to vasovagal syncope.  The details of the next
event remain unclear.  However, he then presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
with a change in mental status on [**6-3**].  A neurosurgery consult
was requested as an initial non-contrast CT of the head was
thought to show a 10 x 8 x 5 mm hyperdense area adjacent to the
right frontal lobe concerning for hemorrhage. INR was 2.1.  The
neurosurgical evaluation suggests he would make nonsensical
vocalizations, had equal round and reactive pupils with facial
symmetry, and withdrawal of extremities to noxious.  The
features
of the imaging was considered atypical for a subdural and
aubarachnoid hemorrhages.
.
While in the ED, the hematocrit was noted to be 23.6 (relative
to
40.6 on [**2149-5-31**]) in the context of epistaxis and a large right
flank hematoma.  After a surgical evaluation, he was intubated
for airway protection and admitted to the TSICU.   He received
three units of packed red blood cells and two units of FFP.  The
hematocrit remained stable thereafter.  Cipro and flagyl were
continued.  A non-contrast CT of the head was repeated on [**6-4**]
and failed to reveal the previously noted abnormality.  The
patient was successfully extubated on [**6-4**] without complication.

Since that time, he has moved to the medical service on the
wards.
.
The patient apparently did well until [**2149-6-6**].  Per report, at
about 5:30 pm, he became unresponsive.  There was no apparent
trigger.   Blood glucose was reported to be 170.  An ABG showed
a
pH of 7.47, pCo2 36, pO2 92, TCO2 27.  It does not appear that
any new medications were started recently.
