History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old man who is being transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring after hip replacement surgery and hardware
removal complicated by significant blood loss.  The patient
initially injured his hip after falling from a roof in [**2178**].  He
suffered a right hip fracture at the time that was repaired with
an IM nail.  Recently, he developed R groin and hip pain, found
to be due to AVN of the femoral head.  Today he underwent a
prolonged procedure involving removal of the IM nail and
associated hardware followed by bipolar hip replacement.  The
procedure took over four hours.  Pt had approximately 3L of
blood loss.  He received 1750cc of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**] blood in the OR, 2
units of pRBC, and 6L of colloid.  He did require some
neosynephrine during the procedure which was weaned prior to
transfer.

CXR [**2182-8-30**]: Increased airspace opacification in the left lower
lobe suggests early pneumonia. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis
and cardiomegaly is unchanged.

CT C spine [**2182-8-30**]: No fracture or malalignment. Mild diffuse
degenerative changes.

Right femur/pelvis film [**2182-8-30**]:
FINDINGS: There is a right revision hip prosthesis. No
periprosthetic
fractures are seen. There is again seen a prominent butterfly
fragment within the superomedial soft tissues. There are several
broken screw fragments in the right distal femoral
diametaphysis. Joint space narrowing at the medial compartment
of the knee is seen. There is a knee joint effusion.

CT Head [**2182-8-30**]:  No acute intracranial process. Partial
opacification in mastoid air cells, which is present on the
prior CT of [**2179-1-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 yo man with alcohol dependance who was presented
for elective right total hip replacement revision. His surgery
was long and he was not able to be immediately exubated due to
left lower lobe collapse. He also developed left lower lobe
pneumonia (H.flu) treated with 8 days of iv unasyn. He was able
to be extubated [**8-22**] but then developed acute alcholol
withdrawl, requiring  valium and haldol. He then became
delerious, likely due to hypernatremia, icu delerium, pain,
infection, and difficulty clearing sedating medications with
some component of alcoholic hepatitis. This delayed his ability
to participate with PT. He required seroquel to help his
delerium clear. He was lucid on [**2182-8-31**], and insisted on
discharge. He was evaluated by PT and OT and felt unsafe to go
home. Despite this he was able to clearly state understanding of
risks and benefits of going home and signed out against medical
advice. His hospital course was complicated by hypertension,
which was not known prior to admission. He was started on
metoprolol and clonidine for this and discharged on metoprolol.
He was noted to have atrial fibrillation with RVR while acutely
ill with pneumonia and intubated, this converted and he remained
in sinus. Given CHADS score he was not recommended to be on
anticoagulation given acute  surgery but should discuss this as
an outpatient with his pcp. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was treated with thiamine,
folate, multivitamin given his alcohol dependance. He was
arranged to have home lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, and VNA with
PT. He was noted to have anemia and thrombocytopmenia, likely
due to acute blood loss perioperatively with poor marrow
response due to alcoholic suppression and consumption of
platelets perioperatively that was improving on discharge. He
should have repeat CXR with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 month to ensure
resolution of his pneumonia.
