HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the patient was a
direct admission to the operating room.  Please see the OR
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had an
aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve.  Cardiopulmonary pump time was 164 minutes with a
cross-clamp time of 86 minutes.  He tolerated the operation
well and was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient was in normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute
with a mean arterial pressure of 66 and a CVP of 11.  He had
nitroglycerin at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute and propofol 20
mcg/kg/minute.

Patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  His
anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from the ventilator
and successfully extubated.  During the course of the evening
on the operative day, he was weaned from all cardioactive IV
medications on postoperative day one.  Patient's chest tubes
were removed and he was transferred from the ICU to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  He was begun on Coumadin on
postoperative day two.  At that time, his  temporary pacing
wires were removed over the next several days, so the
patient's beta blocker and diuretics were adjusted.  His
Coumadin dose was also adjusted with an attempt to get to a
goal INR of 3 to 3.5.

During this period the patient's activity level was advanced
with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing
staff.  On postoperative day eight, the patient complained of
a sore throat.  At that time, he also had a fever to 100.5
with a white blood cell count of 16.  A urinalysis done at
that time was negative.  A chest x-ray showed no effusions or
infiltrates with a small amount of postoperative atelectasis.
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were also sent at that
time.  Sputum Gram stain was negative and showed
contamination with oropharyngeal flora.  Blood cultures to
date are negative.  However, the patient did have an
erythematous throat and he was dosed with Zithromax 500 mg at
that time.  He will be continued on Zithromax 250 mg q.d. x5
days.

The following morning the patient had remained afebrile x24
hours and the decision was made that he was stable and ready
to be discharged to home.  At this time, the patient's
physical exam was as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99,
heart rate 72, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 114/53,
respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation 91 percent on room
air.  Weight at time of discharge 88.7 kg, preoperatively 88
kg.

Laboratory data on day of discharge:  White count 13,
hematocrit 26.1, platelets 245.  PT 18, PTT 69, INR 2.1.

Physical exam:  Alert and oriented times three.  Moves all
extremities, follows all commands.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
