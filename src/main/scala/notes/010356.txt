History of Present Illness:
This 45 year old white male began about one and a half months
ago to notice chest discomfort "like indigestion", across the
entire chest when exerting himself. He is avid walker and has
noticed this discomfort when going up
any type of incline and resolving with rest. He has not noticed
this discomfort when walking on a level surface. It is easily
reproducible. He underwent a stress echo which revealed mild LV
enlargement with preserved LV function. The left atrium was
moderately dilated. There was moderate mitral valve prolapse
involving the posterior leaflet with severe mitral insuffiency
and pulmonary vein flow reversal. Mild TR and borderline aortic
root dilation were seen. He exercised 6 minutes and developed
chest pain at peak exercise along with lateral ST depression.
PVC's were noted. Echo imaging showed anteroseptal ischemia. He
was referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate. He
was found to have coronary artery disease upon cardiac
catheterization and referred to cardiac surgery. He continued to
complain of chest pain on a nitro drip and morphine. He had an
intraaortic balloon placed with stabilization and was taken the
following day to the Operating Room  for an urgent operation.
enzymes were flat.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending aorta appears
free from atherosclerotic plaque with some limitation in the
study due to the presence of an intraaortic balloon pump. The
distal tip of the IABP appears end prior to the subclavian
artery takeoff.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There
is partial posterior (P2) mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is in sinus tachycardia on low dose epinephrine &
moderate dose phenylephrine infusions. The biventricular
function is maintained. There is a well seated annuloplasty ring
in the mitral position. There is trace MR. There are peak and
mean gradients of 11 & 5mmHg, respectively. The remaining valves
are unchanged. The aorta appears intact, though the descending
aorta has suboptimal imaging due to the presence of an IABP. The
IABP continues to remain with the distal tip in appropriate
position.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45-year-old male referred from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
consideration of coronary artery bypass grafting as well as
mitral valve repair. The patient developed severe angina
after his diagnostic cardiac cath which revealed moderate left
main disease and high-grade LAD and diagonal stenoses. The
patient was not responsive to nitroglycerin and therefore was
brought to the Operating Room and an intra-aortic balloon pump
inserted. This abated his chest pain.

A stat echo in the Operating Room showed severe mitral
regurgitation.  It was felt that the patient should proceed with
mitral valve repair or replacement and coronary artery bypass
grafting the next morning.  The patient had a stable night and
