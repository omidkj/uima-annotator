PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Chronic cholecystitis with cholecystostomy tube in
    place.
2. Large incarcerated umbilical hernia.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.

OPERATION:
1. Attempted laparoscopy, conversion to open.
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. Repair of incarcerated umbilical hernia.

ANESTHESIA:  General.

INDICATION:  This patient with quite marked coronary disease
and chronic atrial fibrillation was taken off his
anticoagulants 5 days prior to surgery and brought to the
operating room to deal with chronic cholecystitis which was a
result of having had a cholecystostomy tube in place when he
developed severe cholecystitis and cholangitis and required
an intensive care unit stay some 6 or 8 weeks ago. He also
had a large incarcerated umbilical hernia. The goal was to
try and perform this operation laparoscopically and then
repair the umbilical hernia but this turned out to be
impossible.

TECHNIQUE:  We placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24631**] cannula through the upper part
of the umbilical hernia after entering the peritoneal cavity,
and upon inflating the abdomen it was quite clear that this
was not going to be a laparoscopic operation and we therefore
made a midline incision.

FINDINGS:  The patient had extensive adhesions around the
gallbladder, between the gallbladder and the liver and
between the liver and the abdominal wall. The cystic duct and
cystic artery were eventually well-seen. The gallbladder
contained multiple small stones and the back of the
gallbladder wall had to be left on the liver as there was
simply no plane to carry out the dissection. This operation
was therefore much more prolonged than normal (at least 75%
longer and more complicated). Additionally, the umbilical
hernia itself required a substantial dissection to repair it.

TECHNIQUE:  The gallbladder was first of all visualized after
dissecting off for the surrounding adhesions and then it was
aspirated of green bile. An attempt was then made to take it
down from the fundus towards the cystic-common duct junction
but there was simply no plane. We entered the gallbladder,
therefore, and left the posterior wall of the gallbladder on
the liver bed as we came down towards the neck of the
gallbladder. At this point, I identified the cystic duct node
and adjacent to it came across the cystic artery. This was
therefore doubly clipped. We then proceeded millimeter by
millimeter to identify the cystic duct which was done. It was
clipped twice and the gallbladder was then removed. As I
stated, the back wall of the gallbladder was left on the
liver bed as there was simply no plane from all the chronic
inflammation. With the gallbladder removed, we carried out a
careful check for hemostasis, and we then turned our
attention to the umbilical hernia. The midline incision was
extended to this area and the incarcerated tissue was reduced
and partially excised. The skin of the umbilicus had been so
stretched out by the size of this hernia that it too was
removed and the patient will have no umbilical skin
component. The edges were identified of the fascia and freed
up circumferentially.

We then closed the entire incision with #1 PDS and staples to
the skin. The patient tolerated procedure well and was
returned to the recovery room.

***** [**4-25**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-27**],
the findings are similar

***** [**4-27**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:

1. Large hematoma extending from the gallbladder fossa
inferiorly. High density within the upper portion of the
hematoma likely represents more acute bleeding. Active
extravasation cannot be assessed without IV contrast.

2. Second pocket of fluid anterior to the left lobe of the liver
containing air pockets and heterogeneous fluid, likely
postoperative sequelae, but possibly communicating with the
large hematoma in the gallbladder fossa.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions and lung base airspace opacities
which could represent extensive atelectasis. Other
considerations include aspiration or pneumonia.

4. Unchanged appearance of enlarged kidneys with perinephric
stranding, consistent with renal disease as discussed on recent
ultrasound examinations.

5. Stable appearance of calcified splenic lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3419**] was taken to the operating room on [**2153-4-23**] for attempted
laparoscopic cholecystectomy; however he was converted to open
due to extensive inflammation of his gallbladder.  Please see
operative report for further details of the operation.
Postoperatively he was transferred to the floor in stable
condition on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  That evening he was
transfused 1 unit of blood for low urine output, tachycardia,
and hct of 26.  His hematocrit responded appropriately.  He did
have some fevers overnight, but this was not completely
unexpected given the nature of his operation.

On POD 1 his diet was advanced to clears and he was restarted on
his bumex for chronic CHF.  In the late morning he developed
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
