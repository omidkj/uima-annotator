[**2152-9-30**] PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made from film from one
day earlier. The patient has made a slightly improved
inspiratory effort on the current film. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged, with prominence of the left
hilum again noted. Previously noted pulmonary edema persists
without change. There is some improved aeration in the left
base.

[**2152-10-2**] SWALLOWING EVAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
     1.Advance to regular consistency po diet.
     2.Should pt develop s/s aspiration, worsening pna, or
     difficulty with upper airway secretions, please reconsult
     for a video swallow study.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD: Patient was observed at her Nursing Home ([**Location (un) 2716**]
Point) to have increased SOB for two days and was seen by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2152-9-29**]. She was noted to have oxygen saturation of 80% RA,
thought potentially secondary to CHF exac vs. PNA.  She was
treated with levofloxacin and lasix with some improvement in her
oxygen saturation to 85% RA, but BP incr. 160s. IV nitro was
started at her nursing home, antibiotics were switched to
azithro + ceftaz, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to the ED, she was diaphoretic, shaky and
unresponsive. Her temperature was 99.6 and pt was hypertensive
to 160-170/60, with oxygen saturation of 86% RA.  An ABG was
7.25/99/257 suggesting CO2 retention.  Per MICU note, daughter
reported [**Name2 (NI) **], no recent F/C/N/V, no CP mild SOB over the last
couple of weeks, no PND , no orthopnea.  Daughter reports
increased LE edema and some weight gain (undocumented) over [**2-1**]
weeks, but no urinary Sx.

In MICU, pt was placed on BIPAP with target O2 sat 90-92%,
diuresed, and abx tx continued with vanc + ceftaz.  MICU
achieved 95-97% O2 sat weaned off BIPAP to 3L NC.  Transferred
to medical floor and we continued to wean O2, continued steroids
(prednisone taper) and continued ipratropium neb, added
albuterol neb. 48 hours later, patient was weaned from 3L NC 02
with 90-95% sats to RA and >95% sats with mild crackles at base.
 She was d/ced in this condition.

2. CHANGE IN MS: Pt. was found unresponsive and brought to the
ED diaphoretic, acidotic, with low O2 Sat.  Was confused and
disoriented, not at baseline per home attendant.  In Unit,
palced on BiPAP with improving sats but hypercarbic, retaining.
Still poor mental status.  As BiPAP was weaned and on day of
transfer to floor, pt was much closer to baseline per home
health aide.  At d.c from medicine floor, home health aid
reports that patient is at baseline mentation.  Although still
not oriented, her thoughts are organized and she is vocal.

3. ID:  Pt's COPD and CXR with infiltrate are worrisome for PNA
+ COPD exac.  Txed inpatient with Vanc+ceftaz, transferred to
floor and continued on ceftaz, then converted to
azithro+ceftriax.  Will d/c with wbc 5.4 crit 33.1 plat 228, abx
10d of cefpodoxime 200 [**Hospital1 **] and azithro 250 QD.

4. Atrial fibrillation: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient is a fall risk, and
PCP does not recommend coumadin or lovenox given risk. Her beta
blocker dose was titrated up for improved rate control.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH was checked on admission
and was within normal limits. On discharge it was midly elev at
5.0.  Her levothyroxine was continued at her present dose.  PCP
should consider TSH level in 2wks to determine if current
levoxyl dose is adequate.
6. Documented desat during sleep ? sleep apnea.  Pt. was
observed for 15 min on 02 sat during sleep.  awake o2 sat 90-92%
RA, pt desats to low 80s high 70s after 30 sec apneic events
during sleep, then sats rise to high 80s.  We will d/c on
nocturnal 02 2L, but may wish to consider sleep apnea w/u as
o.p.

6. C/o R eyelid pain.  On [**10-4**] pt c.o mild R eye discomfort -
she and home health aid admit to chronic R eye
dryness/discomfornt.  No exudate, scleara clear, no obvious
foreign body, no erythema, no edema.  Txed with artificial
tears.  No clinical indication on exam of pathologic process.
