Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
diffuse weakness, episodic numbness, diffuse body pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical pleurodesis and Left Upper Lobe Wedge Resection


History of Present Illness:
35 yo woman discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] (admitted [**Date range (1) 32318**], then
[**Date range (1) 74351**]) s/p pleurodesis/VATS for bleb removal.  Pt. was
admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from OSH with a L pneumothorax on [**8-22**], has a
chest tube placed, and on [**8-26**] had L flexible bronch, VATS, and
pleurodesis.  She tolerated the procedure well, with no
complications, and her pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA
-> Morphine PCA -> PO Dilaudid.  She was seen by the pain
service there and discharged on 2 mg Dilaudid PO Q4 per their
recs.  She was readmitted on [**9-1**] with a recurrent pneumothorax
and got a 2nd L sided chest tube.  She was discharged on [**9-7**] on
Dilaudid 2 mg PO Q8.
.
Pt. presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**9-7**] c/o diffuse weakness,
episodic numbness, diffuse body pain.  She was given 2 mg IV
Dilaudid in ED, 0.5 mg Ativan, and admitted to medicine for pain
control.  She was started on Amitriptyline however she never
received a dose. In the morning she was found to be complaining
of back pain and pain at the site of her chest tube placement.
She denied constipation, diarrhea or bowel incontinence, dysuria
or incontinence of urine, weakness or numbness, though she did
report "tingling" in her abdomen, and that she "can't feel bowel
movements coming out."  At 9PM that evening, she was found to be
unresponsive with a poor respiratory effort.  She was moving all
extremities spontaneously.  She was lethargic but appropriate 20
minutes before.  Initially her O2 sats were 70% on RA, HR 100,
SBP 160.  Her O2 sats improved to 94% on a face mask.  She had
clear breath sounds bilaterally.  She was intubated for airway
protection.  Her ABG was found to be 6.86/179/168/35/lactate
2.4.  Of note her WBC count increased to 22.4 with 78%
Neutrophils and 0% bands from 7.8 earlier today. She received
Narcan x1. She was transferred to the MICU.

Past Medical History:

when admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] with pneumothorax.  Mother reports that she
does not abuse ETOH or illicit drugs.  She takes ativan [**Hospital1 **] for
anxiety.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT, [**9-8**]: There is no pneumothorax. There is scarring
around a previous chest tube tract at the left lung apex. Linear
scarring is also present in the right and left lower lobes.
There is pleural thickening or small amount of pleural fluid at
the right lung base. Scattered blebs are present in both lungs.
The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi. There
is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is no
evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy on non-contrast evaluation.
The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
The visualized portions of the liver and spleen appear
unremarkable. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
in the visualized osseous structures.
.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Right basilar pleural thickening
versus a small pleural effusion.

CT CHEST

INDICATION: History of recurrent pneumothoraces, Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome,
pulmonary embolism with increasing left-sided chest pain.

Comparison is made to the prior chest CT dated [**2132-9-18**]
and prior
chest x-ray on the same day.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed
following
intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
Multiplanar
reconstructions were also obtained.

FINDINGS: Compared to the prior CT scan, there has been interval
development
of a large left-sided pneumothorax. This also appears to have
progressed
significantly compared to the chest x-ray performed on the same
day. There
are associated atelectatic changes in the left lung. There is
again evidence
of left upper lobe wedge resection. Multiple peripheral blebs
are noted along
the right upper lobe. Linear atelectatic changes are
demonstrated in the
right lower lobe with marked interval reexpansion of the right
lower lobe.
There has been development of an oval shaped roughly 3.8 x 2.1
cm
low-attenuation lesion in the right lower lobe with a few foci
of gas most
consistent with loculated fluid. The pulmonary arteries
demonstrate no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heart, pericardium, and
great vessels are
within normal limits. Note is made of a tracheostomy tube. An NG
tube is
also noted. No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar lymph
nodes are demonstrated.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: The above findings were confirmed with
multiplanar
reconstructions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of very large left-sided pneumothorax.
2. Marked interval reexpansion of the right lower lobe compared
to the prior
CT scan with residual small loculated fluid collection in the
right lower
lobe.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Approved: SAT [**2132-9-27**] 9:06 AM
Procedure Date:[**2132-9-26**]

Clinical: Left recurrent pneumothorax.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh and labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number and "right upper lobe
wedge" and consists of three wedge resections of lung, the
smallest measuring 2.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, the second measuring 3.6
x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, and the largest measuring 8.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.
The pleural surface is smooth and without any gross
abnormalities. Serial sectioning reveals a red-brown spongy cut
surface without any lesions. The specimen is represented in A-C.

TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2132-10-16**] AT 14:51

COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same date at 8:24.

INDICATION: Status post removal of left-sided chest tube.

Since the recent chest radiograph, a left-sided chest tube has
been removed.
A small left apical pneumothorax is present, best visualized on
the lateral
view. In retrospect, this is also present on the pre-chest tube
removal
radiograph and is without interval change. On the PA view, the
pneumothorax
was partially obscured by the overlying chest tube on the
previous film,
rendering it more difficult to visualize pr
