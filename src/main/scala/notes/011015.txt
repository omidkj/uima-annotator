CXR [**7-13**]: Chronic  right pleural effusion and pleural
thickening.

CXR-P [**7-16**]: New left lower lobe patchy opacity concerning for
possible pneumonia. Increased mild pulmonary edema. Chronic
right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
.
CXR pa/lat [**7-16**]: Increasing patchy peripheral opacities in the
left mid and lower lung zones, which may be due to a developing
pneumonia in this patient with fever. Increasing small left
pleural effusion.
Chronic right pleural thickening.
.
CXR pa/lat [**7-18**]: Congestive failure.  Bilateral air space
disease may be on the basis of edema or bilateral infection,

Neck US [**7-19**]: In the right neck, there is an echogenic lesion
measuring 1.4 x 4.2 cm.  No focal fluid collection or mass is
identified on either side of the neck.  There is no evidence of
edematous changes within the skin.  Lesion in the right neck may
represent an enlarged lymph node or a small lipoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
- 54 y/o M s/p OLT [**10-2**] and CRT [**11-1**] secondary to Hep C,
post-transplant cryoglobulinemia, recurrent hepatitis C, MPGN,
h/o endocarditis, anemia, and CHF who was admitted to Transplant
Surgery on [**7-9**] w/hyper K (6.7) and acute on chronic renal
failure(3.2 up from 2.3). His hyperkalemia was managed medically
(insulin, kayexelate, calcium gluconate) and, given concern that
recently initiated lisinopril/diovan was contributing to his
renal failure, these were discontinued. In addition, cyclosporin
was discontinued and he was started on rapamycin.
.
On [**2189-7-19**] he developed new neck swelling which progressed over
the next several days. [**7-20**] neck MRI showed diffuse, symmetric
bilateral soft tissue edema from the parotid glands to the
clavicles. Rapamycin was discontinued (given possible drug
reaction) and, given new fevers and concern for infection,
Unasyn was started. ENT was consulted [**7-20**]; fiberoptic scope
showed airway edema, and he was transferred to the MICU for
continuous O2 monitoring/airway protection.
.
In the MICU, his neck swelling was felt to most likely represent
med reaction (nifedipine vs rapamycin). He was continued on IV
dexamethasone with gradual improvement of neck edema ([**7-21**]
ifiberoptic scope showed near clomplete resolution of airway
edema). Initially, he was continued on Unasyn for concern about
new submental soft tissue infection + levo for possible LLL PNA.
His neck soft tissue infection, however Unasyn was discontinued
[**7-22**] given low suspicion of neck soft tissue infection. MICU
course was remarkable for (+) HSV swab, for which he was
initially on acyclovir, subsequently changed to valacyclovir. He
also developed progressive pancytopenia, attributed to
azothiaprine (which was started 8/16 per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
Azathioprine was discontinued and he was started on neupogen
[**7-22**]. He underwent biopsy of renal transplant [**7-23**].
Pt was weaned off of high dose steroids that were started out of
concern for swelling around his airway. Tacrolimus was initiated
to replace rapamycin as an immunopsuppressant. His levels were
followed daily with a goal of >5. Shortly after start of this
medication, the patient developed a macular erythematous rash on
the posterior/lateral aspect of both lower extremities spairng
the heel/soles and much of the dorsum of the foot. Derm was
consulted who biopsied the rash and results supported
leokocytoclastic vasclulitis possibly from cryoglubinemia. This
rash resolved over the next several days with initiation of
plasma [**Month/Year (2) **]. The patient's renal biopsy results showed
evidence of ongoing MPGN c/w with ongoing cryoglobulinemia.
However, the patient's LFT's and HCV viral load have remained
normal and undetectable, respectively. Hem/Onc was consulted
early in his course to r/o a lymphoproliferative disorder to
account for his ongoing cryoglubinemia. A bone marrow biopsy did
not show evidence of this. A port was placed in the OR on [**7-29**]
and plasma [**Month/Day (4) **] was initaited afterwards to address ongoing
cryoglubinemia. Pt has 3 sessions of plasma [**Month/Day (4) **] and was
discharged on [**7-31**] with plans for ongoing outpatient plamsa
[**Month/Day (2) **].
Pt was ruled out for HIT with antibotdy serologies 2 X during
his hospital stay. His thrombocytopenia was thought to be due to
recent azathioprine and hypersplenism.
Pt complained of wrist pain on the day of discharge thought to
be due to a gout flare (? cryglobulinea) and was given stress
dose prednisone 40mg PO QD X 5days.
Pt was discharged in good condition, without pain, feeling well,
to follow up with plasmapheresis 3x/week.
