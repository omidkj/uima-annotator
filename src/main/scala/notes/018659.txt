Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with h/o CAD, DM II, PVD, COPD, cellulitis, who
presented with melena and hypotension, and underwent
embolization after duodenal ulcers were identified.

# Melena: Patient with melena x 1, along with hypotension at
nursing home and HCT drop from 37.3 on [**9-1**] to 29.1.  GI was
consulted. GI performed an EGD on the morning of [**9-7**], which
showed 2 duodenal ulcers, cauterized. Pt was initially
transfused 1 unit PRBCs in emergency department.  Hct was 28,
stable at 29.9-30 while on MICU service. Pt. was treated with
PPI IV BID.  BP meds were held.  After discussion with GI,
decision was made to continue plavix given pt's CAD s/p stents,
but ASA was decreased from 325 to 81 mg. Pt should discuss
resumption of full dose ASA with his PCP.

# Hypotension: Likely in setting of UGIB, was hemodynamically
stable in MICU.  Hct stable as above.  Did not require fluid
boluses while on MICU service or on floor. Generally maintained
good pressures 110-122 systolic while on floor. The patient was
discharged on Metoprolol Succinate 100 mg Tablet Sustained
Release one per day.

# Cellulitis: Patient with recent discharge for cellulits, on
Bactrim/Levo/Flagyl PO.  These antibiotics were discontinued as
the wound culture showed resistance, and patient was started on
Vanco IV for 14 days first dose [**2103-9-6**].

# CAD s/p stents - Pt s/p PCI of LAD in [**6-/2103**] with 2 Bare Metal
Stents.  Plavix continued and ASA decreased to 81 mg as above.
In the context of his hypotension on presentation, his home
ACEi, BB, and statin were initially held. Metoprolol was later
introduced. We advise that the patient's PCP consider
[**Name9 (PRE) 18290**] his ACE-I as outpatient if pressures remain stable.

# COPD: Patient lethargic on arrival, on O2.  O2 stopped, ABG
taken, hypoxic to 89% transiently which improved immediately.
ABG 7.39/49/68.  Lethargy likely [**2-24**] to lack of sleep.  His
tiotropium was continued, and albuterol nebs were ordered.

# DM II - Pt continued on half dose NPH while NPO.

# Atrial fibrillation - Hx of afib, not on coumadin.  Continued
on ASA 81mg as above.  When patient was NPO, he was continued on
Digoxin IV and his digoxin level was checked.  As above, his
beta blocker was held, and restarted at the end of his course
with good results. Patient should discuss restarting Coumadin
with PCP after GI tract has had some time to heal.

# PVD - History of SFA stent: Continued plavix, decreased ASA
dose as above.

# Dementia - Held aricept, paroxetine while NPO, these were
reintroduced at the end of his course.

# Sacral Ulcer:  Pt was seen by wound care.  Wound was dressed
with wet to dry dressings.
