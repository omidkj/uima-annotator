History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo Right
handed woman with a PMH significant for HTN, COPD and
hyperlipidemia. At baseline she lives alone and is seemingly
independent of all ADLs (per her daughters).

Patient was last noted to be well (in phone conversation with
her
daughter) at 7:30pm yesterday, [**5-11**]. This am she was to meet
friends at 10 am and did not show. Her daughters were called and
they found her at 10:30 am. At that time she was noted to be
lying on her living room couch, smelling of urine and
complaining
of nausea and back pain. When questioned, she believes that she
slept upstairs in her bed and came downstairs that morning. She
is unaware of ever hitting her head.

She was taken to the [**Hospital3 4107**] ER where she was noted to
have a left scalp and left shoulder abrasion. She had a C-spine
CT which was negative. However, a head CT showed a Right
temporal
ICH so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

IMAGING:
NC Head CT [**5-12**]:
There is a 3cm Right temporal ICH with surrounding edema. There
is also a very small focus of extraxial(subarrachnoid) blood
over the high right parietal convexity.

CTA HEad [**5-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Dense atherosclerotic calcifications with a
combination of soft plaques are demonstrated on the left carotid
bifurcation with no significant stenosis. A partially calcified
thyroid nodule is noted on the right, correlation with thyroid
ultrasound is recommended in a non-emergent basis, bilateral
pleural scarring and bilateral emphysematous changes

CT Head [**5-13**]:
1. Stable appearance to right temporal hemorrhage and edema.
2. Increased right frontal and parietal extra-axial blood may
represent
redistribution.
3. Apparently new isodense crescentic density overlying the left
convexity
likely represents subdural blood products.

CT Head [**5-14**]:
Right temporal intracranial hemorrhage redemonstrated and
unchanged. Trace
subarachnoid blood within the left parietal lobe and the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle is also unchanged. No new hemorrhage
or mass
effect


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NSurg service for close
observation. A CTA was performed to evaluate for an underlying
AVM, which was negative.  Her repeat Head CT upon admission was
stable from the previous image.  She received 6u platelets, and
her ASA was held.  She was started on keppra for seizure
prophylaxis, and her SBP was kept under 160. Her neurological
exam remained stable throughout the evening.

On [**5-13**], her repeat Head CT showed no evidence of interval
change.  She was seen by the pain consult service for her
chronic back pain, who recommended Tylenol and a muscle relaxer
PRN.  She was quite nauseated and dizzy with standing; zofran
was given, which gave her good relief, and a fluid bolus helped
with the orthostasis.

Because she had an obviously bruised R thumb, an xray was
ordered.  This revealed a trasnverse fracture of the distal
bone.  She was seen by plastics, who recommended conservative
management with a Spica Splint, and outpatient follow up.

She was seen by physical therapy who determined she met criteria
for an acute rehab center.

Her neurologic examination remained non-focal and unchanged
throughout the hospitalization.
