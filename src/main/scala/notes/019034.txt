IMAGING:
.
CT/A/P ([**2189-1-23**]):
FINDINGS:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
There is a subtle area of hypoattenuation with loss of the
insular ribbon at the junction of the right frontal and temporal
lobes. This is associated with effacement of the adjacent sulci.
No hemorrhage, large mass, or midline shift are present. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.
.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK:
There is minimal calcific disease of the right cervical carotid
artery. Also present is a thrombus in the inferior division of
the right MCA. The
remaining intracranial and cervical vessels are unremarkable.
The patient is status post bilateral lens surgery. Also present
is severe
multilevel degenerative disc and joint disease. Note is made of
asymmetry of the occipital skull, which may be developmental or
posttraumatic in origin. This is age indeterminate.
.
CT PERFUSION:
There is increased mean transit time and decreased cerebral
blood flow and
decreased cerebral blood volume in a large right MCA territory
covering the right frontal and parietal regions. There is no
mismatch between the cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood
volume to indicate penumbra.
.
IMPRESSION:
Large right-sided MCA territory stroke with thrombus present
within the
branches of the right middle cerebral artery.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2189-1-24**]):
IMPRESSION: Interval progression of infarction in the right MCA
inferior
divisional territory, with no evidence of significant mass
effect,
hemorrhagic conversion, or new region of infarction.
.
CXR ([**2189-1-23**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2189-1-27**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including CAD, hypertension, and possible atrial
fibrillation who presented [**2189-1-23**] with acute left hemiparesis.
She was admitted to the stroke service from [**2189-1-23**] until
[**2189-2-5**].
.
NEURO
.
Upon her arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] symptoms were
considered quite concerning for a right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) stroke.  Accordingly, a CT with angiography and perfusion
was performed.  The imaging confirmed the presence of a large
right MCA stroke.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was given IV t-PA with an
improvement in her neurological examination; her eyes began to
cross the midline and she was able to move all four limbs. A
non-contrast CT of the head was repeated within 24 hours.  While
the study showed the expected interval progression of the right
MCA stroke, there was no evidence of significant mass effect,
hemorrhagic conversion, or new region of infarction.
.
Although there was no clear pre-existing diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation, the patient was consistently noted to have an
irregularly irregular rhythm on auscultation and telemetry. The
etiology of the etiology of the stroke is thought to be
cardioembolic. To evaluate for a cardioembolic source, a
transthoracic echocardiogram was performed.  The study
demonstrated no evidence of thrombi, vegetations, an ASD, VSD,
or PFO.  Coumadin was started with a target INR of [**2-4**].  This
was started with an aspirin bridge which may be discontinued
once INR > 2.  Her HbA1c was 5.8 and LDL was 73.  She was
started on simvastatin 10 mg.
