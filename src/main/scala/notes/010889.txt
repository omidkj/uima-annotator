Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] is an 87 year old male with a history of COPD on 3L
O2, lung cancer and congestive heart failure who is transferred
from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring intubation and hypotension. Per the patient's wife he
has been feeling poorly for the past week.  He has not had any
documented fevers but has felt chilled.  He has had a cough
productive of clear sputum.  He has had worsening dyspnea on
exertion and oxygen requirements.  He was reluctant to go to the
hospital but his breathing became worse and his wife encouraged
his to go.
.
On arrival to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] he was reported as being alert
and oriented, cyanotic, with diminished air movement
bilaterally, using accessory muscles of respiration.  He was
immediately intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  He
received initially received solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1,
azithromycin 500 mg IV, ceftriaxone 1 gram IV, lasix 40 mg IV,
etomidate 20 mg IV, vecuronium 1 mg IV and succinyulcholine 100
mv IV.  He became hypotensive and he received 2 liters normal
saline and was started on a dopamine gtt.  He subsequently
developed multifocal atrial tachycardia and was started on a
diltiazem drip and his pressor was switched to neosynephrine.
He also was started on propofol for sedation.   Labs were
notable for a WBC count of 21.2 with 89.4 % neutrophils,,
hemoglobin of 13.1.  Initial ABG post intubation was
7.31/68.1/293 on 500 x 15, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5.  Prior to transfer
his blood pressures were ranging from the 70s to 90s systolic.
.
On arrival he was intubated, sedated and unresponsive to
questions.  His blood pressures were in the 80s systolic on
neosynephrine.  The diltiazem drip was discontinued and his
heart rates were in the 70s with wandering atrial pacemaker.  He
received 3 liters normal saline with improvement in his blood
pressures to the 110s systolic.  He had an arterial line and a
right sided IJ placed.  Review of systems unable to be obtained.

Echo [**3-27**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is at least borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. A trivial pericardial effusion is
seen.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low normal left
ventricular systolic function. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with mild hypokinesis. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Minimal aortic stenosis. Borderline pulmonary
hypertension (may be underestimated).

CXR [**3-28**]:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no
change in the right upper lobe mass highly suspicious for
neoplasm. Interval development of left lower lobe opacity is
consistent with aspiration. Bilateral pleural effusions are
present, small.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 87 year old male with a history of COPD on 3L O2,
lung cancer and congestive heart failure who is transferred from
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring intubation and hypotension.

Shock:  Patient with subjective fevers at home, leukocytosis and
hypotension concerning for septic shock.  Other potential
etiologies for this patient include cardiogenic shock given his
history of congestive heart failure and adrenal insufficiency
given chronic steroids.  Less likely etiologies are hypovolemic,
hemorrhagic, or obstructive shock.  In terms of etiologies for
septic shock, pneumonia appears to be the most likely etiology
although we will cover him broadly for now.  After discussion
with family, goals of care clarified, no further escalation of
care wanted.  Patient extubated, abx and blood pressure support
withdrawn as patient made CMO.

Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Patient with tenuous lung
function at baseline with known malignancy, home oxygen
requirement and obstructive lung disease.  PaO2/FiO2 = 117.
Given bilateral infiltrates and no clear evidence for congestive
heart failure meets criteria for ARDS.  CXR today with new LLL
infiltrate c/f aspiration PNA.  Patient extubated on [**3-28**],
pressors and abx withdrawn per CMO request.  Patient expired on
[**3-29**] after being made CMO the previous day.

Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia:  Likely related to underlying
lung disease.  Heart rate currently in the 70s off diltiazem.
Patient monitored on telemetry.

Lung Cancer:  Diagnosed approximately one year ago.  Unclear
what treatment he has had or degree of metastatic disease.

Congestive Heart Failure:  Ejection fraction 50% per echo on on
[**3-27**].  Low normal left ventricular systolic function. Moderately
dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Minimal aortic stenosis. Borderline
pulmonary hypertension
