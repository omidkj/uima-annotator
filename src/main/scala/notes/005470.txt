chest pain

[**2103-4-10**]


History of Present Illness:
77 year old female has a cardiac
history notable for a remote MI in [**2071**]. She had been doing well
from a cardiac standpoint over the years until about 3 weeks ago
when she started to notice exertional chest burning. She
describes chest burning with activity such as climbing stairs.
More recently, she has also had a few episodes of chest pain
occurring at rest that have woken her from sleep and lasted for
10 minutes. She was referred to cardiology and had a nuclear
stress test done that was notable for lateral ischemia. She was
then referred for a cardiac catheterization and was found to
have
coronary artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization.

Studies
Cardiac cath [**2103-4-3**]: COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had
a 70%
mid vessel stenosis.  THe first diagonal branch had an ostial
70%.  The
Lcx had an 80% eccentric lesion that wasn't ammenable to PCI.
THe RCA
was non-obstructed with a mild amount of proximal plaque with a
possibe
non-flow limiting chronic dissection in the proximal portion of
the
vessel.
 2.  Limited resting hemodynamics reveal elevated left
sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 17mm Hg.  Systemic
pressures
were normal.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated an ejection fraction of
65% with
no wall motion abnormality.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ejection fraction.
3. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressure.

CXR [**2103-4-4**]: No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is within
normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion,
pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Opacification in the
supraclavicular region on the right medially could be an
artifact or represent some area of calcification.

[**2103-4-10**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
Aorta intact. Trace MR, no AI.


Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77yoF with h/o remote MI in [**2071**], HTN, HLD,
hypothyroidism, gout, who presented with worsening chest pain,
found to have 3 vessel disease on [**2103-4-3**] cath, admitted for
management prior to CABG.
.
# CORONARIES:  Cath on [**2103-4-3**] showed prox OM 80% not a great
candidate for stenting. mid 70% LAD, mid 30% diag lesion. 2
vessel disease, rec. CABG. Plavix was held starting on [**4-3**]. She
initially was doing well, chest pain free. However on [**4-8**] she
started developing chest pain after going to the bathroom, EKG
unchanged. On [**4-9**] she developed chest pain at rest, EKG with ST
depressions in lateral leads. This pain was responsive
immediately to nitro 0.4mg SL x1, and a heparin gtt was started.
She went for CABG on ####
.
# Acidosis: Pt persistently has low bicarb, ~16-18. ABG on [**4-6**]
showed 7.26/39/76/18. This represents a mixed metabolic acidosis
and respiratory acidosis. Differential for non-AG metabolic
acidosis is GI losses of HCO3- (possible, given 18" colon
resected [**2101**] for villous adenoma, when this issue arose, and
has chronic watery diarrhea as a result), renal tubular acidosis
(potential), early renal failure (less likely as GFR is in
30's). Urine anion gap is +17, which suggests a failure of
kidneys to excrete NH4+, as opposed to bicarb losses. Suggests
type I or IV RTA. Persistent hyperkalemia suggests type IV, as
type I usually has hypokalemia. Also FeHCO3- is <5%, which also
supports type IV RTA. Renin/aldosterone levels were sent which
showed #####. She was started on sodium bicarb 325mg PO BID,
which improved her serum bicarb. Prior to surgery, she was
infused 1L D5W with 150meq NaHCO3. If truly type 4 RTA, may
benefit from fludrocortisone in the future.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: baseline creatinine 1.4,
briefly up to 1.7 during admission. Possible CIN from cath [**4-3**].
Gentle hydration was given, and ACEi (benazapril) was held. [**Last Name (un) **]
resolved.
.
# PUMP: no evidence of CHF. Dry weight 145lbs on admission.
