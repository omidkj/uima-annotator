Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure, altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture ([**4-14**]).

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from [**Name (NI) 401**] [**Name (NI) 25766**] HCP and neuro notes

52 y/o M with PMHx of Type I DM, HTN, CKD and DKA c/b hypoxic
brain injury who had a witnessed generalized tonic clonic
seizure today this morning which lasted approximately 1 minute.
Per report, he was then noted to be postictal and yawning but
"he was moving all 4 extremities at the time" and BS was >200.
The rehab team cannot tell if there was a gaze deviation or
bowel incontinence. He did not receive any meds. [**Name (NI) **]
brother reports that at baseline the patient is able to converse
and comprehend, but has difficulty with naming. At baseline
patient is able to walk with assist using a belt and a person
following with a wheelchair. Has recently been able to
walk up 16 stairs. Per patient's brother/HCP, pt's blood glucose
levels have been fluctuating recently and he reportedly had an
episode of hypoglycemia yesterday with a glucose POC of 24
because the patient missed a meal. Brother saw patient last
night at which time he was able to discuss his children and his
retirement. Pt had a UTI last week which was treated with
ceftriaxone, last dose ~48 hours ago. Of note, he has had a
foley in since admission to the NH.  HCP reported that he has
had recurrent infections while at rehab and recently treated for
CDiff (stopped Abx for Cdiff on [**4-8**]).

Initial VS on arrival to the ED: T 97.6 BP 173/94 RR 18 Sats
95%2L NC.
Given new onset seizure and mental status changes, pt was given
Ativan 2mg IV and there were multiple unsuccessful attempts at
lumbar puncture. Head CT did not show any acute changes from
baseline. Neuro was consulted and pt was empirically treated
with Ceftriaxone 2grams, Vancomycin 1gram, Ampicillin 2grams,
Acyclovir 1gram. Pt was given IVF but this was stopped after CXR
showed increased pulm edema.

On arrival to the MICU, pt was somnolent but arousable to
stimuli.  Pt would shout out in clear language to stop and says
"[**Last Name (un) **]" but otherwise, he does not follow commands. Of note, he
falls to sleep and exhibits cheynes [**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing.

Family provided additional ROS: Pt has been c/o chills at night
but denies fevers. Good appetite, some diarrhea, recent UTI, no
significant cough or shortness of breath. Improving with swallow
function, advanced to regular diet approx [**2-10**] wks ago. No nausea
or vomiting.

Hyerplipidemia
CKD ([**2190-11-25**] Cr of 3.0)
h/o Acute pancreatitis
h/o DKA with associated hypoxic brain injury and prolonged ICU
stay requiring Trach & PEG (now weaned from trach but PEG in
place)

Social History:
Used to work as an [**Company 2318**] mechanic, but had to stop working when
he lost driver's license after repeated episodes of
hypoglycemia. Not married. Pt has been living at [**Hospital1 9494**] Rehab since admission in [**Month (only) **]/[**2190**].

-[**4-13**] CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Unchanged old
infarctions.
-[**4-13**] CXR: 1. Mild CHF. 2. Left retrocardiac opacity, most likely
representing atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
-[**4-13**] Abd X-ray: No evidence of bowel obstruction. No free
intraperitoneal air.
-[**4-14**] EEG: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized

background and frequent bursts of generalized slowing. These
findings
indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and

subcortical structures. There were some sharp features before
the
generalized slowing, but they were not simple spike or sharp and
slow
wave complexes, and they appeared repetitively for only a few
seconds at a time. The tracing cannot rule out the occurrence of
seizures at other times, but the bursts of slowing and even
sharp waves appeared more likely related to the encephalopathy.
If clinical suspicion for
seizures persists, a repeat tracing or longer monitoring could
be
helpful. There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, but
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
-[**4-16**] Renal U/S: Echogenic kidneys suggesting underlying medical
renal disease.  There is no nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, or
renal mass lesion
-[**4-17**] Right UE U/S: No right upper extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Seizure/Altered Mental Status: Neuro exam was generally
non-focal aside from right sided and lower extremity weakness,
which had reportedly been stable since his hypoxic brain injury
several months ago. He was empirically treated with Vanc,
Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin and Acyclovir for possible meningitis.
LP was eventually obtained after an initially unsuccesful
attempt. CSF was not concerning for infection, and
antibiotics/antivirals were discontinued.  Neuro was consulted
and recommended starting Keppra. In the MICU, his toxic
metabolic work up revealed a mildly elevated TSH and normal free
T4. Infectious workup was unrevealing. Pt was initially
continued on empiric metronidazole for possible C Diff given his
history of recurrent Cdiff, recent Abx course and elevated WBC
count, but this was discontinued when his toxin assay came back
negative.  EEG was performed and showed findings likely related
to encephalopathy. Mental status was improved by day 2 of
admission and pt was called out to the floor. He did not have
any further seizures, and his mental status improved to his
baseline mental status from prior to the seizure, according to
his brothers. [**Name (NI) **] will follow up with neurology as an outpatient.
