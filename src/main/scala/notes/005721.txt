Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD/colonoscopy
[**Month (only) **] total colectomy w/ end ileostomy; takeback [**8-7**] Ostomy
revision, hematomay evac


History of Present Illness:
57 year-old woman with past medical history of ulcerative
colitis on Humira as an outpatient whopresented to OSH for
atypical chest pain on [**2137-7-18**]. Patient stated that while
she was getting ready to leave her house she had an episode of
sudden onset chest pain located mostly in the substernal and
left side of the chest which was nonradiating and was not
associated with any diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath. Pain was pressure-like sensation an dlasted for
approximately 1 [**2-15**]- 2 hours. Pain subsided in response to
sublingual nitrogen in the ER. Described as chest pounding.
Denied any fever, chills, or rigors at that time. No sick
contacts. At OSH, CTA was negative for PE. EKG at OSH
demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with non-specific ST-T wave
changes. CXR at OSH demosntrated no acute cardiopulmonary
process. Patient was ruled out on telemetry. Cardiology
recommended a persantine stress test. Stress test was aparrently
cancelled given drop in crit to 25.5. Patient was transfused 2
units of pRBCs. Patient during her admission complained of
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. Patient
apparently developed klebsiella UTI, which is being treated with
Cipro (sensitive to cipro). Patient was started on cipro 250 mg
PO BID with florastor 500 mg PO BID. Stool studies at OSH
demosntrated + fecal leukocytes and was negative for c. diff but
positive for fecal occult blood. Lactate was WNL. Her ulcerative
colitis has been active lately. She is being treated with Humira
(adalimumab) and her prednisone has been taperred off. Pt was
hemodynamically stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient has a history of active ulcerative colitis. She is
most recently on Humira and been tapered off outpatient
steroids. She had a HCT drop from 29 => 25 at OSH and received 2
units of pRBCs with stable HCT from admission until surgery. At
OSH she was negative for c. diff. Negative for c. diff x 2 here,
stool culture negative as well. EGD was WNL but flex
sigmoidoscopy demonstrated severe active colitis. Gi biopsy
demonstrated chronic active colitis with ulceration and
fibrinopurulent exudate without granulomas or dysplasias and
without evidence of viral cytopathic changes. CT abdomen/pelvis
demonstrated interval progression of UC from scan from [**12/2136**]
now involving distal transverse colon along with rectum
involvement without free air, fluid or fistula. General surgery
was consulted as well as GI.  She was taken to surgery by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] on [**2137-7-31**] and a total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy
was performed. Her postoperative course was complicated by a
pulmonary embolism requiring a heparin drip, which resulted in a
large pelvic hematoma.  She was slow to progress and a CT scan
was performed.  Imaging studies showed small locules of
intra-abdominal free air as well as an extensive amount of
subcutaneous air throughout the abdominal wall adjacent to the
ileostomy.  She had intermittent tachycardia and worsening
complaints of right lower quadrant abdominal pain with exquisite
tenderness on exam and therefore was taken back to the OR for an
exploratory laparotomy on [**2137-8-7**].  The pelvic hematoma was
evacuation, lysis of adhesions was performed, and she had a
small bowel resection and ileostomy revision.  She remained
intubated overnight and was extubated on POD1.  Post-operatively
she was in the ICU for two days, then transfered to the surgical
floor.  She had blood loss anemia and was transfused 2U PRBCs on
POD2.  She was restarted on her heparin drip for her PE on POD2
as well after her HCT was shown to be stable.  Her ileostomy was
functioning, but she had persistent complaints of pain,
discomfort, and nausea that slowly improved over her
post-operative course.  She was on TPN postoperatively as her
nausea and pain prevented advancement of diet initially.  This
gradually improved and her diet was slowly advanced to regular.
She has been followed by the wound care/ostomy nurse throughout
her stay.  Chronic pain was also consulted and a fentanyl patch
was started in addition to oral medications titrated which
resulted in a significant improvement.  Physical therapy worked
with the patient during her postoperative course as well.  Upper
extremity ultrasound on [**8-8**] showed a DVT at her right PICC site
and this was removed.  The heparin drip was being restarted at
that time.  Lower extremity ultrasounds were negative.  A PICC
was placed on [**2137-8-11**] on the other arm for TPN and again, an
upper extremity ultrasound showed that she had a DVT in the left
subclavian vein on [**2137-8-14**] around the picc as well, so this
