Service:  MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient fell, with bleeding.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
white female with hypothyroidism, who presented to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for evaluation after the
patient was found in her bed this morning with bruises and
bleeding.  Reportedly, the patient was in her usual state of
health on the day prior to admission.  She recalled having
had dinner and not feeling great and went to bed.

The patient did not remember falling, but did remember
crawling into bed, which was on the [**Location (un) 1773**] and required
the patient to ascend three steps.  She reported feeling
wetness on her sheets and not feeling well.  She called her
neighbor, who came over and found her to have numerous
bruises with blood on her sheets.  The patient denied any
preceding events such as chest pain, headache, visual
changes, convulsions or lightheadedness.  She denied recent
orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She had baseline
shortness of breath that had been ongoing for two years.  She
noted occasional pain in the left part of her sternum, but
cannot recall when it happened last.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  History of peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications included Levoxyl and
aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had been a widow for eight years
and lived alone, but had neighbors who looked in on her
routinely.  She worked as a laboratory technician and
[**Hospital6 1129**] and at [**Hospital1 190**] in the past.  She reported a smoking history,
but quit six to seven years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
98.9??????F, a heart rate of 92, a blood pressure of 153/56, a
respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 94% on
room air.  In general, the patient was alert and oriented, in
no acute distress and very talkative.  On head and neck
examination, the patient had a right periorbital hematoma but
the eye was anicteric and not injected.  She had a left
surgical pupil, but her right pupil was reactive.  There was
a right lateral tongue hematoma.  There was no jugular venous
distention.

The pulmonary examination showed decreased breath sounds with
no wheezes.  The cardiovascular examination revealed distant
heart sounds with a I/VI systolic murmur in the left upper
sternal border.  There were no rubs or gallops.  The abdomen
had positive bowel sounds and was nontender and nondistended
with no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.  On examination of
the extremities, there was a large left arm hematoma with
left third and fourth toe hematomas as well.  There were 1+
pulses bilaterally.  On neurological examination, the patient
was alert and oriented times three with intact language and
comprehension.  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  Gait was not tested.

LABORATORY:  The patient had a hematocrit of 34.4, white
blood cell count of 16,100, hemoglobin of 11.9 and platelet
count of 218,000.  There was a sodium of 132, potassium of
4.2, chloride of 95, bicarbonate of 121, BUN of 23,
creatinine of 1.3 and glucose of 201.  Prothrombin time was
13.6 and partial thromboplastin time was 26.6.  CK was 786
with an MB of 6.

RADIOLOGY:  The left elbow was without fracture.  However,
the right distal radius had a fracture with dorsal
displacement of the fracture, but no loss of joint space.  A
head CT scan revealed a right subdural hematoma from the
parietal to the occipital lobe; this was 6 to 7 mm at its
widest diameter.  The chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax
and no infiltrate at the time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
intensive care unit for further workup.  The neurosurgery
service was consulted.  However, given her age and frail
status, no surgical intervention was offered at that time.
[**Hospital 17552**] medical management was begun.  With regard to
her right radial fracture, the orthopedic service was
consulted.  During her hospital stay, the fracture was
reduced and a cast was placed.  Further laboratory workup
revealed in line changes consistent with an acute myocardial
infarction.  CPKs were 914, 736, 459 and 337 sequentially
with a troponin elevation of 16.5, 11.2 and 8.9 sequentially.
The CK MB initially were 25, 15, 14 and 8 with indices of 3,
2 and 3.

Because of the patient's fall and subdural hematoma, the
decision was made not to anticoagulate her with heparin or
aspirin.  She was stabilized in the medical intensive care
unit and transferred to the floor for further workup.  She
underwent an echocardiogram, which revealed a left
ventricular systolic ejection fraction of greater than 55%,
but with a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction.  These findings were consistent with a
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

During the hospitalization, the patient experienced an acute
respiratory exacerbation with oxygen saturations decreasing
to the low 70s.  She was started on 100% nonrebreather with
adequate desaturation.  Subsequently, she was weaned to a 40%
scoop mask with oxygen saturations in the mid to high 90s.
The rapidity of her respiratory decline was worrisome for a
pulmonary embolism or possibly congestive heart failure.
However, the patient had no evidence of left ventricular
systolic dysfunction.  Lower extremity Doppler studies were
done to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis, which were
negative.

Because of the patient's bleeding tendency, a decision was
made not to further evaluate her for a pulmonary embolism
after a discussion with her primary attending physician and
with the patient.  A chest x-ray during this time was
suggestive of a pulmonary infiltrate and the patient was
started on empiric antibiotic treatment.  She remained
afebrile during this time.  She was given scheduled Atrovent
and albuterol nebulizer treatments to decrease wheezing and
poor air movement, with good result.  The patient was begun
on a regimen of Lopressor to treat her idiopathic
hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and to obtain rate control
kept between the 60s and 70s.

The patient had a questionable history of falls in the past.
However, after a discussion with her primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
had cared for her for 40 years, we were reassured that she
had not fallen before this episode which resulted in
hospitalization.  At this time, the cardiology service did
not feel it necessary to consider placement of a
defibrillator.  However, with the patient's idiopathic
hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, this may be a consideration
if her signs and symptoms of syncope increase.

At the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating with the
assistance of physical therapy without problems.
