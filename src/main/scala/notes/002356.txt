MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: w/ & w/o gadolidium ?cva
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man s/p fall in bathtub, ? cva based on CT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
w/ & w/o gadolidium ?cva
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

MRI OF THE HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, MRA OF THE BRAIN. MRA
OF THE CAROTID AND VERTEBRAL ARTERIES (NECK MRA).

CLINICAL INDICATION: 78-year-old man status post fall in the
bathtub? Rule out CVA based on prior CT.

COMPARISON: Prior CT of the head dated [**2133-2-27**].

MRI OF THE BRAIN.

TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images
were obtained, axial T2, magnetic susceptibility, axial FLAIR,
diffusion-weighted sequences. The T1-weighted images were
repeated after the intravenous administration of gadolinium
contrast.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior CT, there is evidence of
vasogenic edema involving the right cerebellar hemisphere, In
addition, there is a rounded heterogeneously enhancing mass at
the level of the right cerebellar tonsil and posterior to the
right flocculus, the inferior limit of this lesion is adjacent
to the right side of the medulla oblongata, in the axial view,
this mass measures approximately 16 x 19 mm x 20 x 21 mm in the
coronal view by 18 x 20 mm in the sagittal projection. There is
no evidence of hydrocephalus. The pattern of enhancement in this
lesion is slightly heterogeneous with areas of low signal. There
is mild deviation of the right tonsil to the left. Therefore,
this lesion possibly is extra-axial, however, there is no
evidence of large dural attachment. No diffusion abnormalities
are noted. The supratentorial structures demonstrate an area of
cystic encephalomalacia posterior to the left caudate nucleus as
well as multiple lacunar ischemic events involving the basal
ganglia bilaterally. No other areas with abnormal enhancement
are visualized. Significant mucosal thickening is observed on
the right side of the ethmoidal air cells, with possible medial
wall deformity on the right. Lamina papyracea fluid level is
identified on the left maxillary sinus, associated with
significant mucosal thickening, there is also mucosal thickening
on the right maxillary sinus and in the medial aspect of the
frontal sinus, significant amount of secretion is identified in
the nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of neoplastic process located on the inferior aspect
of the right cerebellar hemisphere, producing mass effect on the
right cerebellar tonsil, this lesion possibly is extra-axial,
however, is not completely clear given the pattern of edema and
enhancement. The differential diagnosis includes meningioma
versus metastatic lesion producing significant edema seen on the
right cerebellar hemisphere as described above. There is no
evidence of acute ischemic changes. Multiple lacunar ischemic
events are noted on the basal ganglia and posterior to the left
caudate nucleus. Maxillary sinusitis and ethmoidal mucosal
thickening. Small lacunar ischemic event is noted on the left
cerebellar hemisphere.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:

TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight arteriography was
performed with rotational reconstructions.

COMPARISON: None.

There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids as
well as the vertebrobasilar system. There is evidence of mild
atherosclerotic changes on the V4 segment of the left vertebral
artery vs mass effect. The anterior and middle cerebral arteries
appears patent without evidence of stenosis, there is no
evidence of aneurysms.

IMPRESSION: Mild narrowing of the V4 segment of the left
vertebral artery, likely representing atherosclerotic changes vs
mass effect, there is no evidence of other areas of stenosis in
the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] or aneurysm formation.

MRA OF THE CAROTID AND VERTEBRAL ARTERIES (NECK MRA).

TECHNIQUE: Two-dimensional time-of-flight MRA was performed,
coronal VIBE imaging was performed during infusion of
intravenous contrast, rotational reformatted images were
obtained.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: There is evidence of vascular flow in both common
carotids, mild- to-moderate stenosis is identified at the origin
of both internal carotids, correlation with ultrasound is
recommended if clinically warranted, both proximal vertebral
arteries are patent.

IMPRESSION: There is possible moderate stenosis at the origin of
both internal carotids in the cervical bifurcations, correlation
with carotid Doppler ultrasound is recommended if clinically
warranted.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2133-2-27**] 8:01 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C

Reason: Primary tumor?
Field of view: 34 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old man s/p fall with cerebellar tumor
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Primary tumor?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 78-year-old man status post fall. Findings
concerning for cerebellar tumor.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2133-2-27**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis
was performed after oral and intravenous contrast. Non-contrast
images of the abdomen and delayed images of the kidneys were
also obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube is seen terminating in the
high trachea. Within the lung in the right upper lobe, there is
a 1.7 x 3.0 cm mass which extends along the bronchial tree
towards the hilum. Within the para
