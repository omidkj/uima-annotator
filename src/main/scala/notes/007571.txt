History of Present Illness:
82M with myeloproliferative d/o and PCV, discharged yesterday
from hospitalization with same chief complaint, now returns from
rehab center with concern for increasing lethargy.
.
Patient was admitted [**2140-6-16**] for lethargy after a fall several
days prior with large R hip hematoma, a near-syncopal episode en
route to the hospital, and abnormal labs including WBC 119.3,
Plt 808, H/h 8.7/29.7, K 6.8 Cr 1.7. Imaging included negative
head CT, abdominal CT with large R buttock/thigh hematoma,
splenomegaly, and L adrenal nodule. Surgery consult felt R
hematoma was concerning for possible persistent bleed but no
concern for compartment syndrome and no surgical intervention
indicated. Patient was admitted to the ICU, fluid hydrated,
treated for hyperkalemia, given 2U PRBCs, and rate controlled
for intermittent atrial fibrillation with RVR. Hematology
consulted, concluded that mental status changes and electrolyte
imbalances cannot be attributed to tumor lysis syndrome or
leukostasis, as patient's smear showed no signs of leukemic
transformation. Hematology did find pt to be iron deficient, and
suggested possible noncompliance with outpatient PCV meds given
absence of expected macrocytic anemia while on allopurinol.
Renal consult found ATN, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis from
R thigh hematoma. Renal ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis.
Discharge labs were: WBC of 79.7, plt 547 h/h 8.1/27. Cr 1.7.
.
Today patient sent back from rehab for persistent/worsening
lethargy. In the ED, VS were T 97.7 HR 72 BP 101/68 RR 20 O2
99%/2LxNC Wt 71.6 kg. Pt was lethargic and oriented only to
self. Found to have jaundice, RUQ pain, abdominal distension,
hematuria, and new RBBB on EKG. Denies f/c/n/v/d/cp/sob.
Hypotensive SBP 90-105 and tachypneic RR 25-30. CT head
negative. RUQ ultrasound showed normal portal vein flor, a
gallbladder full of slude but without e/o cholecystitis, and
small ascites. CT abd/pelvis revealed mild ileus (gaseous
distention of large bowel without obstruction or [**Last Name (un) **]),
abdominal ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse anasarca
and stable splenomegaly. Grossly dilated bowel loops also seen
on KUB. Volume overload on CXR seen as increased perihilar
markings and cardiomegaly, plus increased R retrocardiac
opacity, with concern for atelectasis vs developing infection.
Surgery consult suggested percutaneous cholecystostomy; poor
surgical candidate. Given 2L IVF, 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for
presumed obstructive cholangitis and admitted to the ICU for
further management.
.
In the ICU, the patient is fatigued-appearing but oriented to
self, [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, and [**Month (only) 116**]. He does feel week. Says
he's here because rehab staff and his wife were "all crowding
around me" today. Denies chest pain and abdominal pain. Some
mild shortness of breath. Endorses belly fullness, and agrees
that pants and shoes were feeling tight at home prior to recent
hospitalization. Also reports diminished appetite; his clothes
had been feeling loose before they started feeling tight, and he
weighed 150 lbs at his last doctor's appt, down from baseline
170 lbs, time frame unknown. Feels his mouth is dry and voice
raspy. He normally lives at home with his wife; he's a retired
electrician who golfs and was working on his car a few weeks
before hospital admission.

Imaging:
=====================
RUQ U/S [**6-22**]: (wet read) - Increased liver echogenicity. Portal
vein normal flow; other veins not assessed by doppler.

.
CT abd/pelvis [**6-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Gaseous distention of large bowel without obstruction
represent mild ileus.
2. Interval development of small volume abdominal ascites,
bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse anasarca could reflect
third spacing in the setting of heart failure. Please correlate
clinically.
3. Stable splenomegaly as well as renal hypo- and hyper-dense
lesions, likely cysts, though incompletely characterized.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
.
