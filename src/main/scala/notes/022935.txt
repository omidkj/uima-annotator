History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 y.o male with h.o NHL, CHF with EF 30%, AS, ESRD on
HD MWF, afib, DM2, hypogammuloglobulinema who presents with
chest pain.  Pt states that he developed 8/10 L.sided chest
pressure with radiation to the back at 4pm today. He was given
his brother in law's nitro which he said alleviated his pain
somewhat. He states that pain was gone ~1hr later upon arrival
to [**Hospital **] Hospital. He denies
LH/dizziness/palp/sob/n/v/diaphoresis. He also denies recent
f/c/headache/ST/URI/cough/abdominal
pain/d/c/melena/brbpr/dysuria/leg swelling. Pt states that he's
never had chest pain prior to Monday. Monday at HD, he developed
a generalized feeling of unwell that he cannot describe further
with the same chest pressure. These are the same symptoms that
led to his admission on Wed. Today, similar symptoms present,
but this time he was not undergoing HD.

In the ED initial vitals were: 98.1 72 110/70 15 99%RA.  Pt was
given asa and nitro.  Pt had 1 reoccurrence of pain in the ED.
He was given nitro and BP went from systolic 114 to 93. Pt
reports normal BP is 90's. EKG reportedly without ischemic
changes. Per discussion with the cards fellow, no heparin given
platelet count.

Of note, pt admitted [**Date range (1) 25029**] and then readmitted [**Date range (1) **].
 Pt was admitted after reporting weakness, fatigue, and feeling
like a zombie at HD on the 11th, CE's were cycled and flat, on
heparin gtt briefly. Pt had an episode of hypotension to the
80's that resolved with IVF. The pt had been admitted [**11-23**] for
chest pressure, had a nuclear stress test that showed a moderate
reversible defect in the inferior wall. CE's flat.He was
discharged with instructions to follow up as an outpt for a
cardiac cath.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis (but he reports that he has a clot
in his L.arm related to his old fistula), pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2150-11-26**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V block. Left anterior
fascicular block.  Non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay of the left bundle-branch block type. Poor R wave
progression could be due to left anterior fascicular block
and/or intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes.

[**2150-11-26**] Chest Xray:
Stable chest x-ray examination with small-to-moderate sized
right pleural effusion and no superimposed acute process
identified.

[**2150-11-27**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed left main plus three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had an eccentric 60% stenosis with a 20mm Hg gradient.
The LAD was a heavily calcified vessel with a ostial 50%
stenosis, and proximal diffuse
disease to 70-80% involving D1. There was diffuse disease in the
mid-distal LAD to ~50%. The LCX had a modest very high OM1, a
large OM2, an atrial branch, a large branching OM3, and a large
OM4/LPL. The L-PDA was diffusely diseased, with an eccentric
60-70% stenosis proximally,
and provided collaterals to the RV/AM. The RCA was a modest
caliber non-dominant vessel, with a ostial 50% stenosis, and 99%
proximal occlusion with post-stenotic dilatation and faint
filling of the distalsmall AM and tiny AV groove mid RCA. The
conus branch was subtotally
occluded at the origin.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15 mm Hg and LVEDP of 26 mm
Hg. PA pressures were markedly elevated at 68/37 mm Hg, with an
associated mean wedge pressure of 28 mm Hg. Calculated cardiac
output and index were 5.1 L/minand 2.8 l/min/m2, respectively,
using a measured oxygen consumption of 252 ml O2/min. SVR was
normal at 1161 dyne s/cm5, and PVR was elevated at 314 dyne
s/cm5. Systemic arterial pressures were normal at 120/65 mmHg.
3. There was a mean gradient of 34 mm Hg across the aortic
valve. The calculated valve area was 0.92 cm2.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the L-PDA with a 2.5 x 12mm
MicroDriver bare metal stent. Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main plus three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate to severe aortic stenosis, with a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of
0.92cm2.
3. Severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
4. Severe pulmonary arter
