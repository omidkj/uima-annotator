Admission Date:  [**2176-12-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-12-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2100-11-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
white female with a past medical history significant for
end-stage multiple sclerosis, decubitus ulcers, atrial
tachycardia, who presents with hypoxia from [**Hospital3 6373**] Center.  The patient was recently admitted for
sepsis secondary to decubitus ulcers.  She was discharged on
[**2176-12-7**] with an extended course of broad spectrum
antibiotics.

She presents the day after discharge with an episode of
hypoxia at her rehabilitation facility.  The patient was
noticed to have an aspiration event by the husband who was at
the bedside.  Following this, she had some coughing and was
found to be hypoxic with 02 saturation at 47% on room air by
the medical staff.  The patient was placed on a
nonrebreathing with improved saturations to 96%.  However,
the patient remained tachypneic and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further workup and
management.

Upon arriving in the Emergency Department, the patient was
initially on a 100% nonrebreather with good oxygenation at
98%.  However, she then developed significant tachypnea with
respiratory rate into the 40s.  She maintained her
respiratory rate for some time; however, then began to have
decreased rate, eventually dropping to less than ten.  She
was finally noticed to be apneic and was intubated.
Approximately 30 minutes after the intubation, the patient
became severely hypotensive with systolic blood pressure at
40.  The patient responded to 1 liter of normal saline and a
dopamine drip at 10 micrograms.  Central venous access was
obtained.  A subsequent chest x-ray showed a small to
moderate right-sided pneumothorax.  A chest tube was placed
at this time with withdrawal of 800 cc of clear yellow
pleural fluid.

On mechanical ventilation, the patient initially had
oxygenation and was hemodynamically stable.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d.
3.  Vancomycin 1 gram q.d.
4.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
5.  Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
6.  Subcutaneous heparin.
7.  Multivitamins.
8.  Senna.
9.  Colace.
10. Vitamin C.
11. Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg q. four hours p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco or alcohol use.  The
patient is a [**Hospital6 595**]-speaking female, although she has been
nonverbal secondary to her multiple sclerosis.  She had been
living with her husband until her recent admission and
transfer to the [**Hospital3 **] Facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.6, blood pressure 122/99, pulse 118, respiratory rate 15,
02 saturation 97% on assist control ventilation with tidal
volume of 500 cc, respiratory rate of 12, positive
end-expiratory pressure of 5, FI02 of 100%.  General:  The
patient was flaccid and extremely cachectic and ill
appearing.  The patient had a significant blanching rash in a
reticular pattern over the anterior torso and bilateral upper
extremities.  HEENT:  The patient was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Her pupils were equally round, and reactive to
light.  Lungs:  The patient had right basilar rales with
decreased breath sounds at the left base, otherwise clear.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac with a regular rate, distant
heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  The patient had 2+ pitting edema of the
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  There is a left PICC
line in place.  Skin:  The patient has stage IV decubitus
ulcers at the sacrum and at the thoracic spine.  Neurologic:
the patient is completely flaccid with no muscle tone.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  CBC revealed a white blood cell
count of 9.2, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 514,000.
Chemistries of significance were a chloride of 99,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.4, calcium 7.4,
phosphate 1.7.

Microbiology studies:  The patient had positive blood
cultures from a previous admission on [**2176-12-1**].  She
had one out of two bottles positive for Prevotella and one
out of two bottles positive for pepto streptococcus.  Her
urine cultures from previous admission were negative.  Repeat
blood culture on [**2176-12-3**] was also negative.

Chest x-ray:  The patient had a moderate right-sided
pneumothorax, as previously mentioned.  There were moderate
bilateral pleural effusions.

EKG showed tachycardia with rate in the 130s with T wave
inversions in II, III, V4 through V6 and no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Initially, the patient was intubated due to her respiratory
failure.  She did well initially on mechanical ventilation
and was able to be weaned off without difficulty. The patient
was extubated on hospital day number two and subsequently had
good respiratory function and oxygenation.  She was continued
on her previous broad spectrum antibiotics for a history of
sepsis as well as for a possible new aspiration pneumonia.

2.  HYPOTENSION:  The patient was hypotensive after her
intubation.  This was likely secondary to initiation of
positive pressure ventilation, perhaps in combination with
medications that she received prior to the intubation.  She
was quickly weaned off the dopamine and maintained good blood
pressure off the pressors.  She had no further hemodynamic
instability.

3.  PNEUMOTHORAX:  The patient had a small right pneumothorax
likely secondary to placement of her central venous line.
Chest tube was placed and discontinued after two days.  The
pleural fluid that was drained and analyzed during the
placement of the chest tube showed that the effusion was
transudative.

Once the patient was transferred from the ICU to the floor,
she had an episode of hypoxia which was likely secondary to
reaccumulation of the pleural fluid.  She had a repeat
thoracentesis done for drainage of the fluid and subsequently
had good respiratory function.

4.  DECUBITUS ULCERS:  The patient was found to have
decubitus ulcers on her previous admission.  She continued to
have wet-to-dry dressing changes b.i.d.  The Plastics team
was consulted and recommended continuing the dressing
changes.  The patient was also continued on her antibiotics
with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl for a total of a six
week planned course.

On this admission, there were no clinical signs or symptoms
of bacteremia or sepsis secondary to her decubitus ulcers.

5.  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:  The patient has end-stage multiple
sclerosis and was given supportive care.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
placed on aspiration precautions and tube feeds were advanced
as tolerated.

7.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was full code on admission and
at discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged back to
[**Hospital3 **] Center.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is in good condition,
afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating tube feeds.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration.
2.  Decubitus ulcers.
3.  End-stage multiple sclerosis.
4.  Pneumothorax:  Right-sided pneumothorax resolved.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.
2.  Vancomycin 1 gram q. 24 hours.
3.  Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d.
4.  Vitamin C.
5.  Colace.
6.  Senna.
7.  Subcutaneous heparin.
8.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
9.  Multivitamins.
10. Magnesium sulfate.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] Center where she will continue her
broad spectrum antibiotics for a total of six weeks.  She
should also continue q.d. to b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing
changes for her decubitus ulcers.  The patient should be
placed on aspiration precautions and tube feeds should be
continued.

FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with her primary care
provider.
