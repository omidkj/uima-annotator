Service:

ADDENDUM:  Please see previous discharge summary for events
during hospitalization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course was uneventful.  Her creatinine was increased to 2.6
on the floor, after having her PO lasix and lisinopril
increased.  As such, it was felt that the patient may be
mildly dehydrated.  As such, the patient's PO lasix was
discontinued, and her lisinopril was held for one day.  Her
creatinine had decreased to 2.5 at the time of discharge.  It
was felt that it would be reasonable to restart lisinopril at
2.5 qd, and have her electrolytes checked in several days to
insure that her renal function has not worsened.  For now,
her lasix will be discontinued, as the patient was not felt
to be overloaded, and it was felt that the patient may now be
able to take in the POs necessary to compensate for diuresis.
