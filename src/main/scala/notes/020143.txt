Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-1-11**]: Aortic valve replacement with a size 25-mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve.


History of Present Illness:
63 M with no significant past medical history who is being
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for severe AS with heart failure.
Patient initially presented to BIDN with worsening shortness of
breath. He first noticed increasing weakness about six weeks ago
and then over the last two weeks, he also reports worsening
shortness of breath. Previously had very good exercise
tolerance, but over the last two weeks has been getting dyspneic
with walking. Also reports having a new 2 pillow orthopnea that
developed over the last two weeks, as well as
intermittent PND. The patient also reports having new LE edema
that for the last few weeks has been getting worse.
Prior to this, the patient has been very active; he was a
marathon runner, was working out up to four hours/day as
recently as six months ago. He reports having intermittent night
sweats over the last few weeks - occasional night cough; only
occasionally productive of whitish sputum. Denies any bloody
sputum.  Denies any recent fevers.  Reports decreased appetite
for the last six weeks, with 5-6 pound weight loss over last two
weeks.  The patient also reports increased urinary frequency
(but reports that this has been a long standing issue since he
was in his teens), hesitancy; denies any blood in urine. He also
reports having lower back pain that started about 5-6 weeks ago.
Of note, CT from OSH showed that the patient had a chest
infiltrate, as well as concern for malignant lesions in bones.
Patient was also found to have multiple bony lesions and a high
PSA thought to be widely metastatic prostate cancer however this
is not yet confirmed with tissue and oncology feels that he
still
would have a three year prognosis regardless. CT also showed
enlarged heart, ECHO showed EF 20-25%, with severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild AR, severe aortic
stenosis. Cardiac surgery was consulted for AVR.

Past Medical History:
Prostate CA

Social History:
- Tobacco history: The patient denies any cigarette use in the
past.
- ETOH: 3-4 beers daily, four days/week for last 30 years
- Illicit drugs:  denies
The patient lives with his mother who is a 85 y/o.
He used to work as a physical education teacher.  Now
intermittently works as a painter.


Family History:
Brother diagnosed with [**Name (NI) 4278**] lymphoma at 51 y/o, sister with
acromegaly, father with stroke at 87 y/o.
Denies any history of early MI or cardiovascular disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications
in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= [**6-19**] %). LVEF improves with institution of 0.04mcg/kg/min
epinepherine to 15%. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis, which improved
to moderate free wall hypokineisis on epinepherine. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Patient is on epinephreine 0.08 mcg/kg/min,
Norepinepherine, 0.08 mcg/kg/min, vasopression 3.6 units/hr. LV
function improved on ionotropes to 25%. RV function mildly
hypokinetic. There is a tissue prosthesis (#25 magna per
surgeons) in the aortic position with no perivalvular leaks.
Peak graident 12 mm Hg, Mean 6 mm Hg. Aortic contours intact.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2132-1-13**]
11:06 AM
Final Report:
1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.
Interval removal of several of the mediastinal drains. Bibasilar
chest tubes and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with
its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract are stable.
2. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative
cardiac and
mediastinal contours. There continues to be patchy bibasilar
airspace
opacities likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema, which is
essentially
unchanged, although a diffuse pneumonia cannot be excluded. No
pneumothorax is seen. Relative density of the ribs raises
concern for sclerotic metastases, for which clinical correlation
is advised. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was a direct admission to the operating room where he
had an aortic valve replacement by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] on [**1-11**].
Please see operative report for further details, in summary he
had: an aortic valve replacement with a size 25-mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve, bypass time was 102
minutes with a crossclamp of 76 minutes. He tolerated the
operation however had low ejection fraction/ he was transferred
to the cardiac surgery ICU on multiple pressors and inotropes.
He remained hemodynamically stable in the early post-op course,
because of his poor cardiac performance he was kept sedated
through the first post operative night. On POD1 his sedation was
lightened, he awoke neurologically intact, his vent
