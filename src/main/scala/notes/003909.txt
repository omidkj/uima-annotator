Relevant Imaging:
1) CT [**2111-6-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Very small amount of stranding and fluid in the right
retroperitoneum,
most consistent with a small retroperitoneal hemorrhage, likely
related to
right femoral central venous catheter placement. Amount of blood
does not
appear large enough to explain clinical hematocrit drop from 40
to 24.

2. Dense bilateral lung base consolidations, concerning for
aspiration or
infection.

2) CXR [**2111-6-22**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78991**] is a 54 year old male with depression s/p ethylene
glycol ingestion for suicide attempt, acidotic with hospital
course c/b fevers, hypotension, anemia, and difficult weaning
from ventilator secondary to AMS.

1)Ethylene glycol ingestion: Patient was admitted to the MICU
after an ethylene glycol ingestion. He had been started on an
ethanol gtt at the OSH. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], renal was
consulted and he was started on fomepizole and access was
established for hemodialysis. He underwent two hemodialysis
sessions and the ethylene glycol level was montiored until it
was no longer detectable. The HD line was then removed.

2)Fevers: During his hospital stay, the patient spiked high
fevers. The cause was thought to be a pneumonia given his sputum
which grew staph aureus and the cxray which suggested a possible
LLL infiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin Zosyn but he
continued to spike through antibiotics. The decision was made to
stop the antibiotics given lack of clear source of infection. He
continued to have fevers but lower than they had been. Cultures
remained negative.

3)Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated initially for
airway protection given changes in his mental status. There was
also some thought that there was a component of PNA vs. volume
overload. He was treated briefly for hospital aquired pneumonia
(which were then stopped) and he was also diuresed with Lasix.
He was successfully extubated and his mental status slowly
improved.

4) Anemia: Patient had a significant drop in his hematocrit from
admission. He was guaiac negative. He also underwent a CT
abdomen/pelvis which was negative for an RP bleed. He did
received 2 units of pRBCs during his stay in the MICU.

5)Depression: Patient presented with ethylene glycol ingestion
as part of suicide attempt. Pscyhiatry and social work were
consulted once patient was extubated.
