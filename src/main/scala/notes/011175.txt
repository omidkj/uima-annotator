She was brought up for a follow-up bronchoscopy on [**12-28**]

postoperative residual swelling of the trachea and main stem
bronchus which resulted in significant subglottic stenosis
and mucous plugging.  Her stent was able to be cleared, but

with phenylephrine.  She was sent to the Medical Intensive

97, her respiratory rate was 25, and her oxygen saturation
was 100% on assist-control with a positive end-expiratory
pressure of 5, and a FIO2 of 50%.  In general, the patient
was a well-developed and well-nourished female on a
ventilator in no apparent distress.  Head and neck
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The neck was
supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No stridor.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lung examination revealed coarse
breath sounds bilaterally.  She did have inspiratory wheezes
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was transferred to the
Thoracic Surgery Service on hospital day two after being
extubated, and she was in good care there.  She was using 35%
face mask and saturating about 98%.

Her floor care required frequent racemic epinephrine
nebulizers for her wheezing, but her need for this soon
decreased during this admission.  In addition, to the
bronchoalveolar lavage from this bronchoscopy, it ended up
growing out Aspergillus fumigatus.  An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained and the patient was started on by
mouth voriconazole instead of Zosyn.  Her diet was quickly
advanced, and by [**1-4**] she was ready to go.

Her physical examination on discharge revealed she was alert
and oriented times three and in no apparent distress.  She
had good air entry bilaterally with some wheezing, but her
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She was
saturating 100% on room air.  Her abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Her extremities were without
any clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
