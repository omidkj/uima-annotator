CT [**2140-1-19**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2140-1-16**].

The previously seen right frontal ventricular shunt has been
removed and the shunt tract is still visible. There may be
minimal increase in size of the ventricles diffusely.

Again seen are subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly along the
sulci of the left cerebrum. The previously seen hemorrhage
involving the left temporal lobe is no longer visualized,
although the hypodensity persists. There is a left-sided coil
pack in the sylvian fissure and the streak artifact limits
evaluation of the adjacent brain.

The basal cisterns are patent.

There are scattered small hypodensities of the deep and
periventricular white matter which likely represent chronic
microangiopathic changes.

A right frontal burr hole is again seen. No suspicious bony
abnormalities are noted.

There is fluid/soft tissue change of the right mastoid air
cells.

IMPRESSION:
1. Since [**2140-1-16**], removal of right ventricular shunt with
minimal increase in size of the ventricles diffusely.
2. Persistent predominantly left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage
and edema of the anterior left temporal lobe.

CT [**2140-1-4**]:
FINDINGS: The patient has undergone interval coiling of the
previously demonstrated left MCA aneurysm. Streak artifact from
the coils somewhat obscures visualization at this level.
Redemonstrated is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage not
appreciably changed compared to [**2140-1-4**] at 10:47 a.m. There
has been interval placement of a ventriculostomy catheter via a
right frontal craniotomy which enters the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle and terminates near the third ventricle.
The ventricular system is slightly smaller compared to the prior
study, although it remains symmetric. Slight shift of the septum
pellucidum to the right by approximately 4 mm has not
appreciably changed. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
remain clear.

IMPRESSION: Interval coiling of left MCA aneurysm. Diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage not appreciably changed. Interval
placement of ventriculostomy catheter which enters frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of right lateral ventricle to a termination near the third
ventricle. Slight interval decrease in size of ventricular
system. No change in slight rightward subfalcine herniation by
about 4 mm.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU on [**2140-1-4**]. She had a
non-traumatic SAH. She had a CTA which revealed a left MCA
aneurysm. The patient had an angio with a coiling on the day of
admission as well as an EVD placement. She was started on
aspirin and plavix after the angio. On [**2140-1-5**] she was
extubated. She had a CTA/CTP on [**1-6**] which showed no vasospam
and she remained neurologically stable. The patient was more
somnolent on [**2140-1-8**] and after a family meeting a CTA was
obtained. It showed no vasospasm. On [**1-9**] CSF was sent because
the patient spiked a fever to 103.4. She was started on
antibiotics by the ICU team for a presumed pneumonia. She had
LENIs which were negative on [**2140-1-10**].

On [**1-10**] the patient was neurologically stable and her drain was
raised to 20 cm H2O.
She had a repeat CTA/CTP on [**1-12**] which showed no change and she
also had a PICC line placed for her antibiotics. On [**2140-1-15**] her
CSF came back which showed no micro-organisms with 2+ polys. We
tried clamping her drain but she failed with ICPs > 25.
On [**2140-1-16**] her CT showed increased size of temporal horns. On
[**2140-1-17**] one antibiotic was stopped. When her drain was clamped
on [**2140-1-17**], she did well. Her ICPs were < 20.
The drain was removed on [**2140-1-19**]. The patient was also
transferred to the floor that day. On [**2140-1-20**] she passed her
speech and swallow evaluation and her vanco was discontinued.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy recommended rehab. The
patient was neurologically stable and was deemed ready for
discharge on [**2140-1-21**]. Her PICC line was removed prior to
discharge. She was afebrile. Neurologically: she was oriented x
3 and full strength in all extremities; no pronator drift; face
symmetric.
