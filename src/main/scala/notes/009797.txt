Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus,
recent surgery and chemotherapy, transferred from OSH with pulm
edema, ruled in for MI at OSH wit TnI 0.16, CK 178, MB 6.7,
index 3.8. BUN 43, Crea 1.7, K+ 5.9, Glu 503. Had received at
OSH 80mg lasix, was started on nitro gtt. Was feeling fine last
night, presented to OSH with acute SOB. No Chest pain, fever,
chills, cough.

In ED, initial VS were  T97.6, HR 81, BP 135/65, RR 25, O2 Sat
100% on NIPPV. ECG with lateral ST depression aVL, V4-V6.
Patient was put on NIPPV, received lasix 80mg x1, nitro gtt, was
started on hep gtt, no floey 2/2 blood clots from urethra. CXR
w/o official read yet, but looks overloaded. ABG in ED

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative except for SOB, dysuria
since radiation therapy started.

STUDIES:

[**2140-6-5**] CXR:
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size is at
the upper limits of normal. There is a perihilar opacity with
bilateral increased interstitial opacity consistent with
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There is a confluent opacity
within the lung bases bilaterally either representing confluent
alveolar edema or aspiration or pneumonia. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2140-6-9**] Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
patent.
The LAD a 99% in-stent restenosis of the proximal vessel. The
LCX had
80% origin and 80% mid stenoses. The RCX had patent stents and
an
occluded posterolateral branch.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP
was
17mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated measuring
50/22mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 21mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were
normal at
106/52mmHg. The cardiac index calculated using an assumed oxygen

consumption rate was 4l/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with
overlapping 2.5
x 23 mm and 2.5 x 18 mm CYPHER DES which were post dilated to
2.75 with
a 2.75 x 20 mm NC [**Male First Name (un) **] balloon at 22 ATM. Final angiography
revealed
no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III
flow (See
PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Cardiac index was 4.l/min/m2.
4. Successful PCI of in-stent restenosis of the proximal LAD

[**2140-6-10**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- to distal
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A slightly-eccentric,
posteriorly-directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
