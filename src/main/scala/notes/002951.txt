.
She initially presented with diffuse edema involving the entire
body, that had worsened over the past 2-3 months. She was found
to have FSGS by renal biopsy. Her hospitalization was also
significant for an L1-L2 vertebral compression fracture with
near paralysis of her lower extremities. She underwent T10-L4
posterior fusion that was complicated by wound infection and VRE
bacteremia. She underwent wound exploration with incision and
debridement on [**3-10**]. She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**3-15**] to complete a course of linezolid.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was found to have a UTI and was
started on Amikacin on [**3-19**]. Also had multiple episodes of
emesis o/n. Febrile to 102.7 at 01:00 on [**3-20**]. Then on am of
[**3-20**], had approx 200 cc of coffee ground emesis. Sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, NG lavage with return of blood that did not clear
after 500 cc saline. Received 2L NS for BP 84/64, and levoflox /
Flagyl. Also received 2 units FFP for INR 1.4.
.
Admitted to MICU where bedside EGD showed grade 3 esophagitis
without active bleed.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2130-3-20**] 12:52 PM
AP CXR: Nasogastric tube has been placed, coiling in the
proximal stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable
allowing for marked patient rotation. No focal areas of
consolidation within the lungs, and there are no definite
pleural effusions. Right costophrenic angle has been excluded
from the study and cannot be assessed. Mild elevation of right
hemidiaphragm is noted.

pleural effusion.
2. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, stable.

metallic streak artifact and subcutaneous soft tissue stranding
extending down to the spinal canal is present. It is
indeterminate how much of this represents postoperative change
vs. possible infection/phlegmon.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to MICU under the care of the Medicine Service.
A bedside EGD was performed which showed grade 3 esophagitis
without active bleed, and UGI bleed resolved with PPI's.  Her
Hct was stable at 28 after receiving 2units of FFP (in ED) and
2units of PRBC (on the floor).  Her hypotension was persistent
thought secondary to her cholecystitis seen on her abdominal CT
as well as her MDR-resistant pseudomonal UTI.  A CVL was placed
and she was started on Levophed for blood pressure support.  She
was continued on Amikacin for her pseudomonal UTI and started on
Zosyn for her cholecystitis.  Her linezolid from a previous VRE
bacteremia was continued until [**3-24**].  General Surgery was
consulted and initially felt that she did not require surgical
intervention at the time and she was planned for percutaneous
cholecystotomy.

She managed to defervesce without percutaneous drainage and was
weaned off pressors on [**3-23**] and her blood pressure normalized.
Foley was changed and repeat UA improved.  A one week course of
Amikacin was completed for her pseudomonal UTI, her course of
Linezolid completed on [**3-24**], and she was transferred to the
floor on Zosyn.

She was re-evaluated by General Surgery on [**3-26**], the decision to
proceed with a lap chole on [**3-27**] was made. She was taken to the
operating room where the laporascopic chole was converted into
an open cholecystectomy secondary to a gangrenous gallbladder.
Postoperatively her care was transferred to the General Surgery
service.
Her staples were removed on day of discharge; she will require
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] mid [**Month (only) 547**].
