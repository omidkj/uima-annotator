History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year-old man with a history of kidney
transplant x 2, DM, bilateral BKA with RLE non-healing ulcer
(right BKA in [**2144-5-21**]), who presents from rehab with AMS. Of
note, he was recently discharged on [**2144-6-13**] after being admitted
with a CHF exacerbation; at that time, he also had a wound VAC
placed on his right stump and was treated with two weeks of
vancomycin for an enterococcus wound infection. He was doing
well at his nursing home until the day prior to admission when
he was noted to have worsening mental status. He was also found
to have a UTI and was started on imipenem. On the day of
admission, he was found standing next to his bed on his stumps
and was combative and noncooperative with nursing home staff,
pulling out both his PICC and foley. He was then transferred to
the ED for further evaulation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 P 51 BP 141/83 R 18 O2 97%ra
sat. He was given vancomycin and zosyn, later spiked a
temperature to 102.9 rectal which resolved with PR tylenol, and
was placed in wrist restraints for combativeness. His right BKA
was draining purulent material and vascular was consulted, with
a recommendation to start broad spectrum antibiotics. He was
also noted to have diarrhea and an abdominal CT was performed to
rule out colitis or an abdominal process, with an initial read
that was negative. Because of his history of VRE, he was also
given linezolid and then ceftriaxone 2g/acyclovir 50 mg x 1 to
cover for meningitis. An LP was attempted (3 passes) but was
unsuccessful. He was admitted to the MICU because of his severe
agitation and concern that he would fail management on the
floor.
.
On the floor, he was agitated but intermittently cooperative
with interview and exam.

CT HEAD [**2144-6-27**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no
hemorrhage.

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2144-6-28**]:
1. Cardiomegaly, small pericardial effusion and small bilateral
pleural
effusions, body wall edema. Findings likely secondary to volume
overload.
2. Small amount of gas in bladder, mild bladder wall thickening
and
perivesical stranding may be seen in the setting of infection.
Recommend
clinicalcorrelation.
3. Bilateral atrophic native kidneys are in place. Transplanted
kidney is
noted within the right lower quadrant area.
4. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Extensive atherosclerosis with prior right SFA stenting.

KNEE XRAY [**2144-6-29**]:
The patient is status post right-sided below-the-knee
amputation. There is
soft tissue gas in an ulcer adjacent to the distal tibial stump.
However, the
cortical margins are unchanged and preserved since the previous
study.
Underlying osteomyelitis is likely given the development of the
ulcer
extending to exposed bone (best seen on the lateral view). There
is increase
in the soft tissue swelling since the prior study. Vascular
calcifications
are identified.

OPERATIVE REPORT [**2144-7-1**] DEBRIDEMENT:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing right BKA stump

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing right BKA stump

ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5045**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29242**], M.D.

REASON FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male who
underwent right below-the-knee amputation a bout a month ago.
He
was found standing next to his bed on his BKA stumps at rehab,
confused and combative and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for stump
infection and MS changes.  The decision was made to debide the
stump back to viable bone and soft tissue.  The procedure was
discussed in detail and the patient signed an informed consent
prior to the procedure.

OPERATIVE NOTE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
and the right leg was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion. A spinal block was performed and level was confirmed.
A
ronjour was then used to trim the tibia to healthy, bleeding
bone
which only required removal of about 1cm of distal tibia.  Skin
and soft tissue was also debrided to healthy tissue.  There was
a
pocket between the anterior and posterior compartments that
contained a 20cc fluid collection.  This fluid was sent for
aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  Hemostasis was achived and a
occlusive negative pressure dressing was placed with continuous
suction at 100mmHg.

The patient's indwelling foley catheter was removed at the
request of the primary team.

The patient awoke from MAC sedation, tolerated the procedure
well,  and was taken to the PACU uneventfully.

The estimated blood loss of the procedure minimal.

Complications: none


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 56 year old male s/p kidney transplant x 2, DM1,
bilateral BKA with RLE stump who presented with AMS secondary to
sepsis from UTI and osteomyleitis from stump site infection.
Patient is s/p multiple debridements and primary closure done by
vascular surgery currently on tobramycin.

[**2144-6-13**], pt had a wound VAC placed on his right stump and was
treated with two weeks of vancomycin for an (VSE) enterococcus

antibiotics at this time. Initially presented with overlying
