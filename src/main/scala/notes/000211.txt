CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2173**], aortic valve
replacement for aortic stenosis, DDD pacemaker for
tachy-brady syndrome, breast cancer, transferred from
[**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital for congestive heart failure
management and cardiac catheterization.

The patient was reported to be independent, per her daughter,
until [**8-1**], when she had a syncopal episode and was diagnosed
with tachy-brady syndrome.  At that time, she received a
pacemaker.  In [**2182-2-1**], she had her first episode of
congestive heart failure and required intubation, per her
daughter.  The daughter states that she had another admission
since that time for sudden onset congestive heart failure
complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In [**2182-7-1**], the patient had both congestive heart
failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation at [**Hospital3 1196**], requiring
intubation.  She also had a right effusion that was tapped
for 1.5 liters.  This was transudative and not believed to be
malignant.  She also had new onset atrial fibrillation during
that period, and was started on Coumadin.  She was discharged
to rehabilitation on [**7-27**].  An echocardiogram during this
admission also revealed an ejection fraction of 50 to 55%.  A
stress test revealed an old anterior infarct and inferior
wall ischemia.

The patient did well until [**2182-8-4**], when she had
increased shortness of breath, as noticed by the
rehabilitation staff.  She was admitted to [**Hospital3 4527**]
with a congestive heart failure exacerbation, and started on
amiodarone.  She had an echocardiogram that revealed no
changes from her previous, and an aortic valve area of 0.8
cm.sq.  She underwent thoracentesis of the right effusion,
consistent with transudate.  She was also started on an ACE
for afterload reduction.

Over the next few days, the patient had diuresis  that
plateaued, and worsening renal failure.  Her ACE inhibitor
was stopped.  She remained on lasix.  Renal consult was
obtained at that time for a creatinine of 2.0.  She remained
to have difficult-to-control blood pressure with very low and
very high.  She also was noted to be very sensitive to
Hydralazine.  Cardiology wanted to consider renal artery
stenosis that could contribute to her decreased perfusion to
her kidney.

On [**8-14**], she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
after an acute episode of shortness of breath and
hypertension.  She had flash pulmonary edema that likely
occurred from high blood pressure, the etiology of which was
unknown.  It may have been precipitated by atrial flutter.
She continued to have problems with her fluid balance, and
was diuresed with high-dose Diuril and lasix.  She had a Swan
to help determine her volume status, and her creatinine
increased to 2.4.

She was also noted to have methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus of the blood and urine.  She was
treated with Zosyn and vancomycin until cultures were
negative.  As her diuresis improved, she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization and workup of a question of renal artery
stenosis.  Upon admission, she was without chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 85-year-old woman with history of
multiple medical problems, admitted with difficult-to-manage
congestive heart failure, question of renal artery stenosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:
a.  Ischemia.  The patient did not have any episodes of
ischemia on admission.  She denied any chest pain at that
time.  It was felt that her congestive heart failure could be
worsened by ischemia; therefore, the patient was referred for
cardiac catheterization.  She underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2182-9-9**], that demonstrated
severe three vessel disease.  She had a LMCA with 30%
proximal lesion.  The left anterior descending was diffusely
diseased proximally and totally occluded in the mid-segment,
with filling via collaterals.  The left circumflex had
diffuse disease up to 70%.  The right coronary artery had a
calcified ostial 80% lesion.  She had an saphenous vein graft
to left anterior descending that was totally occluded
proximally.  She had a normal filling pressure with reduced
cardiac output of 2.3.  She had renal artery angiography with
no renal artery stenosis.  She underwent successful
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting
of the mid-left anterior descending lesion with two stents.

Following the patient's catheterization, she had a brief
episode of hypotension requiring dopamine.  She was then
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.
On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, she was found to be
short of breath and hypertensive, with diffuse wheezes
bilaterally.  She had the dopamine discontinued, and a nitro
drip was started.  She was also noted to be in congestive
heart failure at that time, and was diuresed aggressively.

The patient had a Swan floated for help with management of
her volume status.  Then she was brought back to the
catheterization laboratory on [**2182-9-13**].  At that
time, intervention on the right coronary artery lesion was
attempted.  She had rotatherapy on the right coronary artery.
She then underwent stenting with a final residual of 10%.
The patient then attempted to have intervention on her left
circumflex proximal R1 that had a 90% lesion.  The lesion
could not be crossed, and therefore was not treated.  The
patient then underwent adjustment of her medicines to
optimize her medical management of her ischemia in light of
her severe disease.

b.  CV pump:  The patient has a known history of diastolic
dysfunction with normal ejection fraction.  She has had many
episodes of flash pulmonary edema in the past, as evidenced
by recent Intensive Care Unit admission to [**Hospital3 4527**]
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
Following the catheterization, the patient again, on
[**9-9**], experienced flash pulmonary edema.  The patien
