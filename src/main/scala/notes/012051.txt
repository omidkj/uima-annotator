Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue/Dypsnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right IJ, left femoral a line, left radial a-line, bronchoscopy,
intubation, paralysis

History of Present Illness:
62 yo F h/o Crohn's Disease, HTN, who presents with complaints
of SOB and fatigue since this morning. Patient reportedly awoke
Sunday morning with fatigue. She complained of dyspnea on
exertion on the walk from the parking lot to church. During
church she felt cold and more fatigued. Due to her progressive
symptoms, her husband brought her to the [**Name (NI) **] around 1500 today.
The day prior to presentation, the patient and family were
vacationing in [**Hospital1 789**] and per the family, the patient felt
well. She complained only of constipation the day prior which
resolved Saturday evening.
.
She had a recent hospitalization [**2-22**] in [**State 108**] for RLL PNA
and anemia (Hct 23 and received 4 units prbcs). She completed a
course of levofloxacin. She was also started on hydralazine at
that time. She saw her PCP [**3-24**] and was reportedly feeling well.
Her dypsnea complaints were improving and a CXR at that time
showed a RLL opacity, but otherwise clear. Also started on
atenolol on [**3-24**] due to palpitations the patient was
experiencing.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.6 77 127/98 16 95% RA. She
immediately triggered on arrival due to marked nursing concern.
On arrival she was initially A&Ox3, but shortly thereafter
became more obtunded, BP trended down quickly to 60s/40s then
lost pulses, received CPR x 1-2 min w/ 1 dose epi. Intubated.
Given succinylcholine for intubation. R IJ line and left femoral
A-line placed under sterile conditions. Started on on dopamine
and levophed as well as a fentanyl/versed gtt. She received 4
liters NS. Also given 10 mg IV decadron. Reportedly
dyssyncrochonus with the vent and biting tube with O2 sat high
80s and gave vecuronium with good effect. She was also ordered
for levofloxacin but has not yet received.
.
Cr: 2.2 (1.6 on [**3-1**]) K: 6.4, Lactate: 3.1. ABG: 7.12/46/144.
She was given calcium gluconate, insulin/d50, and bicarb and
repeat K 4.9. EKG: SR 76, STD/TWI V4-6. Cardiology fellow
performed a bedside echo with reportedly good pump function.
.
VS prior to transfer: 99 105/57 20 100% on AC 350 x 20, 10 PEEP
and FiO2 100%.Currently on dopa at 20 and norepi at 1. Fentanyl
at 25 and versed at 2. Notably spiked to 102 rectally.
.
The patient was quickly weaned off of pressors in the ICU. She
was difficult to ventilate due to increased airway resistance
requiring paralysis. The patient was continued on antibiotics,
she was extubated, and then diuresed. The patient had some
bursts of atrial fibrillation and she was started on a heparin
gtt. She was stabilized and transfered to the floor.

Blood Culture: Negative

TTE [**3-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial
pericardial effusion.
