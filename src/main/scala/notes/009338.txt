Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening mental status and respiratory failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
70 M with multiple lung co-morbidities including severe
kyphoscoliosis resulting in severe restrictive physiology,
severe sleep disordered breathing, hypoventilation syndrome,
severe pHTN, chronic dHF who presents with worsening confusion
over the past 4 weeks which prompted her daughters to bring her
into the ER by 911 this evening. History is taken through
daughter's who state their mother has become more confused
throughout the past 4 weeks. They state she denies any dyspnea,
fever, cough, URI symptoms, and that she takes her medications
on her own. They state she has refused to wear the BiPaP machine
since it was brought into the household in [**Month (only) 1096**] after she
was diagnosed with the severe sleep disordered breathing.
In the ER she was tachypneic into the 30s and had decrease in O2
saturation into 70s, she was given multiple neb treatments with
minimal improvement. An ABG was drawn 7.13/107/38 and she was
then placed on BIPAP and transferred to the ICU. Vitals prior to
ICU arrival were 129/64, 92, 20s, 86-96% on bipap, only on 10
minutes.
Upon arrival the patient has no complaints and is able to state
her name, the year, and her location. When asked regarding her
code status she is not able to express understanding.

Echo [**2166-2-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-14**], the
degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.

CXR [**2166-2-5**]:
COMPARISON: [**2166-2-3**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
transparency of the right lung has improved. At both the right
lung base and in the entire left lung, however, small scattered
areas of opacity are seen, most likely caused by chronic
infection. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Borderline size
of the cardiac silhouette, no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
Unchanged position of [**Location (un) 931**] stabilization device, unchanged
sternal wires.


Brief Hospital Course:
Respiratory Failure
Contribtors include severe kyphoscoliosis resulting in severe
restrictive physiology, severe sleep disordered breathing,
hypoventilation syndrome, severe pHTN, chronic dHF. Because of
tenuous respiratory status and initial infiltrate was started on
course of Levoquin. Given hypercarbia and hypoxia, work toward
NC when awake and NIPPV when asleep. Formulation is worsening of
underlying diseases - spinal and pulmonary hypertension (worse
on echo), possible central drive failure (particularly at
night). Aim for permissive pCO2 80-90. Initally treated with
fluticasone, ipratropium, salmeterol and albuterol, with
continuation of the latter two, as per her home regimen. Appears
euvolemic at present but will restart home Lasix and observe.

Altered Mental Status
TSH, folate, B12 came back within normal limits. Simple
toxicology negative. Patient with episodes of visual/audio
hallucination on [**2-4**] (seeing people not in the room and hearing
a baby) during the afternoon and evening when off CPAP and on
nasal cannula. ABG obtained in the morning with her on nasal
cannula. Patient was placed back on CPAP titrated to mental
status. Likely contributors were compasine, hypercarbia and
underlying neurodegenerative disorder possible.

Osteoporosis
Continued vitamin D and Ca supplementation.
