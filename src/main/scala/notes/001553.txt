Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 107389**] was admitted to the Surgery service with a
Klebsiella UTI and coagulase negative staph positive blood
cultures at her rehab. She was started on Cefriaxone and
Vancomycin and her PICC line was pulled and the tip cultured and
blood and urine cultures were also sent. All cultures were
negative. On [**1-9**], she became anxious and then developed
respiratory distress, hyopoxia, and acidosis that required
emergent intubation. She was transfered to the ICU where her
respiratory distress was attributed to CHF as a TTE showed a EF
of 40% whereas she had previously had a normal EF. She was
diuresed and extubated. Renal was consulted for worsening renal
funciton that they believed was secondary to ATN. A renul
ultrasound showed only mild left pelvocaliectasis and no signs
of obstruction or hydronephrosis. Upper extremity ultrasound
revealed left IJ occluding thrombus and and left upper extremety
non-occlusive thrombus. The patient was started on Heparin drip
and bridged to coumadin. A repeat ECHO on [**1-12**] showed improved
EF of >55% and no vegetations. Mrs [**Known lastname 107389**] was transferred back
to the regular floor and did well. Infectious disease was
consulted and recommended continuing the vancomycin and stopping
the ceftriaxone as a 10 day course of treatment had been
completed. Repeat blood and urine cultures were negative. A new
PICC line was placed on [**1-13**] for antibiotics and TPN, but given
her recent bacteremia and her tolerating tube feeds well, TPN
was not restarted. She remained afebrile and was tolerating her
tube feeds well, and was advanced slowly to a regular diet in
addition to her tube feeds. A left upper extremity ultrasound of
the old PICC site showed findings suggestive of left antecubital
thrombosed pseudoaneurysm. Due to the presence of multiple
thrombi, infectious disease recommended continuing the IV
Vancomycin for 4 weeks and will continue to follow her
laboratory and micro data at rehab. Her abdominal
wound/ostomy/fistula continued to require daily care by
wound/ostomy nurses. Recommendations for wound care and
nutrition were included in the page one.
.
Heme: Pt was found to have left IJ and left upper extremety
thrombi. Given her respiratory distress early in her admission a
chest ct-angiogram was considered but not performed secondary to
her worsening renal function. She was started on therapeutic
dosing of heparin and bridged to coumdin. Her INR was
therapeutic on [**Month/Year (2) **], but her daily coumdain dose was not
stable and will need to be monitored closely at rehab.
.
Renal: Mrs [**Known lastname 107389**] presented in acute renal failure, which
worsened somewhat during her hospital course, despite adequate
hydration and consistently good urine output. Renal was
consulted and felt was ATN and recommended renal ultrasound and
monitoring urine output. The renal ultrasound showed no
obstruction or hydronephrosis. Her creatinine and urine output
should be followed at rehab.
.
Cardiac/Respiratory: Pt had episode of respiratory
distress/hypoxia as described above, that appeared to be a
combination of anxiety and new CHF with reduced EF on ECHO. EK
