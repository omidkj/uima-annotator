Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 139**] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male who
was admitted on [**2160-7-3**], to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for hypotension.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was sent to the Emergency Department after he
was found by his primary medical doctor to be hypotensive to
70/30.  For several days prior to this admission the patient
reports increased weakness and lightheadedness, particularly
upon standing.  He also complains of weight loss of
approximately 10 pounds.

This patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2160-6-15**] to [**2160-6-22**].
During this admission he was found to be in atrial
fibrillation, and in the setting of anticoagulation for this
condition developed a gastrointestinal bleed.  Endoscopy
revealed peptic ulcer disease (duodenal ulcers), and the
patient was also found to be H. pylori positive.  After being
hemodynamically stabilized the patient was discharged on
amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor for
treatment of his H. pylori infection.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was found to
have a central venous pressure of 1.5.  He was placed on
dopamine which was quickly weaned off.  The patient responded
well to aggressive hydration.  An echocardiogram was done
which showed an [**Year (4 digits) **] fraction of greater than 55%, mild
aortic insufficiency, moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.  Cardiac
enzymes were cycled, and the patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  His heart rate in the setting of
atrial fibrillation was controlled with Lopressor.  The
patient also developed low-grade fevers during his Medical
Intensive Care Unit stay of 100 to 100.7.  Blood and urine
cultures were all negative.  Chest x-ray was normal.  No
source of infection was found during the [**Hospital 228**] Medical
Intensive Care Unit stay.

At the time of transfer to the Medical floor on [**2160-7-5**], the patient felt well.  His only complaint was the
development of a cough.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission were
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diovan, insulin, Lipitor,
allopurinol, Zantac, Cardura, Lopressor, multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE causes gastrointestinal upset.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature was 97.9,
heart rate was 110 and irregular, blood pressure was 105/65,
oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  In general, the
patient was comfortable, alert and oriented.  HEENT revealed
anicteric sclerae.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
appeared dry.  Neck examination revealed the patient had a
large V-wave in the jugular venous pulse.  Neck was supple.
Cardiovascular examination was irregular, a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border.  No gallops.
Pulmonary examination showed increased expiratory phase and
crackles at the right base.  Abdominal examination revealed
soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  No
masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal examination was
heme-positive in the Emergency Department.  Extremities
revealed no edema.  Right leg had diffuse purple bruising
which the patient reported to be one week old.  The patient
stated that he had seen an orthopaedic surgeon for this and
was told that he had a torn hamstring.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6.3,
hematocrit of 34.3, platelets of 121.  Differential was
63 neutrophils, 2 bands, 2 nucleated red blood cells,
1 atypical cell, 1 meta cell, and 25 lymphocytes.  Chem-7

revealed sodium of 135, potassium 4.5, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 45, creatinine 1.9, and glucose of 60.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray was unremarkable.

Electrocardiogram showed no changes from previous study on
[**2160-6-20**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   (Since transfer to the medical floor).  On
transfer to the medical floor a workup for a source of the
patient's fevers was continued.  Because of the patient's
complaint of cough, a chest x-ray was performed which showed
right middle lobe infiltrated.

On [**2160-7-6**], the patient was started on Levaquin to
treat empirically for pneumonia.  On [**7-7**], 1/2 bottles
of the patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci.
However, since central line had been removed it was
determined not to treat this, but to re-culture.  All further
blood cultures were negative.

On [**7-8**], a CT of the abdomen was performed to evaluate
for abdominal sources of infection which was unremarkable.  A
repeat chest x-ray showed right middle lobe and retrocardiac
opacities.  The patient continued to spike fevers and had
intermittent episodes of hypotension to approximately 80/50.
These episodes responded well to small fluid boluses.

At this time the Infectious Disease Service was consulted.
Many cultures and serologies suggested by Infectious Disease
were performed.  None yielded a source of infection for this
patient.  Levofloxacin was discontinued on [**7-12**] due to
concern that the patient was still spiking fevers after seven
days of treatment.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were
done while the patient was off antibiotics which also did not
yield an organism.

On approximately [**2160-7-14**], the patient's fever spikes
subsided into a consistent low-grade temperature.  Although
there had been a mild improvement in clinical status, the
patient did not appear to be continuing to improve.
Therefore, on [**7-16**] a bronchoscopy was performed with
bronchoalveolar lavage.  The lavage showed gram-positive
cocci on the Gram stain but no growth occurred on culture.
Multiple studies for viral and other pathogens were also
negative.  The patient was subsequently placed back on
levofloxacin for an expected 3-week course.  The patient
showed slow but consistent improvement over the next few
days.

On [**2160-7-18**], the patient was noted to have left lower
extremity swelling, and Doppler studies were positive for
deep venous thrombosis of the popliteal to common femoral
veins. The patient was started on Lovenox.  By the time of
discharge, the patient's cough had markedly subsided.  He had
been afebrile for several days, and he had good oxygen
saturations off of oxygen both at rest and with ambulation.
