TTE [**2150-03-25**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Probable diastolic dysfunction. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 86207**] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2150-3-23**] for
removal of hardware in right femur due to a prominent screw from
the locking plate that has backed out from possible nonunion of
her supracondylar femur fracture left. She underwent surgery
without complication on [**2150-3-24**].
She was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the
recovery room in stable condition and later transferred to the
floor. On the floor she did initially fine but suddenly felt
"unwell"  while sitting upright eating dinner. She may have felt
some dizziness, but denied chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, nausea, and palpitations. She was slumped
forward in her chair, but did not fall out. She was transferred
to the bed and a code blue was called. There was some concern
that she was initially apneic, but she was breathing regularly
by the time the code team arrived. ABG showed  7.43/44/101/30
with a lactate of 1.8. Telemetry revealed a narrow complex
rhythm that was regular, and she maintained a pulse throughout
the Code. FS was 161 and BP was 109/67. She received
approximately 500 cc of NS and was transferred to the MICU. She
did loose her urine, but denied loss of bowel continence,
post-ictal confusion, chest pain, and palpitations when she woke
up. No tremors or jerks were noted by the Code team. Of note,
patient did once syncopize 5 years ago while walking. It has not
happened since then.
Her metabolic workup was unremarkable. No events on tele
overnight in the ICU. Enzymes were flat, ABG and EKG normal.
Finger stick was normal. Although patient had some bladder
incontinence, seizure seems less likely as patient was not
post-icital and normal CT head. No murmurs on exam. CXR
unremarkable. Given prodrome and the fact that patient has had
syncope before, and that this event occurred while eating,
patient may have had vasovagal event. A TTE was performed which
demonstrated normal global systolic function. She was
transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**2150-3-25**] in stable
condition.
Her right knee has been tapped on [**2150-3-25**] to rule out a
persisting infection prior to a potential knee revision. Results
are currently pending.
She had adequate pain management and worked with physical
therapy while in
the hospital.  The remainder of her hospital course was
uneventful and
Ms. [**Known lastname 86207**] is being discharged on [**2150-3-26**].
