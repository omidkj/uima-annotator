History of Present Illness:
45 y/o male with ESLD from HCV, HBC, and EtOH who had a TIPS
done on [**2119-1-5**] who presented to the OSH yesterday with altered
mental status. The patient was treated with lactulose at the OSH
with some improvement in his encelpalopathy. There was concern

reports abdominal pain slightly worse than his baseline. No
melena or BRBPR.
.

Social History:

disease

Physical Exam:
VS: 97.5 95/69 90 12 93%RA
Gen: awake, oriented x 2 (able to state month and year, stated
he was at B+W's)
HEENT: NC/AT. PERRL, EOMI, MMM. OP clear.
Neck: Supple, no LAD.
CV: RRR, S1, S2 no m/r/g.
Chest: CTAB no wheezes or crackles.
ABD: Distended, + tense ascites, TTP diffusely
Ext: WWP, no edema. + asterixis

Pertinent Results:
Upon admission, a CT of the abd/pelvis was done [**2-1**]
demonstrating:
1. Large amount of ascites. Tiny amount of high-density fluid
layers in the deep pelvis consistent with blood not changed from
prior study at 2:13 a.m. today, [**2119-2-1**]. No subcapsular hepatic
hematoma.
2. Small subcentimeter focus of arterial enhancement of hepatic
segment VIII becomes isodense to liver parenchyma on the delayed
phase. This is more conspicuous compared to [**2118-12-27**] and [**2118-11-9**].
Finding is non- specific but given cirrhosis a small focus of
hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded. Continued imaging
surveillance is recommended.
3. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly indicating portal hypertension.
4. Patent TIPS.

On [**2-25**] a  ruq u/s was performed showing  a patent TIPS with
increased velocities, little changed.
Head CT was  negative and EEG was abnormal with findings
consistent with moderate encephalopathy . There were no
epileptiform features and no seizure activity.
.
[**2-27**] ct chest:
1. Abnormality in the right upper lobe demonstrates marked
panlobular
emphysematous changes. No evidence of pneumothorax.

2. Atelectasis within the right upper and bilateral lower lobes.
No evidence
of airspace consolidation.

3. Limited images through the upper abdomen show a large volume
ascites,
TIPS, and splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
 Patient initially transfered from OSH with encephalopathy and
concern for clotted TIPS.  TIPS initially placed [**2119-1-5**].
Ultrasound showed patent TIPS and his mental status improved
with lactulose and regular bowel movements.  The patient was
tapped for a large amount of ascites and it was negative for
SBP.
He continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] encephalopathy,  He
required admission to the MICU twice for unresponsiveness, both
times which he was intubated for airway protection, and given
additional lactulose. His head CT on first MICU admission was
negative for any acute process such as intracranial bleed. EEG
findings were consistent with encephalopathy without seizure
activity.

An attempted Re-Do TIPS to divert blood through portal veins and
not the TIPS was attempted, but technically unsuccessful and
complicated by small hemoperitoneum that required transfusion
but otherwise self-limited. He finally had successful TIPS
revision on [**2119-2-6**].

He continued to receive therapeutic paracentesis. Ultrasound
initially showed patent TIPS but subsequent ones showed
increased velocities concerning for stenosis.  He was restarted
on diuretics because his sodium was improved from prior
admissions, but these were held for worsening renal function.
He was continued on 1500ml fluid restriction and Cipro for SBP
prophylaxis. CVVHD was started.

A CXR showed new right sided infiltrate and the patient had
moderate growth of MRSA from his sputum with sparse growth of 2
colonies of GNR. He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

On [**3-14**] he underwent Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant
(piggyback), portal vein-portal vein anastomosis, common bile
duct-common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube, branch patch
(recipient) to celiac patch (donor)hepatic artery anastomosis.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please see operative report
for further details.  EBL was 2 liters replaced with PRBC, plt,
FFP, cryo and cellsaver. Two JPs were placed. He was maintained
on CVVHD during the case. He received HBIG intraop and on pod
[**12-31**]. HBsAb titers were greater than 450. HBIG IM was given on
pod 7 and 14. Entecavir was started immediately postop. This
dose was renally dosed.

Postop, he was transferred to the SICU per protocol. He was
extubated on POD 2. CVVHD continue for ~ 2 days then lasix was
started. He received prbc/plt/ffp on pod 0. Labs were monitored
q 6 hours.  US of the liver demonstrated difficulty detecting
the expected hepatic arterial supply to the left lobe. Otherwise
U/S was normal. LFTs trended down. The medial JP was removed on
pod 5. The lateral JP continued to drain large amounts of
ascites. Outputs were as high as 4.5liters per day. He received
IV fluid replacements and albumin for JP outputs. Of note,
creatinine started trending up off CVVHD as high as 4.3 from
2.7. Urine output averaged 1000-1200cc/day. Nephrology was
consulted. It was felt that he had ATN on resolving hepatorenal
syndrome. Fluconazole dose was renally dosed to 200mg qd as this
was felt to increase the prograf level. Creatinine slowly
trended down to 2.9. Hyperkalemia was a persistent problem that
required treatment with insulin, dextrose, lasix and kayexalate.
Hyperkalemia improved with improved renal function. A low
potassium diet was ordered.

The lateral JP was removed on [**3-29**] for outputs of 600cc. The
transplant incision remained clean, dry and intact. His abdomen
appeared a little distended

PT evaluated him and initially recommended rehab, but he
improved significant and it was felt that he would be safe for
discharge to home. He was also started on insulin for
hyperglycemia. Glargine and humalog sliding scale were given.

Immunosuppression consisted of cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], steroids
were tapered to prednisone 20mg qd per protocol, and prograf was
started on pod 1. Prograf was decreased to 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] per trough
levels of [**8-8**].2.

VNA services were arranged for home.
