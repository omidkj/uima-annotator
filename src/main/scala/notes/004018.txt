[**2133-2-9**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant
circulation
demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
mild
luminal irregularities. The proximal LAD had a 30% stenosis. The

proximal LAD stents were totally occluded with some retrograde
filling
of the distal and mid LAD by left to left collaterals. The LCx
was a
large dominant vessel and had mild luminal irregularities. The
OM1 was a
moderate size vessel with moderate diffuse disease. The OM2 was
also a
moderate size vessel without significant obstructive disease.
The L-PDA
was without any significant flow limiting disease. The RCA was
not
engage because it was known to be a diminuitive vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated moderate elevation of right and left heart filling
pressures (RVEDP 20mmHg, LVEDP 23mmHg). There was moderate
pulmonary
arterial hypertension. There was no mitral stenosis appreciated.
There
was no transaortic pressure gradient upon catheter pullback from
the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta. The calculated cardiac
output by
the Fick method was 5.3 L/min with a cardiac index of 2.7.
3. Intravascular ultrasound interrogation of the proximal LAD
verified
that the occlusion was secondary to thrombus formation and that
the
previously deployed stents were well opposed.
4.  Successful catheter thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty
using a
3.25 mm balloon in the proximal LAD late stent thrombosis. Final

angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).

[**2133-2-11**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mid anterior,
anterior septum and septum ( moderately hypokinetic). The
inferior wall is mildly hypokinetic.The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass the LV function was unchanged and RV function is
preserved. Aorta was in tact post decannulation.

[**2133-2-9**] CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2133-2-9**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads. Extensive anteroseptal and lateral
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2132-9-5**] multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist
without major change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27427**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-2-9**] for further
work-up of his chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which was significant for severe single vessel
coronary artery disease. Given the severity of his disease, the
cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical management.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27427**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.
Heparin was continued for anticoagualtion. Given his new history
of a right upper lobe nodule, the thoracic surgery service was
consulted for assistance in his care. A mediastinal lymph node
biopsy was recommended during his bypass surgery. On [**2133-2-10**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 27427**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels.
Afterward he was transferred to the Cardiac surgery recovery
unit in stable condition and awakened neurologically intake.
He was weaned from ventilator support, extubated, and pressors
were weaned.  On POD 2 he was then transferred to the Stepdown
unit for further recovery.  His chest tubes were removed without
complication.  He was gently diuresed to his preoperative
weight, beta blockade and aspirin therapy were resumed, and
physical therapy service was consulted to assist with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Electrolytes were repleted
as needed. On POD 3 he his epicardial pacing wires were removed
without complication, he continued to improve his ability to
ambulate including climbing stairs without respiratory distress
or chest pain.  A chest xray demonstrated a left lower lobe
consolidation for which he was placed on empiric levaquin.  On
POD 4 Mr. [**Known lastname 27427**] was at his preop weight with good exercise
tolerance, no SOB, or chest pain.  His blood pressure was
stable.  His sternotomy and leg incision were clean, dry, and
intact without evidence of infection.  He was discharged home on
POD 4 with services in good condition, levaquind 500mg po qd for
five days, cardiac diet, sternal precautions, and instructed to
follow up with his PCP and cardiologist i
