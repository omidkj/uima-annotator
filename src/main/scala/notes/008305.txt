History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with hx recent PE/DVT, atrial

for ERCP. She has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital3 26615**] this
past month, most recently on [**2149-11-20**]. In early [**Month (only) 1096**], she
presented with back pain and shortness of breath. She was found
to have bilateral PE's and new afib and started on coumadin. Her
HCT dropped slightly, requiring blood transfusion, with guaic
positive stools. She was discharged and returned with abdominal
cramping and black stools. She was found to have a HCT drop from
32 to 21. She was given vit K, given a blood transfusion and
started on protonix. She received an IVF filter and EGD.  EGD
showed a small gastric and duodenal ulcer (healing), esophageal
stricture, no active bleeding.  She also had an abdominal CT
demonstrating a distended gallbladder with gallstones and
biliary obstruction with several CBD stones. She was started on
Levo/Flagyl and transfered here for ERCP. Per nursing, her BP
had been low in 90's at OSH and 80's enroute.

In the ERCP suite, she received vancomycin, Ampicillin and
Gentamicin as well as Fentanyl. A biliary stent was placed
successfully in the upper third of the common bile duct. No
sphincterotomy was done given elevated INR. In addition, a
single cratered non-bleeding 20mm ulcer was found in the antrum.

KUB: Supine film shows gas-filled loops of large and small bowel
with gas in the region of the rectum. The appearances are
inconsistent with obstruction and do not suggest ileus

CXR: no failure

RUQ ultrasound: report pending at time of death

Brief Hospital Course:
Septic from the time of transfer from the OSH for ERCP. Required
blood pressure support with levophed, which was changed to
neosynephrine due to elevated HR.  Difficult to volume
resuscitate given developement of crackles/increasing O2
requirement with fluid.  Treated with vanc/cipro/flagyl and
changed to meropenem/vanc. Had stent done by ERCP, but
sphincterotomy/stone removal not done due to elevated INR.  Most
likely source of sepsis is biliary/ascending cholangitis.
Evaluated by General surgery team, who thought she was not a
surgical candidate and would not recommend IR cholecystostomy
tube. Lactate rose to 10.5, last ABG 7.2/13/101.  The patient
complained of significant pain, difficult to control with bolus
morphine.  Bedside ultrasound was being done to evaluate for
cholecystitis when the family decided to make the patient CMO
and the study was stopped. Preliminary report not available at
the time of death.  The patient was made CMO by her family and
expired comfortably on a morphine gtt at 16:20 on [**2149-11-27**].
Medical examiner declined the case, family declined autopsy.
