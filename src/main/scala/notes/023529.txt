BX-NEEDLE LIVER BY RADIOLOGIST; GUIDANCE/LOCALIZATION FOR NEED
Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 64219**]
Reason: please biopsy liver lesion for diagnosis



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   71F colon ca s/p resection, now RUQ tenderness, new liver
lesions ?mets.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   please biopsy liver lesion for diagnosis



Final Report
HISTORY: Colon cancer, now with suspicious hepatic masses on
MRI, for biopsy.

TECHNIQUE: Written and oral consent was obtained prior to the
procedure.
Timeout was checked x2. Preliminary son[**Name (NI) 493**] interrogation
demonstrates
visualization of a somewhat subtle, heterogeneous lesion at the
inferior right
hepatic lobe which corresponds to the MRI findings.

The overlying skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion. Local
anesthesia was achieved with a buffered 1% lidocaine solution.
Pain relief
was achieved with 50 mg of Demerol. Under son[**Name (NI) 493**] guidance,
an 18-gauge
Bard biopsy system was advanced to the lesion within the
inferior right
hepatic lobe, and a single core sample was obtained. Pathology
was present,
and the sample demonstrated clusters of atypical cells.
Following the first
biopsy, there was decreased visualization of the lesion, and
therefore a
second biopsy was not performed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate
complications. The patient was returned to her inpatient bed in
good
condition.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was present for the entire procedure.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided biopsy of an inferior
right lobe
hepatic mass previously seen on MRI.

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, core needle biopsy:

1.  Minute distorted focus of poorly differentiated carcinoma
(see RC L1).  The histology is consistent with that of the
patient's previously resected colon tumor (S08-[**Numeric Identifier **]).

2.  Focal mild portal and lobular mixed inflammation.

3.  Focal bile ductule proliferation associated with
neutrophils.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to surgery with RUQ pain and leukocytosis.She was
placed on IV antibiotics, made NPO and IVF.  Anticoagulation was
reversed with vitamin K. CT and MRI done to evaluate hepatic
lesions, which were determined to be metastatic in appearance.
The night of HD2, the pt trigger twice for hypotension.  She
responded initally to fluid boluses, but then required transfer
to the SICU for monitoring on HD3.

In the SICU, pt pressures were monitored through her a-line, and
a central line was avoided, because she was on aspirin and
plavix.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics after an
ID consult.  In the SICU, MAPs remained in 60s without further
boluses.

On HD5, liver biopsy was done to confirm diagnosis of metastatic
colon cancer.  Pt was transferred to the floor and seen by
physical therapy.  Post procedure, she tolerated regular food
with minimal RUQ pain.

Antibiotics were discontinued after 2 sets of blood cultures and
C.diff toxin study was negative and WBCs continued to trend down
on discharge. Pt remained afebrile.

She was discharged on HD8 to rehab, after arranging an
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in oncology.
