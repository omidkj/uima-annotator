History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 26 year old woman with a history of seizures
since age 21 following head trauma in a motor vehicle accident
now presenting with a seizure earlier today.  The patient is
unable to give a coherent and reliable history so most details
are taken from her home care taker [**Female First Name (un) **], who I spoke to on the
phone.  She tells me that the patient was sleeping on the sofa
as
she walked by the room.  She woke her up and asked her if
everything was okay.  She told her "my mouth hurts".  The
patient
then tried to get off the sofa, fell to her knees and began an
episode of whole body shaking that lasted about a minute or so.
During the seizure, dropped her torso to the floor and hit her
face on the ground.  Her face was bleeding.  After the seizure
she was confused and somewhat lethargic.  [**Female First Name (un) **] then activated
EMS and the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

She was last seen in our ED 3 days ago with nausea and vomiting.
She was unable to take PO medications because of these symptoms
including her AEDs.  She was sent home after receiving IV
fluids.
She had recently had teeth extracted and had a good deal of pain
in the mouth that also inhibited her from eating/swallowing.
She had been treated with an unknown anti-biotic for the
presumed dental infection.

Her last EEG in [**4-9**] showed generalized spike and slow wave
discharges in the 3 hz range.  Her head MRI in [**3-12**] showed mild
cerebellar atrophy.
