Earlier in the day on the 17th, she developed back pain that
radiated down her right arm.  She called her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] sent her to the Emergency Room.  The pain was
relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  Today she was also
found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.  She was transferred in
for cardiac catheterization.

LABORATORIES:  White count 13.1, hematocrit 31.6, platelet
count 371,000.  Blood gas was as follows:  7.23/45/87/20/-8
base access.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY WORK:  BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, sodium
137, K 4.6, chloride 108, bicarb 17, anion gap 17, glucose at
210, also repeated in that evening at 9 p.m. was also 409.
CK at 9 in the evening was 135.  ALT 26, AST 34, alkaline
phosphatase 42, amylase 29, total bilirubin 0.3.  CK MB
fraction was 15 with an index of 11.1%.  Her magnesium also
that evening was 2.0.

Preoperative chest x-ray for checking her Swan placement
showed the femoral access Swan-Ganz catheter in normal
position, intra-aortic balloon pump was in position.  There
was no cardiomegaly.  Lungs were clear.  There were no
pleural effusions or pneumothoraces and no evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary disease.

Preoperative EKG showed sinus rhythm at 81 with a right
bundle branch block and no significant change from her prior
EKGs at admission.

Preoperative laboratory work was as follows:  White count
13.1, hematocrit 31.6.  PT 12.5, PTT 31.5, platelet count
371,000.  INR 1.0.

In the Cath Laboratory, results showed significant coronary
disease with a 90% mid LAD lesion and 90% proximal circumflex
lesion.  Her systolic blood pressure is approximately 170.
Nipride was started for afterload reduction and Cardiology
inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump.  Carotid duplex was
requested and patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 18078**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14968**] with
Cardiothoracic Surgery at that time for evaluation of
imminent coronary artery bypass grafting.  In addition, there
was a 99% lesion of the LAD at the takeoff of a major
diagonal.  The RCA had a patent stent with 40% distal lesion.


Patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] of Cardiothoracic
Surgery service.  Patient was followed by her attending
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Additional preoperative
laboratory work showed a sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride
108, bicarb 17, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8.  Patient received
some stress dosed steroids and remained on Lasix as well as
IV nitroglycerin with a wedge goal of 14-18.  Nipride was
stopped and kept in reserve if needed.  Patient was given
BiPAP as needed, and was admitted to the CCU from the
Catheterization Laboratory.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Were listed by the patient as the
following:
1. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Nifedipine XL 90 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Zantac unknown dose.
5. Folate unknown dose.
6. Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Neoral 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o. q.d.
10. Accupril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Isordil 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Were previously noted as penicillin and question
of Lasix.

Patient was followed by the CCU team and remained
hemodynamically stable through the 18th.  She was on an
Integrilin drip as well as Heparin drip.  Her metoprolol was
increased to 50 b.i.d.  She was started on captopril 12.5
t.i.d. and also remained on nitroglycerin drip.  She was also
receiving her renal dosing of cyclosporin for post
transplant.

The single episode of flash pulmonary edema was successfully
treated in the Catheterization Laboratory.  Her diabetic
ketoacidosis resolved.  Her CHF was all managed by the CCU
team.  She was seen by Social Work.  The preliminary
noninvasive carotid studies showed an occluded left ICA and a
right ICA narrowing of less than 40%.  Patient was seen by
Vascular Surgery to evaluate the role of whether or not the
patient would need a left carotid endarterectomy prior to
CABG.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48367**] of Vascular Surgery determined there is
no role for vascular surgery at this particular time.

On [**11-29**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting x2 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] with a LIMA to the LAD and a
vein graft to the OM.  The patient still had her preoperative
intra-aortic balloon pump in place.  She was transferred to
Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition A-paced on a
Neo-Synephrine drip on 1 mcg/kg/minute, insulin at 6
units/hour, and a propofol titrated to 10 mcg/kg/minute.

On postoperative day one, she remained on CPAP with pressure
support in the low 90s in sinus rhythm with a pressure of
144/70.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.  She had
scattered rhonchi throughout her lungs.  Her extremities were
warm with 1+ edema.  Sedation was minimized with a plan to
wean extubate her and D/C her chest tubes.  Captopril was
started 6.25 t.i.d.  Lasix diuresis was begun.  She remained
NPO at that time given her intubation, and she received 1 amp
of bicarb to balance her.  Her white count was 18.1 with a
hematocrit of 31.6, platelet count of 110,000
postoperatively.  PT was 13.0 with an INR of 1.1.  Her K was
4.7 with a BUN of 25 and a creatinine of 0.9.

Her intra-aortic balloon pump remained in place.  Her
nitroglycerin was being titrated to help maintain a good
blood pressure.  She was seen by the Cardiology fellow for
pulling her balloon pump on the 20th, which was done without
any complications.

On postoperative day two, she was extubated.  Her balloon
pump was out.  Her Neo-Synephrine was off as well as her
nitroglycerin IV drip.  She remained on captopril and Lasix.
Plavix was restarted.  She was in sinus rhythm in the 80s
with a pressure of 114/52.  She was saturating 100% on 3
liters nasal cannula and was making good progress.  Her white
count rose slightly to 18.  Hematocrit remained stable at
26.4, but her platelets dropped again to 76,000.  Patient's
prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.d. was restarted.

On postoperative day three, she remained in sinus rhythm in
the 60s as her beta blockade began.  Her incisions were
clean, dry, and intact.  Her captopril was stopped.  She was
maintained with good blood pressure.  She continued to
receive Lasix, and her CellCept was restarted as well as the
cyclosporin A.  She was seen by the Renal fellow.  Her
creatinine rose slightly to 1.2.  She remained on her
immunosuppressive drugs.  They recommended gentle diuresis.
She was also seen by the clinical nutrition team for
screening followed by the social worker as well as the case
manager.

On postoperative day four, heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  Her thyroid medicine had
also been restarted the day prior.  Cyclosporin level was
sent off.  Her creatinine rose slightly to 1.4 with a K of
4.2.  Her hematocrit remained at 25.6.  White count was at
13.2.  Recommendations were made and evaluated daily by the
CT Surgery team.  She was also seen by the physical therapist
and the patient's blood sugar did drop during the day to 56.
It was up to 434 in the afternoon.  Patient was treated and
decision was ma
