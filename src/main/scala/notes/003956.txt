Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7202**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 year old man with multiple medical problesm
including coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of
20-30%, status post pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, chronic lower back pain who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital to the vascular service
with concern for aortic dissection.
.
The patient reports that he began to develop diarrhea several
weeks prior to admission. This diarrhea is only during the day,
not related to eating. Per the nurse, the patient's stool is
liquid, brown, no bright red blood per rectum. The patient also
developed nausea and epigastric pain one week prior to
admission. The epigastric pain is sharp, constant, unrelated to
eating and without exacerbating or alleviating factors. The
patient denies emesis, recent travel, or recent antibiotic use.
.
The pt presented to [**Location (un) **] emergency department on [**2184-2-15**] for
these symptoms, and was noted to have an abdominal aorta
aneurysm at the level of the renal artery as well as a short
aortic dissection on CT. Repeat CT here revealed a 2 cm aortic
dissection at level of renal arteries, with possible chronicity.
The patient is transferred to medicine for blood pressure
management given patient's systolic blood pressure was up to 198
on day of admission.
.
On review of systems, patient denies fever, decreased appetite.
He complains of worsened sciatica down his right leg.

Pertinent Results:
[**2178**] cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominants system revealed
severe left main and three vessel CAD. The left main coronary
artery was diffusely diseased with a 70% distal stenosis. The
LAD was totally occluded proximally. The left circumflex artery
had a 70% mid-vessel stenosis and the first obtuse marginal
branch was totally occluded. The RCA was occluded immediately
distal to its origin.
2. Graft angiography revealed patent SVGs. The SVG to the LAD
was widely patent. The skip SVG to the first and second diagonal
branchs had moderate luminal irregularities throughout its
course. The SVG to the obtuse marginal branch was patent. The
SVG to the rPDA was patent and the native posterolateral branch
beyond the anastamosis was diffusely diseased.
3. Resting hemodynamic studies revealed normal right and left
sided
filling pressure. The mean RA pressure was 3 mmHg, teh mean PCWP
was 5 mmHg, and the LVEDP was 6 mmHg. The cardiac index was
marginally
depressed at 2.4 L/min/m2.
4. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with more
severe apical hypokinesis and inferior wall akinesis. The
estimated LVEF was 30-35%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe left main and native three vessel coronary artery
disease.
2. Patent SVGs to the LAD, skip diagonals, obtuse marginal and
rPDA.
3. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.

Studies:
.
CXR [**2184-2-20**]:
1. Cardiac pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and the
right ventricle.
2. Elevated left hemidiaphragm.
.
CT abdomen [**2-21**]: 1.  No evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.
2. Emphysema. 3.  A 13 mm vague nodular density in the right
middle lobe, which should be evaluated further within three
months (as well as a 7 mm nodular density at the left base as
well, which can be re-evaluated at he same time). 4.  Severe
stenosis at the origin of the left renal artery with relative
atrophy of the left kidney compared to the right. 5.  Short 2cm
dissection of the aorta at the level of the renal arteries.
Although of uncertain chronicity, the appearance may be chronic.
6. Small abdominal aortic aneurysm. 7.  Right common iliac
aneurysm. 8. Compression fracture of T12, probably chronic.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2184-2-28**]: The portable erect AP radiograph
of the chest is reviewed, and compared with the previous study
of yesterday.
.
The patient has prior CABG and median sternotomy. Pacemaker
leads remain in place. There is increase in mild congestive
heart failure with cardiomegaly with small right pleural
effusion. There is increase in bibasilar patchy atelectasis.
.
Again, note is made of marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
with calcification. No pneumothorax is identified.
[**2184-3-4**] Echo:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but is moderately
depressed. Overall
left ventricular EF cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

INDICATION: 87-year-old male with throat pain, equivocal bedside
evaluation.

Video oropharyngeal swallow.

FINDINGS: Note is made of moderate amount of pharyngeal residue
after multiple swallowing attempts. Note is made of penetration
at thin barium swallow, more with straw than cup sip. No
evidence of aspiration is seen.

Please also refer to the official report by speech and lung
pathologist available on CareWeb.
