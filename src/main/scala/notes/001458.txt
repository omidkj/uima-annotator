History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old male with severe COPD and extensive cardiac
history in [**2171-10-5**]. Since surgery in [**2171-10-5**], patient
has always complained of a sternal click and incisional
discomfort. This finding was confirmed at his postoperative
visit in [**2171-12-5**]. At that time, his incisional discomfort
was described as mild and did not affect his routine ADL's.
However over the last several weeks following another bout of
pneumonia with significant coughing
episodes, his sternal click and incisional discomfort have
significantly worsened. Currently, he rates his pain 10 out of
10 and is no longer able to function. He denies fevers,
chills,palpitations, orthopnea, PND, syncope and pedal edema.
He has just completed a course of Prednisone and Levofloxacin
for
presumed pneumonia. The  ACE inhibitor was also recently stopped
due
to persistent dry cough. He presents for surgical repair.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who 1-1/2 months ago underwent
a third time re-do mitral valve operation.  He did well for
about 30 days following which he
got an upper respiratory infection resulting in severe coughing
and a sterile dehiscence of the sternum. A CT scan was obtained
which showed left upper lobe lung lesions which could be
inflammatory or early malignancy. Thoracic surgery was consulted
who recommended a repeat CT in 3 months.

He had sternal plating performed at which time the adhered lung
to the undersurface of the sternum had a couple of tears with
resulting pneumothorax.  The air leak subsequently infected the
sterile sternum and the plates and resulted in a secondary
infection requiring removal of the plates and packing of the
wound for awhile.  He after that underwent pectoral flap
advancements by Plastic Surgery filling in the gap between the
sternum and closure over chest tube and drains.  He was
susequently extubated on [**3-6**] and had some coughing episodes and
then sudden increased drainage in his chest tube and development
of hematoma under his pectoral flap and massive hemoptysis.  He
returned to the Operating Room emergently for mediastinal
exploration, evacuation of the hematoma and control of pulmonary
bleeding.

He subsequently was extubated again and progressed slowly.
Vancomycin was dosed by level and the Infectious Disease service
followed him closely. He had some dysphagia and a Dobhoff tube
was placed for tube feedings.  He slowly progressed and the diet
advanced to the present solids and thin liquids as tube feeds
were weaned and dicontinued.

He had a fair amount of confusion after the last operation, but
was clearing. His short term memory remained marginal at times.
He twice had a significant leukocytosis, without an obvious
source and then this resolved Vancomycin will continue for 8
weeks total (through [**4-27**]) and ID followup is arranged.  The
sternal wound is clean and healing and the two JP drains remain
in situ, being managed by the Plastic Surgical service.

He was ready for rehab on [**3-28**] and was sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] .
All follow up appointments were made.
