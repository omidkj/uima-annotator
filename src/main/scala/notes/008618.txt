History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis,
diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell
lymphoma, diagnosed after recent onset of abdominal pain. She
initially presented to NEBH ambulatory care [**2114-12-5**] for mild
abdominal pain, where, abdominal exam reportedly was notable for
a palpable mass. Labs that day were notable for hematocrit 30.5
(baseline 37-39) calcium of 13.1 (albumin 3.5), creatinine 1.8
(baseline 1.2-1.5), and BNP 333.
.
She underwent abdominal/pelvis CT scan, which revealed a large
soft tissue density surrounding the cecum and ascending colon
with significant stranding, initially believed to be a phlegmon
possibly [**1-23**] appendicitis or appendiceal rupture. There was
moderate concentric narrowing but no obstruction. CT also showed
a smaller, similar phlegmon anterior to the transverse colon. CT
Chest was negative for malignancy. She was admitted for surgical
evaluation and biopsy, and triaged to the ICU for intensive
fluid management in the setting of her severe diastolic CHF.
.
She underwent abdominal open surgery on [**12-10**], with biopsy of
her mass in multiple abdominal locations - diagnosis felt to be
large B cell lymphoma. As above, CT chest was negative for
malignant involvement. She did not undergo any other staging
studies. Patient was transferred for possible chemotherapy. Per
signout reported patient got prednisone 80 mg x 2 days [**12-17**],
[**12-18**] - but this is not listed in the discharge summary.
.
In regards to her hypercalcemia, she was treated with normal
saline and furosemide, with normalization of her serum calcium
levels. On day of transfer, her calcium was 9.8 with albumin of
2.2, suggesting mild hypercalcemia. She underwent TTE on [**12-13**]
that was reportedly not consistent with dCHF.
.
NEBH d/c summary reports today's exam notable for no fevers,
mild hypotension with systolic BPs in the 90s, regular heart
rhythm with rate in the 80s, and normal oxygen saturation. She
was reported as having a distended, slightly tender abdomen.
Labs today were notable for stable CBC, INR 1.3, creatinine 1.5,
and LDH 648. D/c summary also indicated that today's CXR was
unchanged, showing poor inspiratory effort, prominent hila,
basilar atelectasis bilaterally but no significant change from
prior chest x-rays. Discharge summary also reports a
supraventricular tachycardia 5 days ago treated with po
lopressor and diltiazem.
.
At time of [**Hospital1 18**] admission patient's on compliant is dysuria and
vaginal pain. Otherwise denies shortness of breath, chest pain
or abdoiminal pain.

Past Medical History:
Past medical history:
-Autoimmune hepatitis confirmed by biopsy in [**2099**] which was
treated with Azathioprine and prednisone. Recent hepatology note
indicates desire to transition from prednisone to budesonide.
Primary hepatologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
-Hypertension treated with metoprolol and Lasix
-osteoarthritis
-sleep apnea
-diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent, treated with Novolin and
regular insulin
-COPD
-possible pulmonary hypertension (This was not borne out by a
recent echocardiogram which although technically difficult, did
not show evidence, doppler or otherwise of diastolic
dysfunction)
-hiatal hernia treated with Nexium
-multiple allergies with intermittent use of Zyrtec
-hyperuricemia treated with urolic
-possible history of CHF, which has been treated with Lasix
-headaches treated with Fioricet.
.
Past Surgical History:
-oophorectomy and appendectomy in [**2063**]
-hysterectomy [**2085**]
-cholecystectomy [**2099**]
-bowel resection in [**2099**] as well

Imaging/pathology:
Bone Marrow Immunotyping ([**2115-12-18**]):
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. CD45 bright, low side scatter
lymphoid events are less than 2% of total analyzed events.

B cells comprise 5% of lymphoid-gated events, and do not express
aberrant antigens. Clonality is difficult to assess due to scant
numbers, but appears polyclonal. T cells comprise 68% of
lymphoid gated events, and express mature lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma
are not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings
and morphology (see S10-[**Numeric Identifier 39761**]) is recommended.  Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

Chromosome analysis bone marrow ([**2115-12-18**]):
KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[20]
INTERPRETATION:

No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified
in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated
specimen. This normal result does not exclude a
neoplastic proliferation.

Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be
detectable using the standard methods employed.

Note: FISH studies were not performed because assessment of
the specimen by Pathology showed no evidence of lymphoma.

Tissue Bone Marrow ([**2115-12-18**]):
Clinical: Lymphoma, NHL.  Newly diagnosed DLBCL.

Pathology Slides ([**2115-12-20**]):
DIAGNOSIS: HIGH-GRADE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL
TYPE, SEE NOTE.

ECHO ([**2115-12-19**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not prese
