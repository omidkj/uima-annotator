CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2165-6-14**]
IMPRESSION:
Worsening multifocal pneumonia. Poorly defined lucency in the
retrocardiac region. Further evaluation with a lateral
radiograph or chest CT is recommended.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-6-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant improvement to multifocal pneumonia; however, a
more solid component medially adjacent to a slightly enlarged
right paratracheal node appears slightly progressed from prior
exam. Given the patient's history, a repeat CT examination in
approximately three months is recommended to exclude an
underlying lesion within this area after the pneumonia has been
appropriately treated.
2. Unchanged moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Slightly
increased adjacent compression atelectasis involving the lower
lobes.
3. Mild atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation
and
intrathoracic aorta.
4. Partially visualized known multicystic liver disease and
abdominal
ascites.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-6-14**]
Preliminary Report
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis. Moderate
ascites, slightly larger than prior study.
2. Multiple low-attenuation liver and pancreatic lesions
consistent with patient's known history of autosomal polycystic
disease.
2. Status post nephrectomy. Transplanted kidney in the right
iliac fossa is unremarkable
3. Diverticulosis, without obvious diverticulitis, limited
evaluation in the absence of contrast.
4. Periampullary duodenal diverticulum is noted.
.
TTE [**2165-5-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-26**],
left ventricular diastolic function has worsened. The amounts of
mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and estimated
pumonary artery systolic pressure have increased.

ECHO [**2165-6-19**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardia
