Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
66 year old female with 1v CAD s/p RCA BMS in [**2102**], dilated
cardiomyopathy with improvement in EF to 55% over the last few
years with a recent exacerbation in [**12-18**], DM, Crohns,
pancreatic insufficiency who presents from cardiology clinic
today for abnormal labs. Patient was recently admitted to
medicine service with SOB and diagnosed with diastolic CHF
exacerbation although at the time BNP was in the 200 range. Over
the last month since that admission she has had total body
volume overload due to her chronic diastolic heart failure with
over 20 lb weight gain over several months. She endorses malaise
but no worsening SOB or CP. She sys the swelling is mostly in
her upper extermities, neck and head. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**] have been slowly increasing her diuretic regimen to try to
combat this weight gain and recently she was switched from lasix
to torsemide 60mg with metolazone twice weekly to try to help
the symptoms.

Today she came to the cardiology clinic for IV Lasix and was
given 80mg x1 along with 40meq of potassium po. However, after
this stat labs drawn before the lasix showed hyponatremia to 118
and hypochloremia to 72. She was given salty snacks and 2 salt
packets. However, repeat stat labs showed Na 113 and Cl 69. BUN
48, Cr 2.6, K 3.2, bicarb 25.  She was then referred into the
ED.

In our ED, VS: T 97.6, P 75, BP 116/88, RR 16, O2sat 96%.
Complained of malaise, flank pain with urination, and edema but
denied chest pain, seizures, mental status changes, SOB. On exam
more swelling in neck, face, shoulders than in legs and the
lungs were clear. She had no MS changes in ED and remained
hemodynamically stable.  Labs in ED unchanged from clinic (Na
114 and K3.3). She received 40meq of KCl and 2 more salt tabs.
She was also fluid restricted in ED.  CXR showed basilar
atelectasis. She was given percocet for flank pain in ED and
urine cultures and UA sent.

T:97.6, HR:73, BP:120/75, 16 98% on RA prior to transfer to ICU.

on arrival to the floor the patient had no acute complaints.

ROS revealed a cough for the last 1.5 weeks, productive of green
sputum, no hemoptysis. She also has had malaise and myalgias for
the same amount of time. No rhinorrhea or post nasal drip. No
other sick contacts in the home although her son had a stroke
recently and just came home from [**Hospital3 **] yesterday. no
recent travel. No chest pain, palps, sob, dysuria. Mild upper
abdominal and back pain new in the last week without change in
her bowel habits (she has occ loose stools and streaks of blood
in her stools from her chrons disease that has not changed since
being on asacol). No frothy urine, foul smelling urine, or
frequency of urination. No rashes.

Imaging:
CXR:
Basilar atelectasis due to low lung volumes. No focal
consolidation or superimposed edema noted.

ECHO [**10-18**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-1-15**],
there is no significant change


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyponatremia: Patient presented to cardiology clinic with a Na
of 118, then received diuretics and dropped to 114 pointing
towards hypovolemic hyponatremia.  BNP in the ED was 400 and has
h/o BNPs in 1000 range with exacerbation in the past, making
hypervolemic hyponatremia less likely etiology.  Was bolused
with 500 cc doses of normal saline, with gradual increase in her
Na content.  She was transferred from the ICU to the general
medical floors, and continued to improve with small 500 cc NS
boluses.  For the last 2 days prior to discharge, no boluese
were given.  She was restarted on her torsemide prior to
discharge with communciation with her outpatient cardiologist
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1255**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Recommendations were made to discontinue metalozone, as this
most likely exacerbated her hyponatremia.  Sodium at discharge
was 131.  Should have CMP followed up as outpatient.
Additionally, assess for signs of heart failure given cessation
of metolazone.

# Influenza like illness:  complained of cough, headache, and
general malaise.  Had rapid influenza test which was negative.
Was having sputum production with slight yellow tinge.  CXR
showed likely atelectasis and not pneumonia.  Cultured sputum
which was initially positive for gram positive cocci in pairs
and clusters as well as rare GNR's.  Empirically started on CAP
treatment with ceftraixone and azithromycin, but speciations
came back as MRSA.  Given lack of severity in clinical
presentation, felt this represented colinization rather than a
MRSA pneumoni
