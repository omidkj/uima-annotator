Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2129-5-9**] - CABGx3 (Left internal mammary-> Left anterior
descending artery, Saphenous vein graft->Right coronary artery)
[**2129-5-2**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o male with ESRD on HD, HTN, and bipolar disorder who was
admitted to an OSH on [**2129-4-29**] with chest pain, SOB, and new
onset atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catherization.

He awoke on [**2129-4-29**] around 3AM and could not catch his breah. He
then started having chest pressure. He took two nitros with
relief of the chest pressure but he continued to have SOB. He
presented to the OSH ED and was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation and to be volume overloaded. He was admitted for
further evaluation.

Patient reports DOE, orthopnea, and PND. He attributes these
symptoms to fluid overload as a result of insufficient
hemodialysis. He also reports episodes of substernal chest
pressure associated with feeling clammy and wet and relieved by
NTG. He denies associate nausea. He experiences the pressure
when he is at rest and with exertion. He is currently symptom
free.

At the OSH, he was ruled out for acute MI with serial cardiac
enzymes. EKGs showed diffuse ST/T changes. Upon transfer, he was
loaded with plavix 600mg and sent to the cath lab, where he was
found to have several RCA lesions and a focal LAD lesion. Of
note, he also had a dilated aortic arch that was concerning for
aortic aneurysm. Given the possibility of aortic aneurysm and
the thought that he might be eligible for renal transplant soon,
the cath team opted not to place stents.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated AFib with rate of 50 and normal axis. Flate T
waves in lateral and inferior leads and TWI in V5-V6 with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2129-4-29**].

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2129-4-29**] demonstrated:
Dilated LV with concentric LVH, global hypokinesis in the
inferior segment, EF 35-40%. Biatrial enlargement. Dilated
ascending aorta. Dilated right ventricle, right ventricular
hypokinesis. Trace to mild MI. Trace AI. Mild TI with moderate
pulmonary HTN.


CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2129-5-2**] demonstrated:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no angiographically

apparent flow-limiting disease. The LAD had a 95% mid-vessel
stenosis. The LCx was small in caliber and without significant
disease. The RCA was calcified and had serial 80% stenoses in
the proximal and mid-segments. The distal RCA had a 20%
stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressure with a LVEDP of 24 mmHg. Systemic arterial pressure was
normal at 124/70 mmHg. There was no transaortic valve gradient
on pullback of the catheter from the LV to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated no mitral regurgitation.
The
estimated LVEF was 45% with global hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta
was calcified and appeared dilated.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate left ventricular contractile dysfunction.
4. Dilated ascending aorta.

HEMODYNAMICS:
elevated left sided filling pressure with a LVEDP of 24 mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressure was normal at 124/70 mmHg. There was
no transaortic valve gradient on pullback of the catheter from
the LV to the aorta.

[**2129-5-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A small mobile
echoenicity is noted on the ventricular surface of the left
coronary cusp.
6. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine and
phenylephrine and is being AV paced.
1. Biventricular function is unchanged.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged.

[**2129-5-5**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-5-2**] for further
management of his chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe two vessel coronary artery
disease and a slightly dilated ascending aorta. Please see
separated dictated catheterization report. Given the severity of
his disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for
surgical revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound
which revealed a less then 40% bilateral internal carotid artery
stenosis. A CT scan was obtained to evalua
