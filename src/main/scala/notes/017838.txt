Chief Complaint:
seizure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. arterial line placed
2. bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
63 yo M h/o HLD, BPH, ETOH abuse, has had dry cough for several
months. Seen by ENT at [**Hospital **] and dx with atrophic
rhinitis. Saw pcp [**4-6**] who ordered chest xray. CXR suggestive of
RML PNA and possible post obstructive PNA. Patient was scheduled
to have repeat imaging following the weekend however wife was
concerned and brought him to ED for evaluation. Repeat CXR today
showed persistant RML opacity, c/f underlying mass. CT Scan
showed 3.6 cm in lungs and liver and osseus mets.

Patient was given CTX and levo for post obstructive PNA. Seen by
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] in ED who informed patient and wife of possible cancer
dx. Patient was admitted to floor where he complained of RUE
pain before having a [**12-28**] minute tonic/clonic seizure witness by
his wife. A code Blue was called. He did not recieve ativan or
other anti-epiletics. His seizure resolved spontaneously. He was
intubated for airway protection and taken for emergent head CT.
.
Per report from his wife his [**Name2 (NI) **] pressure has been creeping up
all day to the 160's sytolic. No reports of HA, dizzyness or
other focal neurologic disorders. No nausea or vommiting.

STUDIES:
.
CXR [**4-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent right middle lobe opacities. Although the
patient has not undergone interval treatment for pneumonia, per
discussion with the referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26216**],
there is concern for underlying mass lesion. Recommend CT for
further evaluation.
.
CT CHEST [**4-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Obstructing right middle lobe mass, with post-obstructive
pneumonia and
ipsilateral bronchovascular spread.
2. Innumerable hepatic and osseous metastases.
3. Suspicious 1.2-cm soft tissue nodule in the right upper renal
pole.
This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of stage IV
metastatic
lung cancer.
.
CTAP [**4-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Obstructing right middle lobe mass, with post-obstructive
pneumonia and
ipsilateral bronchovascular spread.
2. Innumerable hepatic and osseous metastases.
3. Suspicious 1.2-cm soft tissue nodule in the right upper renal
pole.
.
MRI [**4-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with multiple brain
metastases in the
supra- and infratentorial region. Mild surrounding edema seen.
No midline
shift or hydrocephalus.
.
Bone scan [**5-1**]:
Multiple increased areas of uptake in the spine, left shoulder,
ribs and pelvis consistent with metastatic disease.
.
Pathology:
Liver biopsy [**4-27**]:  Needle biopsy of liver: Hepatic parenchyma
only. No metastatic carcinoma seen.
Liver biopsy [**4-28**]: Needle biopsy of liver: Metastatic
adenocarcinoma. Tumor cells stain strongly and diffusely for CK7
and TTF1, very focally for CK20, and do not stain for CK5/6. The
findings are consistent with a tumor of lung origin.
Also [**4-28**]:
FNA, and touch prep of core, liver:

  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, CONSISTENT WITH CARCINOMA.

  Note: This is a non-small ccell carcinoma. The site of
  origin cannot be determined based on cytomorphology. See
  core biopsy S11-[**Numeric Identifier 26217**] for further discussion.
.
EEGS:
[**4-25**]: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of
a
burst suppression pattern where the bursts consist of a mixed
alpha/beta
frequency activity seen with an anterior predominance. This
pattern is
suggestive of a spindle coma which may be secondary to
medication
effects (most commonly benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or
tricyclics).
Alternatively, if seen after diffuse hypoxic injury, it portends
an
extremely poor prognosis. There were no focal abnormalities or
epileptiform features seen.
.
[**4-26**]:This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of
prolonged periods of generalized, mixed theta and delta
frequency
slowing interrupted by occasional periods of alpha frequency
activity
with an anterior predominance. This pattern is suggestive of a
moderate
to severe diffuse encephalopathy commonly seen with medication
effect,
metabolic disturbance, or infection. Compared to the previous
tracing,
the periods of mixed theta and delta slowing are more prolonged
and
frequent possibly consistent with a lightening of sedation
effect.
There are no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features seen.
.
[**4-27**]: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background of [**4-1**] Hz with bursts of generalized
delta
frequency slowing, indicative of a moderate encephalopathy.
Again seen
were periods of generalized mixed alpha and beta frequency
activity,
which were far less prolonged and noticeable than the previous
day's
recording. These findings represent an improvement in the
background
compared to the previous day's recording. However, rare
generalized
sharp and slow wave discharges were seen and indicate
generalized
cortical irritability. No clear electrographic seizures were
seen.
.
[**4-28**]: This is an abnormal EEG telemetry due to the presence of a
disorganized, mixed alpha and theta frequency background,
alternating
with periods of [**12-28**] Hz frontally predominant generalized detla
slowing.
This pattern is indicative of a moderate encephalopathy,
commonly seen
with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. In
addition, the frequent periods of generalized rhythmic delta
activity
with embedded sharp waves are suggestive of a diffuse cortical
irritability, these were less prominent than the previous day's
recording. There were no definite electrographic seizures seen.
