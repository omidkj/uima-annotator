Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional dyspnea
Pulmonary hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Heart Catheterization
Paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 y.o. female with severe pulmonary arterial
hypertension who presents with one month of worsening exertional
dyspnea. At baseline, she is on 6 litres oxygen at home as well
as bosentan, and was able to walk 50 feet until 1 month ago. She
subsequently had increasing exertional dyspnea and she is now
only able to walk 20 feet on level ground. She was admitted
electively for right heart catheterizaton to further
characterize her pressures and possibly adjust her epoprostenol
dosing. She also complains of increasing abdominal distention
with some mild pain secondary to expanding ventral hernia but
denies any nausea or vomitting. She does have diarrhea which is
at baseline secondary to epoprostenol therapy vs. scleroderma.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for exertional dyspnea
above. Otherwise there is no chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2126-9-24**]):
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2126-9-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2126-9-30**]):    NO GROWTH.

Peritoneal fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2126-9-19**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-5-31**], the
effusion is larger. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade maybe
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures. The
mitral and tricuspid inflows are difficult to assess in the
presence of atrial fibrillation

[**2126-9-19**] Abdominal US
Scans of the four quadrants of the abdomen and pelvis
demonstrate a large
volume of ascites, which represents a distinct change from
previous ultrasound scan of [**2125-10-4**] which showed no ascites.
The ascites is also seen to extend into a large umbilical
hernia.  The fluid is anechoic showing no signs of septations or
exudative appearance.

CONCLUSION:  Large volume ascites including ascites within an
umbilical
hernia.

[**2126-9-20**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Hemodynamic assessment revealed severely elevated pulmonary
arterial
systolic pressures, with PASP 91 mmHg at baseline.  Cardiac
index is
preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2 but reduced compared to prior RHC.
Moderate
elevation of right-sided filling pressures, with RVEDP 15 mmHg.
Mild
elevation of left-sided filling pressures, with LVEDP 13 mmHg.
Elevated
PVR at 800 dynes-sec/cm5.
2.  Drug therapy noted above entailed increasing flolan dose
from 38
ng/kg/min to 41 mcg/kg/min, with resultant hemodynamic
measurements
noted above after 15 minutes at new dose.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Severe pulmonary hypertension
2.  Plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (notified) and CCU team (notified)

[**2126-9-25**] CT chest w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1.  Given the technical differences and lesser degree of
inspiration, the
diffuse centrilobular interstitial pulmonary abnormality is
essentially
stable.
2.  Increased size of pericardial and pleural effusions,
increased ascites, new findings of anasarca and interlobular
septal thickening at the lung bases, all suggesting worsening
volume overload.
3.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
4.  Stable 4-mm right middle lobe lung nodule.
5.  Moderate coronary atherosclerosis.
6.  Aortic valve calcification.

[**2126-9-24**] Paracentesis, US guided
IMPRESSION: Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis
with removal of 1.5 liters of ascites.
