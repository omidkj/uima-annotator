Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in ED; Extubated in MICU
ArcticSun Cooling
Coronary Catheterization
EP study
ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with past medical history of CAD MIx4 s/p 3v
CABG [**2174**], who was living at [**Hospital3 2558**] after two staged
spinal surgery [**2192-11-12**] complicated by NSTEMI.
.
She had an stress dobutamine echo prior to the surgery for risk
stratification. Per report, it was normal with no clear evidence
of ischemia. She remained intubated after the second surgery out
of concern for aggressive IVF resuscitation, with peak lactate
of 3.5 intra-operatively. She experienced an NSTEMI on [**11-14**]
with TWI in lateral leads and Troponins up to 2.667. Echo at the
time showed EF 50-55%, with inferolateral wall akinesis, basal
to mid-inferior wall is akinetic. Mid anterolateral hypokinesis
and the discrete mid-laterall wall aneurysm noted on dobutamine
stress images from [**2192-11-7**] was not visualized. Cardiology
consult was obtained and it was decided to medically manage her
NSTEMI.
.
According to the report, she was found pulseless and
unresponsive [**2192-11-27**], code blue was called and patient received
6 cycyles of CPR, AED was applied and shock advised after which
SROC occurred. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
managment and had agonal breathing in the ED, she was intubated
and admitted to the MICU. She was found to have multiple
pulmonary emobli and a possible ileopsoas abscess. She was
treated with the post arrest cooling protocol. She was started
on heparin bridge to warfarin, and was briefly treated with
antibiotics for supposed ileopsoas abscess however suspicion for
abscess was low and abx were discontinued. She had ECHO [**11-14**]
which showed EF of 50-55%%. Head CT was negative. [**2192-12-3**] She
was extubated and transferred to the general medical floor.
.
Cardiac enzymes were trended which never increased.
.
Following transfer to the general medical floor at [**Hospital1 18**], the
working diagnosis was that arrest was precipitated by PE versus
cardiac arrhythmia. She was seen by electorphysiology who
requested transfer to Inpatient cardiology service for an EP
study and possible ICD palcement.
.
Per Ms [**Known lastname 91304**] son, she was independent prior to her surgery.
She had limited motion due to her back pain but heart has not
been a problem for her since the CABG operation. Her son recalls
use of NTG only twice over the last 10 years. She did not have
any orthopnea, PND or lower extremity edema prior to her
surgery.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
[**2192-11-27**]
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is an inferobasal and posterobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall,
and posterior wall. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. Mild
to moderate ([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is
