Head CT [**2173-5-17**]: Again seen are postoperative changes on the

interval decrease in the amount of postoperative pneumocephalus.
No significant change in the hyperdensity along the sulci of the
right frontal and parietal lobes as well as slight decrease in
amount of right-sided subdural hematoma seen. Slight leftward
shift of the normally midline structures is again seen, not
significantly changed. Ventricles appear relatively unchanged
compared to prior study. Again seen is hypodensity in left
insular region. There appears to be an evolving lacue in the
left internal capsule. Visualized paranasal sinuses appear
relatively clear. Again noted are surgical staples in the scalp.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and evaluated by the neurosurgery team in
the emergency room. The patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the
patient was taken to the OR for evacuation of R SDH.
Postoperatively, she was transferred intubated to the SICU.

Neuro: On admission, she did not follow commands but moved all
extremities. Postoperatively her examination demonstrated
intermittent command-following, localizing on the R and
withdrawing both legs to noxious stimuli. Her examination did
not significantly change during her hospitalization and at the
time of discharge she intermittently opens eyes to name but does
not follow commands reliably. She has baseline asymmetric pupils
L>R.

Resp: patient was maintained on the respirator and then a
decision was made with the patient's family for tracheostomy.
Her sputum cultures did demonstrate gram positive cocci and CXR
did demonstrate a question of PNA. She continues her antibiotic
regimen at the time of discharge.

CV: no significant issues, her metoprolol continues at the time
of discharge.

GI: PEG tube was placed at the bedside while the patient was in
the ICU and she was maintained on goal tube feeds.

GU: foley

Hct: stable anemia, patient started on folate

ID: patient did spike intermittent fevers while hospitalized.
Her CXR did demonstrate a question of LLL consolidation. Sputum
cxs demonstrated gram positive cocci. ID was consulted who
