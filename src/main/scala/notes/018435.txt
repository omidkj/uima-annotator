Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis, DIC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation (at OSH)

History of Present Illness:
62y/o F with h/o COPD, CVA, + PPD [**12-27**] exposure to husband s/p
INH course x9 months, dementia, EtOH, hypertension presented to
OSH with increasing dyspnea. Was recently d/c'ed with COPD
exacerbation - treated with steroids and gatifloxacin. One week
later, c/o worsening dyspnea on [**12-29**]. She was confused, producing
thick yellow sputum, with chills.
Pt admitted to the floor. Desatted, with episode of a fib with
RVR - transferred to unit, treated with dig, lopressor, and dilt
- converted to normal sinus. Was hemodynamically stable.
At OSH, oriented to person and place, but not time. Sat 94% on
2L. WBC on arrival was 25.4, Hct 27.5, plt 35. She was found to
have a RLL infiltrate on CXR. Was on BiPAP initially, eventually
intubated [**12-27**] worsening respiratory failure. Had a chest CT with
loculated R effusion, 2.2 cm RML spiculated mass and R axillary
and supraclavicular LAD. Head CT performed [**12-27**] MS changes -
acute infarct in L frontal lobe. Head CT 4 days later showed no
change. Due to findings on chest CT, had a bronch on the AM of
admission - thick purulent secretions in RML, had cytology
brushings and quantitative cytology brushings sent. On the day
of admission, fibrinogen < 70, FDP > 20, plts 47, INR 1.9. Pt
rec'd 4 units of cryo, then 10 units cryo on [**1-1**], ? FFP, ?
platelets, vitamin K. Acute rise in LFTs - AST 275, ALT 260, alk
phos 82. Were normal on admission [**12-28**] - AST 31, ALT 15, alk phos
82, t bili 1.0.
Was treated with vanco and imipenem. Was transferred here for
expedited workup of RML mass.

Pertinent Results:
OSH Radiology Studies:

CT head without contrast [**12-31**] (OSH): c/w acute infarct, left
frontal; atrophy with additional small areas of decreased
attenuation c/w previous ischemic changes; R parietal temporal,
L posterior parietal, deep central R parietal - c/w areas of
previous infarct - no change from [**12-28**]
.
CT chest with contrast [**12-31**] (OSH): anteriorly at R base, 2.2cm
area of increased attenuation, possible rounded atelectasis but
cannot exclude lung mass in RML; soft tissue prominence in R
axilla, enhancing; soft tissue fullness in supraclavicular
region on R c/w adenopathy
.
CXR [**1-2**] (not official read): R sided diffuse infiltrate, could
not visualize discrete mass

[**Hospital1 18**] Radiology Studies:
[**1-3**] CXR:
1. Moderate loculated right pleural effusion.
2. Right paratracheal/suprahilar density, which may represent a
mass or
lymphadenopathy.
3. Patchy opacities in the right lung.
4. Further evaluation by chest CT is recommended.

[**1-3**] RLE U/S:
The right common femoral vein is patent and compressible, with
normal waveforms. The right common femoral artery is patent as
well, with a normal waveform, and without evidence of
pseudoaneurysm. Small amount of calcification is noted within
the right common femoral artery.

[**1-3**] Abdominal U/S:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature. No evidence of portal venous
thrombosis.
2. The gallbladder is fairly distended with sludge and possible
small amount shadowing stones within it. There is no gallbladder
wall thickening or edema, but there is a small amount of free
fluid in the gallbladder fossa. The appearance is not diagnostic
of cholecystitis, but the appearance is not entirely normal. If
there is clinical concern for cholecystitis, HIDA scan or
follow-up ultrasound may be helpful.
3. Right pleural effusion.

[**1-3**] Head CT:
There are multiple moderate size areas of hypodensity in the
cortex
and subajcent white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. These
are associated with loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation and are suggestive of subacute-chronic infarcts.
The abnormal areas are in the frontal and parietal lobes
bilaterally. The distribution is consistent with embolic
phenomenona but could be compatible with a watershed
distribution as well. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. Note is made of septum cavum pellucidum et
vergae.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] arrived to the ICU intubated. Initial labs
confirmed likelihood of DIC, probably [**12-27**] sepsis. There was no
evidence of acute bleeding, so FFP, platelets, and cryo were not
given. She was started on empiric vancomycin and meropenem for
PNA coverage, with the intention of d/c'ing vanc if no GPC on
blood or sputum cultures in 48h. She was also placed on steroid
taper since pt received decadron treatment at OSH. She was kept
on respiratory precautions due to h/o TB exposure, and sputum
cultures were ordered to r/o active
