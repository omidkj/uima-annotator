HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral
vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
chronic renal insufficiency secondary to bilateral renal
artery stenosis who presents from Spinal [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
for intractable hypertension.

He was seen at the [**Hospital1 69**] in
the middle of [**2170-10-1**] after experiencing lower
extremity paralysis at an outside hospital in the setting of
an aggressive antihypertensive regimen.  Ultimately, it was
discovered that his relative hypotension had resulted in
significant end-organ damage including an anterior spinal
artery infarct resulting in T11 paraplegia, acute renal
failure, and a troponin leak.  The patient was sent to
neurologic rehabilitation at the end of [**Month (only) 359**].

Since arriving at rehabilitation, the patient has made
significant neurologic improvement progressing from 0/5
strength in his lower extremities to 4- strength in some
muscle groups at present.  His course has been marked
continued hypertension that is refractory to four
antihypertensive medications including minoxidil.  It is
believed that his hypertension is most likely secondary to
his bilateral renal artery stenosis.  Because of this, he was
transferred back to [**Hospital1 69**] for
definitive treatment.  Given that aggressive blood pressure
lowering has yielded catastrophic results in the past, it was
decided to admit him to the Intensive Care Unit for invasive
blood pressure monitoring and parenteral therapy.

On admission the patient denies chest pain, fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations, bowel or
bladder incontinence, lightheadedness, or headache.  He is
able to move his legs spontaneously.

 1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in the setting of sudden hypotension.
 2.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post aortobifemoral
bypass.
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 2, and bilateral renal artery stenosis as described above.
 5.  Anterior spinal artery infarct secondary to

 6.  Difficult to control hypertension.
 7.  Recent hospitalization in [**2170-9-1**] for a right
upper lobe pneumonia requiring intubation for one month,

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lived with his mother and daughter at
home prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2170-10-1**].  He has a 50-year smoking history,
smoking three packs per day.  He quit in [**2170-10-1**].
Since then he has resided at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This is a pleasant
65-year-old gentleman in no acute distress who was afebrile
with a blood pressure of 186/74 by cuff, and 195/72 by
arterial line.  His heart rate was 75.  He was satting at 98%
to 100% on room air.  His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination was unremarkable.  He had no jugular venous
distention.  His lungs were clear with no wheezes or rales.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with normal first
heart sound and second heart sound, and a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  His abdomen was
benign except for multiple ecchymoses along his lower abdomen
and guaiac-positive stool.  His extremities were significant
for clubbing bilaterally. He had good distal pulses.  He had
3+ pitting edema to his calves bilaterally.  There were no
femoral bruits.  He had [**5-5**] upper extremity strength
bilaterally with decreased range of motion at bilateral
elbows.  Neurologically, his mental status was intact.  His
cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  He had
[**5-5**] upper extremity strength bilaterally.  He had [**1-5**] to [**2-5**]
lower extremity strength bilaterally except for 4- bilateral
plantar flexion.  His toes were equivocal.  He had 0 deep
tendon reflexes of his biceps, patellar, and Achilles.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 9.2, hematocrit of 26.9,
and platelet count of 157.  His sodium was 134,
potassium 5.2, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, blood urea
nitrogen 67, and creatinine of 1.2.  His glucose was 226.
His albumin was 3.4.  His calcium was 8.5, magnesium 2, and
phosphorous of 2.7.  His coagulations were within normal
limits.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm with normal axis and normal intervals.  He had left
ventricular hypertrophy with strained pattern.  He had a Q
wave in III.

Echocardiogram from [**2170-10-25**], showed an ejection
fraction of 45%, with mild left atrial dilatation, and mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  He had resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the
basal and middle inferoposterior wall, and hypokinesis of the
posterolateral wall.  He had a normal size and wall motion of
his right ventricle.  He had moderate 2+ mitral
regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the
Coronary Intensive Care Unit.  His oral antihypertensive
medications were held, and he was started on a Nipride drip
to keep his systolic blood pressure between 150 and 170.  He
had a single episode of chest pain associated with a systolic
blood pressure of 220 while on the Nipride drip, so a
nitroglycerin drip was added as well.  He had no
electrocardiogram changes or enzyme leak associated with the
chest pain.  It resolved quickly after his blood pressure was
lowered.

He was then taken to the catheterization laboratory where he
received a left renal artery stent for a 90% proximal
stenosis.  His right renal artery was totally occluded
proximally.  He also had 3-vessel coronary artery disease
with normal left main artery, moderately diseased left
anterior descending artery, totally occluded middle left
circumflex and proximal right coronary artery, with good
collateral flow to the distal portions of both of those
vessels.

After the procedure, he was weaned off of the Nipride and
nitroglycerin drips and changed to oral antihypertensives.
His goal systolic blood pressure is 140 to 160.  To that end,
he was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q.6h.,
captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.   He
continued to have systolic blood pressures in the 170s to
200s after two days of this regimen, so minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
q.d. was added.  His systolic blood pressure was initially in
the 150s the following day but then dropped into the 130s the
day after.  This pressure is most likely too low for him
given the range of syst
