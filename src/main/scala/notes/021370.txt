Chief Complaint:
Right thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular spread

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 yo man with hx HTN, afib on coumadin for past few
months, DM, CAD s/p cabg, among other medical problems, who
presents as transfer from OSH (S. Shore) with R subcortical and
intraventricular ICH.  As he is intubated and sedated when
neurology consulted, hx obtained from wife.  [**Name (NI) **] had been in USOH
yesterday, and noticed after he woke up this am that his "legs
weren't working properly."  He had trouble getting down the
stairs; he took his medications and ate breakfast.  When he
tried to get up the stairs again, he had to crawl on his hands
and knees.  He called his wife at 10:50AM and she told him to
come to hospital.  He had also c/o dizziness, but did not
specify if this was lightheadedness or vertigo.  He had no
headache, no visual changes, no problems with the arms, no
trouble speaking or swallowing, and no changes in his appearance
or voice.  He had to lean on a chair to stand up properly.  He
had no n/v until after he had gotten to OSH. In the ambulance,
his BP was 164/90 and HR was 108, BG 290.  However, at the OSH,
his family members noted that his bp was above 200/100.  His GCS
was 15, and his INR was 2.4, for which he received 4 units FFP
and Vitamin K as well as dilantin.  He did not tell anyone
whether he had fallen (we have report of "no falls" per [**Hospital **] report to neurosurg team); his wife feels that if he had
hit his head or fallen today, he would have mentioned it, but
she cannot remember anyone asking him.  He had c/o dizziness and
had a head CT at the OSH with R thalamic bleed and
intraventricular extension, R>L; he was given valium and ativan
at the osh ER for complaint of "dizziness" and within about an
hour or two after the medication, his family noticed that he
became progressively sleepier.  Though he could still follow
commands and answer simple questions, it took more to keep him
awake.  He vomited several times.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for possible intervention/neurosurgery, and en route, he became
even drowsier and incoherent, at some point unable to keep awake
at all.  At [**Hospital1 18**] ER he was promptly intubated and taken to head
CT where a large R IVH and R thalamic hemorrhage was identified,
with extension into contralateral and 3rd ventricle, no blood in
4th, and large ventricular system but no definitive
hydrocephalus.  There is some mass effect on the R temporal
lobe. Neurosurgery saw the patient and does not plan to put in a
drain at this time.

Imaging:
Head CT reviewed - R thalamic bleed with extensive R>L IVH,

lobe /mass effect, no shift, no blood in 4th vent "IMPRESSION:
Extensive hemorrhage centered within the right thalamus and deep
white matter structures with intraventricular extension.  Prior
study not available to assess for interval change.  Findings
discussed with neurosurgical team after the
study."

carina.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo man with hx HTN, afib on coumadin for past few months, DM,
CAD s/p cabg, among other medical problems, who presents as
transfer from OSH (S. Shore) with R subcortical and
intraventricular ICH.  The hemorrhage may have started in the
thalamus, and may relate to his hypertension, as well as the
fact that he is on coumadin and thus more at risk for ICH.  At
the present time, neurosurgery does not plan to put in an
external ventricular drain, and prefers to follow exams for now
and repeat imaging in the morning.  Received 4U FFP, Vit K, PHT
load at OSH, and receiving more FFP x 4U.

Rec:
-Admit to neurology ICU, attg: [**Doctor Last Name 1693**]
-Give FFP now to lower INR to <1.2 (recheck at MN); if high,
give
vitamin K again
-Keep sbp 120-140
-Hold off on giving more dilantin, but check level in AM
-Q1h neuro checks (focus on brainstem exam)
-Monitor on telemetry
-Head CT in AM or if any change in exam
-Check lytes, cbc, coags in am
-Check UA
-ventillator support for now pending repeat imaging
-consider drain, as blood in 3rd ventricle is worrisome for
impending hydrocephalus
-Protonix, pneumoboots

[**10-3**]: Likely hypertensive bleed in setting of supratherapeutic
INR. No history to suggest trauma. Trial of pressor support
overnite and attempt to extubate in am. Repeat INR this pm 1.2
and Hct 34.8. Plan to clear c-collar once extubated and more
awake. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] spoke with son.

[**10-5**]: Spoke w/immediate fam, code discussion established DNR.
Spiked fever ON, repeating cxs, CXR. Tolerating pressure support
off propofol, neuro exam unchanged and notified family. Attempt
to extubate later today per TICU team.

[**10-9**]: Bld cxs back 3/4 bottles pansensitive coag neg staph
switched to Cefazolin. Bronch'd [**10-8**] GPCs on BAL gram stain and
cxs PND. Repeat head CT stable. Started vitK 10mg PO x3days for
uptrending INR (1.3 today).

[**10-10**]: Per micro lab, sm colony of S aureus growing from BAL
fluid sensitivity pending and sputum from [**10-7**] growing MSSA.
However, pt defervescing. ICU team spoke with family and plan is
to place trach and peg and IVC filter tomorrow in OR. Head CT
radiology read as ?IPH [**Hospital1 **]-parietal likely overead and bleed
tracking from ventricles; however, TICU team d/c'd SC heparin
and plan to place IVC filter (?). Will discuss with stroke team.

[**10-11**]: Getting peg and trach TODAY. ID recs, check abd CT
(ordered for Sat concurrent with head CT) to r/o diveritculitis,
GB dz. Rads reread head CT as likely ventricular blood
biparietally NOT worsening bleed. Restarted SC heparin. Will get
TEE today prior to ETT out. Uric acid normal. Awaiting urine
legionalla.

[**10-12**]: TTE: complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and
descending thoracic aorta, LVEF 45-50, no endocarditis
- Urine legionella negative
- Abd CT: 1.  Right colonic diverticula with adjacent minimal
inflammatory changes. Cannot exclude early diverticulitis.  No
evidence of abscess.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis,
with
Lower lobe patchy opacities, consistent with atelectasis versus
early
pneumonitis.
3.  Gallstone without ev
