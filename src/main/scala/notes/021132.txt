Reason: Evaluate for occult sources of GI bleed, including
possible

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
36 year old man with large, occult GI bleed, h/o left rib
fracture and stab wound s/p splenectomy, sarcoid, asthma, with
negative EGD/push enteroscopy/colonoscopy/tagged RBC scan
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for occult sources of GI bleed, including possible
angiography to evaluate for AV fistulas and ischemia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL INDICATION: 36-year-old gentleman with large occult GI
bleed. Evaluate for occult sources of possible gastrointestinal
hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: 0.625 mm helically acquired images are obtained from
the lung bases to the pubic symphysis both with and without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformations are provided for
interpretation.

FINDINGS: No prior imaging is available for comparison.

The lung bases are grossly clear.

There is evidence of prior splenectomy with splenosis identified
in the region of the surgical bed. The pancreas, adrenal glands,
kidneys, gallbladder, and liver are grossly unremarkable.

Evaluation of the bowel reveals significant circumferential
thickening involving the region of the rectum. Differential
considerations do include neoplasia given this imaging
appearance. Other considerations include inflammatory or
infectious etiologies. Direct visualization is recommended for
further evaluation as clinically indicated. Findings are
discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of dictation. Also, there
is a small amount of inspissated oral contrast within the distal
aspect of the appendiceal lumen.

Pelvic structures appear otherwise grossly unremarkable. No
suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are seen. Healing
fracture of the right-sided twelfth rib is incidentally noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Significant thickening of the rectum as noted above.
2. Healing right-sided rib fracture as described above.
3. Findings of prior splenectomy with splenosis in the region of
the surgical bed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially observed overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with stable
vital signs and hematocrit and was transferred to the floor. A
bowel prep was performed and capsule endoscopy was performed,
results pending at the time of discharge. A contrast abdominal
and pelvic CT was performed, and the distal rectum was noted to
have hypervascularity. A subsequent flexible sigmoidoscopy was
negative and completely normal. Patient was notably guaiac
negative after bowel prep, with stable hematocrit for 4 days on
discharge. He was scheduled for follow up in [**Hospital **]
clinic.
