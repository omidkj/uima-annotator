Please see the previously dictated discharge summary dated
[**2128-5-10**] for prior hospitalization and hospital course.
This dictation covers hospitalization from [**5-3**] to [**2128-5-31**].  The remainder of the hospital course will be dictated
in a separate discharge summary done by the next intern
covering caring for this patient.

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:
1. Hairy cell leukemia.  This patient is status post 2CdA
   treatment from [**4-29**] for the hairy cell leukemia.
   Patient was maintained on Allopurinol to prevent tumor
   lysis.  She had no evidence of tumor lysis during this
   hospitalization stay.  In addition, she had a one time
   dose of GM-CSF, which was also in the setting of having
   persisting high fevers.  This was discontinued after one
   time dose given the fact that patient did not
   significantly respond to this course.

She also had a three day's course of GM-CSF to improve her
counts.  Her ANC improved to greater than 500 on [**5-17**] and
greater than 1000 on [**5-18**].  The remainder of
hospitalization course was markedly improved in terms of her
neutropenia and pancytopenia.  She had persistent pulmonary
nodules and persistent fevers of unknown origin during this
hospitalization stay.  Differential diagnosis for these
pulmonary nodules were likely persistent leukemia versus
infectious etiology.  Further evaluation of these lesions
will be determined in the future hospitalization course.

1. Atypical Mycobacterium bacteremia.  Patient had cultures
   that were positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.  She was
   initially treated as described in previous discharge
   summary with linezolid, Amikacin, moxifloxacin, and
   clindamycin.  However, given the fact that the organism
   was identified was Mycobacterium abscessus as per the
   Infectious Disease consult, they recommended discontinuing
   these agents switching her clarithromycin and AmBisome as
   well as vancomycin and cipromycin given the fact that she
   was febrile and neutropenic at this time.

The remainder of her hospitalization was significant for
continued spiking high fevers of unknown origin.  She had
blood cultures sent, which were negative.  Given the fact
that she continuing spiking fevers, it was unclear what the
course of her atypical Mycobacterium should be.  There was
debates between Pulmonary, who was consulted for evaluation
of this patient given her persistent nodules, serial CT scans
during the month showed that she actually had some
improvement in the ground-glass opacities as well as the
hilar pulmonary nodules.  There was a concern for possible
rebronching and evaluation of these nodules with a tissue
biopsy versus a VATS to rule out fungal infection.  At the
time of this dictation, the plan was to continue monotherapy
for the atypical Mycobacterium with clarithromycin and
followup serial CT exams for further evaluations and possible
adjustment of her treatment.

The plan was if she continued to spike high fevers and had a
hemodynamic instability, plan was to broaden antibiotic
coverage and possible further invasive tissue evaluation.

1. Left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression.  A
   repeat torso CT on [**5-21**] showed persistent pulmonary
   nodules, but no evidence of bronchial compression.  The
   patient subsequently received doses of AmBisome during her
   hospitalization to cover her neutropenic period.  However,
   this was discontinued after further consultation with both
   Pulmonary and ID given the fact that the concern for these
   nodules was likely less for fungal given her neutropenia
   had resolved, but more towards Mycobacterium possible
   nodules.

1. Febrile neutropenia.  The patient was covered with
   AmBisome, vancomycin, and Cipro given her ceftaz allergy
   as described previously for febrile neutropenic coverage.
   She was HIV negative per outside hospital records.  She
   was also continued on acyclovir.

On [**5-10**], she developed axillary nodules as well as some
thrush.  Dermatology was consulted in evaluation of these
nodules.  They were biopsied and the cultures were consistent
with gram-negative rods and Pseudomonas as well as a throat
culture, which grew out Pseudomonas.  Ciprofloxacin was D/C'd
in favor of high-dose levofloxacin given the sensitivities of
the Pseudomonas.  On [**5-13**], the levofloxacin was changed
to aztreonam given the concern for rising LFTs on
levofloxacin.  Once her ANC was greater than 500, vancomycin
and AmBisome were D/C'd.  Aztreonam was D/C'd as well given
the fact that the pseudomonal infection was not thought to be
due to infection per se, but was thought to be due to
pseudomonal colonization.

Once her ANC was greater than 1000, her antibiotic therapy
was tailored to just acyclovir and clarithromycin.  However,
she continued to have new spiking fevers to 103 and a urine
culture grew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus x2.  A
torso CT was performed to evaluate for an occult abscess and
in the setting, aztreonam and linezolid were empirically
started.  Torso CT showed no hepatosplenic candidiasis, but
resolving bilateral pulmonary disease and continued nodules
of unclear etiology.  She also had a new rash that was in her
upper trunk and diffusely macular, and erythematous, and
blanching.  Dermatology was reconsulted on evaluation of this
patient, and they recommended that this was likely due to a
drug rash secondary to aztreonam and the patient was changed
from aztreonam to ciprofloxacin as a result.

She continued to have spiking fevers afterwards of unclear
etiology and continued with broad coverage.  On [**5-25**], the
linezolid was D/C'd given the fact that she was no longer
neutropenic, and again it was determined that her VRE was a
colonizer rather than an acute infection.

On [**5-26**], her ciprofloxacin was D/C'd and she was covered
just on AmBisome and clarithromycin, however, further
evaluation with Pulmonary and Infectious Disease consult
regarding pulmonary nodules recommended discontinuing the
AmBisome given the fact that the pulmonary nodules are likely
consistent with either atypical Mycobacterium infection
versus leukemia, and she was maintained on clarithromycin
monotherapy with reimage with possible repeat CT.  A repeat
CT was performed on [**5-31**], which showed stable pulmonary
nodules and no interval change other than a left pleural
effusion.  It likely will be that the patient will be treated
with clarithromycin monotherapy for her Mycobacterium
abscessus for a total course of three months to be followed
up as an outpatient with Infectious Diseases.  The patient
was also given inhaled pentamidine x2 one month apart during
this hospitalization stay for pneumocystis pneumonia
prophylaxis.

1. Hypotension.  The patient had an episode of hypotension at
   the beginning of the month.  During her previous month
   during this hospitalization, she completed a seven day
   course of steroids given her failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
   Repeat [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was performed on [**5-3**] given her
   hypotension.  She was given a one time's dose of
   dexamethasone, and her hypotension resolved.

1. Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.  The patient
   had some elevations in her LFTs initially concern for
   levofloxacin as she was subsequently changed to aztreonam
   as described above.  Aztreonam was D/C'd given the fact
   that she was no longer febrile neutropenic on [**5-18**].
   There was also concern for hepatosplenic candidiasis.
   This was negative by a torso CT, so AmBisome was held off,
   but we initially restarted given her persistent pulmonary
   nodules as described above.

On [**5-27**], she had a markedly increased transaminitis,
where her ALT and AST were both greater than 500 up from 90
the previous day.  She had an acute hepatitis, which was
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] serologies were negative for acute hepatitis.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed that was unrevealing
except for sludge in the gallbladder.  Hepatology was
consulted i
