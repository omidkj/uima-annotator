Service:  Medical ICU and [**Doctor Last Name **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 23-year-old man
with a history of type 1 diabetes complicated by retinopathy,
neuropathy, and nephropathy, hypertension, migraine
headaches, and congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 35% who presents with three days of nausea,
vomiting, and hyperglycemia.  The patient also reported
diarrhea five times on the day of admission with severe
refractory vomiting approximately 10-15x/day.  He reports in
addition to that, chills and abdominal pains, but denies any
fever, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath.  He did have
a sick contact in his mother who had similar diarrheal
symptoms recently.  Denies any bright red blood per rectum or
any melena.

Upon presentation to the Emergency Department, he had one
episode of coffee-ground emesis.  Nasogastric lavage at the
time cleared after 1 liter of normal saline.  He was volume
resuscitated with 2 liters of normal saline, started on an
insulin drip for his elevated blood glucose, and was brought
up into the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Type 1 diabetes with triopathy.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetic
nephropathy.
3. Hypertension.
4. Left Charcot foot.
5. Migraine headaches.
6. Depression.
7. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35% and
global left ventricular hypokinesis.

ALLERGIES:  Zestril leads to lightheadedness.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 80 mg po bid.
2. Lantus insulin 20 units q am.
3. Humalog sliding scale.
4. Norvasc 10 mg q day.
5. Labetalol 600 mg [**Hospital1 **].
6. PhosLo 667 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Epo 5,000 units 2x/week.
8. Hydralazine 25 mg qid.
9. Isordil 20 mg tid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes approximately one pack of
cigarettes per day.  He is poorly compliant with his diabetic
care.  He gives a history of both alcohol and marijuana
usage.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes.  He has two
sisters also with the disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 97.1,
heart rate 88, blood pressure 155/70, respiratory rate 20,
and O2 saturation is 99% on room air.  In general, he
appeared in no acute distress.  Pertinent physical findings
reveal that his sclerae were anicteric.  He is status post
right vitrectomy.  His neck was supple.  His heart was
tachycardic with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right
upper sternal border and a [**3-6**] murmur at the apex.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdominal
examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended, he had guaiac negative stool on
rectal examination.  Extremities were without clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Examination of his skin revealed no rashes.

LABORATORIES ON EXAMINATION:  Sodium was 121, potassium 6.7,
chloride 84, bicarb 8, BUN and creatinine of 111 and 8.1
respectively.  Blood glucose initially on admission was
1,111.  His anion gap was 29.  Complete blood count revealed
a white blood cell count of 10.8, hematocrit of 29.9,
platelets of 427.  He had no bands on his differential.
Coags were within normal limits.  LFTs revealed an ALT of 62,
AST of 56, alkaline phosphatase of 301, amylase of 63, total
bilirubin of 0.4.  Initial arterial blood gas was 7.20/23/89.

Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute
with a normal axis.

Chest x-ray revealed small bilateral effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for management of his diabetic
ketoacidosis.  He was treated aggressively with insulin drip,
aggressive volume resuscitation, and electrolyte management,
and by the third hospital day, was off of insulin drip and
back on lantus and Humalog sliding scales.  His diabetic
ketoacidosis was thought to be triggered by a viral
gastroenteritis as well as pneumonia ([**Last Name 788**] problem #2).
Initially because of poor po intake, he was only given 10
units of Lantus insulin and his blood sugars were
persistently between 200-300.  Lantus was increased to 20
units on the day prior to discharge with continuing Humalog
sliding scale coverage.  This regimen to achieve better
glycemic control, and prior to discharge, a repeat Chem-7 was
checked showing complete closure of his anion gap.

2. Pulmonary:  Because of his anemia, which is likely
secondary to his renal disease, he was transfused 1 unit of
packed red blood cells on the 15th.  Following this blood
transfusion and in addition to the aggressive intravenous
fluid resuscitation he received, the patient developed
pulmonary edema, and was restarted on his outpatient dose of
Lasix 80 mg po bid.

The patient continued to have an anion gap despite
appropriate therapy with insulin and it was unclear if
further infection was the cause of his diabetic ketoacidosis.
With the pleural effusions at the lung bases were obscured,
to better evaluate lung parenchyma, a CT scan of the chest
was done which revealed a right lower lobe parenchymal air
space consolidation with again no evidence of bilateral
pleural effusions associated with compressive atelectasis.
There are also prominent mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes
noted.

The patient was then started on antibiotics initially given
ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  Concern was briefly arranged
for an aspiration pneumonia given the patient's significant
vomiting, however, it was felt that he most likely had a
community acquired pneumonia, and then was continued on
clindamycin alone.  Upon transfer from the Intensive Care
Unit to the Medical team, his antibiotics were further
changed to levofloxacin as monotherapy for his pneumonia.

Sputum culture was obtained which revealed fewer than 10
polys, and culture grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.  The
patient was discharged with levofloxacin to complete a 10 day
course.  Prior to discharge on [**2155-3-17**], the patient had a
right thoracentesis which removed approximately 1 liter of
fluid.  Culture of this fluid yielded no growth.  Gram stain
revealed no organisms or leukocytes.  Chemistry analysis of
the fluid and cell counts revealed white blood cell count of
125, red blood cell count of 1,490 with a differential with
the white blood cell count of 0 polys, 77 lymphocytes, 17
monocytes, and 5 mesothelial cells.  The pleural fluid
glucose was 146, LDH 93, and albumin 0.9.  Analysis of these
numbers revealed that the fluid is most likely suggestive of
a transudate likely representing a parapneumonic effusion.

For the local pain of the thoracentesis site, the patient was
given Percocet with good relief.

During the admission, the patient had also complained of a
pleuritic type of pain on the right side.  Brief concern for
pulmonary embolism was raised, and the patient was started on
Heparin.  Bilateral lower extremity noninvasive studies were
performed which were negative for any evidence of deep venous
thrombosis at which time the Heparin was stopped.  The
pleuritic pain was likely felt to be due to his pneumonia and
effusion.

3. Cardiovascular:
A. Hypertension:  The patient continued to be hypertensive
during his admission.  He was continued on his outpatient
medications including Isordil, Norvasc, and hydralazine.

B. Congestive heart failure:  As stated above, following
transfusion and aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient
had some pulmonary edema.  This cleared after reinstating his
outpatient dose of Lasix at 80 mg po bid.

4. Renal:  Renal was consulted upon admission.  His
creatinine progressively improved from 8.1 on admission down
to 6.6 on the day of discharge.  His elevated creatinine
likely represented progression of chronic disease with the
added insult of dehydration.  One final Chem-7 was checked
before discharge, as the patient left late at night in order
to check his anion gap, and it showed that his creatinine had
bumped again to 7.2.  He will have very close followup with
Nephrology and plans to start
