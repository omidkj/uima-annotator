History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85007**] is a 66 yo IDDM who seems to have had some minor
anemia about a year ago and was followed q 3 months for this and
his DM - about 2-3 months ago he and his wife noticed that he
was bruising easily and he was just not feeling all that well.
He was having some problems with dizziness, feeling nauseated in
the mornings and not really wanting to get out of bed. It sounds
like his PCP sent him to the nephrologist because of an elevated
creatinine, he saw the kidney doctor on [**4-28**] and received a call
a short time later that his WBC was high and that he needed to
either see an oncologist or go back to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] he saw the
next morning. At around the same time he was having some sore
throat and left sided neck pain and he had a CT of his neck
which he said they told him was normal ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **]). At
some point he was started on avelox for this throat issue. He
presents here today to the ED after talking on the phone with
oncology.
He has been [**Location (un) 1131**] online and his conversations with oncology
earlier he believes that he likely has a new leukemia - he notes
that he appreciates people being very frank with him and not
glossing over anything. It is also very important to him to be
front and center in all the decision making and knowing results
in a timely fashion.
He is currently without pain, his complaints are fatigue, nausea
in the a.m., bp that was difficult to control and is now low,
easy bruising and nightime sweats times the last couple of
months.

CT-head non contrast [**2146-5-3**]
No mass lesion or gross bony abnormality to specifically suggest
IAC or
skull base pathology. If clinical concern remains, dedicated MRI
of the brain and IACs, with and without contrast, may be
performed for further evaluation.
.
Echo [**2146-5-5**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.

Head CT [**2146-5-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post left craniotomy and evacuation of left subdural
hematoma, with
expected changes at surgical bed.
2. Interval resolution of subfalcine and uncal herniation. Mild
remaining
rightward shift of midline structures measuring 5 mm.
3. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No subarachnoid hemorrhage.



Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo presented with new leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and
anemia. He ultimately had a diagnosis of AML.  His hospital
course was complicated by a subdural hematoma, evacuation of
hematoma, respiratory arrest, intubation, febrile neutropenia
and he expired on [**2146-5-21**] (see below).
.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 85007**] was found to have AML from Bone marrow biopsy on
[**5-4**].  On [**5-6**] he was noted to have acute AMS. STAT CT head
revealed new large left subdural hemorrhage, with significant
mass effect with subfalcine and uncal herniation. He
subsequently underwent emergent left craniotomy and evacuation
of left subdural hematoma. On [**5-7**] he was noted to be febrile to
101.8. He was placed on a Labetolol gtt with goal SBP < 140. He
was febrile again on [**5-8**]. On [**5-9**] his vital signs reflected a new
O2 requirement with 92-100/4L NC. On [**2146-5-12**] patient became more
and more confused and agitated, was thought to be not safe on
the floor,  requiring sedation for repeat head Ct.  Patient was
given 2 mg IV ativan to enable head CT, and 15 min later was
found to be unresponsive and hypoxic.  Code blue was called,
patient was hypoxic with sPO2 of 36 and pCO2 of 80, he had
palpable pulses through out the course of resiscitation with SBP
of 200. He was intubated and oxygenation improved with air bag
ventilation. Flumazenil was given with return of minimal degree
of spontaneous movement. He was transferred to the ICU for
stabilization and subsequently had emergent head CT which did
not show rebleed fro
