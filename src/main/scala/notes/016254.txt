History of Present Illness:
81 year old man with HTN, PUD, DM and CRI presented on [**2198-6-11**] to
[**Hospital3 **] with progressive shortness of breath, epigastric
fullness, chest pain and dysuria. His EKG showed Q waves V1-4
and STD laterally and initial Troponin-I was 0.85, which
subsequently bumped to 70.93 on next draw and then trended down
to 55.28 prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. His CXR and exam were also
found to be consistent with pulmonary edema (pt O2 sat 95% 3L)
and pt was diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix. He was noted to have a
UTI (+ E.Coli with unknown antimicrobial sensitivities) and
treated with a dose of 500 mg IV Levoquin (remained afebrile).
Also, his Cr on admission 2.5 (recent baseline apparently 1.6)
with a K 6.9. These were treated with Kayexalate, insulin,
calcium gluoncate and Lasix. The pt's home ACEi was held and his
repeat SCr this morning was 2.1.
.
Pt was reportedly loaded with 600 mg clopidogrel and started on
heparing and nitroglycerin gtts. Arrangments were made for
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was comfortable with stable
vitals, but was noted to have persistent wet crackles on lung
exam with a 4L NC oxygen requirement. Repeat CE were CK: 459
MB:19 MBI:4.1 Trop-T:5.27. As the nitro infusion rate was very
low, this was stopped and he was continued on heparin.
Integrelin was not started due to renal failure.
.
After several hours on the floor, the patient reported
experiencing recurrent [**2-13**] right chest pain (achy, pressure
sensation) while eating. This pain was identical to this
discomfort that caused him to present initially. An ECG was
remarkable for new 2 mm STE in V1 and 1 mm STE in V2, as well as
new inferior Q waves. A nitroglycerin gtt was restarted with
rapid resolution in the patient's symptoms. Repeat ECG once pain
free was remarkable for a new RBBB. Given the patient's
recurrent CP and dynamic ECG changes he was transferred to the
CCU for ongoing monitoring.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2198-6-14**]):    NO GROWTH.

OSH Urine Culture: E. Coli pansensitive

precordial
QRS voltage. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical
correlation is suggested.

[**6-13**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominanat system

revealed severe LM and 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had
diffues 90% stenosis involving the proximal LAD. Poor distal
filling of
the LAD was noted with R to L collaterals. The LCX was noted to
have
poor filling with one reasonable sized OM with a diffuse 80%
proximal
stenosis. The RCA was a large vessel with a proximal PDA 70%
stenosis in
a notably small vessel. The RPL had a 60% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic blood pressure.
There
was elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 16
mmHg. There
were elevated estimated left sided filling pressures with mean
PCWP of
18 mmHg. There was mild pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 30
mmHg.
3. Successful IABP placement.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful IABP placement.

[**6-14**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 3 vessel coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had a 90% stenosis. The proximal LAD had a 90%

stenosis and was diffusely diseased distally. The LCX was
diffusely
disease and the OM2 had an 80% mid vessel stenosis. The RCA was
not
engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressures with
good diastolic augmentation from the IABP.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA with a 3.0 x 28 mm
XIENCE
DES which was post dilated with a 4.0 x 12 mm NC balloon at 14
ATM.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, n
