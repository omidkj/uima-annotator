History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with a history of biliary obstruction due to
tumor with metal stents presenting to an OSH on [**1-3**] with an
episode of weakness/incontinence found to have polymicrobial
bacteremia/sepsis.  The patient was treated for a UTI on [**12-21**]
with Macrobid.  On [**2169-1-2**] she was being assisted to the
bathroom by her husband and became acutely weak and incontinent
of urine. She was taken to the OSH ED where she had a fever of
104 and a SBP in the 70s (per report).  Full ROS at OSH was
negative. Patient does not remember the episode and cannot
provide further history at this time.

No discharge summary or hospital course was provided by the OSH.
 From the provided data, her blood cultures from the OSH are
positive for E. coli, Klebsiella a 3rd GNR and GPC.  She was
treated initially with levofloxacin, but changed to Imipenim and
gentamicin with improvement in her clinical status.  A CT of the
abdomen demonstrated persistent biliary dilatation concerning
for stent obstruction. There were also questionable liver
lesions with decreased enhancement surrounded by increased
enhancement concerning for abscess.  She also developed AF with
RVR necessitating a diltiazem gtt.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2169-1-5**] for ERCP
evaluation of her metal biliary stents given CT findings.  She
is afebrile and clinically stable on transfer.

Currently, she complains of irritation by the Foley, but denies
headache, blurry vision, dry mouth, thirst, difficulty/pain with
swallowing, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
nausea, heartburn, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation (though notes no BM in 1 week), new weakness,
numbness or tingling.


Past Medical History:
-Biliary obstruction/malignant stricture s/p ERCP X 2 and 2

candidate.

OSH Micro:
[**2169-1-2**]: Blood culture-E. coli (Amp R, Cipro R, [**Last Name (un) **] Augmentin,
Aztreonam, Cefazolin, Cefoxitin, Ceftriaxone, fent, imipenem,
zosyn)
[**2169-1-2**]: Urine culture-negative
[**2169-1-2**]: Blood cluture: K. pneumonia, other GNR
[**2169-1-4**]: Blood culture: GNR, GPC
[**2169-1-4**]: Blood culture: GPC
[**2169-1-4**]: Sputum culture: Yeast

OSH studies:
1. CXR: vascular congestion in right upper lung, unchanged since
[**1-3**] without active lung disease.

2. CT abd/pelvis ([**1-3**]): double biliary stent catheter in place
with evidence of continued biliary obstruction throught the
liver--not improved. Liver shows areas of decreased enhancement
in posterior right lobe and in the anterior left lobe with no
definite mass effect seen suspicious for possibility of
infections at that site.  In the anteriormost portion of the
left lobe, a low area of decreased enhancement surrounded by
increaseed enhancement extend over a diameter of 2 cm which
could represent early formation of an abscess even though no
clear-cut abscess is definitely identified.  Spleen is
unremarkable. Large amount of retained stools in rectum
compatible with fecal impaction.

3. CT head without contrast: no actue abnormality identified,
sinus disease and left mastoiditis. Small vessel disease

ECGs:
[**1-2**]: Sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm with PACs, TWI in III, no ST
changes. Q waves in II/III/aVF
[**1-3**]: NSR, axis change from [**1-2**]
[**1-4**]: AF with RVR, maintained axis change from [**1-2**]
[**2169-1-5**]: NSR, normal axis (same as [**1-4**]), normal intervals, TWI
V1-V4 (new), biphasic T waves V5-V6, poor baseline d/t
Parkinson's tremor but otherwise, no ST changes.
.
Cardiac Echo [**2169-1-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal left and right ventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Evidence of elevated left sided
filling pressures.
.
ERCP [**2169-1-6**]:
Biliary Tree: There were multiple filling defect that appeared
like sludge in the upper third of the common bile duct, right
main hepatic duct and left main hepatic duct,within the metallic
wallstents.
Procedures: Multiple stone fragments and sludge were extracted
successfully using a 11 mm balloon.
Impression: Stent obstruction by stones and sludge was found -
stents were dredged using a balloon.
(stone extraction)
.

CXR for PICC placement:
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The left PICC terminates over
the mid
right atrium and can be pulled back 4 to 5 cm to the lower SVC.
The
nasogastric tube has been removed. The cardiomediastinal is
stable and within
normal limits. The lungs are clear.
.
LE Dopplers [**2169-1-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No DVT of the right lower extremity.
2. Probable thrombus of a deep vein of the left calf, likely one
of the
paired posterior tibial veins.

.

CT Abd [**2169-1-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary
enhancement
consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe,
multiple hypodense
collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
abscesses. The
largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable to
percutaneous
sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to catheter
drainage at its present size.
2. Vague region of parenchymal enhancement at the apex of
dilated ducts could represent obstructive tumor mass, but its
margins are difficult to define.
3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph
node.
5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein,
resulting in
heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the
liver.
6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While
it is too
small to characterize, findings suggest a c
