         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Pertinent Imaging:

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leafl
