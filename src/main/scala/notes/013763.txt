Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p VFib arrest, for pacemaker placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Defibrillator/Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
65 yo F w/ h/o dilated, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, transferred
from [**Hospital6 17183**] s/p VF arrest [**2-8**] thought [**1-4**]
aspiration in setting of an EF of 20-25% and mod-severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25783**]D placement.  Review of OSH reveals pt was at ENT office for
management otitis externa, suffered witnessed arrest, CPR
initiated with EMS giving 3 shocks, epi, atropine, and lido gtt
followed by amiodarone gtt. Admitted to OSH ICU, intubated,
treated for pulmonary edema and aspiration PNA w/zosyn (course
completed). Echo showed EF 20%, no AICD. Neurology was consulted
for hypoxic brain injury and she required NG tube placement for
feeds [**1-4**] mental status but was able to tolerate honey thickend
liquids/pureed diet at time of transfer.  Pt was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **]-V pacemaker/ICD placement.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology floor, the patient was
unable to recall the details of the events leading to her
hospital course.  She was continued on metoprolol, lasix 40mg
p.o to prevent volume overload in setting of low EF and dilated
cardiomyopathy.  Her outpatient cardiologist and PCP were
[**Name (NI) 653**] to attempt to obtain her most recent catheterization
records, but none were able to be located.  She received a
cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for scar, which showed effective LVEF of 28%.
Echo showed LVEF severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
.
Of note, she had been receiving oral ciprofloxacin for
management of otitis externa, which were started prior to [**2-8**]
although exact date unclear. She was switched to topical cipro
on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] as was having continued drainage. There is
some concern for QTc prolongation in the setting of prolonged
use of ciprofloxacin. In order to determine whether patient
suffered drug induced torsades de pointes which deteriorated
into VF, she was transferred to the CCU for ciprofloxacin
challenge.
.
The patient was given Ciprofloxacin in the CCU with a
prolongation of her QT but without reucrrence of VF.  QT
prolongation resolved by the following morning.  She underwent
electrical mapping in the EP lab on [**2-24**], where they were unable
to induce VT, and was transferred back to the floor to await her
ICD placement on [**2-25**].
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, or any other complaints.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient reports significant left ear and left facial pain
for the last several days associated with drainage and worse
with movement of the external ear.  Denies fevers/chills.
Pt also reports becoming "thinner" and losing weight in the past
several months but cannot quantify the amount of weight loss.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR ([**2118-2-17**]):  Negative for acute cardiopulmonary process
.
TTE ([**2118-2-18**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %). The left ventricle appears to contract
dyssynchronously. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac MRI ([**2118-2-18**]):
1. Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with abnormal
left
ventricular function. Severe hypokinesis in the basal to mid
interventricular septum with paradoxical motion and mild
hypokinesis in the remaining LV segments. The LVEF was
moderately decreased at 32%. The effective forward LVEF was
severely decreased at 28%. Resting myocardial perfusion images
suggestive of delayed perfusion in the inferior and inferoseptal
walls. There was a questionable focal area of hyper-enhancement
in the basal lateral wall consistent with myocardial fibrosis.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 59%.
3. Moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
5. Aortic atheroma.
