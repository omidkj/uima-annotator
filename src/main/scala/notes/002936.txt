Allergies:
Zocor / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breath for 5-6 months. Critical AS.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Core Valve placement
Endotracheal intubation
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a a very articulate [**Age over 90 **] year old [**Location 7972**] man
who has been in good health until the past two years when his
activity level has diminished. Over the past three months, he
had increasing dyspnea with exertion. He does not have chest
pain or syncope-presyncope but is limited to a few stairs or
walking across the room. His dyspnea resolves rapidly with rest.
He has not had PND, orthopnea, or other cardiovascular symptoms.
As part of assessment for percutaneous aortic valve therapy he
was found to have iliofemoral peripheral vascular disease. He
underwent stenting (x2 Bare Metal Stents) of his right iliac
artery on [**2113-3-2**], with excellent result. He was
discharged home on [**2113-3-3**] with VNA and has been doing well
since. He did complain of back pain to the VNA who sent a U/A
via his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was positive for a UTI (unknown bacteria) and pt
is on day [**3-25**] of Cephalexin. Able to ambulate only 20 steps
before has DOE causing him to rest. Also has incontinance at
baseline, uses pads at home.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. He does have DOE after 20 ft. He has had TIA s/p
stenting of left cartotid artery [**2105**].

Past Medical History:
1. Hypercholesterolemia
2. Recurrent UTIs ([**12-21**] Foley catheters), urinary incontinence
3. Left carotid stenting in [**2105**] due to a TIA with mild left eye
droop
4. Bilat Total hip replacement [**2106**]
5. Stage III chronic kidney disease
6. Essential Thrombocytopenia
7. Stage 3 CKD
8. Aortic valve stenosis with valve area 0.5 cm2
9. Hypertension
10. NYHA class III CHF

Social History:
He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 89789**] MA. He has much support at

home including daily nursing and home health aide from VNA of
[**Hospital3 **]. One son lives next door and is frequently over to see

him several times a day; another son is also in to visit several

times a day. He uses a cane and has not had any falls. He does
not have lifeline in the home but son states there is almost
someone there during the day but not at night. He will be
accompanied by his son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 6330**] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 89790**]. Uses a
walker at home. No history of falls.

.
ECHO ([**4-11**]): The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.There is severe aortic stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen, with a restricted posterior leaflet.There
is also a mitraal valve cleft bettween P1 and P2. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Post TAVI
There is 2+ aortic regurgitation.The regurgitation is
parvalvular,
2+ mitral regurgitation similar to preprocedure
No pericardial effusion is seen
LV function is preserved
.
ECHO ([**4-18**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets
appear normal. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. There are two small paravalvular aortic
regurgitation jets, together constituting no more than mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normally-functioning CoreValve aortic prosthesis.
Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional systolic function.
Severe pulmonary hypertension with dilated right ventricle and
mild global systolic dysfunction and moderate to severe
functional tricuspid regurgitation.

EKG ([**4-19**]): Sinus bradycardia
