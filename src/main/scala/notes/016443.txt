HPI: 28 yo woman with mental retardation, reactive airway
disease, DM, and severe kyphscoliosis with restrictive lung
disease, who presented to [**Hospital 58752**] Hospital with several days
of decreased POs and increased shortness of breath. She also had
2 wks of abd pain and facial swelling and was recently treated
with amoxicillin after tooth extraction. She was brought here as
CH had no ICU beds. ED she noted to have acute respiratory
distress with O2 sat in 70%s on RA with very poor air
movement.Received combivent/solumedrol/suc epi/IV mag/unasyn.
CXR w/ mid-lobe process. Initially placed on bipapwith some
improvement but pt still increased work of breathing. he was
intubated. She was intubated in ED. ABG 7.45/44/164->7.31/61/168

PE: CV: 3/6 SEM, decreased BS, deminished pulses throughout.

Labs from [**Hospital1 1926**]' CBC WNL (WBC 6, Hct 40s)plt 137), Chem
7(130/47/86/46/16/0.9), LFTs WNL, U/A unremarkable

Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure [**2-29**]
exacerbation of RAD, possible pneumonia, s/p intubation w/
improved with airwau resistence. Pressure controlled and
hemodyanmically stable

Brief ICU course: She was initially given ceftriaxone and
azithromax to cover possible community acquired pneumonia.  But
the CTA revealed a large embolus in the right pulmonary artery
for which heparin drip and coumadin were started.  Antibiotics
were stopped given no evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray.  She
was extubated the next day without much difficulty.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 28 yo woman with mental retardation, reactive airway and
restrictive lung dz, here with acute respiratory distress.

1. PE-unknown etiology.continue coumadin 7.5 hs. PTT within
therapeutic range. INR therapeutic and stable. She was
transitionined from heparin to coumadin as inpatient. SHe should
have hypercoagulable workup as outpatient once discharged.
.
2. Reactive airway disease-SHe had 1 episode of oxygen
desaturation + wheezing to 90% on RA but responded to solumedrol
x1 and BiPAP. She was put on prednisone at 40 daily for while
she was in the hospital and was to home with 20 mg daily). She
was continued on albuterol/atrovent nebs q4 + q2 prn. SHe was
setup for BiPAP and nebulizer at home

3. DM: H/O DM, increased BS likely [**2-29**] to steroids. Initially on
insulin drip for DKA but now on SSI.FS much improved in 100s.She
was continued initially on insulin sliding scale while she was
on steroids in the hospital.  She was continued on metformin
prior to discharge

4. Abd pain?/increased skin swelling-NO rebound and +BS is
reassuring for no acute abd sign. SHe had abdominal ultrasound
of suboptimal quality that showed on biliary obstruction. She
was continued on colace and lactulose prn.Her right sided
abdominal pain is likely due to referred pain from her pulmonary
embolism. Her pain slowly resided prior to discharge

5. HTN-Her blood pressure was stable on her home medication.
6. Facial swelling- unclear etiology. possible reaction
amoxicillin. No rash or other signs of anphylaxis. Resolved.
