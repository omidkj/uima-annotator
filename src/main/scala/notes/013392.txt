who was found to be more confused than her baseline.

On transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**], her

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratory evaluation revealed white blood cell count was 19,
hematocrit was 34, and platelets were 447.  INR was 8.2.
Chemistry panel was normal.  Serial creatine kinases and
troponin levels did not reveal a myocardial infarction.
Urinalysis revealed the presence of a urinary tract
infection.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram was
unremarkable.

A chest x-ray showed questionable right lower lobe opacity.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Anticoagulation was reversed.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
colonoscopy.

The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed some erosions in the
antrum with otherwise normal findings to the second part of
the duodenum.  The colonoscopy revealed multiple nonbleeding
diverticula with small openings in the sigmoid colon.  There
were large deep oozing ulcers in the rectum and the distal
sigmoid colon as well.  Cold forceps biopsies were performed,
and the results were pending at the time of this dictation.

The patient's hematocrit remained stable, and she was
transferred to the Medicine Service to continue treatment of
what was ultimately identified as a methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from her blood as well as
the right femoral vein catheter tip.  Following clearing of
her cultures, she had a percutaneously inserted central
catheter placed and shall complete a 10-day course of
vancomycin.  She remained afebrile.  Of note, she required
increasing doses of Fentanyl patch transdermally for pain
control.
