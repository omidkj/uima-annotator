Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Morphine Sulfate

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope, torsades de pointes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath and drug-eluting stent placement [**2112-10-17**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD secondary to DM and HTN,
CHF, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode. She had
been in her usual state of health until she began having
syncopal episodes about 1.5 weeks ago. Prior to today, she has
had 2 episodes of passing out for a few seconds, once at home
and once at her son's. Of note, she also felt lightheaded after
dialysis on Monday, which resolved later in the day with rest.
She denies any recent medication changes, except for switch to
Celexa from Lexapro more than 6 months ago.
.
This morning, patient had left in the morning around 6am for a
nephrology appointment at [**Hospital1 18**]. She felt well upon awakening
but had not eaten breakfast. She was sitting in the backseat of
the T Ride when she suddenly lost consciousness for [**11-10**]
minutes. Her daughter was with her at the time and did not note
any head trauma or shaking. Denies any chest pain, numbness or
tingling in her arms, palpitations, diaphoresis, or shortness of
breath prior to or after the syncope episode. Patient awoke in
the ambulance and was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On review of systems, patient has had TIA x 2 without residual
neuro deficits. S/he denies any prior history of stroke, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.  Positive for syncope and
lightheadedness.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 70s, BP 90s/50s, AF. EKG on
admission showed QT prolongation. Patient had torsades de
pointes x 2, lasting < 1 min each and was unresponsive. Prior to
torsades, she was eating lunch and felt slightly lightheaded.
Central line was placed in R femoral and Mag 5 mg IV was given.
Neuro was consulted and felt cause of syncope is unlikely
neurogenic given head CT that was negative for bleed and more
likely cardiac or from hypoperfusion.

.
EKG [**2112-10-12**]: NSR @ 60bpm, no ectopy, LAD, PRWP (new since
[**2111-3-25**]), normal PR and QRS intervals, QTc prolonged at 620ms,
no LVH, no ST elevations/depresions.
.
TELEMETRY:  Episodes of R on T and torsades noted on tele.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2112-10-13**]:
PA and lateral chest radiograph. The mildly enlarged
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again noted are aortic
calcifications, most prominent at the aortic knob. There is
interval removal of the dual-lumen dialysis catheter. The
pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged and increased
interstitial markings bilaterally are unchanged, compatible with
mild interstitial edema. There are no pleural effusions. The
lungs are otherwise grossly clear without new focal
consolidations. In the low thoracic spine there is an apparent
new anterior wedge deformity, which is not seen a year and a
half ago. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
2. Mild anterior wedge deformity in a low thoracic vertebral
body, new in the interval.
.
HEAD CT [**2112-10-13**]:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. No large
territorial infarct, edema or mass effect are noted. The midline
structures are normal. The ventricles and sulci are prominent,
compatible with age-appropriate atrophy. There is
periventricular and subcortical white matter disease, compatible
with chronic small vessel ischemia. Again noted is a punctate
calcific density in the right sylvian fissure, unchanged, and
may represent a calcified granuloma, sequela of prior
neurocysticercosis, or be vascular etiology. A non- aggressive-
appearing lucent lesion is unchanged in the left frontal bone,
previously thought to be a hemangioma.
There is significant calcification in the distal vertebral
arteries as well as the cavernous portions of the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
TTE [**2112-10-14**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive anterior, septal,
and apical akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mild
