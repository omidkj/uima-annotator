Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Simvastatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, left shoulder/neck pains

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization.
Angioplasty was performed of LCx stenosis.


History of Present Illness:
89 y/o F with PMHx of CAD s/p LAD stent and in '[**66**] she underwent
2x BMS stenting RCA and taxus stent to proximal RCA, CHF
(unknown EF), HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM-II and Paget's Disease who
was taken to [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] after developing left sided shoulder,
neck pain and dyspnea overnight. Pt recalled waking up to go to
the bathroom several times and became very short of breath. She
was having trouble breathing while lying flat and was
gasping/panicking per the family.
.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she was anxious, SOB and diaphoretic with a sinus
tachycardia to 120 range. She was given 325mg ASA and NTG SL
with resolution of her left neck/shoulder discomfort. She was
noted to have diffuse fluid overload on CXR and was given 40mg
IV lasix, 2mg morphine and placed on CPAP with a slow resolution
of her symptoms. Labs revealed a troponin of 0.09 and CK 138 and
CK-MB 9.1. Total lactate elevated slightly at 2.1.  Decision was
made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was chest pain free and her SOB was
markedly improved on CPAP. She was still having trouble
breathing with lying flat.  EKG showed ST depressions in V4-V6,
I and aVL. She was continued on heparin gtt and given 600mg load
of Plavix in ED in anticipation for late afternoon cardiac
catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, patient complained of CP and SOB while lying
flat.  O2 sat dropped to 87% on 4L.  She was given lasix, and
started on a nitro gtt. She felt better after the intervention.
Angioplasty was performed of LCx stenosis. RCA appeared totally
occluded and no intervention was performed. On arrival to the
CCU, pt was hypertensive, tachycardic and complaining of
worsening SOB.  She was placed on a NRB and given Atrovent nebs,
nitro gtt and Lasix 80mg IV.  Her tachypnea improved rapidly as
the BP came down and she was able to weaned from the NRB to 4L
NC.   She was denying any chest pain, nausea or lightheadedness.

.
On ROS, pt denies cough, congestion, fevers, chills, changes in
bladder habits, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain or lower
extremity edema.  She denies palpitations, lightheadedness or
chest pressure.

CXR ([**9-20**] at OSH):
AP portable sitting view of the chest. There are bilateral
extensive interstitial opacities with more alveolar-appearing
perihilar opacities, most consistent with severe pulmonary
edema. No large pleural effusions are seen. The heart shadow is
partially obscured. Aortic calcification is seen. Left basilar
retrocardiac opacity is likely related to the pulmonary edema,
although a superimposed consolidation could not be definitively
excluded.
.
CXR [**9-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary edema which is now moderate on a
background of probable emphysema. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
Echo [**9-21**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral akinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Moderate calcific aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
EKG [**2170-9-20**]: Sinus rhythm and frequent ventricular ectopy. ST
segment depression in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 which may represent
active ischemic process
.
Cardiac catheterization report 10/8/9:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
60%
stenosis at the origin.  The LAD had a 40% stenosis at the mid
segment
and otherwise no angiographically apparent flow limiting
disease.  The
LCX had a 95% stenosis at the proximal segment and a 70%
stenosis at the
mid segement.  The RCA was occluded proximally with left to
right
collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg), severe pulmonary hypertension (PA
64/31 mm
Hg), elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 35 mm Hg), low
cardiac
index (cardiac index 2.1 l/min/m2), and systemic systolic
hypertension
(central aortic pressure 161/85 mm Hg).
3. Successful POBA of the LCX with a 2.5x12mm Voyager balloon.
Final
angiography revealed minimal residue stenoses, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
4. The procedure was complicated with transient hemodynamic
instability
due to damping of guide in the LMCA with resultant hypotension,
chest
pain and hypoxia that resolved with guide removal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca. PTCA of
vessel.

Brief Hospital Course:
89-yo woman with h/o multi-vessel CAD with multiple stents from
[**2166**], CHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM-II who was taken to [**Location (un) 620**]
[**Hospital1 18**] after developing left sided shoulder/neck pain and dyspnea
overnight, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization due to
concern for NSTEMI.
Due to the NSTEMI, the patient was taken to the cardiac cath lab
on [**9-20**]/9. Please see below for the cath report details. During
this procedure the patient developed an acute exacerbation of
worsening CHF, with respiratory distress and chest pain. The
patient was made chest pain free and through lasix and oxygen
the patient's respiratory distress resolved shortly after
arriving in the CCU. Following this episode, the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course consisted prim
