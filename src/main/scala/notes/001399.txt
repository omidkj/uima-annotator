Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial Fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
failed electrical cardioverion for atrial fibrillation
lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
63M with metastatic esophageal cancer. Went out for newspaper
today, tripped on side walk and fell. Came to ED for evaluation
of head lac and knee pain. All trauma films negative except for
small hematoma. Pt cleared to be discharged. Got up to go to the
bathroom and heart rate jumped to 200s. Received 6mg, then 12mg
of adenosine without termination, then IV Dilt 10mg x2. SBP
dropped from 140 to 80. Temp to 102 with rigors. 150mg amio and
SBP now down to 75. Then attempted cardioversion first at 200J,
then 250J without success. An additional 150mg of amio was
given. He was then started on neo for low BP and given 250mg
digoxin. Pt converted to sinus rhythm 10 minutes later and BP
came up to 126/53. He was given a total of 5L NS and maintained
on a neo gtt. His HCT at the time of admission was 24.5, no
other lab values were available for comparison. Pt had a CT scan
to rule out PE that was negative for clot but did show COPD and
peripheral nodular consolidations. He was also noted to have a
temp of 101.3. Got Tylenol in the ED. CT abd/pel no hematoma or
free air.
.
On arrival to the floor, vitals 97.9 68 120/75 20 98% on 2L. Pt
initially on neo but able to discontinue immediately with stable
blood pressures. Pt unable to provide detailed history. Oriented
x2. Complains of productive cough, sore throat, belly pain and
some numbness on the medial plantar surface of his left foot,
unchanged from baseline.

.
CTA Chest - 1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Peripheral opacities are nonspecific with a differential that
includes
atypical or less likley eosinophilic pneumonia or BOOP/COP.
3. Right upper lobe pulmonary nodules are concering for
metastatic disease.
4. Moderate emphysematous changes.
.
CT abd/pel - 1. Satisfactory PEG position.
2. No hematoma or free air.
3. Low density renal lesion may represent cyst or neoplasm.
Further
characterization (perhaps with ultrasound) recommended.
.
Knee XR - No traumatic injury identified in either knee. There
is no
significant underlying degenerative joint disease.

CT Neck - 1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Multilevel moderate-to-severe degenerative change, with canal
narrowing at C4-C6. In this setting, there is increased risk for
ligamentous and cord injury, and MRI is more sensitive for these
entities.
3. Emphysema.
4. Thyroid lesion. Please correlate with clinical exam and
biochemical
profile. If indicated, consider US for further evaluation.
.
CT Head - 1. Left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
2. No fracture or other site of hemorrhage.

[**2192-2-24**] Carotid ultrasound:
There is minimal diffuse wall thickening in some areas of
calcific plaque
involving both carotid systems. The peak systolic velocities on
the right are 53, 60, 69, 100, and 88 cm/sec for the proximal,
mid, and distal ICA and CCA and ECA respectively. Similar values
on the left are 76, 66, 66, 91, and 100 cm/sec. There is
antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries. The ICA/CCA
ratios are within the normal range. IMPRESSION: No significant
ICA or CCA stenosis bilaterally.

The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
63M with metastatic esophageal cancer who initially presented
after falling and went into afib as he was leaving the hospital.
In the setting of heart rate of 160s drop SBP to 80. After
adenosine x2, dilt x2, cardioversion x2 and dig, pt converted to
sinus and blood pressure responded. He was transferred to the
floor on neo which was promptly discontinued on arrival to the
floor and the patient maintained his BP in the 120. Patient
received LP for question of altered mental status, but waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] at baseline despite normal electrolytes and no
evidence of brain mets.

Atrial Fibrillation - now in sinus rhythm, s/p adenosine x2,
dilt x 2, amio bolus x2, cardioversion x2 then dig. Patient was
placed on amino drip for 48 hours and d/c with dilt PO daily.
PCP/HEM/ONC TO DETERMINE RISKS/BENEFITS OF ANTICOAGULATION

Community acquired [**Name (NI) **] Pt spike temp in setting of new
tachycardia. Has had productive cough x1 day and now altered
mental status. Intially was treated empirically for hospital
acquired PNA and meningitis, will go with vanc, ceftriaxone, and
ampicillin. From clnical picture, CTA chest, will treat as CAP
with 5d course of azithromycin. No flouroquinonlone because of
seizure history in the setting of wellbutrin. Cultures negative
at the time of discharge.

Anemia - HCT on admission 24, down to 22 following 5L of fluid.
Do not know baseline. Though patient has esophageal cancer, this
is lower than would be expected. CT no eveidence of bleeding in
Head/C/A/P. INR 1.5. Unknown if on anticoagulation at baseline.
Transfused 1 u pRBCs

Hypotension - Resolved. Likely [**1-16**] tachycardia.
.
Esophageal Cancer - s/p radiation on [**2-15**]. Extent of mets
unknown.  Patient has care at [**Hospital1 2177**], patient is NPO, has G-tube
for feeds. Pain management as outpatient regimen, since there is
no change in
