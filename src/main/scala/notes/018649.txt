Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 104311**] is a 66 year-old
gentleman with a long standing history of diabetes, end stage
renal disease and an extensive coronary artery disease who
presents to the hospital with shortness of breath.  He has
been in his usual state of health until five days ago when he
had acute onset of shortness of breath that progressively
worsened.  He denies any chest pain, fevers or chills, or any
other associated symptoms.  He is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service on [**2187-1-15**] and there is shortness of breath was
improved with hemodialysis, but ruled in for a non Q wave
myocardial infarction with a troponin if 13, normal CK.

He went to the catheterization laboratory this afternoon for
intervention.  In the cardiac catheterization laboratory he
was noted to have three vessel disease with occlusion of two
saphenous vein, with occlusion of his venous graft, which is
new from 8/[**2184**].  His EF was noted to be only 15%.  This is
his left ventricular ejection fraction.  His left internal
mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery was patent with extensive collateral left and right.
His left circumflex and right coronary artery were diffusely
diseased. The left circumflex was difficult to intervene upon
due to difficulty engaging the vessel, but ultimately
received a stent.  During the procedure the patient had
several episodes of ventricular tachycardia that was
responsive to cardiac massage on at least one instance.  He
was started on Dopamine drip at the cardiac catheterization
laboratory at the end of the procedure for a systolic blood
pressure in the low 80s.  The patient arrived in the Coronary
Care Unit hemodynamically stable, tachycardic to 110 and
sedated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes type 2 insulin dependent.
2.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, with placement
of an AV fistula in the right forearm in [**2186-6-11**].  3.
Hypertension.  4.  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2185-6-11**], (left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal) as well as implantation of an AICD in [**2185-7-12**] for syncope and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  5.  History of central line infection times two
as described previously.  6.  Cholecystectomy.  7.
Appendectomy.  8.  Status post left fourth metatarsal
debridement in [**2186-3-12**].

MEDICATIONS:  Zestril 20 mg Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and
Sunday.  NPH sliding scale, Lipitor 5 mg po q.d., Lopresor
12.5 mg Tuesdays, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Nephrocaps
one tab po q.d., Neurontin 200 mg po q.d., Phos-Lo three tabs
po t.i.d., Renagel 800 mg po t.i.d., Avandia 8 mg po q.h.s.,
Quinine 325 mg q.h.s. and q noon on days of hemodialysis.
Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.  A heparin drip was
started on the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  Protonix
40 mg q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had a cerebrovascular accident at the
age of 69.  He also had diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a less then one pack per day smoking
history for at least thirty five years.  He quit fifteen
years ago.  He denies any alcohol use.  He is divorced.  He
lives with his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired salesman.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 88/48 on 5 mg of
Dopamine.  Pulse 118.  Respiratory rate 16.  Sating 91% on 5
liters nasal cannula.  In general, he was sedated.  He
appears comfortable.  He is an obese elderly man.  HEENT
pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclera
anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.  Respiratory clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen soft and
benign.  Extremities good peripheral pulses.  Right groin
sheath in place.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8.3, hematocrit 34.9,
platelets 213.  Chem 7 sodium 140, potassium 3.7, chloride
96, bicarb 27, BUN 52, creatinine 9.3, glucose 97, PT 13, PTT
33, INR 1.3.  Arterial blood gas, pH was 7.50, PCO2 34, PAO2
was 84, CK 98, troponin 13.4, bilirubin 3.7, calcium 9.1,
phos 4.9, mag 1.9, B-12 [**2137**].  Electrocardiogram revealed
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 114, first degree AV block,
normal axis, right bundle branch block, lateral ST
depressions.  Chest x-ray revealed an interval increase in
cardiac shadow with a small pleural effusion suggestive of
congestive heart failure.  No infiltrates were identified.
PA pressures on catheterization were 45/30.  His pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 25 to 30.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient did fine until early the next
morning where he developed progressive shortness of breath.
Arterial blood gases was obtained, which revealed that the
patient was severely acidotic.  A chem 7 later on revealed
that ............... metabolic.  As respiratory therapy was
called to intubate the patient emergently, the patient became
apneic and pulseless.  His electroencephalogram tracing on
the defibrillator revealed that the patient was in
ventricular tachycardia, which transformed into ventricular
fibrillation.  A code was called and the patient was
immediately defibrillated with no conversion from VF.  CPR
was initiated and the patient was given pharmacotherapy
according to standard HCL protocol with no success in
improving the patient's condition.  After over thirty minutes
of trying to aggressively resuscitate the patient he was
pronounced dead at 7:00 a.m. on [**2187-1-17**].  The patient's family
was notified and they declined an autopsy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
4.  Hypertension.
