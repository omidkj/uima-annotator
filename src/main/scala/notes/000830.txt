LENIs: Using linear probe, [**Doctor Last Name 352**] scale and color Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal vessels were performed bilaterally. Study is limited
by large body habitus. Allowing for limitations, there is no
intraluminal thrombus. Vessels demonstrate normal flow,
compressibility, respiratory variability, and augmentation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 29 yo legally blind female with h/o asthma and
anxiety presenting with respiratory distress.
.
1. Shortness of breath: the patient was treated for an asthma
flare with immediate improvement in her peak flow, symptoms and
oxygen requirement.  There was a strong anxiety component to her
presentation.  After obtaining [**Hospital1 112**] records, we learned that the
patient also has paradoxical vocal cord motion and
severe/difficult to control GERD which are also contributing to
her presentation.  The patient had negative LENIs and a d-dimer
of 515.  The patient was discharged to complete a 2 week steroid
taper and with the addition of Singuair to her outpatient
regimen of Advair, Albuterol, Flovent, Rhinocort, and Xolair. We
recommended she follow up with her Pulmonologist and ENT.  She
was to complete a 10 day course of Amoxicillin for sinusitis.
.
2. Tachycardia: related to anxiety and albuterol. Quickly
improved with spacing out nebulizer treatments.  Negative LENIs
and no clinical evidence or history of PE or cardiac pathology.
.
4. GERD: continued on protonix and famotidine. The patient has
an outpatient pH monitoring soon for further evaluation of this
chronic problem.
.
5. Iron deficiency anemia-continue patient on ferrous sulfate
.
6.  Respiratory alkalosis- 1) partially compensated primary
respiratory alkalosis, or (2) acute superimposed on chronic
Primary Respiratory Alkalosis, or (3) mixed acute respiratory
alkalosis with a small metabolic acidosis. Pt appears to be a
chronic hyperventilator given anxiety.
.
7. fibromyalgia/ptsd- cont nsaids, celexa. Ativan given in house
with good effect.
.
8. Hospital:
-prophylaxis: sq heparin, ppi/h2 blocker
-code: full
-disposition: discharged home to complete 2 week steroid taper.
She will need PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 17329**] and ENT follow up.
