History of Present Illness:
86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib (now on
warfarin), stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra
(previously seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 619**]. atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin. who presents with left ear pain. He
presented to the OSH ED ([**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**]) 1wk PTA with CC: ear pain.
He was sent home with Dx of cerumen in external canal. His ear
pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) 621**] gtt
for presumed otitis externa. Per his son, he developed
progressive confusion and imbalance. He became unable to walk,
and became more somnolent.

He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] in the evening of [**2158-2-13**]
(1d
prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to
102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized
with
1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence. His WBC was
elevated at 14.9. INR was 3.3. Dig 0.84. Troponin negative. UA
"negative" and CBC/BMP/LFTs reportedly unremarkable/wnl. A NCHCT
showed *Left mastoiditis*. He was given a dose of IV Zosyn. ENT
was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the
following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis
Tx. He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance
from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the
morning.

However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**2157-2-14**]), the
patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop.
He
was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] (from his home dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **]). He
was
intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off. His
post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all
four
extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability. A Neurologist
there saw the patient, but his notes are not immediately
available to me. His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a
very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the
posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone). There
was
also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa
(which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on
reviewing the images I think this is an overcall). Finally,
there
was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks
old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in [**2156**] on OSH
workup in [**State 622**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH,
below).

The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of
an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe (despite a lack of
any
evidence for this on the NCHCT), and held his warfarin, which
was
a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the
time of 3.7. After discussing the case with a Neurologist here
at
[**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy
with vitamin K or FFP. They continued his statin.

Regarding his infectious and other general medical
workup/treatment, he had [**4-17**] BCx bottles return positive for GPC
in pairs. The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics. A TTE was
obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did
not show valvular vegitations, but did show several
thickened/diseased valves. TEE was considered, but not done. He
was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and
urine was dark on arrival here). He was continued on his digoxin
(level y/d was 0.86), and his home BB and CCB were held. He was
doing just find on MV/CMV with ABG of 7.39/35/174 and an
unremarkable CXR. They did not start tube feeds.


Past Medical History:
  1.  Hypertension, on CCB/BB
  2.  Hyperlipidemia, on statin
  3.  Atrial fibrillation, lonstanding, now on warfarin (started
[**2157-12-6**], see OMR Cardiology note)
  4.  h/o stroke seen on MRI at OSH (in [**State 622**], on
presentation
for stroke, see below) > or = 2y ago, details unknown to me at
this point other than an OSH MRI from [**2156**] showed an "old
stroke," which seems like the most likely culprit for his
subsequent memory deficits and the seizure in [**2-/2156**] (and now)
and the old Right-temporal abnormality seen on HCT at the OSH.
  5.  Seizure disorder -- first seen by a Neurologist in clinic
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 623**] here @[**Hospital1 18**] in early [**2156**], seen two
subsequent times through 9/[**2156**]. Initially presented to OSH in
[**State 622**] with first-ever seizure [**2156-3-1**] ([**Hospital 624**] hospital in
[**Location (un) 625**], VA; had been visiting his son) -- a GTC x 30-45min and
post-ictal [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 555**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 167**]-hemiparesis, which resolved; reportedly
negative MRI, echo, and EEG at the OSH, and a normal EEG here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. See OMR for details. Although he was on 750mg [**Hospital1 **] of
Keppra as of the last clinic note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. in [**2156**], the
transfer admission from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] [**2-13**] today says that he was
only taking a very small dose of this AED at home, 250mg [**Hospital1 **].
  6.  "memory issues" since the stroke/seizure in [**2156**].
  7.  CAD s/p 3v CABG [**2143**]
  8.  h/o SBO after knee surgery, details unknown to me at this
point
  9.  h/o "knee surgeries" (R-knee replacement)
  10.  "hay fever", on daily diphenhydramine at home for qAM
rhinorrhea (per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**] [**2158-2-13**])
  11.  h/o Depression, details unknown at this time (of note,
wife died in [**2156**] after stroke, cancer).
  12.  h/o partial bowel resection (?no cancer found), temporary
colostomy, reconnected; details unknown to me at this time, now
c/b chronic diarrhea 2-3x per day.
  13.  h/o prostate cancer s/p XRT, details unknown to me at
this
time
  14.  unsteady gait, walked with cane at home
