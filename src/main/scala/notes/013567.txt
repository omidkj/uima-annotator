CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-11-10**] 12:13 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p dht placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 y/o man s/p Redo CABG/Repair Ascending Aorta Graft
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p dht placement
PORTABLE CHEST ON [**11-10**].

INDICATION: Postop as above. Status post Dobbhoff tube
placement.

FINDINGS: Compared with 11/20 at 12:27 p.m., a Dobbhoff tube is
now present with its tip overlying the mid gastric region.
Tracheostomy and right PICC line are grossly unchanged in
position.

Other findings are grossly unchanged.

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Left ventricular function. ?Pericardial effusion
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 149
BSA (m2): 1.84 m2
BP (mm Hg): 115/65
HR (bpm): 75
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2139-11-2**] at 15:00
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2006W000-0:00
Test Location: West SICU/CTIC/VICU
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% to 65% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Large left pleural effusion is seen.
This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2139-7-1**].


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free wall
hypokinesis.
Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure/volume overload.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is mild global
right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A
bileaflet aortic
valve prosthesis is present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2139-7-1**], RV function is now depressed.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion is seen.





Brief Hospital Course:
Taken to the OR urgently for re-do sternotomy, repair of leaking
aorta, re-do CABG on [**2139-10-14**].  Please see operative summary for
details.  Transfused multiple units of blood products. Post-op
day #1, continued with significant coagulopathy, bleeding,
returned to OR on [**10-15**] for mediastinal exploration.  Nephrology
was consulted for low urine output, resolved over next few days
with diuretics.
Required milrinone, amiodarone, vasopressin, levophed drips
which were weaned off during the first week post-op.  He was
extremely agitated, requiring sedation.  He was slow to wean
from the ventilator initially felt to be due to fluid overload.
He failed extubation quickly due to tachypnea & hypoxia.
Subsequent bronchoscopy revealed significant tracheomalacia.  He
was treated with IV atibiotics for tracheobronchitis (with
negative final cultures). He ultimately underwent tracheostomy
om [**2139-10-23**] for inability to wean from ventilator & protect his
airway.  He has weaned to minimal ventilator support, but still
requires some PSV at night due to tachypnea.  He has also
tolerated short periods with a Passey Muir valve.
His rhythm has been AFib/flutter with a controlled ventricular
response.  He is being anticoagulated for his mechanical valve,
and is tolerating the AF from a hemodynamic standpoint.  His
creatinine peaked at 2.9, and is now down to 1.9 which has been
stable for many days.  He has a continued need for diuresis, but
is being given Edecrin on an "as needed" basis, depending on his
fluid status, BUN & creatinine.  He was on Bumex at times during
his post-op course as well.  He was started on Flomax due to
inability to void.  His Foley remains in place upon discharge.
