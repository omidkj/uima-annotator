History of Present Illness:
The patient describes progressive dyspnea on exertion since
[**2184-10-14**]. On approximately [**2185-3-7**] the patient awoke with
severe respiratory distress. He went to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he
was noted to be diaphoretic, tachypneic to 26 in obvious
distress with audible rales throughout his lung fields. Vitals
at that time were 96.3 120 156/88 26 with ABG 7.29/47/278. EKG
revealed sinus tachycardia with 1-2mm ST elevations in V1-4 new
from prior. CXR revealed pulmonary vascular congestion. The
patient received furosemide (40mg IV), nitropaste (1in) and
morphine (4mg IV) and was rapidly intubated. The patient
subsequently received metoprolol, aspirin and [**Hospital3 4532**] load. He
also received ceftriaxone (1g) and azithromycin (500mg) for a
question of a right sided infiltrate on CXR.
.
The patent was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2185-3-8**]. The patient was
continued on aspirin, [**Month/Day/Year 4532**], beta-blocker and was started on
heparin. His cardiac enzymes (by verbal report) were modestly
elevated. The patient was noted to be in acute on chronic renal
failure with Cr 5.5 up from baseline 3.4. The patient underwent
TTE revealing a thin, scarred anterior wall suggestive more of
an old infarct with chronic sequelae. Given the correlation
between this chronic area of change and the geographic
distribution of EKG changes this was felt to potentially
represent an old ischemic change. Given the severity of renal
dysfunction, the decision was made to defer cardiac
catheterization rather than risk the remaining renal function.
The patient was continued on heparin for 48 hours. The patient's
blood pressure and volume status was optimized. Initially that
patient EF was estimated at 20% by echo, though repeat study
prior to transfer revealed improvement to 30%.
.
The patient's respiratory status improved dramatically with
diuresis. He was extubated on [**2185-3-9**] and at the time of
discharge the patient is saturating well on room air. The day
after extubation, the patient developed a fever to 103,
leukocytosis and had persistent CXR findings suggestive of a
right sided consolidation. The Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin
initially started at [**Hospital3 3583**] had been discontinued but
at this time were reinstituted for treatment of presumed
community acquired pneumonia (effectively, day 1 antibiotic
therapy [**2185-3-9**]). The patient was also noted to have bilateral
small, layering effusions on chest x-ray.
.
The patient's renal dysfunction was profound (Cr 5.5 up from
baseline 3.4) and he had hyperkalemia on admission to 6.9. The
renal consult team was involved in the patient's care at [**Hospital1 2177**].
They felt he did not necessitate dialysis. His hyperkalemia
resolved however his Cr is persistently >5 at the time of
transfer. The decision was made to defer cardiac cath or
possible CABG if possible until the patient is dialysis
dependent.

with severely reduced systolic function. Inferior and
inferolateral walls move normally at the base and are
hypokinetic at mid level. The base of the anterior wall, lateral
wall and anterior septum are akinetic. LVEF 20%. RV is normal in
size with apical hypokinesis and normal overall systolic
function. Mild LA enlargement. Trace MR and trace TR. IVC is
dilated with blunted respirophasic variation.
