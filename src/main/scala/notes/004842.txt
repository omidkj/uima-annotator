CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: lead placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman s/p dual chamber pacemaker
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
lead placement
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: S/P dual-chamber pacemaker.

Comparison is made with prior study, [**2143-4-16**].

New left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the standard
position in the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild
cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions
with associated bibasilar atelectases are unchanged. There is
engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without overt CHF.
Patient is post median sternotomy. There is no pneumothorax.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**1-30**]+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: Patient is AV-Paced, on no infusions. Well seated
aortic and mitral prostheses are seen with no AI, no MR and no
perivalvular leaks. Residual mean aortic valve gradient is 9,
mitral is 7. Good biventricular systolic fxn. Aorta intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent extensive cardiac
surgical evaluation. Cardiac catheterization confirmed aortic
stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography showed
single vessel coronary artery disease. Other workup included
transthoracic echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound and vein
mapping which showed suitable greater saphenous vein. Please see
result section for more extensive findings of the above studies.
Her preoperative course was otherwise uneventful. She remained
stable on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for
surgery. On [**4-8**], she underwent aortic and mitral valve
replacements along with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
For surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative
note. Given her inpatient hospital stay was gr
