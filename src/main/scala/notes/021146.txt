EKG demonstrated NSR, PR >200 ms, LVH, ST dep V2-5, II with no
prior for comparison.
.
CXR
1. Mild cardiomegaly and very mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

2. Vague opacity within the right lower lung zone may be
secondary to edema although an early consolidation cannot be
completely excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
 CAD:  Patient w/ hx of CAD w/ PCI w/ placement of BMS to RCA
and LCx in [**2117**] in NY, who presented w/ complaints of chest
pressure and elevation of cardiac enzymes.  EKG showed diffuse
ST depressions w/ LVH, which at this time was believed to be due
heart strain in the setting of fluid overload with elevation of
troponint to 0.02 and CK to 80.  Enzymes continued to rise, with
peak of CK to 211, and patient was started on
integrillin/heparin complicated by bleeding from hemmeroids.
Anticoagulation was continued, by ASA and plavix were continued.
 Patient underwent RHC/LHC.  Angiography revaeled a calcified
60% LMCA
disease and origin heavily calcified LAD 80% lesion.   Cypher
was then deployed in the LMCA into LAD at 16 atms jailing the
LCX but not compromising flow.   The procedure was without
complication.
.
Pump:  Patient was with JVD to mandible and crackles to mid
lungs on exam.  Patient underwent diursis with improvment of
dyspnea and above physcial exam findings.  Unclear if heart
failure symptoms more secondary to valve abnormalities or acute
ischemia.  Pre-procedure echo showed moderate aortic stenosis,
moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global
biventricular systolic function, and moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension.
.
HTN:  Patient's BP meds were adjusted over the course of the
hospitalization, due to elevation of sbp to 170s.  Patient
discharged on HCTZ 25mg, Toprol XL 75mg, Ramipril 10mg, and
Norvasc 10mg.   Pressures currently well controlled.  Follow up
labs scheduled for week after dischare to evaluate after
starting HCTZ prior to discharge.

DM:  Patient with history of DM.  Continued home meds over
hospitalization.  Discharged with continued plan of VNA services
as done prior to hospitalization.
