Brief Hospital Course:
48 F with anxiety, tobacco and (+) FH p/w 5 days of chest pain,
s/p stenting of RCA mid TO.

* STEMI - On presentation to OSH, pt had EKG with ST elevations
in inferior leads with reciprocal depressions and was thus
transferred for urgent catheterization after receiving ASA,
beta-blocker, Plavix loading dose, heparin bolus and drip and
integrilin bolus and drip. Her cardiac enzymes at that time were
at their peak CPK of 167 and Troponin I of 17.02. She was later
found to have peaked in her Trop T as well at 2.62.

In the cath lab, patient was HD stable with CI 3.09, mean RA
pressure 18, PCWP 31, PA mean 31.  She was found to have right
dominant system, with LMCA 50% ostium, LAD 30% mid, LCX normal,
RCA 50% ostium, 100% mid with left-to-right collaterals.  DES
placed to mid RCA. Hemodynamics were consistent with RV
ischemia/infarction physiology.

She was transferred to CCU for HD monitoring were she continued
to be comfortable, denying chest pain, shortness or breath or
nausea. She did occasionally report some anxiety relieved by
anxiolytics and not associated with any EKG changes.

Given the fact that pt had reported 5 days of chest pain,
troponin>CK elevation, and Q-waves on presentation, pt's STEMI
was thought to be presenting late in the course of her ischemia
and thus was predicted to recover function of the right
ventricle but not likely substantial function of the inferior
left ventricular wall.  Cath lab and echocardiogram findings
confirmed RV failure.  In spite of previous reported negative
stress test, collaterals were thought to suggest longstanding
angina, which may have been attributed to panic attacks in the
past.

Pt was treated with ASA, metoprolol, plavix, high dose statin,
and eventual addition of ACE inhibitor. She also received 18 hr
integralin which she tolerated well. She had no furthur
complications including mechanical, arrhythmic or pain related.

* ANXIETY DISORDER - Pt had appropriate level of anxiety in
context of longstanding personal and family history. She was
treated with minimal PRN ativan.

* TOBACCO USE - Pt and pt's husband were counseled on the
importance of smoking cessation.

* GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE - Pt was continued on home
omeprazole.
- continue omeprazole
