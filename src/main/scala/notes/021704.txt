HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47-year-old
male who presented to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Emergency Room complaining of fevers, chills, nausea,
and epistaxis.  He has a history of HIV since [**2160**] with the
last CD4 count of 456, viral load 299 in [**2171-4-23**] but
continues highly active antiretroviral therapy but has poor
follow-up, hepatitis C, and asthma, who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] one day after presenting to
[**Hospital1 2025**] with complaints of five episodes of epistaxis in a single
day, feverish feeling, chills, nausea, sore throat with
dysphagia, and whole body aches for one to two days.

He was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**]
for further care.  He denied any recent illness, sick
contacts, cough, urinary symptoms, headache, neck stiffness,
or photophobia.  He felt well up until two to three days ago.
He denied any vomiting.  In the Emergency Department, he had
a fever to 102.5, heart rate 126, blood pressure 97/46,
respiratory rate 22, 02 saturations 98% on presentation.  He
had an ill appearance on examination and nonblanching
petechiae on bilateral forearms.  He underwent a workup for
sources of infection including a lumbar puncture that was
suggestive of meningitis.  He was started on empiric coverage
for the same.

He subsequently developed hypotension requiring pressor
support in addition to IV fluid hydration for which he was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
102.5, heart rate 120s, blood pressure 90s/40s, respiratory
rate 15-20, SA02 97% on room air.  General:  The patient was
in moderate distress, dishevelled appearing male.  HEENT:
Pupils equally round and reactive.  The extraocular movements
were intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The oropharynx was
clear with some evidence of thrush.  No stiff neck.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm but tachycardiac, normal S1,
S2.  No murmurs.  Lungs:  Faint rales at the left base,
otherwise clear.  Abdomen:  Soft, diffusely tender, no
rebound or guarding, decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities:
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin:  Petechiae in the
bilateral upper and lower extremities and chest.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.2, hematocrit 36,
platelets 118,000, MCV 96.  Sodium 128, potassium 3.6,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 17, BUN 15, creatinine 1.5, glucose
101.  The differential on the white count was 55%
neutrophils, 20% bands, 15% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 3%
atypicals, 3% metas, 1% myelos.  The urinalysis was dark,
slightly hazy, positive nitrates, faint leukocyte esterase,
[**6-1**] white blood cells, [**6-1**] red blood cells.  CSF tube
number four revealed 26 white blood cells of which 86% were
polys, 14% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, red blood cells 54.
Gram's stain was negative for micro-organisms or PMNs.  The
fluid culture was pending.  CSF protein was 59, glucose 50.
ABG revealed a pH of 7.37, PC02 22, PA02 107, unknown what
oxygen level this was at.  Lactate 4.3.

The chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.  Central
bronchial cuffing, pneumonitis versus viral bronchitis was
seen, however.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2172-12-22**] for meningitis with
sepsis.  He was subsequently intubated overnight for airway
protection in the setting of altered mental status and
combativeness requiring increasing sedation.  He had a
noncontrast head CT showing mild thickening of the ethmoid
and sphenoid sinuses, globular density in the inferior
maximal shyness, mild amount of ascites on the abdominal
scan.

The remainder of the hospital course was notable as follows.

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  A.  Meningitis:  The patient was
initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover a
wide variety of organisms that could be responsible for
meningitis in an immunocompromised host.  This included
ampicillin to cover Listeria, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin.
He was also given Decadron.  Subsequent blood cultures from
[**Hospital1 2025**] drawn on the day prior revealed meningococcemia, after
which his antibiotic regimen was tapered down to penicillin
for a 14 day course.  He completed his 14 day course and
received a one-time dose of oral ciprofloxacin on the advise
of the Infectious Disease team to try to eradicate possible
nasal carriage of the organism.

B.  Oral HSV:  The patient developed oral HSV lesions which
were treated with topical acyclovir.

C.  Fevers/possible ventilator-acquired pneumonia:  The
patient subsequently developed recurrent fevers while in the
ICU and had some chest x-ray findings on workup of the source
that suggested possible right lower lobe pneumonia.  He
underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed some erythema of the
airways and bronchoalveolar lavage that on Gram's stain
showed a predominance of gram-negative rods.  He was started
on ceftazidime for empiric therapy of presumed
ventilator-associated pneumonia.  The bronchoalveolar lavage
cultures were subsequently found to have multiple microbes
consistent with oropharyngeal flora.  He is continuing
ceftazidime currently through the 16th to complete a seven
day course.

D.  HIV:  The patient continued his highly active
antiretroviral therapy and continues to tolerate it well with
no further issues.

E.  Oral esophageal thrush:  The patient was continued on
Diflucan, particularly in light of being on broad spectrum
antibiotics during his hospital stay.  He continues on
Diflucan currently with no signs of thrush.  This can be
reevaluated once he is finished with his IV antibiotic
therapy.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  Congestive heart failure:  The
patient had hypotension during his ICU stay and a great deal
of IV fluids were given to him in attempts to volume
resuscitate him in the setting of meningococcal sepsis.  He
underwent an echocardiogram which revealed a depressed
ejection fraction with right ventricular hypokinesis
diffusely.  The ejection fraction was estimated at about 20%.
He was started on digoxin and underwent diuresis with Diamox
later added for a question of contraction alkalosis.

When his blood pressure stabilized, it actually started to
rise and he developed hypertension for which he was started
on an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker.  The digoxin was
later discontinued; however, he continues on ACE inhibitor
and beta blocker to control his blood pressure.

He may need a follow-up echocardiogram at a later date to
reassess his biventricular function as he may have an
underlying cardiomyopathy, i.e., HIV cardiomyopathy, or may
have had depressed biventricular function globally in the
setting of severe sepsis.

Towards the end of his ICU stay, he underwent diuresis with
IV Lasix which helped remove some of the fluid.  He continues
to have great urine output on his own.

3.  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  The patient had some altered
mental status in the setting of meningococcal sepsis
requiring sedation and intubation.  After he was intubated,
he was given more sedat
