Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral valve repair (38mm CE [**Doctor Last Name **] band)
CABGx2 (LIMA -> LAD, SVG -> Diag)


History of Present Illness:
This is a very active 62-year-old male with known mitral
regurgitation since [**2151**]. He has been followed with routine
surveillance echocardiograms with his latest done on [**2192-5-24**].

The test revealed right and left atrial dilatation with a right
atrial pressure of [**4-26**] mm Hg.  Left ventricular wall thickness
and function were normal.  The LVEF was > 55%. The left
ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.  The right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appeared structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no AR.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly
thickened.  They were myxomatous.  There was moderate-to-severe
mitral valve prolapse.  Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation and
(2+) TR were noted.   There was moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

A comparison of past echocardiograms shows his pulmonary artery
pressures are increasing.  His PA pressure in [**2-17**] was 29+RA,
[**2-18**] it was 35+RA and then in [**5-23**] it increased to 45+RA and on
[**2192-5-24**] was 44+RA.

In terms of symptoms this gentleman denies chest discomfort,
palpitations, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion,
presyncope, syncope or diaphoresis.  He is very active
exercising daily walking 45 minutes per day at a brisk rate and
climbing 2 flights of stairs with no difficulty.

Past Medical History:
Mitral regurgitation
Basal Cell Ca s/p resection
Gilberts Disease
Seasonal allergies
S/P tonsillectomy
[**2190**]: Colon polyps s/p resection
S/P vasectomy
S/P plantar fasciitis


Social History:
He is married and works as a pediatrician
He does not smoke and consumes approximately [**12-20**] alcoholic
beverages per week.


Family History:
His father died of an MI at age 56 and his brother has CAD s/p
stents.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. Prominent Eustachian valve (normal variant).


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal
calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP. Partial mitral leaflet flail. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**]
(4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse of both the anterior and posterior leaflets. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail involving P2 and P3. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: patient is on phenylepherine and atrially paced.
Normal biventricluar function. A mitral ring prosthesis is seen.
Trivial MR, No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] mitral gradient 3.6 mm Hg. Aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All finidings
disussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 24613**] was admitted after undergoing a CABGx2 with MVR.  All
tubes, lines and wires have been removed.  His postoperative
course was complicated by pneumothoraces, which delayed removal
of chest tubes.  These tubes were removed on POD 4, and his
chest x-ray was improved.  He is now discharged with
instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and his
cardiologist and PCP.
