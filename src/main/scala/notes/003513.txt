Chief Complaint:
elective ablation for A-fib

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p elective blation for A-fib
s/p pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
62 year old man has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
that dates back to his 20's. He has undergone about 7
cardioversions and has been trialed on several antiarrythmics
including Sotalol and Flecainide. In late [**2097**] the patient began
to experience increasing episodes of AF and underwent pulmonary
vein isolation/flutter ablation on [**2099-4-1**]. Following the
ablation he gradually weaned off of Flecainide. In [**Month (only) 1096**] of
[**2098**] he had a prolonged episode of rapid palpitations that
required cardioversion. Following this he has had almost monthly
episodes of rapid palpitations that he has treated with am
"Flecainide cocktail", described as 300mg every four hours until
resolution of symptoms. His most recent episode in [**2100-6-6**]
required admission to [**Hospital3 **] for repeat cardioversion.
He has not had further palpitations since then and is referred
for left atrial tachycardia ablation.
.
Prior to admission the patient reported feeling well except for
an occasional sensation of skipped beat. He had intermittent LE
edema which he treated with compression stockings and as needed
lasix. When he is in the arrhythmia for a prolonged period, he
is aware of palpitations and a feeling of being run down.
.
He presented on the morning of admission to the CCU for elective
ablation for A-fib complicated by pericardial effusion. MAPs
fell into the 40s. A drain was placed and 500cc were drained.
His MAPs rose into the 80-90s and he was brought to the CCU for
treatment and monitoring.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was intubated with normal
pressures.

[**2100-7-21**] TTE:
There is a small-moderate pericardial effusion visualized along
the LV apex and right ventricle. Tamponade physiology cannot be
excluded based on the initial pre-pericardiocenthesis. Following
aspiration of 400 cc of fluid, the amount of pericardial
effusion appears small without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. After removal of an additional 100 cc of fluid, the
pericardial effusion appears trivial. Based on limited views,
global left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF >
55%).
.
[**2100-7-22**]: TTE
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Focused study. Trivial pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-7-21**],
the findings are similar (when compared to the
post-pericardiocentesis images performed at the end of the
study).


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo male with PAF, HTN, and HLD who presented for elective
ablation for A-fib complicated by pericardial effusion.

#Pericardial Effusion: Patient's ablation procedure was
complicated with ablation through left atriam with resulting
pericardial effusion. In the cath lab, patient's MAPs fell into
the 40s during the procedure. He was placed on neo and
pericardiocentsis was perfromed with drainage of 500cc of bloody
fluid. Subsequently his MAPs rose into the 80-90s and neo was
discontinued.  He was transfered to CCU for further monitoring
overnight. Per report patient ablation was not totally completed
at the time of pericardial effusions.  Overnight in the CCU
patient's blood pressure reamined stable. He reported
improvement in his pleuritic chest pain. Overnight patient had
about 125ml of serosangrounes fluid in the drain with no blood
or clot therefore the drain was removed and sterile dressing
applied. He had repeat echo in the morning which did not show
any further reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.  Patient was
discahrged on colchicine 0.6mg for one month to help with pain
and prevent pericarditis.

#Recurrent atrial fibrillation: He underwent a left atrial
ablation for recurrent PAF. The procedure was complicated as
above. His INR remained 2.0 and his Coumadin was continued as an
outpatient with an INR check on [**2100-7-26**] at his [**Hospital 197**] clinic.
He was continued on Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily as prescribed.
he was also started on Aspirin 325 mg daily for 1 month post
ablation. Prilosec 40 mg daily for 1 month.

#HLD: continued home atrovastatin
