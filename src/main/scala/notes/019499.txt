Service:  GYNECOLOGY
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Vaginal bleeding.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 42-year-old
female G2, P2, who was transferred from an outside hospital.
She presents to the [**Hospital1 69**] with
secondary to a diving accident at an early age and has a
history of irregular bleeding for over one year.  She
presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2152-8-17**] with an episode
of vaginal bleeding at 11 o'clock AM on the morning of
admission to the outside hospital.  Workup, during the past
year, has resulted in numerous attempts for unsuccessful
endometrial biopsies.  She has been noted to have a distorted
quadriplegia.  She has been receiving Lupron treatment for
this vaginal bleeding.  The most recent dose was on
[**2152-8-6**].  She is normally followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104956**]
at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  The patient states that her period has
progressively worsened over the past few weeks.  The first
heavy bleeding episode was on [**2152-8-6**].  She was in the seen
in the ED at that time and given Lupron.  The bleeding did
subside for two days, but again resumed.  She states that
again, on [**2152-8-17**], she began bleeding heavily and there was
saturation of the mattress.

On admission to the outside hospital, the hematocrit was
noted to be progressively dropping to a level of 24 from 31.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department she was transferred with one unit of
packed red blood cells.  At the outside hospital, she already
received one unit.  Also, notable is a history significant
for a ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in [**2152-1-21**].
The hospital course was complicated by sepsis, as well as
intubation requiring eventual tracheostomy placement.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN (hives).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.7; blood pressure 150/88; heart
rate 101; respirations 20; oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented times three.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx benign.  LUNGS:
Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, midline incision with an
approximately 3 cm x 2 cm area of pink granulation tissue,
distended abdomen, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  2+ edema
bilaterally.  Speculum examination:  Gross blood in vaginal
vault with poor visualization of the cervix and vaginal
walls, active bleeding, no evidence of trauma or lacerations
to the external genitalia.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory studies revealed the
following:  Hematocrit from the outside hospital on [**2152-8-17**]
was 31; hematocrit from outside hospital on morning of
[**2152-8-18**] was 24.

Negative beta hCG.  White count cell 5.3, hematocrit 22.8,
platelet count 311,000, PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 26.5, sodium
136, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 22, BUN 6,
creatinine 0.2, glucose 97, limited pelvic ultrasound.
Retroverted uterus, multiple masses with distorted
endometrium, suggestive of fibroids, 3 mm endometrial stripe,
trace free pelvic fluid.

Urinalysis:  Positive nitrites, 11 to 20 WBCs, many bacteria.
Urine culture:  Greater than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18675**] Klebsiella, 10,000 to
100,000 proteus.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast:  No evidence of
retroperitoneal or groin hematoma.  No evidence of lower
extremity DVT.  Irregular and enhancing fluid collection in
mid and left pelvis, which possibly represents the bladder
and may be related to vesicovaginal fistula, but an abscess
cannot be excluded.  By report at an outside hospital,
similar collection was described on [**2152-3-1**]; status post
urostomy with sigmoid conduit, status post midline
exploratory laparotomy with postoperative wound infection now
healing with secondary intent, status post recent uterine
artery embolization with embolic material in the right
pelvis.  Cortical scarring of the left kidney.
Cholelithiasis.

Pelvic ultrasound from [**2152-8-22**] revealed the following:
(Preliminary report):  Retroverted uterus with recently
embolized fibroids, unable to appreciate endometrial lining
due to orientation of uterus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for intractable
vaginal bleeding.  At the outside hospital, she had already
received two units of packed red blood cells.  She received
an additional three units of blood while in the emergency
department.  After five units total, the patient's hematocrit
was found to be 27.3.  Given the patient's history of profuse
vaginal bleeding, discussions regarding the most appropriate
management were undertaken.  Given the patient's complicated
medical and past surgical history it was felt that the
patient would most benefit from an interventional radiology
procedure in an attempt to stop the bleeding rather than
proceeding with surgical intervention.

On [**2152-8-19**], the patient underwent uterine artery
embolization with good success.  She also received another
two units of packed red blood cells, which brought her post
transfusion hematocrit to 34.7.  The patient was admitted to
the Department of Medicine Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring.  She had a femoral arterial line placed for
easier vascular access.  The patient did require an addition
two units of packed red blood cells after the hematocrit was
noted to drop to 27.3.  The patient responded well to the
blood transfusions and subsequently the hematocrit has
remained stable.  On the day of discharge, the hematocrit was
noted to be 30.5.  The patient was eventually transferred out
of the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  She has
done well, and she has had only small amounts of vaginal
bleeding.  She has remained hemodynamically stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Vaginal bleeding status post uterine artery embolization.
2.  Distorted pelvic anatomy as shown on CT and ultrasound.
3.  Urinary tract infection.
4.  C5-C6 quadriplegia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO b.i.d. times five days.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. times five days for vaginitis.
3.  Percocet 5/325 p.r.n.pain.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient will be discharged home in
stable condition.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTION:  The patient is to follow up with her
gynecologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104956**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  She is also
to follow up with the [**Hospital 159**] Clinic.  She will be given the
phone # for the clinic and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8872**] for
an outpatient cystoureteroscopy.  She will also be given the
phone # for
