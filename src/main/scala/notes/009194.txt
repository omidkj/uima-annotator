Pertinent Results:
CXR [**11-28**]
Lung volumes are preserved following extubation. Mild
enlargement of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is
comparable. Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.

TEE [**11-27**]
PRE-CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. No other
changes from pre-CPB
findings. Thoracic aorta appears intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac management.  He ruled in for STEMI [**11-25**] and
then underwent cardiac catherization [**11-26**] which revealed 3
vessel coronary artery disease.  He underwent cardiac surgery
preoperative workup and [**11-27**] went to the operating room for
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Please see operative
report for further details.  He was transferred to the cardiac
surgery unit on insulin, propofol, and neosynephrine.  In the
first 24 hours he awoke neurologically intact, extubated without
difficulty, and weaned off vasopressors.  He continued to
progress and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 on post operative day 1.
He continued to progress except for elevated blood sugars and
returned to the cardiac surgery recovery unit for blood glucose
management and insulin drip.  He was transitioned back to NPH
and regular insulin sliding scale with controlled blood sugars.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 were he continued to progress and
was ready for discharge with VNA services on postoperative day
5.  Plan for continued glucose monitoring and follow up with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 11694**].
