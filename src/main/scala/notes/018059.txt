History of Present Illness:
85 year old male with h/o Pagets, CRI, CAD, DM, HTN, CAD
presented from nursing home with concern for tibial plateau
fracture seen on xray at the nursing home.  He was transferring
with assistance from the nurses and fell on his knee.  He was
given Percocet 5/325 and ativan 0.5 mg this morning to help him
tolerate ambulance transfer which confused him.
.
In the ED, films were done and showed no evidence of fracture.
Then patient desaturated to 70% while sleeping; (per son he is
on oxygen at home only at night); pt placed on NRB and sats came
up to 100%; stayed in 90s off of the NRB. Labwork and EKG
ordered as well as CXR. Then desated to 70s again while lying
flat in bed again. CXR showed large left sided pleural effusion
(has this in past and drained before). EKG wnl. ABG done b/c
became more somnolent pH 7.21/76/104 and was then gave patient
nebulizers, azithromycin, 125mg Solumerol. Labs WBC 11.1 with
89%Neutrophils. Repeat gas: ph:7.00 pCO2:141 pO2:79 HCO3:37.
Discussion was held with the family given the patients desire
for DNR/DNI and the decision was made to do trial of BIPAP to
see if his respiratory status could improve.  On BIPAP in the
ED, his repeat ABG demonstrated persistant hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

The patient was then admitted to the MICU for further care.
.
Currently the patient is non-responsive on BIPAP, thus further
history is unable to be obtained.

Knee Plain Films:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture is seen. If clinical concern persists,
consider CT or
MRI to evaluate for occult fracture.
2. Moderate to large right suprapatellar joint effusion.
3. Bilateral degenerative changes at the knees with joint space
narrowing as
well as diffuse osteopenia.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval worsening with now moderate left-sided pleural
effusion. Stable
left basilar opacification, likely representing collapse and
effusion, though
underlying infection is not excluded. Note that patient has had
persistent
collapse since remote examinations dating back to [**2185**].
Correlate with any
history of bronchoscopy.
2. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
3. Known Paget's involving the right shoulder.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M with MMP admitted with hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory
failure. Admitted to ICU for trial of BIPAP as patient is
DNR/DNI.

# Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
Patient presented from his nursing home with concern for tibial
plateau fracture seen on xray at the nursing home.  He was
transferring with assistance from the nurses and fell on his
knee.  He was given Percocet 5/325 and ativan 0.5 mg to help him
tolerate ambulance transfer which confused him. In the ED, films
were done and showed no evidence of fracture.  He was evaluated
by ortho and placed in a knee immobilzer. Then patient
desaturated to 70% while sleeping; (per son he is on oxygen at
home only at night).  He was placed on NRB and O2 saturations
came up to 100% and remained in the 90s off of the NRB.  A CXR
showed a large left sided pleural effusion.  His EKG was wnl.
His initial ABG was 7.21/76/104 and was then given nebulizers,
azithromycin, 125mg Solumerol. A repeat gas: showed ph:7.00
pCO2:141 pO2:79 HCO3:37. Discussion was held with the family
given the patients desire for DNR/DNI and the decision was made
to do trial of BIPAP to see if his respiratory status could
improve.  On BIPAP in the ED, his repeat ABG demonstrated
persistant hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient
continued to worsen and reamined non-responsive.  He had
worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure without improvement on
BiPAP. After a discussion with the family his BiPAP was removed
and the patient passed with the family at the bedside.  The
Medical Examiner and family decline autopsy.
