Allergies:
Kefzol / Solarcaine / Polocaine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Tx from OSH for cardiac catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-25**]: cardiac cathetirization with stenting of the LAD with
Cypher DES
Central Line placement
[**5-2**]: exploratory laparotomy, diagnostic angiography, placment of
celiac stent

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 yr old woman with ESRD on dialysis, h/o AAA repair
([**2192**]) who is referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] for cardiac
catheterization. Pt presented to OSH Tues [**2200-4-22**] w/progressive
SOB after several days of URI sx. She notes that she had
returned from vacationing in FL where she felt well, she had
nasal congestion and nonproductive cough, no fever/chills. She
awoke on day of presentation w/SOB without improvement after
sitting up and called 911. She denies CP/palpitations, no
HA/dizzyness/n/v/visual changes/diaphoresis. She also denies LE
edema, orthopnea, PND. She notes that she had had complete HD on
Monday, day PT presentation.
.
On presentation to the OSH, she had bp in 90s/50s which quickly
resolved. EKG showed LAD, atrial flutter at 143 bpm and peaked T
waves BNP was 2060. Her K was 7.0 and she was found to have a
TNI 0.23 which increased to 1.31, CK 133 later that day. She was
started on ASA and Metoprolol as well as Diltiazem for rate
control, had another HD session and was treated for a presumed
COPD flare w/steroids and levofloxacin.
.
On HD2, TNI increased to 2.93 and EKG showed ST depressions in
II, III, AVF although there is a question of lead placement
after repeat EKG here. She continued to be CP free.
Echocardiogram revealed mid to low septal akinesis, apical
hypokinesis new from prior echo in [**2196**]. Today, her TNI was 4.34
because of hypoxia, she was placed on CPAP but weaned down to 5L
NC prior to tx. She received 300mg Plavix. There is no OSH EKG
from today. However, EKG here shows deep TWI in precordial
leads.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
+ dyspnea on exertion, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. +
fatigue.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated a.flutter at 85bpm deep TWI in V2-V6 new
compared with prior dated [**2197-2-10**]
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2200-4-23**] at OSH demonstrated:
EF 50%, normal LV size and mild systolid dysfunction with mid to
low septal akinesis, apical hypokinesis new from prior echo in
[**2196**]. Fibrosclerotic aortic valve change without significant
stenosis
Trace MR, trace TR

.
CXR [**4-24**]: no acute process
.
Cardiac cath [**4-25**]:
The initial angiography revealed an 80% calcified proximal LAD
lesion. Bivalirudin was administered for anticoagulation.  The
strategy to attempt to predilate and stent the lesion with
provisional rotablation if the balloon were to fail to expand.
XBLAd 3.5 Guide provided good support. Prowater wire crossed the
lesion easily. 2.5 X 12 mm Quantum Maverick balloon appeared to
expand well although somewhat differentially at 12 atms. 3.0 X
13 mm Cypher DES was deployed at 16 atms with some mid-stent
residual stenosis but good stent apposition at stent edges. 3.0
X 9 mm NC Ranger balloon was used for mid stent post-dilated at
30 atms. There was a 20% residual stenosis with normal flow and
no dissection. The patient left the cath lab in stable
condition.
.
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD with Cypher DES.
.
CT abdomen [**5-1**]:
1. Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, left greater than right,
may represent infectious process, possible aspiration. Other
entities cannot be ruled out. Follow up study after appropriate
treatment is recommended to document resolution.
2. 4.6 x 4.4 cm right adnexal cyst. If clinicaly indicated, US
and or MRI could be performed for further characterization.
3. Mild distal small bowel mucosal wall thickening may represent
ischemia given the extensive vascular calcifications, infection
or inflammatory process.
4. Fluid-filled mildly distended descending colon and sigmoid.
5. Infrarenal AAA status post repair.
6. L3 compression fracture with retropulsion of the fracture
fragments narrowing the thecal sac at this level.
[**4-27**], [**4-28**], [**4-30**]: c.diff negative x3, stool cx neg.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yr old woman with hx ESRD on dialysis, dyslipidemia, HTN, s/p
AAA repair, no previously known h/o CAD who was transferred for
cardiac catheterization after she was found to be in new onset
atrial flutter, elevated Troponin I, and new wall motion
abnormalities seen on echo at OSH.
.
# NSTEMI - the patient was diagnosed with NSTEMI based on
elevated cardiac enzymes, new wall motion abnormalities.  She
had cardiac cathetirization on [**4-25**] showing an 80% calcified
proximal LAD lesion.  She had a cypher DES placed.  She was
maintained on ASA, plavix (initially loaded at OSH).  She was
not treated with integrillin because of renal failure.
.
# Ischemic colitis - the day after cardiac cathetirization the
patient developed diarrhea and the onset of BRBPR, approximately
600cc of bloody stool.  She remained hemodynamically stable.
The patient had an NG lavage which was negative.  A blood
transfusion was started but pt developed fever from 97 to 100
degrees F, so transfusion was stopped.  Transfusion reaction
labs were sent.  A subsequent HCT was noted to rise from 31 to
34 and remained stable.  Potential etiologies for her LGIB were
felt to be diverticular bleed/AVM or mesenteric ischemia/colonic
ischemia.  Of note, pt had transient hypotension earlier that
day at dialysis from 140's to 90's, she had a recent cath with
known aortic calcifications and had new onset AF.  GI was
consulted and plans were made
