Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Endotracheal intubation (done at another hospital) and
extubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o DM, CAD s/p stents to D1 and
LCx, who presented from [**Hospital3 4107**] as a Code STEMI.  The
patient was reportedly in his normal state of health until noon
on [**8-27**], when he was lifting furniture and developed chest pain.
 He reportedly had associated diaphoresis and lightheadedness.
An hour and a half later, the patient drove himself to [**Hospital1 **], where he continued to have substernal chest pain.

On arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be ashen but
conversant and AAO x3.  His initial VS were BP 130/77, P 51, R
14, O2 97% on RA, Wt 233 lbs.  On transfer to the ED stretcher,
the patient went into VFib arrest.  He was coded for 54 minutes,
during which time he was intubated and received 12 mg
Epinepherine, 5 mg of Atropine, and was started on Lidocaine and
Dopamine gtts.  Cooling protocol was initiated, and he was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as code STEMI for cardiac catheterization.

In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a total occlusion
of the mid-RCA.  He underwent successful primary PCI and had a
BMS placed in his RCA.  He was weaned off the pressors, and
heparin and integrilin were discontinued as the patient
continued to have substantial bleeding from his nares.

The patient was intubated and sedated upon arrival to the CCU
and was thus unable to answer ROS.

Blood Cx: No growth to date

Urine Cx: Group B streptococcus >100,000 organisms

Imaging/Studies:
CXR [**2118-8-31**]: Portable upright chest radiograph is compared to
[**2118-8-30**]. There has been interval removal of endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes. The lung volumes are low. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. However,
there is new fullness in the hilar regions bilaterally and
increase in interstitial markings suggesting new pulmonary edema
above what would be expected for extubation. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are also evident. There is no pneumothorax.
Retrocardiac density, likely atelectasis, is unchanged.
.
ECHO [**2118-8-29**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow
identified. Dilated aortic root.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2118-8-27**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-domimant system
revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
significant stenoses.  The LAD had mild diffuse disease and
patent stents in the first diagonal with moderate diffuse
restenosis.  The LCX had patent proximal stent and a large OM2
branch with mild diffuse disease.  The RCA had an acute
mid-vessel total occlusion
2.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular
filling
pressures and RA / PCWP pressures suggestive of right
ventricular
infarction, with depressed cardiac output.
3.  Successful manual aspiration thrombectomy and placement of a

3.5x18mm Vision bare-metal stent were performed in the mid-RCA.
Final
angiography showed TIMI 3 flow, no apparent dissection, and no
residual
stenosis.  (See PTCA comments.)
4.  Post PCI bleeding was observed in the left nares, resolved
with
manual pressure and cessation of integrilin.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and
D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 **] s/p
cardiac arrest with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.

# Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarct:  The patient presented
with chest pain and subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital1 **].  He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after
one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization
demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  He was on
Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac catheterization.  He underwent
cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Versed for sedation and
Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours.  He was then rewarmed
and weaned off sedation without complication.  He was started on
aspirin 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, Lipitor 80mg daily, and
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Heparin and integrilin were held due to
nose bleeding post-cath.  He had episodes of hypotension over
the 24-48 hours after cath, and was aggressively given IV fluids
to maintain blood pressure. HIs BP and HR were stable at
discharge on current meds.

#. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] in the setting of cardiac arrest.  After cardiac cath,
extubation was slightly delayed due to concern for
ventilator-associated pneumonia and increased secretions.  He
was started on Vancom
