Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
Inferior STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2119-9-4**]: Cardiac catherization with two drug eluting stents
placed in RCA.

[**2119-9-5**]: DC cardioversion at 200 J times one.


History of Present Illness:
62 year-old male with no known coronary artery disease who had
sharp pain between his shoulder blades and anterior chest pain
that radiated down his left arm while doing yardwork.  He also
was diaphoretic, nauseated, and had a tingling sensation in both
hands.  He called EMS and was transfered to [**Hospital1 34**] where he was
found to have ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVf.  He was
started on metoprolol, aspirin, plavix, heparin, and
integrellin.  He was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catherization.  At catherization, he was found to have RCA
thrombis with no disease in the LMCA, LAD, or LCx.  Two cypher
stents were placed in the RCA.  During the procedure, he went
into atrial fibrillation and had transient hypotension that
required neosynepherine drip and an IV fluid bolus.
Post-procedure, he did not have chest pain or shortness of
breath.

Past Medical History:
1. h/o chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis 6 years ago
x 2 episodes.  He was treated at [**Hospital3 2005**] and had a
negative stress test.  There is a question of atrial
fibrillation on that admission.
2. Hypercholesterolemia
3. Asthma requiring Albuteral inhaler daily, advair, and
flovent.
4. Depression
5. s/p removal of benign middle/inner ear tumor 2 years ago
leaving him with  about 50% hearing in left ear.
6. h/o colitis.

Social History:
He is married with 6 children.  He works as a carpenter.  He
does not smoke and drinks occasionally.

Family History:
Family history is significant for his father who had an MI at
age 51.

Physical Exam:
Well appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  His vitals are
temperature 95.5, heart rate 127 (105-127), blood pressure
106/66, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98 % on 2L NC.
His mucous membranes are moist.  His cardiac exam is irregular
and tachycardic with a normal S1 and S1, no murmors, rubs, or
gallops.  His JVP is at the level of the sternal notch.  Femoral
pulses are present with bruit, no evidence of hematoma at the
catherization site.  His pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation
anteriorly.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, mildly distended,
with bowel sounds present.  His extremeties are warm without
cyanosis or edema, distal pulses are 2+ bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
At [**Hospital1 34**]:
Na: 140 K: 4.2 Cl: 103 Co2: 23 BUN: 21 Cr: 0.9 Glu: 104

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 62 year-old male with no known coronary
artery disease who was transfered from [**Hospital1 34**] for an inferior
STEMI.

1. CAD: At cardiac catherization, he was found to have thrombis
in the RCA.  Two cypher stents were placed.  During the
procedure, he went into atrial fibrillation and had transient
hypotension that required neosynepherine and IV fluid bolus.  He
was started on integrillin for 18 hours, aspirin, plavix,
atorvastatin, and low dose metoprolol.  His hypotension was
thought to reflect some RV involvement, but an ECHO showed
normal RV function.  The ECHO also showed an EF of 50% and
regional left ventricular basalar hypokinesis.  After one day,
his blood pressure was stable, so he was called out to the
floor.  He tolerated the low dose metoprolol, so the dose was
increased.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: He went into atrial fibrillation during
catherization.  Since he was in normal sinus rhythm earlier, it
was decided to attempt cardioversion.  He was started on IV
heparin anticoagulation with a goal PT of 50-70.  Chemical
cardioversion was attempted with a 1 mg ibutilide infusion over
10 minutes with no conversion to sinus rhythm.  He did not have
a prolongation of the QT interval, so a second 1 mg ibutilide
infusion was attempted that also did not result in conversion.
He was then DC cardioverted with 200 J times one that converted
him to sinus rhythm.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout this hospitalization.  Because his atrial
fibrillation was induced in the catherization lab, his
anticoagulation was discontinued.

3. Pump: He has no evidence of heart failure.  His ECHO showed
an EF of 50%, which is likely secondary to the acute MI.  He
appeared euvolemic with a low JVP throughout his hospital
course.

4. Asthma: He has a history of asthma; however, on admission, he
had no evidence of an acute issue.  His albuteral inhaler was
not given because of his tachycardia.

5. PPX: He was kept on colace and senna as a bowel regimen,
pantoprazole for GI ulcers.  He was ambulating for DVT
prophylaxis.

6. FEN: He was kept NPO for his cardioversion on [**9-5**];
otherwise, he was kept on a cardiac healthy diet.  His potassium
was repleted during this admission.  He was given two IV fluid
bolus during the first severall hours post-catherization for
transient hypotension.

7. Dispo: He was discharged to home on the third hospital day.
