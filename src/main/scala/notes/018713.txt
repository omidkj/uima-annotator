Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, decreasing O2 sats


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placed on [**6-6**].


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68259**] is an 81 yo F with h/o aspiration PNA, COPD and
CVA/aphasia, who presented to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with SOB,
wheezing and low O2 sats (92% on 2LNC).  Her daughter states
that she became progressively more SOB with cough and inc sputum
and decreasing PO intake for the past 2 weeks.  2 days ago she
ran a temp to 100.1 F and she was given two doses of levaquin at
the rehab yesterday (unclear if had gotten more) for increased
secretions. She was also given lasix 40 mg PO x1.  She initially
presented to the [**Hospital1 882**] ED this afternoon but was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 **] per the request of her family.
.
At [**Hospital1 882**], VS were 99.8, 106, 22, 142/68, and 92% 2LNC.  WBC
was 28.1 w/ 19% bands, trop < 0.04, BNP 38, bicarb 26; ABG was
7.46/32/91 on ? O2.   She was given solumedrol, duonebs,
Tylenol, ceftriaxone x 1, and flagyl x 1.  She had one set of
cardiac enzymes that were nagtive and CXR reportedly had a LLL
PNA.  VS on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] were 99.5, HR 134, BP 100/78, RR
22, 92% on 4L NC.  She was given 3 L NS as well as vancomycin 1
g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV and cefepime 2 g IV.
.
Per daughter: She was placed in long-term care facility ~3.5 yrs
ago for alzheimer's dementia.  About 1-2 years ago she fell out
of bed at NH and fx'ed her hip.  She has not ambulated since
then.  She had 2 strokes in summer of [**2150**] that left her with an
expressive aphasia.  She can speak in simple sentences/phrases
when well.  She will often string together non-coherent words
and believe she is communicating coherently.  Daughter states
the current babbling of word fragments is worse than her
baseline.

.
trends:
WBC improved to 16 on discharge.
HCT 34.8 - stable
creatinine - stable
.
Vanco trough on am of discharge 35

AMDISSION EKG: noisy background, sinus tach at 130; poor R wave
progression; no ST seg changes or TWI; LAD.

ADMISSION CXR:
AP upright chest radiograph is reviewed and compared to
[**2151-6-3**].
Evaluation is limited by rotation, despite technologist's
attempts to properly position the patient. Evaluation is also
limited by low lung volumes. There is no large consolidation,
though retrocardiac area cannot be reliably assessed. There is
no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Limited exam. No focal consolidation.
.
[**6-6**] CXR:
HISTORY: PICC line placement.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there has been placement of a left subclavian PICC line that
extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Little change in the
appearance of the heart and lungs
.
Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricle is not well seen.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve is not
well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen. Valvular function could not be
evaluated


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F w/h/o aspiration PNA and COPD, admitted from NH with
SOB, wheezing and hypoxia w/ possible LLL opacity on OSH film.
ICU course by problem:
.
#. Respiratory Distress: wheezy on exam; LLL infiltrate on CXR;
WBC 22-28; resp status thought [**12-25**] PNA (either NH/CAP vs.
aspiration).   Her PNA was supported by possible infiltrate but
also by heavy secretions.  Secretions improved within 2 days.
We suspect PNA may have triggered COPD flare.  Minimal evidence
of CHF exacerbation on imaging, exam and labs, but does have CHF
history.  We treated her as follows:
- PNA: treated with vanco, ceftaz, flagyl for nosocomial
coverage with plans for an 8 day course.  She will need 4 more
days of this regimen.  Note that her vanco trough on am of [**6-7**]
was 35 so we recommend rechecking vanco trough on [**6-8**] and dose
1gm q24 for trough<20.  We also treated with azithromycin to
cover atypicals.  She will need two more doses of this.
- COPD: We treated with prednisone 40mg daily and tapered down.
Recommend 20mg daily x3d, 10mg daily x3d then stop.  We also
treated with q1-2h albuterol nebs and q6h ipratropium nebs.
This was spaced out to q4h with breakthrough prn nebs.
- UCx negative but BCx still pending
- low suspicion for MI.  CE as above
- she was on 4L NC prior to discharge from the hospital.
.
#. COPD:
-- management as above
.
#. chronic systolic CHF: no evidence of volume overload on exam;
BNP 38 (negative) at OSH. Echo here was of poor quality but did
not reveal obvious wall motion abnl.  We gently diuresed with
lasix 10mg IV to keep her even to slightly negative.  She
tolerated this well.
.
#. HTN: Initially held her metoprolol but this was restarted.
.
#. Hypothyroidism
-- continue levothyroxine 88 mcg QD
.
#. Dementia: not currently on medications
.
#. Depression: was on venlafaxine in past; held on last
admission for c/f NMS.  Nothing on med list currently.
.
#. Osteoporosis: currently on calcium supplements
-- cont calcium;
-- fall precautions
.
#. FEN: on admission, takes ProBalance 65 ml/hr; on at 9 pm, off
at 6 am.  200 cc free water flushes Qshift.  we used Replete
w/fiber Full strength during her ICU stay.
