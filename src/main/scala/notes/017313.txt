Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p fall with hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L Hip ORIF

History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with COPD on home 3L O2, CAD s/p stent, CHF
with EF 50%, T2DM, ESRD on HD, Afib, HTN, OSA who was admitted 2
days ago with a pelvic fracture s/p repair yesterday. She is now
being transferred to the MICU with hypotension and hypoxia at
her HD session.

She reports that two days ago she was walking without her walker
and lost her balance trying to step up to the curb. Her left hip
hit the concrete and she was unable to get up and called 911.
She denies any preceding CP, palpitations, dizziness. Also
denies LOC or head trauma.

In the ED, intial vitals were 97.7 64 119/42 18 94%RA (although
wears 3L at all times at home). She was found to have a left
subtrochanteric hip fracture. She was given vitamin K for an INR
of 3.1 and transferred to the medicine floor.

She underwent left ORIF yesterday after an HD session. She had
2.5L taken off at HD yestserday and was given 1.5L during the
OR. This morning her vitals prior to dialysis were "99.1 109/89
63 18 95%RA" per review of records. Since admission her BP's
have ranged 101/53-112/45 and O2 sats have ranged from 86%RA to
86%3L. This morning she went to HD and was found to have a BP of
70's/40's with O2 Sat in the 70's on room air. She was given 1L
NS and BP was responsive to 91/44. She was then transferred to
the MICU.

Currently reports not feeling well. Reports not hearing well
this morning and having mild nausea. Also reports not eating in
2 days. Denies any dizziness or chest pain, but does feel that
her breathing is more labored. Also c/o worsened back pain, and
sore, dry throat. Has a baseline cough but not coughing anything
up.

7. Syncope/Presyncopal episodes - This was evaluated as an

changes in the past when she has had these episodes.

Brief Hospital Course:
65F with COPD on home 3L O2, CAD s/p stent, CHF with EF 50%,
DM2, ESRD on HD, Afib on warfarin, HTN, OSA, who underwent
successful repair of left hip fracture. [**Hospital 72030**]
transferred to MICU for hypotension and hypoxia at dialysis.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was transferred to the MICU after an
episode of hypotension at HD.  Her BP was 70's/40's and
responsive to 1L IVF.  Subsequently her blood pressure remained
stable and her metoprolol was restarted.  CXR was consistent
with pulmonary edema and further fluids were minimized.  Her O2
sats remained at her home level.  She was called out to the
general medical service on hospital day 3. Her pressures
remained stable on the floor.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely [**3-1**] lack of home oxygen in dialysis. Placed on
3L home requirement and saturated well.
.
# ESRD: No dialysis on [**10-22**] as she was hypotensive prior to
connecting to machine.  Received dialysis on [**10-24**].  Continued
sevelamer, low phos diet. She was given a three day course of
aluminum hydroxide for elevated phosphorus levels.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na in low 120s, likely [**3-1**] free water intake.
She was placed on fluid restriction.  Na improved to 126 prior
to discharge. This will need to be repeated on [**10-26**] at dialysis
and discussed with MD.
.
# Pain control s/p hip fx repair:  Initially on IV dilaudid,
then switched to oral dilaudid.
