Imaging:
EGD ([**11-19**]):
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Nodularity, congestion, erythema and mosaic appearance in the
stomach body and fundus compatible with severe portal
hypertensive gastropathy
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
Liver ultrasound ([**11-20**]):
1. No biliary dilatation seen.
2. Nodular heterogeneous liver consistent with the patient's
known cirrhosis.
3. Splenomegaly and mild ascites.
4. Patent hepatic vasculature with a patent umbilical vein and
midline
varices.
.
CT Torso ([**11-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe
consistent with infection.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions with secondary atelectasis.
The right atelectasis has a small component that is
hypoattenuating in comparison to the other components and might
represent pneumonia.
3. Known cirrhosis with portosystemic collaterals and large
ascites. The right portal branches are diminutive most probably
related to the large recanalized paraumbilical vein. Note is
made of a varix of this recanalized vein.
4. No signs of bowel obstruction.
5. Acute left tenth rib fracture.
6. Ascites.
4. Patent hepatic vasculature with a patent umbilical vein and
midline varices.
.
Abdominal ultrasound ([**11-28**]):
Scans of the upper and lower abdomen demonstrates a large volume
of ascites, predominantly on the right side. An appropriate spot
was marked in the right flank for subsequent paracentesis by the
clinical team.
.
CXR ([**11-19**]):
SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Endotracheal tube tip is at
the level of the thoracic inlet, terminating approximately 8.3
cm from the carina. The nasogastric tube tip is within the
stomach. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. There are low lung volumes with
crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Streaky opacities i
