Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker placement
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
80M transferred from OSH for further w/u of newly discovered EF
of 20% and severe cardiac conduction problems (CHB, sick sinus).
Pt was hospitalized at OSH s/p being found down ? [**1-31**] fall -->
subsequently diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis but also had +
troponin and above EF/rhythm findings. To EP and Cath today
which showed clean coronaries and a pacemaker placed. Lengthy
stay in PACU [**1-31**] sedation issues. Per family, extensive ETOH
history, which explains the dilated cardiomyopathy and
conduction disorders. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
hx PAfib, htn, supranuclear palsy, hyperlipidemia, possible OSA

lives with nephew; +etoh [**2-1**] drinks a day but heavy use in past
and has not gone a day without drinking in 50 years; +tobacco in
past but quit 20 years ago; no drugs

Medications:
-on admission: flonase, verapamil, potassium, sinemet,
allopurinol
-on transfer: heparin gtt, tylenol, allopurinol, sinemet,
lopressor, nitropaste, combivent nebs

Physical Exam:
Vitals:  98.8 107/69 62 30 95% on 3L NC
Gen:  NAD, lethargic
Neck:  no JVD, no carotid bruits
Cardio:  distant heart sounds, RRR, no m/r/g appreciated
Resp: tachypnic, CTAB anteriorly
Abd: soft, nt, distended, +BS
Ext:  no c/c/e, 2+ DP/PT.  R groin cath site.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization: normal coronary arteries, moderately
elevated right sided pressures (mean RA 22 mmHg), moderately
elevated pulmonary pressures (mean PA 31 mmHg), and moderately
elevated left sided pressures (mean PCWP 26 mmHg) with a
severely reduced cardiac index (1.2 l/min/m2)
.
Abdominal CT: Bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.  No abscess, focal fluid collection, or source of
infection identified within the abdomen or pelvis.  Coronary
artery calcification and diffuse calcification of the abdominal
aorta and iliacs.  Unremarkable appearance of the bowel, but
mesenteric ischemia can not be excluded on this I-, motion
limited study. Correlate clinically
.
Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Please note that
meningitis is a clinical diagnosis based in part on laboratory
evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: The patient was noted to have an elevated troponin with
a concern for an acute MI and worsening heart failure. He was
taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to
have no flow limiting disease, though did have elevated filling
pressures consistent with an element of heart failure. His
troponin elevation was considered secondary to CHF vs. metabolic
damage. He was continued on aspirin and loaded with digoxin,
until the decision for hospice was made.

2. Arrhythmia: The patient was noted to be in bradycardia with
intermittent heart block at the OSH. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for pacemaker placement.  He was loaded on amiodarone and was
monitored on telemetry.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient was noted to have an ejection
fraction of 20% at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac catheterization revealed no flow
limiting disease. His cardiomyopathy was considered likely
secondary to alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

4. Septic shock: The patient became increasingly septic and was
transferred to the MICU for treatment. The patient was treated
with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, flagyl and ampicillin to cover
Listeria meningitis. The source of his possible infection was
not clear. Imaging studies did not reveal a clear source. Blood
and urine cultures were negative at the time of discharge. Once
the patient's code status was changed, antibiotics were
discontinued.

5. Altered Mental status:  The patient remained obtunded
throughout his hospital course both at [**Hospital3 3583**] and
[**Hospital1 18**]. The etiology was considered multifactorial and related to
infection, hepatic failure, renal failure, and alcohol withdrawl
in the setting of supranuclear palsy.

6. Rhabdomyolysis:  The patient was noted to have a CPK of
11,000 secondary to a fall with prolonged down time. This
improved with IV fluids.

7. Renal failure: The patient had a slowly increasing creatinine
throughout his hospitalization, concerning for renal failure
from hypoperfusion and complicated by the dye load during his
cardiac catheterization. Despite fluids, the patient's
creatinine remained elevated.
