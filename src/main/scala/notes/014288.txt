This is a history and physical preoperatively.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 7362**] early a.m. on
[**2197-9-17**] with the complaints of chest tightness and shortness
of breath.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care, catheterization, and possible surgery.  He has known
coronary artery disease in the past.  He has had a PTCA with
stent to his left LAD in [**2195**], which was complicated by acute
renal failure with a creatinine in between 2.5 and 4.0.  He
also has critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6
centimeter squared in [**2195**].  He was referred to Cardiac
Surgery for a possible aortic valve replacement plus or minus
CABG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is as
follows:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2195**] and
PCI/stent to the LAD; aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 centimeter
squared in [**2195**]; hypertension; acute renal failure after PCI
in [**2195**], he was on dialysis, but not presently, with a
creatinine of 2.5 to 4.0; hypercholesterolemia; prostate
cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation
treatment; anemia, the patient is on Epogen; COPD.  Also, the
patient is status post a GI bleed (secondary to infection as
per wife).  He is also status post MRSA UTI.  The patient has
diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post
cholecystectomy, status post right THR x2, status post
urinary tract revision with sphincter.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications are:
1. Zocor.
2. Norvasc.
3. Lopressor 5 mg q.d.
4. Allopurinol 150 mg q.d.
5. Casodex 150 mg q.d.
6. Felodipine 5 mg q.d.
7. Epogen every week.
8. Humulin 70/30 25 units q.a.m. and NPH 20 units at dinner.
9. Ceftriaxone.
10.      Zithromax.


ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not drink alcohol.  He quit smoking
40 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologically, he is grossly intact.
Alert and oriented x3.  Pulmonary:  His lungs are clear to
auscultation.  His heart has regular rate and rhythm, with a
4/6 systolic ejection murmur.  His abdomen is soft,
nontender, and nondistended with bowel sounds.  His
extremities are warm with positive pulses, no clubbing, no
cyanosis or edema.  His carotid arteries have bilateral
murmurs from the heart that radiate up.

LABORATORY DATA:  His chest x-ray was negative for any
cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  VQ scan was negative.  UA was
negative.  His white blood count was 9.5 and hematocrit 27.6.
Platelets 128,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 57, creatinine 2.7, glucose 178, CPK 463,
and troponin T is 1.3.  PT 12.7, PTT 34.1, and INR 1.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  So, once again, the plan for this
patient:  This is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical
problems, which he currently has a fever, and the plan was to
follow up on his cultures that were taken a day before.  We
will get a Panorex x-ray and Dental consult, have cardiac
catheterization, an echocardiogram, and a carotid study, and
also have an ID consult to rule out infectious source of his
fever and a Hematology/Oncology consult to evaluate his
anemia and a possible metastatic workup for his prostate CA.
Carotid ultrasounds revealed no significant hemodynamic
lesion in either the left or right carotid artery.  Cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**2197-9-19**], which showed the
following results:  LMCA was normal.  His LAD had a mid 70
percent stenosis, the left circumflex with moderate diffuse
disease mid 50 percent, distal 70 percent.  The right RCA
demonstrated mild luminal irregularities.  The patient had [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 109**] gradient of 0.627 meter squared.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Severe and progressive aortic stenosis,
moderate two-vessel coronary artery disease with left
anterior descending stent, and severely elevated left-side
filling pressures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2197-9-19**] showed
the following results:  Severe aortic stenosis, mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional
systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, at least
mild mitral regurgitation.  There was no regurgitation
present in any other valves.  So, on hospital day number 2,
the patient was seen by Infectious Disease for a possible
source of infection secondary to increased hematuria and
fever, and Cardiac Surgery continued to follow up until given
consent was okayed for surgery.  On hospital stay day number
3, the patient had a bilateral lower limb ultrasound Doppler
to rule out any DVT for source of fever and possible
asymmetry of his calves.  There were no DVTs found on the
Doppler examination, no evidence of abnormality, and the day
earlier, the patient was seen by Dental and was cleared for
surgery as per Dental.  On hospital day number 9, which was
[**2197-9-26**], the patient appeared to be ready for his CABG and
AVR in the near future.  Following a Urology consult, the
patient will need a suprapubic tube placed as a urethral
catheter could cause erosion of urethra and also need
recommendations from Urology to comment on when full
authorization for cardiopulmonary bypass is safe status post
a placement of the suprapubic catheter.  Throughout the last
nine days of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he has been
followed by Medicine, Cardiology, Nephrology, Infectious
Disease, Physical Therapy, and Hematology/Oncology in the
need to find any source of infection following his renal
status and following his CHF status and his anemia.  The
patient has also received several blood transfusions
secondary to a decreased hematocrit during the last week.  On
[**2197-9-28**], which was hospital day number 11, the patient had a
Foley inserted with the help of cystoscopy and pelvic
ultrasound guidance, and was planned for surgery the next
day, which would be [**2197-9-29**].  Cardiac Surgery had done this.

On [**2197-9-29**], the patient was brought into the operating room
for cardiac surgery.  The surgeon was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  The
procedure was coronary artery bypass graft x2.  The grafts
were LIMA to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM.  The patient
also received aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The cardiopulmonary bypass
time was 108 minutes.  Cross-clamp time was 88 minutes.  The
patient's condition on transfer to the CSIU is as follows:
He had a rate of 80 beats per minute in normal sinus rhythm,
mean arterial pressure of 67, CVP of 5, PA diastolic of 13,
and PA mean of 21.  He was receiving epinephrine drip of 0.02
mcg/kg per minute, nitroglycerin at 0.5 mg, insulin at 2
units per hour, and propofol 20 mg en route to the CSIU.  On
postoperative day number 1, the patient was still receiving
the following drips:  Insulin of 1 unit, milrinone of 0.5 mg,
Natrecor of 0.01 mg, and propofol of 25 mg.  The patient had
a specifically low cardiac index.  Examination-wise, the
patient was in no acute distress.  His heart rate was regular
rate and rhythm.  His lungs were clear.  His wounds were
clear, dry, and intact.  His temperature was 99.7 degrees F.,
94 normal sinus rhythm heart rate, BP 106/45, and
respirations 14.  His white blood count was 11.3, hematocrit
was 29.2, and platelet count was 84,000, which was down from
113,000.  His hematocrit, I guess, was 29.2, which was down
from 37.  The plan was to start Lasix t.i.d., get a hepatic
panel with possible decrease in milrinone, and extubate the
patient as soon as the patient was tolerable.

On postoperative day number 2, the patient was still
receiving milrinone at 0.3 mg now, which was down from 0.5
mg, insulin of 4 units, Natrecor of 0.01 mg, and he was on 40
mg of Lasix intravenously.  The patient was extubated.  He
had received 1 unit of packed red b
