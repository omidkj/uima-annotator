Imaging:
ECG Study Date of [**2201-4-13**]  3:36:56 PM
Sinus rhythm with premature ventricular contractions. Left axis
deviation.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Borderline
prolonged P-R interval. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2201-3-18**] frequent ventricular premature beats are now
appreciated.

CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2201-4-13**] 2:50 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent left pleural effusion with associated compressive
atelectasis.
2. Unremarkable appearance of aortic graft, without evidence for
leak. SMA
and celiac are patent, through the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is occluded.
3. Increased assymetric expansion of the left psoas muscle, with
ill-defined central low-attenuation collection and peripheral
rim enhancement. While this appearance can be seen in an
organizing hematoma, the continued expansion on serial studies
is atypical and thus concerning for development of a psoas
abscess and phlegmon formation.
4. Status post partial colectomy with colostomy.
5. Unchanged perirectal lymph nodes.
6. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
7. Persistent left abdominal wall defect, with extension
adjacent to the
lateral eleventh left rib, where a slight cortical irregularity
is identified.
Underlying osteomyelitis cannot be excluded, and clinical
correlation is
recommended.
8. Expansion and enhancement of the left flank musculature
adjacent to the
left abdominal wall defect. Findings may relate to post-surgical
change, but again, infection of this tissue is not excluded. No
discrete abscess is seen within this region.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2201-4-15**] 4:46 PM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
moderate
increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild increase in
extent of
the pre-existing right-sided pleural effusion. In the right
lung, there is a minimal unchanged parenchymal opacity at the
bases of the right lung.
Otherwise, no changes.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2201-4-18**] 4:34 PM
There has been no appreciable reaccumulation of left pleural
fluid and no
pneumothorax is seen, pigtail catheter still projecting over the
left mid
chest. Small right pleural effusion and borderline edema
persists in the
right lung, though lung volumes have improved. Heart size is top
normal.
Mediastinal vascular engorgement suggests volume overload.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2201-4-20**] 7:29 AM
Small left apical and tiny right apical pneumothoraces are
unchanged. Left pigtail catheter in the chest is in similar
position. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents a
combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Left basal
atelectases are seen

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2201-4-22**] 2:56 PM
1. Interval decrease of left-sided pleural effusion with
slightly improved
aeration and better diaphragmatic contour. Residual small
bilateral pleural effusion.
2. Unchanged tiny apical left pneumothorax.
3. Interval placement of right PICC with tip at the mid SVC.

CXR [**2201-4-14**] stable




Brief Hospital Course:
[**2201-4-13**] HD0: Transferred from rehab after patient fell from bed
to floor.  Found to be neurologically intact, although later had
altered mental status and c/o mild abdominal pain.  He then
became hypotensive w/ SBP 60-70s on transport. Hypotensive upon
arrival in ED where he was given fluid boluses and transfused
with 2 units of PRBCs. BP stabilized and then admitted to the
CVICU. Right groin temporary access central line, left EJ, and
foley placed. PICC line from previous admission pulled, tip
cultured. ECG and CXR done. Head, cervical, abdomen & pelvis CT
done. Continued Vanco/Zosyn and Micafungin per ID recs.
Continued DVT prophylaxis, RISS. Patient found to have coccyx
decubiti and partially dehisced abdominal wound, incision-vac
dressing applied.  CT torso showed left pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis, persistent left abdominal wall defect,
unremarkable appearance of aortic graft, without evidence for
leak, and increased assymetric expansion of the left psoas
muscle.

[**2201-4-14**] HD1 Patient continued to have low BP and was given more
fluids. Blood cultures from 46/ showed GPC and GNRs.  Swab from
[**4-13**] eventually staph aureus, later found to be pansensitive.  BP
improved. Continuing daily blood cultures.  Physical therapy was
consulted for out of bed activity. Vanco d/c'd, continued on
Zosyn and Micafungin.  ID continued to actively follow.  Source
not immediately clear.  Possible PNA in left lower lung field.
Sputum culture was contaminated by OP flora.

[**2201-4-15**] HD2 Vitals stable. Transfered to [**Wardname 10876**] VICU. T maxed 101,
tachycardic (HR 108) treated with metoprolol prn and increased
scheduled dose. Had some episodes of shortness of breath - ABG
showed aPO2 of 74, CO2 35.

[**2201-4-16**] HD3 Continues to be febrile T max 101.1.  Continuing
daily blood cultures, BP borderlinely low. Patient in and out of
ventricular bigeminy. Electrolytes repleted. ID following-
antibiotic coverage switched to Dapto/Fluconazole and Zosyn
given GNR bacteremia.

[**2201-4-17**] HD4 Continues to have episode of hypotension de
