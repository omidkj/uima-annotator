Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted to OSH with L hip fracture following a mechanical fall.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia and management of femur
fracture.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Left hip hemiarthroplasty
Picc line


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of chronic afib,
inferior MI requiring PPM placment, CHF,left MCA stroke with
expressive aphasia, admitted to OSH with L hip fracture
following a mechanical fall. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICU admit
after an episode of respiratory distress with O2 sats in the
80s, but admitted to the floor after respiratory status
improved, with good oxygenation on 4 litres O2 by NC.
.
By report, CTA at OSH showed mild fluid overload, for which pt
was given 40 mg lasix 1v. He was also given ASA 81 and
ceftriaxone/vanc, presumably for concern for pneumonia in
setting of h/o MRSA bacteremia. Patient does have a history of
CHF, with last documented EF of 40% in [**3-10**]. This was improved
from an EF of 25% 11/05.
.
Per patient and patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is able to easily climb a
flight of stairs at baseline.  He denies CP, dyspnea, orthopnea,
PND or lower extremity swelling.
.
Since arrival on the floor, patient's respiratory status has
improved steadily. He is now at 100% O2 saturation on room air.

Past Medical History:
Chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation
CAD s/p RCA stent, [**2125**]
Inferior MI requring PPM placment for bradycardia, [**2125**]
Left MCA embolic stroke with residual expressive aphasia, [**2125**]
MRSA bacteremia [**2-6**] pacemaker wire infection, [**2131**].
S/p left carotid endarterectomy
S/p left retinal detachment
S/p appy

T98.1 HR97 BP124/64 RR18  O2sat 100% on RA
General: Pleasant elderly man.  Awake and alert but with
expressive aphasia/word finding difficulties
HEENT: Minor cut over left eyebrow; otherwise NCAAT
Neck: No JVD, left carotid bruit
CV:irregularly irregular, no murmurs/rubs/gallops.
Resp: Difficult exam because it is painful for pt to roll over.
Good air movement, no obvious rhonci or rales.
Abdomen: Tense musculature but non-tender, non-distended. No
hepatosplenomegaly.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2133-9-29**] 3:40 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: pulmonary infiltrates. signs of infection
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with continues leucocytosis and fever and
hypoxia despite Abx.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pulmonary infiltrates. signs of infection
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with leukocytosis, fever and hypoxia
despite antibiotics.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest x-rays dating back to
[**2125-11-16**], more recently from [**2133-9-15**] to [**2133-9-25**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest was performed following the
administration of 75 cc of intravenous Optiray. Images were
obtained with 1.25-mm slice thickness and displayed in soft
tissue and lung windows. Coronal reformatted images were also
obtained.

CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A right PIC catheter
terminates in the distal SVC. A left chest wall pacemaker has
leads adjacent to the right atrium and right ventricle. There is
no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The heart
and particularly the right atrium are enlarged. Mild
calcifications line the intrathoracic aorta. Moderate
calcifications line all three coronary arteries. Incidental note
is made of mild bilateral gynecomastia.

Layering, nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions are large on the
right and moderate on the left. Patchy consolidation in the
right upper lobe is consistent with infection. Right upper lobe
bronchus is severely narrowed by the right pulmonary artery.
Ground-glass opacity within the lingula may represent an
additional focus of infection versus residual of interstitial
edema. Relaxation atelectasis in both lower lobes is due to
underlying effusions.

Imaging of the upper abdomen is not sufficient for diagnosis. A
5-mm low- density lesion in the left liver lobe was not clearly
seen on prior CTs from [**2125-11-6**]. Calcified gallstones are seen
within an otherwise normal-appearing gallbladder. The spleen is
nonenlarged. The adrenal glands are normal. A right upper pole
renal cyst measures 25 x 23 mm and was present on [**2125-11-16**],
but appears slightly larger. An exophytic hyperdense cyst in the
left kidney is unchanged since [**2125-11-16**]. Two additional
low-density lesions are likely larger.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no findings concerning for malignancy
within the imaged bones. Degenerative changes are noted in the
upper lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:

1. Parenchymal consolidation in the right upper lobe is
consistent with infection.

2. Additional ground-glass opacity in the lingula may represent
infection or mild interstitial edema.

3. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic, layering pleural effusions, large
on the right and moderate on the left. Relaxation atelectasis
bilaterally.

4. Low-density lesions within both kidneys are stable or
slightly larger than [**2125-11-16**], and could be further evaluated
with ultrasound.

5. Cardiomegaly.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-9-25**] 11:57 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for acute CVA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with new dysphagia and slurred speech
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for acute CVA
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with new dysphagia and slurred
speech. Evaluate for acute CVA.

COMPARISONS: [**2133-9-23**].

FINDINGS: The appearance of the large left MCA territory infarct
with encephalomalacia and ex vacuo dilatation of the posterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is unchanged. There is a
stable central brain atrophy. There is mild periventricular
white matter hypodensities, consistent with chronic small vessel
angiopathy. A small lacunar infarct in the left external capsule
is unchanged. There are no new areas suggestive of infarction.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Atheroslcerotic
calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid arteries
bilaterally. Again noted is fluid in the right mastoid air cells
and mild thickening of several ethmoid air cells. The bony
structures and surrounding soft tissue structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged from [**2133-9-23**], without CT evidence for
new ischemic infarction.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23537**] on [**9-25**], [**2133**].

2. Fluid in the right mastoid air cells, which could represent
mastoiditis.
