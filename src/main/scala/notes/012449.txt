Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected right femoral above-knee popliteal prosthetic graft

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Excision of an infected graft, oversewing of above-knee
popliteal artery and femoral to below-knee popliteal artery with
non reverse saphenous vein and angioscopy.

2. Successful emergent PCI of mid LAD with a MINI VISION
2.5x28mm
bare-metal stent (BMS)

3. L femoral artery intra-aortic balloon pump advanced to
appropriate position via fluoroscopy for added hemodynamic
support post revascularization.


History of Present Illness:
This 65-year-old gentleman had a femoral above-
knee popliteal bypass with a prosthetic graft at another
institution in [**2111-12-4**]. The procedure was complicated by
an MRSA wound infection. Subsequently he developed a large
fluid collection around the graft which appeared clear on CT
scan. This was encompassing virtually all of the graft with a
large fluid collection of at least 10 cm in diameter in the
above-knee popliteal space. Arteriogram demonstrated that the
graft was patent with stenosis at the distal anastomosis and
runoff was via the posterior tibial and anterior tibial
arteries distally. He has had leg swelling and discomfort
from the large fluid collection although he has not
manifested septic symptoms and because of the persistent
nature of severe leg pain and difficulty walking, he was
advised to have the graft removed and replaced with vein
graft.

CXR:

Some vague opacification at the left base with poor definition
of the
hemidiaphragm suggests combination of atelectasis and effusion.
Some
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, though it is
accentuated by the lordotic view.

HEAD CT:

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or infarct. The ventricles and sulci are slightly
prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy. Calcifications
are present in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.

The patient has been extubated, with improvement in
nasopharyngeal secretions. Air-fluid levels in the bilateral
sphenoid sinuses have decreased. The remaining paranasal sinuses
are clear. Fluid opacification is seen in a few mastoid air
cells bilaterally. Note is made of bilateral lens replacements.


No bony fractures are identified. Diffuse anasarca and subgaleal
fluid
collections have resolved.

IMPRESSION: No fractures or intracranial hemorrhage.

CARDIAC ECHO:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
probable septal and anterior hypokinesis. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Mild symmetric LVH. The mid to distal anterior septum
and anterior wall are probably hypokinetic but are not well
seen. There may be other wall motion abnormalities. The right
ventricle is not well seen but is probably dilated/hypokinetic.
Large left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with history of DM2, HTN, HPL, PVD presented on [**2112-7-5**]
for excision of an infected prosthetic R femoral popliteal
bypass graft.

Briefly - He had a femoral above knee popliteal bypass with a
prosthetic graft at another institution in [**2111-12-4**] which
was  complicated by an MRSA wound infection and a large > 10 cm
fluid collection around the graft in the above-knee popliteal
space. Arteriogram demonstrated that the graft was patent with
stenosis at the distal anastomosis and runoff was via the
posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries distally. He had
leg swelling and discomfort from the large fluid collection and
difficulty walking.

Was admitted on [**2112-7-5**]  with infected prosthetic R femoral
popliteal bypass graft. He agreed to have an elective surgery.
Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC,
Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other preperations were
made.

On [**2112-7-5**] Excision of an infected graft, oversewing of
above-knee popliteal artery and femoral to below-knee popliteal
artery with non reverse saphenous vein and
angioscopy.

Post op Patient suffered hypoxic respiratory failure on
extubation post procedure. He
suffered a PEA arrest, and code blue was called.  CPR was
initiated and sinus rhythm returned. TEE was performed at the
time of the code which demonstrated severe anterior wall
hypokinesis.  He was in shock with systolics as low as 30-40,
and was started on a norepinephrine and epinephrine drips.  He
was transferred urgently to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory. Cath revealed 80% LAD stenosis, and a BMS was placed
in the proximal LAD with restoration of flow.  A IABP was placed
for
hemodynamic support.  He was tranferred back to the CVICU on
epi, levo, and milrinone and well as the IABP at 1:1.

In the CVICU, he spiked fevers as high as 101.7 and was covered
for infection broadly with vanc/zosyn/cipro. Transfused 2 U PRBC
for Hct 25 (-> 28). Patient gradually became more responsive.
troponin peaked at 10.31 on [**2112-7-7**]. IABP was removed on [**2112-7-8**].
Patient gradually weaned off milrinone and pressors and was
extubated on [**2112-7-10**].  TTE demonstrated LVEF of 35% (prior
70%)with anterior akinesis.

He was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. He was
maintained on heprin drip for wall motion abnormality. After
reviewing the echo it was decided to DC the heparin drip. He
will  be maintained on Plavix for at least a month and ASA for
life.

Also while in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable
he was delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was
obtained. When he was stabalized from the acute setting of post
operative care.
