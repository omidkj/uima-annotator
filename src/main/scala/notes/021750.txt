Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to the RCA,
HTN, and recently diagnosed melanoma, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with NSTEMI.  On [**7-27**], the patient developed chest pain
which awoke her from sleep.  She thought the chest pain was
indigestion and was treated with Maalox by her Rehab facility,
with improvement of symptoms. On Monday [**7-28**], pt re-developed
the pain and was again treated with Maalox, this time with no
relief.  She stated that the pain was sharp, [**7-9**], substernal,
non-radiating, and occured at rest.  She had associated
diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  EMS was called, and the
patient was found to have SBP 60's.  She was treated with IV
fluids and transferred to [**Hospital3 **].  There, she was found
to have a CK of 1441 and a troponin increase from 0.65 to 35.
She was loaded with 300 mg Plavix and started on heparin and NTG
gtts, and she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
This morning, the patient underwent Cardiac cath, which showed
severe 3VD without an obvious culprit lesion.  She was also
found to have severe LV diastolic heart failure (LVEDP of 35).
CT surgery was consulted, and they stated that the patient is
not a candidate for surgical intervention.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient states that she is
currently chest pain free.  She does complain of a headache, and
she states that she feels subjectively short of breath (at her
baseline).  Otherwise, the patient has no new complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH: [**7-29**]
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed severe multivessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had
proximal and distal 30% stenoses.  The LAD was moderately
calcified
with a near ostial 80% lesion.  There was diffuse disease of the

proximal-mid LAD to 50% before S1, a mid 65% lesion after S1 and
S2 and before D1 and a bifurcation lesion involving mid-LAD at
D1 which
extended to a 90% diffuse lesion in the mid-distal LAD after D1
with
twin distal LAD of only modest caliber and a D1 larger in
caliber than the distal LAD.  The LCx was moderately calcified
with anostial 30% and a proximal 50% lesion just before OM1.
Mid, serial 90-05% stenoses bracketing.
.
TTE [**7-30**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum and distal inferior and
anterior walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Coronary disease:
The patient has known CAD s/p RCA stent [**67**] years ago. She
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH with chest pain and cardiac
biomarker elevation, without significant ECG changes; consistent
with NSTEMI. Cardiac cath showed diffuse 3 vessel disease, with
no culprit lesion identified. Patient was transferred to CCU on
[**7-29**]. CT surgery was consulted, but felt that there were no good
distal targets for bypass. In addition, the patient was felt to
be a poor surgical candidate due to recent melanoma diagnosis.
The possibility of RCA stent was considered, but since patient
had no severe wall motion abnormalities in the RCA territory,
stent was not indicated. The patient was managed medically with
ASA, Plavix, statin, heparin gtt, and metoprolol. Metoprolol was
decreased to 12.5 mg [**3-3**] hypotension weekend of [**2166-8-2**]. Pt will
need to be restarted on ACE inhibitor at some point after
[**Date Range **] for her low EF. It was held during this hospital
course [**3-3**] hypotension and renal insufficiency.
.
2. HTN
The patient was hypertensive immediately after cath, and
received nitro gtt. Blood pressures normalized and nitro gtt was
D/Ced overnight. Pt later became mildly hypotensive (SBP
90-100s) with slight improvement by the end of her hospital
stay. Pt continued on her home metoprolol (decreased to 12.5
mg), ACE-I held.
.
3.Acute on chronic diastolic and systolic CHF:
The patient had evidence of elevated LVEDP in cath lab. She was
given 20 mg IV Lasix and diuresed 2L overnight the first night.
She continued to have evidence of volume overload including JVD,
crackles on exam, and CXR showing mild-moderate pulmonary edema.
Patient was given an additional 1
