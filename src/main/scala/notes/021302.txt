Brief Hospital Course:
After presentation to the ED, patient had a CT scan.  This
showed several very dilated loops of small bowel, a high grade
obstruiction, and a completely decompressed colon.  After
agressive resuscitation, including NG suction and crytalloid,
she was taken to the operating room on [**2170-3-9**] for lysis of
adhesions.

Post-operative course was complicated by acute on chronic CO2
retention, poor oxygenation, and hypotension.  On POD 10,
patient was transferred to the floor.  On POD 12 patient became
hypercarbic (has baseline CO2 retention), with increasing
respiratory distress.  While preparing to electively intubate,
patient had a PEA arrest.  Intubation was completed, and the
patient was quickly resuscitated.

Post-intubation status was gaurded.  Patient continued to have
a. fib.  She was lowly diuresed on a natrecor drip, but required
a swan-ganz [**Last Name (un) **] and drip for worsening CHF.  5 days later,
patient had a repeat arrest, again requiring CPR, but was
succesfully resuscitated.  On [**3-24**], she was cardioverted for
stable a. fib, but ultimately reverted back to a. fib.  On [**3-28**]
she uder went operative trachesotomy and placement of g-tube,
all without event.  Hospital course thereafter was uneventful,
responding well to PT, and tolerated TFs well.
