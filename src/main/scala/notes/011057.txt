Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 year old woman with coronary disease s/p CABG (no
stents) on aspirin and coumadin who presented with cholangitis.
A CT and RUQ ultrasound on admission showed CBD dilitation and
stones. She received ciprofloxacin and flagyl with improvement
in her fever, liver function tests, and all of her symptoms. She
underwent an unsuccessful ERCP on [**6-27**] (inability to visualize
the papilla). She underwent an MRCP that same day, which
demonstrated 2 large stones in the CBD with intra and
extra-hepatic dilitation. She underwent an [**Name (NI) 48373**] PTC
placement on [**6-29**] after 1 day of being pre-medicated due to a
contrast allergy (hives). The ERCP team attempted a rendezvous
procedure on [**6-30**] using the PTC, however, they were unable to
access the ampulla. The patient had a complicated anatomy from
gastric bypass in the [**2151**]. She underwent an IR guided
procedure for stone extraction on [**7-4**] which was successful but
was complicated with hypoxia and respiratory distress. She was
then admitted to MICU ([**7-5**]). She was initially placed on BiPap
but was weaned latter to 2 L nasal cannula. Hypoxic respiratory
distress was from decompensated CHF and flash pulmonary edema as
well as her COPD/asthma exacerbation and improved with diuresis
and bronchodilators. TTE showed no systolic failure but she may
had diastolic heart failure. She also received diltiazem for
several episodes of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular
rate and her beta blocker dose was increased. However,
Metoprolol was inadequate to treat her atrial fibrillation.
Digoxin was added with excellent contol (HR of 65-70) and
avoidance of excessive hypotension. Coumadin was held due to
procedures but she was started on lovenox 70 mg SC BID since
will need a repeat outpatient IR procedure (PTC) soon
(appointment was scheduled). Despite significant GI improvement,
she developed progressive right pleural effusion. She underwent
thoracentesis for diagnostic purpuses to rule out parapneumonic
effusion and effusion related to subdiaphragm process. She was
finally discharged to LTAC as her fluid analysis showed no
infection.........Before discharge, she was started on Augmentin
to treat mild infection of biliary drain exit site......
.
Instructions for LTAC: Please hold Lovenox on the day of
radiology appointment with IR as they may take the drain out.
She had an appointment for outpatient IR already. The external
drain was capped on [**7-9**] with no recurrence of her symptoms
despite eating a normal diet.
