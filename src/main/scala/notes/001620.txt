Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB X 9 days, worsening orthopnea, fatigue with exertion,
nonproductive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion [**2136-7-24**]
cardiac catheterization with stent placement [**2136-7-26**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 y/o man with PMH signficant for inferoposterior MI
[**11/2130**] (cath done at that time insignificant left main ds with
totally occluded LAD, distal circ stenosis and totally occluded
RCA s/p IABP and CABG with L internal mamm art to LAD and vein
graft to post desc artery, vein graft to obtuse marginal-
balloon pump weaned and EF improved to 15-20%), h/o Afib with
RVR and A flutter tx with Coumadin and Amiodarone, lost to
follow up until [**2136-7-17**] when he presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(PCP)'s office c/o 9 days of worsening SOB, worsening orthopnea,
fatigue with exertion, and non-productive cough with no chest
pain and found to be in Afib with RVR, LBBB, and CHF by clinical
presentation and CXR.  He was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with
dx of CHF.  Last echo was [**2136-7-17**] showing EF 10-15%, severe
diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, RV decr fxn, mod MR, mod
TR, PA systolic was 40mmHg.
.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], he was started on Carvedilol 6.25mg po bid, Lasix
40mg IV bid, Lisinopril 2.5mg po qd, hep gtt.  He was in
Aflutter with variable conduction, and was started on digoxin
0.125mg po qd.  On admission, he had wide complex tachy to 120,
when slowed- was Aflutter.  His bp dropped with these meds, to
80s-90s systolic without dizziness.  He remained extremely SOB,
however, +orthopnea (cannot sleep from any angle- sleeps sitting
up in bed on tray table.)  CXR at OSH c/w pulmonary edema with
b/l pleural effusions.
He ruled out for MI with 2 sets neg CE and 3 sets neg troponins.
 Because of his significant orthopnea and failure to diurese
despite IV lasix and hypotension, he was transferred here for
potential IV milrinone, possibly also needed atrial fib ablation
vs. cardioversion to NSR.

EKG at OSH shows Aflutter with variable conduction
EKG here: Atrial flutter with variable conduction, Rate 75bpm,
wide QRS c/w LBBB, ST elevation in V2, V3, and V4.
.
CXR [**2136-7-21**] here: with slight right pleural effusion, with
cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary arteries
.
CTA OSH: Suboptimal but otherwise neg for PE
.
ECHO [**7-20**]: EF:20%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
20 percent). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ECHO [**2136-7-24**]: no thrombus before DC cardioversion from Aflutter
to NSR.

1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-RCA. Occluded second SVG-RCA and SVG-OM. Patent
LIMA-LAD.
3. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
4. Depressed cardiac output and index.
5. Successful drug-eluting stenting of the LCX.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:  71 y/o man with h/o CAD, s/p 4 vessel CABG in the
past, ischemic cardiomyopathy, with h/o Atrial
fibrillation/flutter, lost to follow up from [**3-/2131**] to [**7-20**],
transferred from OSH in decompensated CHF and Aflutter. He is
now status post DC cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm; s/p
diuresis over 18 L total; s/p cardiac catheterization w/
stenting of his native LCX.
.
1.  CHF: His initial decompensation was likely subacute as he
was grossly volume overloaded w/ relatively minor sxs. We felt
this was a combination of dietary non adherance and atrial
flutter. The pt is much improved w/ diuresis, afterload
reduction and restoration of NSR.  We diuresed over 18L off of
the pt with IV lasix.  His blood pressures tolerated this well.
He will be discharged on CoReg, ACEI.  He will receive one more
dose of lasix prior to discharge and will need follow up
labwork.
His echo was done on [**2136-7-23**], showing EF of 20% with severe
global LV hypokinesis.
He has a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for potential
ICD placement.  His appt is [**8-29**], and he will have an
echocardiogram that same day.
.
2.  Coronary Artery Disease:  As there was some difficulty
obtaining prior cardiac records, and because his echo
demonstrated an EF of 20% with severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with depressed systolic function, we pursued workup
of his likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He went for cardiac
catheterization on [**2136-7-26**], demonstrating 2 of 3 vein grafts
down on cath; patent LIMA to LAD; s/p stent to native left
circumflex.  He did well post-cath, and will be discharged on
ASA/statin/BB/plavix, with follow up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was told that he must take his medications.  He
will have a repeat echo in [**8-20**].  He has an outpatient follow
up appt with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for potential ICD vs. BiV pacer
placement.
.
3.  Aflutter- He initially presented with atrial flutter with
variable conduction w/wide QRS c/w LBBB, ST elevation in V2, V3,
and V4. He is now s/p TEE/DC cardioversion to NSR, without
complications.  He remains in NSR.  He was given amiodarone
400mg po qd for 10 days, then switched to amiodarone 200mg po
qd.  For anticoagulation, we placed him on heparin gtt and
coumadin.  He will be discharged on coumadin 7.5mg po qd, with
f/u to his PCP to check INR.  His INR is therapeutic at 2.3.
.
4.  Hyperlipidemia
His lipid panel was checked:  TG 96, HDL 36, LDL 67.  We
continued his lipitor.  He will continue this medication after
discharge.
.
5.  Type II Diabe
