Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath [**6-30**], [**7-4**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 66309**] is a 63-year-old man with a history of
hypertension and intermittent chest discomfort with exertion. He
presented to the [**Hospital1 **] ED on the morning of admission
complaining of 1 hour of acute onset severe, non-radiating chest
pressure/ache, diaphoresis and mild shortness of breath. The pt
reports that he had been watching TV at home when his symptoms
abruptly began. He received SL NTG x 2 en route to the hospital.
At [**Hospital1 **], initial vitals were 97.9, 58, 12, 151/93, 96%
RA. He was still having pain on arrival and was given another SL
NTG. Initial EKG showed [**Known lastname **] elevations in all precordial leads as
well as leads I and II. CK checked there was 122, CKMB 0.70,
TropT <0.01. The patient was initiated on the STEMI protocol,
including clopidogrel load (600mg), ASA, atorvastatin,
Integrillin and was started on a heparin drip. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], the pt's chest pain was improved but persistent. He was
taken emergently to the cardiac cath lab where angiography
demonstrated total occlusion of the LAD. Two overlapping DESs
were placed to the LAD lesion with an excellent angiographic
result. Elevated filling pressures were also noted at that time.

.
In discussing the patient's prior symptoms, he reports that
three years ago he was hospitalized at [**Hospital 26380**] Hospital for
chest discomfort. He was apparently diagnosed with hypertension
at that time, but is unaware of any other significant findings.
Since then, he has experienced mild, non-radiating chest
pressure with exertion (always when running, occasionally when
climbing a flight of stairs). This is associated with some SOB
and seems to have been getting worse lately.
.
On review of systems, the patient endorses some decrease in his
urinary stream of late. He otherwise denies any recent fevers,
chills or rigors. No cough or wheeze. No palpitations. No PND.
No abdominal symptoms. No discolored stools. No other urinary
symptoms beyond those described above. Denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.



Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension
2. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- seminoma s/p left testicular resection in [**2116**]

of urine flow


Social History:
Divorced. Lives alone at home. Completed college. Works as a
medical supply courier.
-Tobacco history: never
-ETOH: rare
-Illicit drugs: denies


Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death. The pt's father died at age 65 from
Parkinson's disease. His mother died at age 81 from
complications due to a hip fracture; she was told she was
"pre-diabetic." The pt's brother died from CHF at age 73 but
also suffered from advanced HIV/AIDS. The pt has three sisters;
one developed MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 82929**]. He has one daughter who is
healthy.

Cardiac Cath [**6-30**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
significant stenoses.  The LAD had a 100% occlusion in the
mid-vessel
just after the take-off of a large diagonal branch.  The LCX had
a 60%
distal stenosis.  The RCA had a 80% mid-vessel stenosis and a
50% distal
stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular
filling
pressures as above, with low-normal cardiac output and normal
systemic
blood pressure and mixed venous saturation suggesting
compensated heart
failure.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with overlapping
2.5 x 28
mm and 3.0 x 12 mm Xience DES which were post dilated to 3.0 and
3.5
respectively at high pressures. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis in the stents, no dissection and TIMI III flow. (See
PTCA
comments)
4. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French
Angioseal
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful stenting of the mid LAD.
4. Right femoral angioseal.

CARDIAC CATH, [**7-4**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no anagiographically apparent
flow
limiting lesions. The LAD stent was widely patent and there was
ostial
stenosis of both diagonals. The LCX had no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting lesions. The RCA was a dominant vessel with an 80%
mid
vessel stenosis and a 40% distal stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamcis revealed normal systemic
pressure.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.0 x 12 mm Xience
DES
which was post dilated with a 3.0 balloon at high pressure.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no
dissection
and TIMI III flow.
5. Left femoral arteriotomy site was closed witha 6 French
Angioseal
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA.

TTE [**6-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic
anteroseptum, severe hypokines of the inferoseptum, distal
inferior and lateral hypokinsis and apical akinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with
coronary artery disease.
