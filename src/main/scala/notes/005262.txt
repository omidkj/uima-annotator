Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2153-2-15**]  10:12:38 AM


Sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions. Left
axis deviation.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction. Anterior T wave
inversions.
Non-specific lateral T wave changes. Rule out anterior
myocardial ischemia.
Compared to tracing #1 anterior T wave inversions are prominent.

TRACING #2

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2153-2-5**].

The cardiomegaly is moderate-to-severe, unchanged. Mediastinal
contours are stable.
Bilateral hilar enlargement and increase in interstitial
markings are consistent with mild volume overload although no
overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. These findings might also
represent infection such as viral or atypical bacterial such as
mycoplasma. No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:

Described finding consistent with either mild volume overload or
pulmonary infection such as viral or atypical bacterial.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the phone at the
time of dictation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CHEST RADIOGRAPH OBTAINED ON [**2153-2-14**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with altered mental status,
tachypnea, rigors, evaluate for pneumonia.

FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Comparison is made with limited views through the lower chest on
subsequently performed CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
Cardiomegaly is noted. There is no overt CHF. Blunting at the
right CP angle, likely related to small pleural effusions seen
better on the CT abdomen and pelvis performed subsequently.
There is coarsening of interstitial markings along the periphery
of both lungs, which is compatible with patient's known
interstitial lung disease, also better assessed on corresponding
CT abdomen and pelvis images. Pulmonary vasculature is within
normal limits. Mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable.
Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob is noted.
There is no pneumothorax. No displaced rib fractures are seen.
Bones are osteopenic. Visualized upper abdomen demonstrates an
unremarkable bowel gas pattern. Degenerative changes are noted
in the thoracic and visualized portions of the lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:

Cardiomegaly, small right
