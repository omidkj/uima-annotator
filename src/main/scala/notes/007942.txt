History of Present Illness:
46 year-old male with DMI with recent admission for DKA and
metastatic NSCLC s/p XRT recently started on chemotherapy
admitted with altered mental status. He was found by EMS in his
home in his underwear, incontinent of urine - what led EMS to
come to his home is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] review of OMR, patient had not
taken insulin in 3 days for unknown reason. Of note, patient
recently admitted with DKA, though at that time was reportedly
taking his medications as directed.
.
In the ED, 98.8 136 111/55 18 96% RA. Patient was noted to be
diaphoretic, ill-appearing, and with Kussmaul respirations.
Initial laboratory evaluation was significant for K 8.3, HCO3 8,
glucose 1290, anion gap 43, ketonuria. EKG showed peaked T
waves; patient received calcium gluconate, 1 amp HCO3, albuterol
nebs. He did not received Kayexelate given concern for not being
able to protect airway. Potassium subsequently came down to 6.1
with unchanged EKG findings. He received 5L NS and was also
started on an insulin drip, currently at a rate of 6 units per
hour. An 18G PIV and triple lumen (right groin) were placed.
Urine studies did not reveal infection. On transfer, patient
with persistent AMS, unable to answer questions. He has remained
afebrile and with improved heart rate following fluid
resuscitation; 170/72, 99%RA, 20-26. Of note, head CT was
initially ordered given AMS, but not done once laboratory data
returned.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is unable to provide further
history, and no further information is available in chart.
Patient unable to provide review of systems. Does complain of
nausea.

Past Medical History:
- NSCLC - Stage 4 disease, initially presented early [**Month (only) **] with
N/V secondary to his diabetic gastroperesis. During that
admission, he was found to have a right effusion and a large 4.6
x 7.6 x 7.7 cm right hilar mass of slightly heterogeneous
texture and infiltrative margins with peribronchial wall
infiltration and septal thickening suggestive of lymphangitic
carcinomatosis. His pleural fluid and TBNA/EBBX of the mass all
were positive for NSCLCA. He had PET scan on [**6-24**] were he was
found to have complete collapse of the right right lung and
large pleural effusion s/p pleurex catheter placement for
recurrent effusion [**Date range (1) 95587**], 10 rounds of radiation.
- DM type 1, followed by [**Last Name (un) **], with history of DKA (last
admission in [**2175**]) and also history of seizures related to
hypoglcyemia. Complicated by gastroparesis.
- Bipolar disorder - last manic episode 2.5 years ago. Denies
recent depressive episodes. [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalizations
?schizophrenia documentation in prior notes: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 95588**]C (psychiatrist).
- Dyslipidemia
- HTN


Social History:
Per prior [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note: He lives with his wife in
[**Name (NI) 1411**]/[**Location (un) 686**]. He used to smoke [**12-29**] PPD x 7 years, quit 1
month ago since diagnosis of lung ca, denies ETOH. Currently on
leave from work due to medical illness.

Family History:
Per prior [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note: Father died of Lung Ca at age 50
(Non-smoker-Probable asbestos exposure) and was apparently an
alcoholic as well. Mother diagnosed with colon ca age 43 and
died at 63 of mets to lungs/brain. Brother with a history of
alcoholism and depression.

Micro:
[**8-10**], [**8-12**] Bcx: pending
[**8-10**], [**8-12**] UCx: no growth
[**8-12**] Sputum: Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with
upper respiratory secretions. Bacterial culture results are
invalid.
[**8-10**] MRSA: negative
.
Imaging:
CXR [**8-10**] on admission (compared to [**2176-7-16**]): 1. Interval
worsening of aeration of the right lung, likely due to
combination of increased right pleural effusion and
post-obstructive collapse due to known right hilar mass.
Superimposed consolidation is not excluded. 2. Left lung remains
well aerated.
.
Abdomen x-ray [**8-10**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without signs
of bowel obstruction or free intra-abdominal air. There is
prominent amount of stool seen throughout the cecum and the
rectum.
.
CXR [**8-12**]:  Compared to [**7-16**] through [**8-11**]: Right lung is
now entirely collapsed with little if any increase in the volume
of right pleural effusion. Tubing projecting over the left lower
lung obscures what appears to be developing consolidation. Left
upper lobe is clear. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric
tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pleural
effusion.
.
[**8-13**] CT chest: 1. In situ pulmonary thrombosis, right interlobar
artery.
2. Interval complete collapse of the right upper lobe,
progression of right lower lobe and middle lobe collapse.
3. Unchanged endobronchial mass within the right lower lobe
bronchus and
unchanged severe loculated right pleural effusion.
4. Unchanged multiple sub-5-mm pulmonary metastases, left lung.

5. New small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.

6. Small amount of fluid within the gallbladder fossa is most
likely due to fluid overload.
.
[**8-13**] CT Head: No evidence for hemorrhage. No large acute
territorial infarct is identified.
.
[**8-14**] LENI: Occlusive thrombus within one of the paired left
posterior tibial veins and the left peroneal vein. There is
nonocclusive thrombus mobile within the lumen of the right
common femoral vein.
.
[**8-15**] (PRELIM) Successful placement of infrarenal non-retrievable
IVC filter.
.
[**8-12**] Bronchoscopy: endobronchial lesion from carina to RLL
subsegments - all of these orifices appeared narrowed,
erythematous and edematous, easily collapsible. ?Extrinsic
compression. No obvious secretions/mucous plugs.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 95589**]:
#. diabetes type I, ketoacidosis:  Pt with type I DM. Pt had
hyperglycemia, acidosis, large anion gap, and ketonuria, large
osmolar gap on admission, with partial respiratory compensation.
Serum potassium elevated on admission although likely total body
