History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3761**] is a 79 year old woman with recurrent NSCLC IIIA
adenocarcinoma of the left lung with metastatic disease of the
lung, pleura and lymph nodes who presented today with dyspnea
and found to have PE on CTA in the ED.  The patient describes
dyspnea x several weeks; worse with exertion. Was seen by her
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**], on [**2169-10-11**] due to her dyspnea and
was diagnosed with PNA based on exam and RLL infiltrate on CXR.
Started on a 7-day azithro course. Since that visit, Ms. [**Known lastname 3761**]
has noted significant worsening of her dyspnea and for that
reason presented today. Notes cough x several weeks.
.
On the oncology floor the paitent was given Lovenox and
antibiotics changed to levofloxacin. Initially on 2L O2 NC
although was saturating in the 80% range. Oxygen supplementation
increased to 6L NC and saturations reached the high 80s.
Escalated to NRB and the patient was saturating a 100%. Appeared
anxious but comfortable around 1700. Attempts were made to wean
the patient off of the NRB although she had continuous
desaturations on NC only. At 2200, the patient was noted to have
increased WOB and was transferred to the MICU for further
observation and possibly NIPPV.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's initial VS were 97.1 117/49 90
21 95% NRB. In mild discomfort due to resp distress with desats
to high 80s with small movements.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 79 year old female with advanced NSCLC admitted
with respiratory distress from newly diagnosed PE, pneumonia,
and volume overload.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
On the oncology floor the paitent was given Lovenox and her
antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin. Initially on 2L O2 NC
although was saturating in the 80% range. Oxygen supplementation
increased to 6L NC and saturations reached the high 80s.
Escalated to NRB and the patient was saturating a 100%. Appeared
anxious but comfortable around 1700. Attempts were made to wean
the patient off of the NRB although she had continuous
desaturations on NC only. At 2200, the patient was noted to have
increased WOB and was transferred to the MICU for further
observation and possibly NIPPV.
.
In the MICU, the patient continued to saturate in the low 90s on
facemask. Deep desaturation when moving. CXR appeared worse and
abx broadened to cef/vanc. The patient did not require NIPPV
although could not be weaned from the facemask initially.
Diuresed well with net negative ~1L to 20mg IV lasix daily, and
subsequent improvement in oxygenation. Respiratory issues
thought to be secondary to pulmonary embolus, pulmonary edema,
PNA, and lung cancer. She was anti-coagulated, diuresed, and
treated with an 8 day course of vancomycin and cefepime.
.
OMED Course:
# Dyspnea: She presented with several weeks of progressive
dyspnea and developed a significant oxygen requirement shortly
after arrival to the floor requiring ICU transfer.  Her dyspnea
is mulitfactorial including advanced NSCLC, new diagnosis of PE
in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, pneumonia, and
volume overload.  She was treated with Lovenox, antibiotics, and
diuresis in the ICU with some improvement in her respiratory
status.  On floor transfer, she was on 6L NC with SpO2 in the
low 90s, but desatting to the 80s with activity.  She triggered
[**2169-10-21**] for persistent SpO2<90% on facemask, and was diuresed
overnight.  Her respiratory status was more stable the next day.
 She was provided supplemental oxygen as needed and Albuterol
and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments.  The multiple conditions
contributing to her dyspnea were managed as discussed below.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism: This was a new diagnosis found on
admission CTA [**2169-10-15**] with emboli to right upper, middle, and
lower lobes.  Most likely related to underlying malignancy.  She
was treated with Enoxaparin Sodium 60 mg SC Q12H.
.
# Pneumonia: She was started on Azithromycin prior to admission
by her oncologist due to concern for CAP after presenting with
cough and dyspnea.  Admission CTA on [**2169-10-15**] showed new (from
[**2169-9-21**]) ground glass and interstitial opacities throughout the
RLL and inferior RUL concerning for atypical pneumonia.  She was
started on Levofloxacin on admission and broadened to Vancomycin
and Cefepime on [**2169-10-16**] for a worsening CXR.  Azithromycin was
continued, completing a 5 day course.  Blood cultures from
[**2169-10-15**] showed no growth.  She was not febrile during her stay.
 Her cough improved after admission, but returned on [**2169-10-21**].
Portable CXR on [**2169-10-21**] showed a stable right sided infiltrate
but increased left pulmonary edema.  Her WBC count has steadily
after floor transfer from 8.9 on [**2169-10-19**] to 16.6 on [**2169-10-22**]
with neutrophil predominance on differential.  Her Vancomycin
trough on [**2169-10-22**] was 25.6, her AM dose was held, and her dose
was adjusted.
.
# Volume Overload: Cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary edema
was noted on recent CXRs.  TTE on [**2169-7-14**] showed LVEF 55-60%
without other significant abnormalities.  Her left sided
pulmonary edema may be due to elevated right heart pressures in
the setting of her right sided PEs.  Pulmonary edema is likely
contributing to her dyspnea.  She was diuresed in the ICU using
Furosemide 20 mg IV doses with a daily fluid balance goal of
negative 1000 ml.  Some radiographic improvement was noted on
ICU imaging, but recent CXR showed increased left sided
pulmonary edema.  Diuresis has continued on the floor with fair
response, but her creatinine increased to 1.2 on [**2169-10-22**] AM
from baseline 0.9 yesterday.  It increased further to 1.4 on PM
labs despite no further diuresis that morning.
.
# Anxiety: Moderate anxiety at baseline treated with Citalopram,
exacerbated by recent illness.  Likely contributing somewhat to
her tachypnea and respiratory distress.  She was continued on
her home Citalopram 20 mg PO daily.
.
# Advanced NSCLC: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**] here.  Plan per recent
Oncology note was to pursue three additional cycles of
Pemetrexed
