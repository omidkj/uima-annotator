Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2160-6-4**] and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a left total hip
arthroplasty without complication.  Please see operative report
for details. Postoperatively the patient was transferred from
the PACU to the SICU for postoperative hypoxia secondary to
sleep apnea and analgesic effects.  The patient was placed on
CPAP and monitored carefully; he was transferred to the floor on
POD1.  The patient was initially treated with a PCA followed by
PO pain medications on POD#1.  The patient received IV
antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, as well as lovenox for
DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The drain was
removed without incident on POD#1. The Foley catheter was
removed without incident. The surgical dressing was removed on
POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean, dry, and
intact without erythema or purulent drainage.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to home with
services or rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was weight bearing as tolerated with
posterior precautions.
