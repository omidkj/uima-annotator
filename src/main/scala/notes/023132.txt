History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50873**] is a 62 year-old man with a history of THR and septic
hip who presnts on transfer from an OSH with a septic hip.

Initially presented to an OSH on [**3-1**] with hip pain severe
enough to make him unable to ambulate. A CT abdomen showed focal
fluid collection along the superficial posterolateral aspect of
the right hip. His WBC was 20 with ESR of 125. Blood cultures
grew out GPC in pairs/chains/cluters and he underwent
fluoroscopic guided aspiration of the THR on [**3-2**]. The aspirate
showed GPCs. Also noted to have elevated troponins (0.113,
0.541, 0.91) and was started on Lovenox 60mg SC BID.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was swifty taken to the OR.

AP PELVIS AND AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HIP.
The patient is status post right THR, with cemented femoral
stem. There is acetabular protrusio. No periprosthetic lucency
to suggest loosening is identified. The extreme distal tip of
this long femoral stem component is not included on these films.
Skin staples are present. Residue of oral contrast is present in
bowel.

RIGHT KNEE, TWO VIEWS.
No true lateral view is identified, and there is overlying
trauma board artifact. There is evidence of osteopenia and
probable degenerative change, not well assessed on this exam.
There is some subchondral lucencies -- the appearance is not
typical for osteomyelitis and is more likely to represent
osteopenia.

RIGHT LOWER LEG, TWO VIEWS.
No suspicious focal lytic or sclerotic lesion to confirm the
presence of osteomyelitis is identified. Scattered phleboliths
noted.

CXR [**2202-3-3**]: there is again diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings. The findings are again consistent with pulmonary
edema, though some chronic pulmonary disease cannot be excluded.
Endotracheal tube is now in place with its tip approximately 5.5
cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter extends to lower portion
of the SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 62 year-old man with a history of prior THR and
septic hip; again presenting with septic joint and bacteremia.


#. Septic joint / bacteremia: The patient presented to an
outside hospital as above with pain, elevated WBC/ESR, GPC
bacteremia and GPC on aspirate from hip.  Cultures grew both
MRSA and Group B strep. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was
taken to the OR for wash-out on [**3-2**] with subsequent irrigation
and debridement of the right hip with removal of the
polyethylene on the acetabular side and the femoral head from
the femoral side with replacement components on [**3-8**]. Post op he
became febrile to 102 with new levophed requirement, which
subsequently improved without change in antibiotics. The patient
was placed on a course of high dose ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and
rifampin.

# L foot osteomyelitis / lower extremity ulcers.  Plain films
were without clear evidence of osteomyelitis but he was debrided
and cultured by podiatry. Cultures grew out the same MRSA and
GBS as above. Lower extremity ulcers monitored and adressed by
plastics.  An MRI if the lower extremities did not show other
areas of osteomyelitis. Prior to discharge the podiatry service
felt as if the surgical wound was well-healed and signed-off.

# Epidural abscess of cervical spine:  During his course the
patient developed swelling of his left arm followed by weakness
of proximal muscles.  He was evaluated for DVT, brachial plexus
injury, bony injury. Finally, a cervical spine MRI showed
evidence of phlegmon, discitits, osteo at C5-6.  He went to the
OR on [**3-18**] for anterior and posterior approach to washout as
above.  OR cultures were negative but as above he will continue
an 8 week course of antibiotics starting from his OR date of
[**3-18**]. The patient will conclude his antibiotic course on
[**2202-5-14**].

# LGIB: The patient developed an episode of large bright red
blood per rectum on [**3-9**]; had tagged RBC study showing bleed
within 6 minutes. He went to angio with IR; had coiling to the
mid-colic artery with successful hemostasis. GI and general
surgery also involved but did not require further intervention.
Later in the hospitalization the patient had a fall in his
hematocrit from a stable 21 to 17. He had one guaiac positive
stool and was given 2 units of PRBCs. The patient's hematocrit
was subsequently stable at 24-26. Further stools were guaiac
negative. The GI service was further contact[**Name (NI) **] but felt that
endoscopy was not indicated.

# Left lung collapse: The patient had a bronch on [**3-6**] for white
out of his entire L lung. A large mucous plug was removed,
however still with some obstruction of lingula. The bronch
showed some generalized narrowing without focal lesion -
possibly related to past lung resection.  Bronchial washings
were without growth on culture.  He had subsequent CXRs
demonstrating improved expansion of his left lung. With further
mobilization, incentive spirometry, ans chest physical therapy,
the patient continued to saturate in the low to mid 90s without
the need for oxygen.

# Dysphagia: Following cervical spine surgery, the patient had
evidence of dysphagia on bedside and video swallow. Initially an
NG tube was placed. A PEG tube was subsequently placed given the
prolonged nature of the patient's dysphagia. At the time of
discharge the patient continues to have PO trials with tube
feeds as the principal source of nutrition.

#. Acute renal failure: Mild creatinine elevation on admission
that resolved quickly following admission with some hydration.

#. Atrial fibrillation: Following stabilization post-GI bleed,
the patient's beta-blocker was titrated up until his rate was
controlled.
