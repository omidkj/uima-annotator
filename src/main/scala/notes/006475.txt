Chief Complaint:
Acute mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular central line
Intubation [**2110-2-22**]


History of Present Illness:
54F with h/o hepatic sarcoid (cirrhosis), grade 2 esophageal
varices, [**1-18**] TIPS procedure, h/o GIB (colonic avm and
diverticulum), idipathic CM with EF 40-45%, h/o CVA and SAH with
aneurysms p/w altered mental status to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital
ED-->[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
[**Name (NI) **] husband reports pt was normal last evening, however
this morning was noted to be somnolent and difficult to arouse.
He states that she had been feeling well since her most recent
discharge on [**2110-2-18**] and mental status was clear when she went to
bed the night PTA.  Her husband reports compliance with
medications (although this has been a concern on her 2 most
recent hospitalizations) and states she has had [**4-15**] BMs
daily--it was later revealed that she was not taking her
lactulose.   He reports she had not been c/o fever/chills,
dysuria, cough, abdominal pain, N/V/diarrhea, blood in stool.
She was taken to [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where she was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED as she gets her care here.
.
In the ED here initial vitals were 99.8  86  112/66  20  95%RA.
She was unarousable and was intubated in this setting for airway
protection.  Ammonia was 159 (224 at presentation last admission
for hepatic encephalopathy).  CT head was negative for acute
intracranial process.  She was afebrile and without elevated WBC
count.  CXR was negative for infiltrate.  She was guaiac
negative on rectal exam with hard stool in vault (concern for
med noncompliance given pt. on lactulose as outpatient).  UA was
negative.  Paracentesis was not performed but she received
Ceftriaxone 1g IV and Vancomycin 1g IV for empiric coverage.
She also received 45g lactulose.
.
Of note, she was admitted [**Date range (1) 29553**] for altered mental
status thought [**3-15**] hepatic encephalopathy and med noncompliance.
 LP was negative during that admission.
.
She was then readmitted [**Date range (1) 29554**]/08 with symptoms of worsening
abdominal distention, N/V and was found on CT to have e/o SBO.
She was kept NPO with NGT in place with resolution of SBO.
Imaging during that admission demonstrated complete occlusion of
the left portal vein and distal branches of the right portal
vein, the proximal right portal vein and main portal vein were
patent, the TIPS was patent and enhanced appropriately.  She was
transiently started on heparin gtt at that time, but this was
discontinued prior to discharge without plan for anticoagulation
given her history of aneurysms and SAHs.
.
ROS:  Unable to obtain from patient given intubated/sedated.
Per husband, patient was without complaints since last d/c on
[**2110-2-18**].  No fevers/chills, no N/V/diarrhea, no
dysuria/hematuria.  No cough/SOB.  No confusion prior to this
am.
