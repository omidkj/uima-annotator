Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Keflex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Upper extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C5-C6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion, C1 tumor
removal

History of Present Illness:
55-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension,
severe peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease s/p R SFA stent angioplasty
and L SFA stent placement, congenital pulmonic valve stenosis,
CAD s/p BMS stents, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation s/p
ablation on warfarin, stage 3 diabetic nephropathy, intradural
tumor compressing his spinal cord at C1/C2, who was admitted on
[**2176-8-29**] to neurosurgery for anterior cervical decompression at
C5/6 fusion ([**8-29**]) and extradural tumor removal of C1 intradural
tumor ([**8-30**]).

The patient was post-operatively managed in the ICU with a
dexamethasone taper. He developed a small subdural hematoma
([**8-30**]) with no new neurologic symptom. Aspirin and heparin SC
were restarted. Clopidogrel, for L SFA stent, is scheduled to be
restarted on POD#5, [**2176-9-4**], and warfarin, for atrial
fibrillation, to be restarted on [**2176-9-9**].

Patient was extubated on [**9-1**], and is coming off a furosemide
drip for dCHF. [**Month/Day (4) **] is following the patient for a mottled
right foot and his recent [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] procedures.

Patient's other medical issues diabetes, HTN, CKD (Cr 1.1),
atrial fibrillation (HRs 70s-80s), CAD s/p stent and "chronic
hyponatremia" (Na 138) have been stable. Transfer is requested
for ongoing management of diastolic CHF.

On evaluation in the SICU before transfer, patient was sleeping
but arousable, complaining of old back pain and of constipation.
Vital signs were stable with O2 saturation 98% on 3L.


Past Medical History:
(1) Type 2 diabetes mellitus, requiring insulin, and the
complications from years of poor glycemic control:
-hypertension
-severe peripheral [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] disease
-peripheral neuropathy
-pressure, venous stasis, and neuropathic ulcers on his right
and left lower extremities
-stage 3 diabetic nephropathy
-renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.5 to 1.7)
(2) Atrial fibrillation status post ablation [**2169**] and [**2174**], on
coumadin
(3) Congenital pulmonic valve stenosis status post two childhood
surgeries
-history of RV failure
-history of peripheral edema and anasarca
(4) Chronic hyponatremia
(5) Chronic low back pain status post car accident
(6) Spinal cord meningioma compressing his spinal cord at C1/C2
(7) COPD
(8) Coronary artery disease status post stenting [**2169**] (bare
metal stent by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8725**])) and repeat
stenting at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2174**] (bare metal stent - see d/c summary
[**2175-2-7**])
(9) MI in [**2161**]

Social History:
The patient is married and has two adult sons who do not live at

home. He lives in [**Hospital1 1474**], MA. His wife works 60 hours a week,
and he is left at home for most of the day. He has been bedbound

for several years. A visiting nurse can only come once a week to

change the dressings on his lower extremity ulcers. His sons
struggle with alcoholism and heroin abuse. His younger son has
recently threatened suicide and homicide (against the patient's
wife), a source of much stress at home. He used to work as a
"bouncer" and in construction, and enjoyed riding his
motorcycle. The patient says he tries to keep a positive
attitude about his condition. He says he feels depressed, but
says he is not interested in therapy or medication for
depression. He has not seen his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2
years because he will only travel in an ambulance but his PCP's
office is in touch with the patient and wife weekly.
-[**Name2 (NI) **] has a 2 pack per year smoking history for "several years"
-He drinks alcohol occasionally, and has never had a problem
with alcoholism
-He denies recreational or IV drug use

IMAGING STUDIES:
# C-spine Xray [**8-29**]: Single lateral view of the cervical spine
obtained portably in the OR, labeled #1. C1 through the C4/5
disc space is visualized. The C5 vertebral body is faintly seen
-- bony structures lower than this are obscured by overlying
soft tissues. However, surgical markers are seen overlying the
anterior aspects of the C4-5 and C5-6 disc spaces, from an
anterior approach. Support tubing and temperature probles noted.


# C-spine CT [**2176-8-29**]:
1. New interval C5-C6 anterior fusion with intervertebral disc
spacer, no
immediate hardware complication. Post-surgical changes in the
soft tissue
with subcutaneous emphysema mostly in the right submandibular
region.
2. Mass at C1 level with associated cord compression consistent
with known
meningioma better described on recent MRI.
3. Soft tissue thickening at the right lung apex, not fully
characterized on the current CT. In comparison with CT neck from
[**2176-8-9**], it has increased in size. CT chest is
recommended to evaluate this further, if clinically warranted.

# Head CT [**2176-8-30**]:
1. New interval left frontal subdural hyperdense extra-axial
fluid collection with new interval subdural subfalcine
extra-axial hyperdense fluid collection, indicating subdural
hemorrhage, likely post-surgical but clinical correlation
recommended.
2. Pneumocephalus with distribution at the basilar cisterns,
mostly at the
left sylvian fissure, and bifrontally at the falx, likely
post-surgical, and additionally in the posterior fossa near the
site of the occipital craniotomy.
3. Post-surgical changes with left craniotomy at the occipital
bone and
laminectomy at C1 with subcutaneous emphysema and hyperdense
products, likely post-surgical.
4. Soft tissue hyperdensity at the posterior parietal, occipital
soft tissue region, could be small post-surgical hematoma.
.
# C-spine MRI [**2176-8-31**]: Status post resection of C1 extradural
tumor, likely meningioma with expectorated postoperative
changes. No large intraspinal hematoma seen. There remains some
persistent narrowing of the spinal canal at C1 level with
indentation on the posterior aspect of the spinal cord.
Continued followup recommended. Mild spinal cord atrophy could
be secondary to chronic myelomalacia.
.
# LE arterial Duplex [**2176-9-3**]: The peak systolic velocity
involving the native right common femoral artery is 104 cm/sec.
Velocities within the superficial femoral artery range from 85
to 234 cm/sec and that within the popliteal artery on the right,
is 25 cm/sec. On the left, peak systolic velocity within the
common femoral artery is 132 cm/sec, SFA, velocities range from
146-75 cm/sec and that within the popliteal artery is 85 cm/sec.

IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicate widely
patent common
femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries bilaterally.

.
PATHOLOGY:
# C1 tumor [**2176-8-30**]: Cervical medullary junction tumor:
Meningioma, psammomatous subtype (WHO Grade I). The tumor is
composed of meningothelial cells with numerous psammoma bodies
and collagen deposition with no typical features or mitotic
activity.
