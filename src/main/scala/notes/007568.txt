[**2121-10-9**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with akinesis of the basal and
mid inferior and inferolateral segments. Due to suboptimal image
quality additional wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated with normal gradient. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargment. Normal left ventricular cavity
size with moderately depressed left ventricular systolic
function and regional wall motion abnormalities as described
above. Normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve with
trace aortic regurgitation. Well-seated, normally functioning
mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-9-27**],
the pulmonary artery systolic pressure has increased from 38
mmHg to at least 44 mmHg.

[**2121-10-12**] RENAL U.S. PORT: The right kidney measures 11.3 cm in
its long axis. In the mid pole of right kidney is a 1.8 x 0.9 x
1.2 cm, anechoic, well-circumscribed region compatible with a
simple cyst. The left kidney measures 12.1 cm in its long axis.
Neither kidney demonstrates stones or hydronephrosis. Both
kidneys demonstrate global color Doppler flow. Transverse an
