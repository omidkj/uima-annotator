SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a previously healthy
56-year-old male who presents with trachea-bronchomalacia.
The patient underwent an uncomplicated tracheoplasty and
bilateral bronchoplasty with Marlex mesh placement on [**2130-6-26**].  Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the CSRU
for potential postoperative respiratory complications.

By postoperative day #1, the patient remained comfortable,
extubated, with chest tube which showed no evidence of air
leak.  By postoperative day #2, the patient was doing well,
continued to improve on chest physiotherapy.

Since the patient had been continuing to improve, physical
therapy evaluation was sought, and he was begun on endurance
training, as well as discharge planning on postoperative day
#3.  By this time, the patient was transferred to the floor
with the chest tube removed while continuing the chest
physiotherapy.  Because the patient was beginning to clear
his own secretions without difficulty, chest physiotherapy
was weaned, and the patient's epidural, as well as [**Known lastname 8389**] were
removed on postoperative day #4 in anticipation of discharge.
By postoperative day #5, the patient cleared the required
Level 5 status of physical therapy, and the decision was made
to discharge the patient to home in good condition.
