Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with Brochoscopy with BAL x 2


History of Present Illness:
80F with COPD, CHF, and hypertension presenting with acute
hypoxia. She was recently discharged on [**2140-10-28**] from [**Hospital1 18**] after
a complicated hospital stay that was notable for c. dif colitis,
hospital acquired MSSA pneumonia, acute on chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure, urinary tract infection, and new onset
atrial fibrillation. She completed a course of therapeutic po
vanc but as she was to have a course of levofloxacin until
[**2140-11-6**] the po vanc was continued as well. The decision to
anti-coagulate her for atrial fibrillation was deferred to her
outpatient provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was discharged to [**Hospital1 9494**]-[**Location (un) 701**] on [**2140-10-28**] for pulmonary rehab. On [**11-1**] a CT
chest showed LLL bronchus intra-lumen mucous impaction and LLL
actelectasis and infiltrate. There was a right sided pleural
effusion with associated atectasis. There was no PE or
pneumothorax.

On admission she was noted to be ~80% on room air and acutely
short of breath while during a bath with the nurse. Prior to
transfer she was given solumedrol, levofloxacin (started on
[**2140-11-2**]), and vancomycin IV. Of note a vancomycin level was >40
prior to transfer.

Upon arrival to the ED, her initial vital signs were 97.9 80
113/73 and 88% on NRB. She was placed on NIPPV. She received
nebs and steroids (solumedrol 80mg IV) as well as
cefepime/levofloxacin.


Past Medical History:
-C. diff colitis during last admission
-MSSA PNA during last admission
-Atrial fibrillation for breif episode during last
hospitalization
-Atrial tachycardia intermittent, no symptoms
-COPD
-CHF- diastolic (EF 40-45% by TTE [**2139-7-21**])

negative
-Hyperlipidemia
-Peripheral artery disease

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-11-3**]  1:39:16 PM


Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction
delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2140-10-22**] the QRS change
in lead V3 could be positional. Baseline artifact is new.

[**2140-11-3**] CXR pre bronch
IMPRESSION: Interval development of complete left hemithorax
opacification. Given the leftward shift of mediastinal
structures, left lung collapse is favored; however, superimposed
infection and/or effusion cannot be excluded.

[**2140-11-3**] post bronch
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-3**], 1:51 p.m.:

Atelectasis in the left lung is dramatically improved, with some
residual at the base and perihilar left mid lung, which should
be followed to exclude coexistent infection. A new small opacity
in the right lower lung projecting over the anterior aspect of
the fourth rib could be another adenitis or infection. Heart is
mildly enlarged, remains left-shifted. Large cardiac
calcification is probably mitral annulus. ET tube is in standard
placement.  No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion, if any, is small,
on the left.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Echo [**2140-11-4**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly
