Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization w/ DES placed to proximal and mid RCA
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
R IJ placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
41yo F with Type I DM, HTN, hx renal transplant 4 years ago, and
recent admit for left heel cellulitis who presents after
developing CP that woke her from sleep at 3AM today. Has had
stuttering CP for 2 days but it has been constant since 3am.
Felt very weak and fatigued. Husband found her crawling up the
stairs of their home this AM, did not have the energy to change
her clothes. Took her to ER in pajamas. Has felt SOB and
fatigued for several weeks. Has had epigastric pain for the last
2 days which she thought was gas pain or her gastroparesis. Took
Tums w/ no relief. Developed back/shoulder pain o/n, again no
relief.
.
Came to ER in AM. Found to be hypotensive w/ SBP 87/46 (last BP
[**Last Name (un) **] was 146/79), HR 95, temp 96.3. Got EKG in ER which showed
ST elevations in II, III, avF and ST depressions in I, avL. Got
ASA, ativan, 1L NS, plavix 300x1, and heparin gtt. In cath lab,
found to have occluded RCA with difficult stent placement (no
reflow) that eventually required IC nipride injection to
establish flow.
.
During the procedure, pt's mived venous O2 sat dropped to 37%
and her CI fell to less than 2.0. She became agitated and had
mental status changes, making her unable to comply with keeping
her leg straight. She was intubated for SOB and agitation. After
intubation, MV02 improved to 58%. ABG 7.18/27/373 w/ bicarb 11,
BE -16. Sent to CCU for further monitoring.

.
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with severe diffuse disease. The LAD was totally occluded
in the mid-vessel. There was a diffusely diseased bifurcating
large diagonal up to 70%. The LCX had a 70% lesion in the mid
vessel. There was a totally occluded OM. The RCA was 100%
occluded proximally, which was thought to be the culprit lesion.

2. Hemodynamics post intervention revealed elevated filling
pressures
(RVEDP 19 mm Hg, PCWP mean 22 mm Hg) with hemodynamics
consistent w/
RV infarction. Initially patient was somewhat hypotensive,
requiring
dopamine. Post intervention, patient's blood pressure improved
and
dopamine was discontinued. Post intervention CI was 2.01, with
arterial pH of 7.17. Repeat CI was 1.5 with a arterial pH of
7.23; at that time patient had SBP >120.
3. Patient became increasingly agitated post intervention with
mental
status changes and metabolic acidosis. She was unable to lay
flat with sheaths in her groin. She was intubated and sent to
the CCU.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated filling pressures consistent with RV infarction.
3. Low cardiac index and acidemia without hypotension.
.
[**2150-3-9**] ECHO: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(EF 25%) with akinesis of the inferior wall, infero-septum and
apex. The antero-septum is hypokinetic. The basal to mid
anterior and lateral walls move best. There is moderate
spontaneous echo contrast seen in the LV cavity but no masses or
thrombi are seen. There is severe global right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION: Severe,
regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. RV
systolic dysfunction.
.
[**2150-3-9**] CXR: Endotracheal tube tip in satisfactory position
.
[**2150-3-9**] CXR: There has been interval placement of a right
internal jugular vascular catheter, with the tip terminating in
the region of the junction of the superior vena cava and right
atrium.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax, and there has
otherwise been no significant change since the recent study of
several hours earlier.
.
[**2150-3-9**] RENAL U/S: Unremarkable transplant kidney without
hydronephrosis.
.
[**2150-3-10**] CXR: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient
in semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
similar previous study obtained on [**2150-3-9**]. The
patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. The
same holds for an internal jugular approach central venous line
terminating at the cavo-atrial junction and a Swan-Ganz catheter
approached from below terminating in the main pulmonary artery.
NG tube reaches stomach. Patient is less inflated during this
exposure in comparison with the previous study. There is no
evidence of new parenchymal densities or CHF but the pulmonary
vasculature is slightly more crowded. The lateral pleural
sinuses remain free.


Brief Hospital Course:
41yo F w/ DMI s/p LRRT [**2146**] and recent hospitalization for L
heel ulcer, presents w/ inferior STEMI with course complicated
by ARF.
.
# ISCHEMIA: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with an inferior STEMI. On
admission CK 361, MB 18, MBI 5.0, trop 2.66). She was taken
straight to the cath lab where she was found to have diffuse
disease, but total occlusion of her RCA which was felt to be the
culprit lesion. Two [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] were placed in the RCA, but they
were unable to establish good reflow post-stenting. IC nipride
was injected and good flow was eventually established. She was
also started on Reopro in the cath lab. PA sats were as low as
37% intra-procedure, but improved to 59% after intubation. ABGs
in cath lab showed an acidemia (pH 7.18) and her lactate was
9.1. IABP was not placed secondary to her severe PVD. In the
cath lab, she initially required a dopamine gtt to keep her BP
up, but by the end of the procedure, she had to be given nipride
to control her BP. Her CO and CI were low and overnight,
dobutamine was added for inotropy. With the addition of
dobutamine, her PA sats improved to 70%, her lactate came down
to 1.3, and her UOP improved to 40cc/hr. Her enzymes peaked at
CK of 1124, MB of 34, and troponin of 6.35. She had persistent
ST elevations on EKG after her intervention, and they remained
on EKG throughout the rest of her hospitalization. She remained
chest pain free after her extubation, although she had
intermittent episodes of epigastric discomfort that were not
associated with any EKG changes. These were felt to most likely
be related to her gastroparesis and GERD. She was continued on
aspirin and plavix after the placement of her s
