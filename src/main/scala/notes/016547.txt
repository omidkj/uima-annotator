Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, hypoxia (transfer from urology)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nephrectomy
Central Venous Catheter placement
Arterial Line placed
Femoral Dialysis Catheter placed

History of Present Illness:
56 yo F w pmh of lithium toxicity induced CRI (baseline crt 5),
HTN, Asthma, GERD, bipolar d/o, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**1-4**]
for hypotension, hypoxia. She is s/p a laproscopic right
nephrectomy on [**2192-1-2**] due to a right renal mass noted on MRI.
Following surgery her creatinine began to rise (7.0). Nephrology
was consulted, and hemodialysis initiation was planned. On
[**1-4**], she became acutely hypotensive, vitals at the time were:
T 99.4, BP 72/48, HR 95, 02sat 90 on 2L with low UOP 5-10cc/hr.
She had some response to a fluid bolus with sBP to the 90's. She
then became hypoxic with escalating 02 req (95% on 5L). Her
initial ABG was 7.21/48/73. She was given lasix 80mg IV, po
mucomyst, placed on a non-rebreather and had a PE protocol CT.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was managed temporarily on BiPap, but never
required intubation, and was started empirically on vancomycin
and zosyn for likely aspiration pneumonia. Her O2 requirements
were weaned, and she remained afebrile with stable blood
pressures. She required 4U PRBC for post-op hct drop, which
urology has been following. A temporary femoral HD catheter was
placed, and HD has been done over the last two days. Surgical
pathology from nephrectomy consistent with oncocytoma with
atypical features (extensive invasion into fat).

Physical Exam:
VS: Temp: 97.1 BP:76 /43 HR:102 RR:18 O2sat 95 on NRB
GEN: appears tired, mildly confused. breathing comfortably on
NRB
HEENT: large neck, could not assess JVD
RESP: rhonchi in anterior lung fields, distant breath sound
posteriorly, bibasilar crackles.
CV: tachycardic, reg rhythm, no murmurs
ABD: 3 post-surgical scars, stapled, dry, intact. obese,
tenderness surrounding surgical sites, soft, hypoactive bs
EXT: warm, non-edematous, 2+ distal pulses
NEURO: slightly confused,awake and oriented x 3


Pertinent Results:
CTA [**1-4**] - IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study but no main or lobar pulmonary embolus.

2. Partial right lower lobe atelectasis and left basilar
atelectasis.

3. 10-mm nodule in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Given the history of malignancy this is concerning for
metastasis and further evaluation with PET-CT can be performed.

4. Nodular right apical opacity with surrounding ground-glass
halo. In the absence of infectious symptoms, considerations
would include bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma and hemorrhagic
metastasis. If there is a history of immunocompromised or
infectious symptoms fungal infection such as aspergillosis
should be considered.
.
EKG - [**1-4**] -
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Baseline artifact.
Presence of
ST-T wave abnormalities cannot be ruled out. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2191-12-28**] probably no major change.

Head MRI:
 Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy. No enhancing brain lesions or
acute infarcts seen. Although no obvious bony or soft
parenchymal metastatic disease is identified, direct correlation
with PET scan would help for better assessment if clinically
indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 yo F w pmh of CKD [**2-25**] to lithium toxicity, htn, asthma,
bipolar d/o s/p R nephrectomy found to have an oncocytoma.

1. ESRD: The initial impairment was thought to be attriubted to
lithium toxicity. The patient was initially admitted to the
urology service for the nephrectomy and mass removal but was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after her creatinine/ renal
failure worsened in the post-operative setting.  She was placed
on hemodialysis with a temporary groin line until IR placed a
tunneled right IJ catheter for continued HD.  She was followed
by the renal consult team during the admission and tolerated HD
well.  She will continue with HD on a Tu,Thurs,Sat schedule in
the future.

2. Renal mass: Pathology returned as oncocytoma with atypical
features. OSH PET scan reportedly showed some brain enhancement.
Also, CTA demonstrated R apical nodular apical opacity
concerning for metastatic disease. An MRI was obtained of the
head to eval for previously mentioned PET lesions however no
focal lesions were seen on our study here.  In regards to the
patient's oncocytoma, these lesions are generally considered
benign however she will need close follow up in the future with
urology.  Additionally, the nodules seen on CT scan will need to
be reevaluated in [**2-26**] months.  This was conveyed to both her and
to her family.

3.  PNA:  The patient developed a likely left retrocardiac pna
while in the ICU that was initially treated with vanc and zosyn
and subsequently switched to levaquin, renally dosed.  She was
afebrile at the time of discharge and will continue on levaquin
for 10 days.

4. Htn: the patient's BP was in the 100s-110s during the
hospitalization and did not require BP pharmacological
management.  She will need to follow up with her PCP about
restarting [**Name Initial (PRE) **] regimen.

5. Bipolar d/o-patient had no evidence of mania during the
hospitalization and was continued on her prior regimen.

She was discharged with home PT.
