Service:  MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 84 year old woman
with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post mechanical
mitral valve replacement, critical aortic stenosis, atrial
fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a prior
episode of epistaxis, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**1-24**], with profuse epistaxis.  This was treated with
anterior/posterior balloon packing for five days.  INR was 4.8 at
the time of presentation.  Her course was complicated by pan-
sinusitis for which Cefpodoxime was initiated.  During this
admission, the patient required transfusion of four units of
packed red blood cells for decreased hematocrit.  During this
hospitalization, Coumadin was discontinued and heparin was
initiated.  The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on

One day following discharge, the patient developed recurrent
profuse epistaxis and was readmitted to [**Hospital1 **].  INR
at presentation was 1.9 with PTT 39.2 and a hematocrit of 29.4
which decreased to 26.7.  Anterior and posterior balloon packing
was reinserted with effective tamponade.  The patient was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.  Due to multiple
co-morbidities, ENT preferred a non-operative approach and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for consideration of embolization.

Of note, the patient had experienced recurrent right sided
headache at [**Hospital1 **], prompting two head CT scans which
both revealed no hemorrhage.  Pan-sinusitis was present.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives alone; has a supportive
daughter involved in her care.  Quit tobacco approximately seven
years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 99.1 F.;
blood pressure 115/60; O2 saturation 97% on room air.  In
general, the patient was a thin, elderly woman, breathing
comfortably.  HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Nasal
packing in nares bilaterally.  Neck:  Carotid pulses parvus
and tardus.  Chest: Mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Good
air movement.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular;
mechanical heart sounds; III/VI systolic ejection murmur
heard across the precordium radiating to carotids
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, normal
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Chronic venous stasis changes bilateral lower
extremities.  Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Strength five out of five in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally. Sensation intact to light touch.

LABORATORY:  On the day of admission, white blood cell count
12.7, hematocrit 31.5, PTT 38.9, INR 1.5.  Sodium 133,
potassium 4.4, creatinine 0.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is an [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease status post mechanical mitral
valve replacement, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and
epistaxis, on chronic systemic anti-coagulation, who presents for
embolization procedure for recurrent massive epistaxis.

1.  ENT:  The patient underwent cerebral angiography with
embolization for recurrent epistaxis.  Post-procedure, the
patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit overnight for
recurrent bleed.  The patient had no recurrent episodes of
epistaxis.  The nasal packing was removed on [**2-9**] without
difficulty.  There was no evidence of necrosis of integument.

2.  Cardiovascular:  On admission, the patient's diuretics were
held and intravenous fluids were initiated in the setting of
recent acute bleed.  Post-embolization procedure, the patient
became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure of 77 after
receiving Lopressor.  The Lopressor dose was subsequently
decreased from 25 mg twice a day to 12.5 mg p.o., twice a day. On
hospital day number three, the patient's diuretics were re-
instituted.  Of note, the patient had a 15-beat run of non-
sustained supraventricular tachycardia post procedure with no
further events on Telemetry during Intensive Care Unit stay.

On hospital day number four, the patient complained of shortness
of breath associated with left sided chest tightness.  O2
saturation was 96% on room air with pulse in the 70s.  EKG was
obtained which showed no ischemic changes and no changes from
admission EKG.  Chest x-ray was obtained which showed mild
congestive heart failure.  The patient's diuretics had been re-
instituted that morning.  The patient was placed on humidified
air with slight improvement in her symptoms.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's oxygen saturation remained 96 to
100% on room air.  The patient was continued on Combivent and
Flovent for history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Post-embolization, the patient spiked
temperature to 102.2 F., in the setting of known pan-sinusitis.
In addition, the patient's white blood cell count increased to
17.9.  Blood cultures were drawn which showed no growth to date.
In addition, urine culture showed no growth.  The patient was
switched to Augmentin 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. to complete a total of
14 days of antibiotics for pan-sinusitis.

5.  Hematology:  The patient had no further episodes of epistaxis
during this admission.  In addition, the patient required no
transfusions.  Post-procedure, heparin intravenously was
restarted and the patient was started on Coumadin 7.0 mg p.o. q.
h.s. on [**2-8**].  She will continue heparin until her coumadin is
therapeutic, given prosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation.

6.  Code Status:  "DO NOT RESUSCITATE".

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a skilled
nursing facility.
