IMAGING:
1) CT Abdomen: Significant for patchy infiltrate with left lung
base.  There is moderate perihepatic and perisplenic free fluid.

There is a large duodenal diverticulum on measuring 4.6 x 4.9 cm
(image 33, series 2).

2) CT Pelvis: Significant for diffuse small bowel dilatation
with
transition point in left lower quadrant.  There are two closely
apposed decompressed loops of small bowel suggesting a
closed-loop obstruction.  Distal loops of ileum are decompressed
compatible with high-grade obstruction.  Bowel loops within left
lower quadrant demonstrate mild wall thickening with a moderate
amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  Colon is decompressed.
Numerous colon diverticula.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 33 year old woman who is status post open Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass in [**2174**] with complicated postoperative course
including anastomotic leak as well as some element of
malnutrition. She was evidently recently under evaluation at
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 33807**] for possible revision of her
gastric bypass due to malnutrition.
She presented to an outside hospital with new onset abdominal
pain of approximately 5-hour duration. She was ultimately
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with 10 to 12 hour history of pain. Upon
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] she had an acute abdomen with peritoneal
signs, acidemia and tachycardia.  The CT scan at the outside
hospital ([**Hospital 23925**] [**Hospital **] Hospital)demonstrated
retroperitoneal fluid consistent with abscess as well as free
air in the region of the duodenum, most likely consistent with a
perforated duodenal ulcer. She was resuscitated with intravenous
fluids, administered intravenous antibiotics and urgently taken
to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy.

Her intra-operative course ([**2183-1-8**] morning) was significant for
a perforated duodenal ulcer, which was repaired, closure of
internal hernia jejunojejunostomy, gastrostomy tube placement in
the gastric remnant, as well as drainage and wash out of the
retroperitoneal abcess. JP drains x2. Please refer to the
operative note for further details. Post-operatively, she was
taken to the ICU without pressor support.

On the evening of [**2183-1-8**], she was taken back to the OR for an
exploratory laporatomy because of continued tachycardia with
rising lactate. Ex lap was negative.

On the morning of [**1-10**], pt was showing improvement after
washout. LA returned to [**Location 213**]. Bladder pressure in teens
instead of 20's. PIP was 30's pre take back, with abd open and
with abd closed. Now PIP in 20s this AM. Still tachy HR 110-120
(but is it pt's baseline? on beta blockade) SBP 90's. Pt fluid
avid. 12L fluid positive.

Infectious Disease evaluated patient and in the setting of
intraabdominal peritoneal soiling [**3-11**] perforation emperic
treatment with Zosyn x 5-7 days was adequate. Pt was febrile
101.4 ([**1-10**]), likely sirs. Cxs from [**1-9**] were followed.

[**1-11**]: Minimized lasix gtt since auto-diuresing (~2L neg). Cont
w/ albumin. Fever to 101. Hct 22. Given 1u pRBC. LENI negative.
Morphine for pain control

[**1-12**] Confused started on zyprexa. Febrile blood and urine
cultures sent (neg)

[**Date range (1) 33808**]: Given 1 unit PRBC. Continued fevers to 102, new
onset right sided abdominal wall erythema/tenderness consisent
with cellulitis. CT showing intra-abdominal fluid collection
with necrotic tissue s/p retro exposure and I&D.  Confusion
resolved, patient lucid and oriented.

[**2183-1-19**] Given 1 unit PRBC. Due to CT scan showing fasciitis,
patient was brought to the Operating room for Right flank
incision, drainage and debridement of right retroperitoneum with
pulse lavage. The wound was packed with kerlex. The outer
dressing had to be changed frequently over the next several days
due to continued leakage of bilious material.

[**2183-1-20**] Given 1 unit PRBC

[**2183-1-21**] Patient brought to Operating room for exploration and
washout of retroperitoneal abscess. Her wound was repacked.
PICC line and TPN restarted.

[**2183-1-24**] Patient brought back to operating room for exploration
and washout of retroperitoneal abscess.  Kerlex noted to be
saturated with bilious material.  A wound vac was applied.
Patient given 1 unit PRBC. Wound vac output was nearly 1 liter
per day following this.

[**2183-1-27**]: Patient brought back to OR for exploration and washout
with vac change.  Still no visible fistula.

[**2183-2-2**]: patient brought back to OR for exploration and washout
with vac change

[**2183-2-5**]: abdominal CT with contrast showing markedly enlarged
intrabdominal abcess and fistula track from 2nd/3rd portion of
duodenum to flank.  1 JP drain was pulled (this drain had put
out only 5-10cc/day for weeks)

[**2183-2-6**]: went to IR for percutaneous drainage of intrabdominal
fluid collection with return of a large amount of pus.  Pig tail
catheter left in. Taken to OR for I+D and vac change.

[**2183-2-10**]:  patient brought back to OR for exploration and washout
with vac change.  LENIs of both lower extremities were negative
for clot formation.

[**2183-2-12**]:  patient underwent CT of abdomen that showed fluid
collection in lower abdominal wall and incidental finding of
thrombus of left renal vein.  Spoke with vascular team, and she
was started on heparin IV weight based dosing to reach
therapeutic levels of PTT.

[**2183-2-13**]:  patient underwent IR guided aspiration of fluid
