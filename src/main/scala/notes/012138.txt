CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain, nausea, coffee ground
emesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 31 year old
female with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple
admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] [**2200-9-2**], with 24 hour
history of nausea and coffee ground emesis with abdominal
pain.

The patient is well known to the hospital for greater than 15
admissions in diabetic ketoacidosis.  Of note, the patient
has a history of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears, and had recent
admission for coffee ground emesis at [**Hospital6 **].

In the Emergency Department, glucose was found to be greater
than 700 and she was started on 150 cc/hour of normal saline
after a bolus of one liter of normal saline.  She was given
12 units of regular insulin and then started on an insulin
drip at 10 units per hour.  Normal saline lavage revealed
black clots with subsequent clearing after 250 cc normal
saline.  No bright red blood was visualized.

Her hematocrit was noted to drop from 30.0 to 24.0 and the
patient was given one unit packed red blood cells in the
Emergency Department. Her blood pressure fell to 70/40 and
her right subclavian triple lumen catheter was placed and
Neo-Synephrine was started at 20 mcg/minute with blood
pressure responding and increasing to 120/70.  She was
subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis and
cardiovascular status.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, no coronary artery
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.5, blood pressure
160/70, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 14, oxygen
saturation 98% in room air.  In general, a young female with
flat affect in no apparent distress (condition on transfer
from Medical Intensive Care Unit to floor).  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat - Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, 4.0 to 3.5 bilaterally.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  The oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are
moist.  Neck - supple, no jugular venous distention, full
range of motion. Cor - regular rate and rhythm, positive
systolic ejection murmur, soft, heard best at left upper
sternal border with slight neck radiation.  Chest - positive
right subclavian triple lumen catheter.  Lungs clear to
auscultation throughout.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+
bilaterally.  Neurologic - on transfer from Medical Intensive
Care Unit to floor, alert and oriented times three.  Speech,
language and attention intact though the patient with flat
affect.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Strength
was [**4-5**] throughout bilaterally.  Decreased sensation to light
touch distal lower extremities bilaterally.  Deep tendon
reflexes 1+ bilaterally upper extremities, slight in lower
extremities.  Toes are downgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, [**2200-9-2**], sodium 131,
potassium 6.0, chloride 88, bicarbonate 13, blood urea
nitrogen 59, creatinine 2.7, glucose 707, anion gap 36.
Blood gas revealed pH 7.28, pCO2 23, pO2 309 on 100% oxygen.
White blood cell count 10.2 with 90% PMNs, hematocrit 30.5
down to 24.0 on next check, platelet count 477,000.
Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time within
normal limits.  Urinalysis nitrite negative, greater than 300
protein, greater than 1000 glucose, 40 ketone, no white blood
cells, 2 red blood cells, no bacteria, less than one
epithelial cell.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted through the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**].
In the Emergency Department, glucose was greater than 700.
She was subsequently given a bolus of 12 units of regular
insulin followed by insulin drip at 10 units insulin per
hour.  Normal saline lavage revealed black clots with
subsequent clearing after 250 cc normal saline.  No bright
red blood was visualized.

Hematocrit noted to drop from 30.0 to 24.0 with subsequent
transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells in the
Emergency Department.  Blood pressure also noted to fall to
70/40s, right subclavian triple lumen catheter was placed,
and Neo-Synephrine was started at 20 mcg/minute, with blood
pressure response to 120/70.  She was subsequently
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hemodynamic
instability.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her anion gap which on
admission was 36, began to normalize, as did her blood
pressure.  Her insulin drip was slowly weaned and
subsequently discontinued on [**2200-9-3**].  Neo-Synephrine was
discontinued and the patient returned to her baseline
hypertensive status for which she received Hydralazine
intravenously times two.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor after resolution of diabetic
ketoacidosis episode.

On the floor, the patient did well with normalizing of blood
sugar and resumption of normal anion gap.  She was discharged
to home with instructions to follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes
Center.

By the time of discharge, her laboratories were the
following:  sodium 141, potassium 4.2, chloride 105,
bicarbonate 28, blood urea nitrogen 8, creatinine 1.3,
glucose 187, anion gap 12.  White blood cell count 9.9,
hematocrit 34.6, platelets 331,000.  Urine and blood cultures

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lente insulin 20 units q.a.m., 12 units q.h.s.
2.  Humalog sliding scale:  if blood sugar less than 150 no
units, if blood sugar 151-200 two units, if blood sugar
201-250 three units, if blood sugar 251-300 four units.
3.  Zestril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
