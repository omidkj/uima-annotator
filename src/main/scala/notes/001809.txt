admited after developing palpitations during hemodialysis this
morning. She was able to complete the dialysis. She denies chest
pain, SOB, or lightheadedness during the episode. No

IMAGING
CXR ([**2124-3-15**]):
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There
are low lung
volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Fullness of
the hila and
mild perihilar opacities may relate to mild fluid overload
and/or crowding of vessels. No definite focal consolidation is
seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with possible mild fluid overload.
Consider
repeat with better inspiration when patient able.
.
EKG
[**2124-3-15**]: HR 120, atrial tachycardia, Nl axis, normal interval,
nl R wave progression, no ST-changes.
[**2124-3-19**]: NSR 84
.
Microbiology:
[**2-/2041**] Blood culture (FINAL): NO growth
MRSA screen: NO MRSA isolated
.
[**3-17**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis
and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with
the exception of the basal posterior and lateral walls, which
are relatively preserved. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded with certainty. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2123-10-7**], there has been marked further
deterioration of left ventricular contractile function as well
as marked increased in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

[**3-19**] R FEMORAL ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS: Focused vascular ultrasound of the right groin, the
common femoral artery and vein was performed with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale,
color Doppler, and spectral analysis. Findings are concerning
for an AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and
vein, just proximal to the greater saphenous vein takeoff, where
there is turbulent, mixed broad waveform and suggestion of
connection between the two vessels. No evidence of
pseudoaneurysm is seen. No evidence of hematoma is seen in the
right groin.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for AV fistula between the right
common
femoral artery and vein. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
