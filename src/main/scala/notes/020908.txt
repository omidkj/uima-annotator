History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 45-year-old right-handed man with a history of
a fib on Coumadin who presents with headache. He developed a
mild
occipital headache/neck pain 3 days ago. He described the pain
as
a dull ache. This gradually worsened over the next two days. He
noted no photosensitivity but did notice worsening if he stood
up
to walk, improved if he lay down. He reported no fevers but a
chill Tuesday night when the headache started. He noted no neuro
deficits. Because the pain had only worsened and had lasted 2
days despite OTC analgesics, he went to [**Hospital6 76854**] yesterday.

At [**Hospital3 **], he received 3 mg IV dilaudid (1 mg x3 over 2
hrs) and 8 mg IV Zofran. He got 8 mg IV Vitamin K, stopped
before
10 mg b/c he reported nausea and diaphoresis. Head CT there was
reported as negative (images unavailable at this time). INR was
2.9. After Vit K, LP showed clear and yellow (xanthochromic)
CSF.
CSF showed 0 WBC in tubes 1 & 4, 765 RBC in tube 1 and 790 RBC
in
tube 4; CSF glucose was 58, CSF Protein 59. CSF gram stain
showed
no WBC and no organisms; culture is pending at [**Hospital3 **].
He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of presumed SAH.

Neurosurgery admitted him. Here, CTA head was preliminarily read
as showing no aneurysms (final recons still pending) but showing
generalized edema. He also had bifrontal extra-axial fluid
collections. He was given mannitol and dilantin. MRI was
subsequently performed and showed diffuse subdural
pachymeningeal
enhancement and T2 hyperintensity but no blood on GRE, no edema,
no DWI lesions. The ventricles and sulci were normal. He
continues to have a headache that is worsened if he sits up.

On neuro ROS, he denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, he reports a subjective chill on
Tuesday night. He denies recent fever. No night sweats or recent
weight loss or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies
chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or
myalgias. Denies rash.

WBC: 7.8; Hct: 36.5; Plt: 256

Radiologic Data:
MRI head:
"Bilateral subdural fluid collections that demonstrate duffisue
pachymeningeal enhancement with no evidence of associated blood
products. DDx includes: 1. Unlikely chronic SDH. 2. SD effusions
associated with meningitis. 3. SD empyemas. 4. SD effusions [**2-4**]
recent LP. 5. SD effusions [**2-4**] spontaneous CSF leak. 6. [**2-4**]
viral
meningoencephalitis."

CT Head [**12-1**] 1:13 AM:
1. Stable bilateral subdural collections. Differential diagnosis
includes
subdural effusions, empyemas, or sterile subdural fluid from
recent lumbar
puncture, or due to intracranial hypotension. Although the
differential
diagnosis based on CT findings alone would also include chronic
subdural
hematomas, the recent MRI from [**2108-11-30**] noted no
evidence of blood
products.

2. Loss of sulcal definition, but similar in appearance from
[**2108-11-29**] CT. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could again
denote
generalized edema, or the effects of the contiguous subdural
collections.

3. No new acute intracranial hemorrhage identified.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Medullary sponge kidney. Obstructing 4 mm calculus
in the distal
left ureter with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter.

CT Head [**12-1**], 11 pm
1. Bilateral subdural fluid collections appear similar in size
but slightly
more dense since prior study. Differential diagnosis includes
subdural
effusions, empyema, or sterile subdural fluid from recent lumbar
puncture, in
the setting of intracranial hypotension.
2. Effacement of the sulci is unchanged, and may represent mass
effect from
the contiguous subdural collections.
3. No acute intracranial hemorrhage

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**12-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. L5-S1: Degenerative disc disease, with small central disc
protrusion,
causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
2. Blood with dural patch in the spinal canal from Ll5-S2 levels
as described
above, encasing the roots and mildly reducing the potential
space available in
the canal. ( correlating with the history)
3. No obvious fluid collections noted in the posterior spinous
soft tissues.
Increased signal in the interspinous ligaments at L3-4, L4-5 and
slight extent
at L5-S1 levels can relate to recent procedure.
