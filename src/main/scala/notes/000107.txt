Imaging summary:
- [**6-7**] liver u/s:
1. TIPS patent. No prior ultrasound is available to compare the
velocities. High velocities can suggest interval hyperplasia in
the TIPS.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Diffuse symmetric thickening of the wall of the gallbladder,
likely related to chronic liver disease.
4. Fatty liver. Other forms of more advanced liver disease such
as fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
5. Liver vessels are patent. Reverse flow is seen in the left
and right anterior portal vein. The right posterior portal vein
is not visualized due to breathing artifact
- [**6-15**] fluid study: negative for malignancy
- [**6-22**]: Flexsig no active bleeding
- [**6-23**]: endoscopy: no active bleeding
- [**6-25**]: CT abdomen: 15-cm left anterior abdominal/pelvic wall
hematoma and correlation with trauma or intervention is
suggested. No free intraperitoneal air with extensive ascites
and cirrhotic liver as before. Unchanged hepatic hypodensities,
too small to be characterized. Unchanged multiple vertebral body
compression fractures
- [**6-26**]: GIB study: No active GI bleeding during the imaged time
period
- [**2119-6-27**] EGD no active bleeding

Brief Hospital Course:
55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her
husband and admitted to MICU with GIB and resp failure.
Improved in the MICU and was extubated [**6-14**].  On the floor, Ms.
[**Known lastname 696**] was noted to have AMS likely [**1-18**] Korsakoff's amnesia.

1. Abdominal wall hematoma: pt began to complain of pain at site
of what was originally though to be a ventral hernia in LLQ.
the abd protrusion was palpated and had crepitus and could be
reduced, so no action was taken and mass was thought to be a
hernia at that time.  Pt was supposed to
