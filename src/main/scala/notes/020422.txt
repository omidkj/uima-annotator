Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
59 y/o male with Hyperlipidemia, Mild Emphysema, GERD, and
Obstructive Sleep Apnea presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2195-7-15**] with
shortness of breath described as inability to get in a
satisfying breath. Patient has been experiencing symptoms for
last 4-5 days. Symptoms associated with increased fatigue,
subjective fevers/chills, swollen neck glands, and palpitations.
Patient denies any chest pain or light-headedness. In the last
week, patient had developed of a vesicular rash, which began on
abdomen, with 2-3 areas of patchy involvement progressing
towards back. He began taking acyclovir for presumed herpes
zoster.
.
Initial vitals at [**Location (un) 620**] were T 98.5, HR 99, BP 109/79 RR 16
SAT 98% RA. Found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 190's.
Given two pushes of lopressor, which did induce improvement
ventricular rate, but precipitous fall in systolic blood
pressures to 70-80s. Patient was cardioverted with 50, 100, and
finally three hundred joules, with successful breaking of atrial
fibrillation. The patient re-entered AFibb within one hour, and
was loaded with amiodarone. Patient's CXR showed an enlarged
cardiac silloute, and CT showed large pericardial effusion.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further manegement.
.
Patient denies any history of arrythmias, joint pain, cancer,
past heart attack, cardiac surgery, hemoptysis, or recent
thoracic trauma. He reports recent intentional weight loss of 30
pounds in last nine months. On two previous CT's patient had
small noted 4mm non-calcified lung nodule, which has not
increased in size.

Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Mild Emphysema PFT's [**2-20**] showed mild obstructive ventilatory
defect

Diverticulosis

No known drug allergies

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. He is a former smoker of two packs a day for twenty years,
quit 17 years ago. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is a family history of sudden death, with his father dying
of cardiac arrest at age 75. His mother died at 79 of cancer. He
has a brother with seizure disorder and another with crohns
disease.

Physical Exam:
T 99.1 HR 105 BP 113/89 RR 18 SAT 96% PULSUS 15

submandibular, sublingual, ant/post cervical adenopathy.
Oralpharynx without edema or erythema, no purulence. No oral
lesions noted.

hepatojugular reflex
CHEST: No axillary lymphadenopathy noted. Slight cardiac rub
appreciated in RLL upon expiration.
HEART: Tachycardic. S1S2. No murmurs or gallops appreciated.
Cardiac rub appreciated, best at apex, with patient leaning
forward.
ABD: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Normoactive bowel sounds.
No pulsitile mass noted. 2cm by 2cm escar noted on LLQ of
abdomen.
EXT: No edema noted in extremities. 2+
DP/PT/Poplitieal/Femoral/and Radial pulses. No cycanosis.
Neuro: Answers appropriatly to questioning. AAOx3. No focal
motor/sensory deficits. Cranial Nerves intact.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 104bpm.
Normal axis. PR depressions noted in I, II, V3. Upsloping ST
segment elevations of 1mm in V3, V4, V5. Minimal electrical
alternans noted in precordium.
.
CXR at [**Location (un) 620**]: Massive Cardiomegaly
.
CT CHEST at [**Location (un) 620**]: Large Pericardial Effusion, Small Bilateral
Pleural Effusions
.
CT scan of Chest [**2-20**]:
Several small mediastinal nodes are seen which do not meet the
criteria of pathological lymph node enlargement and they are
stable in
comparison.  The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion
or thickening is seen. Small calcification in LAD is noted. The
thoracic aorta is unremarkable as well as the pulmonary
arteries. Stable 4-mm left upper lobe nodule is seen on series
2, image 10. A calcified pulmonary nodule is again seen near the
fissure in the left upper lobe, series 2, image 22. No other
pulmonary nodules or lesions suspicious for malignancy are seen.
 Stable mild predominantly centrilobular emphysema is again
noted mostly involving the upper lobes. Bilateral symmetric
gynecomastia is present unchanged in comparison to the previous
film.
The upper images of the abdomen again demonstrate unchanged
small porta hepatis lymph nodes.  The imaged portion of the
liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen do not reveal any pathology.
Degenerative spine changes are seen predominantly in the upper
thoracic spine.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2193-8-1**] (baseline) demonstrated:

Mildly Dilated RA. The LA is normal in size. LV wall thicknesses
are normal. The LV cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). RV chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Echo [**2195-7-16**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is unusually small. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a large pericardial effusion. There
is sustained right atrial collapse. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse and probable compression, consistent with
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
.
Post-pericardiocentesis Echo [**2195-7-16**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There is a pericardial effusion that is very
small anteriorly and upto 1.7 cm wide and echodense (consistent
with organization/possible thrombus) posterior to the basal left
ventricle. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the study earlier today, the pericardial effusion is
now much smaller.
.
Echo [**2195-7-17**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is a small pericardial
effusion
subtending the right atrial free wall. There are no
echocardiographic signs of  tamponade. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.  Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-7-16**],
there has been some reaccumulation of fluid around the right
atrial free wall.
.
Echo [**2195-7-19**]:
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion
measuring 1.2 cm
subtending the right atrial free wall and 1.1 cm inferior to the
LV basal to mid inferior wall. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2195-7-17**], there is no change in the
size of pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest, abdomen, pelvis [**2195-7-17**]:
1. Unchanged centrilobular emphysema and 4 mm left upper lobe
pulmonary
nodule. Continued follow up in 12 months is recommended.
.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.

.
3. Moderately large pericardial effusion with prominent
hyperenhancing
pericardium.  This could be related to
