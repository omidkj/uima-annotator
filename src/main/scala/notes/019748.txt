Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic cystic neoplasm.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
subtotal Pancreatectomy with Splenectomy
Lysis Of Adhesions
Open Wedge Liver Biopsy
Small Bowel Resection


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14893**] is a 61-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems, one of which is chronic abdominal pain. She had some
type of surgery for a cystic
lesion in her pancreas several years ago which I think was on
the basis of an incorrect diagnosis as a pancreatic pseudocyst.
She has persisted with this cystic neoplasm in her central
pancreas which indicates that a pancreatic
pseudocyst was not an accurate diagnosis. Although we have
followed her pseudocyst serially with imaging and found that it
has not changed in its size or anatomical configuration, it is
clearly obstructing the outflow from the left pancreas where the
pancreatic duct is dilated. We have no other reason
for her abdominal pain. She has had numerous issues in the past
few months, perhaps the most significant of which was coronary
artery disease necessitating coronary artery bypass grafting.
She also is morbidly obese and has had multiple
prior abdominal operations. As an attempt to eradicate her pain,
I recommended resection of this pancreatic cystic neoplasm.

DIAGNOSIS:



1.  Pancreas and duodenum, partial pancreaticoduodenectomy
(A-R):

1.  Microcystic serous cystadenoma, 4.6 x 4.4 x 2.4 cm,
completely-excised.

2.  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 1.

3.  Six lymph nodes, no malignancy identified.

4.  Unremarkable duodenum.

2.  Distal pancreas and spleen, distal pancreatico splenectomy
(S-V):

1.  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 1.

2.  Chronic pancreatitis.

3.  Benign spleen with focal hemorrhage.

4.  Six lymph nodes, no malignancy identified.

3.  Small bowel (W-Y):

No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

4.  :Bowel" (Z-AA):

Small bowel, no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

5.  Liver, wedge biopsy (AB):

1.  Moderate microvesicular steatosis including approximately
30% of liver parenchyma (score 1).

2.  Rare lobular inflammatory foci including neutrophils (score
2).

3.  Scattered balloon cells (score 1).

4.  Focal minimal central lobular fibrosis seen on trichrome
stain (stage 1).

5.  Iron stain shows mild iron deposition in Kupffer cells.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2118-3-24**]

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast
with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with
Valsalva.
There was no change in the left ventricular outflow tract
gradient with
Valsalva maneuver. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**2118-3-24**] and went to the OR for:
1.  Subtotal (80%) pancreatectomy with splenectomy.
2.  Small bowel resection.
3.  Mobilization of splenic flexure of colon.
4.  Extensive lysis of adhesions.
5.  Open wedge liver biopsy.

Post-op Hypovolemia: She received two 500cc fluid boluses
overnight in the SICU for hypotension and low urine output. Her
urine output remained at 20-40cc/hr in the SICU.

On POD 3, she received IV Lasix and had a good response with
increased urine output. She was now back on her home Lasix dose
and her peripheral edema was improving.

GI/Abd: Her abdomen was tender and her dressing was intact over
the incision. She had a NGT, was NPO with IVF. Her wicks were
removed on POD 2. she had minimal drainage from the left side of
her wound. There was no erythema or infection. The staples were
left in place and will be removed at her follow-up appointment.

The NGT was removed on POD 3. She was started on sips on POD 4.
Her diet was slowly advanced over the next few days. She
complained of gas pains, that resolved with a suppository and
bowel movement.  She was able to tolerate regular diet at time
of discharge. She was ambulating and safe to go home.

Pain: She was having considerable pain post-operatively. She was
followed by the pain team. Given the pt's hx of chronic pain and
chronic opioid use (was on Percocet (7.5mg), Vicodin, opana at
home), she had increased requirements on pain medications. Since
she seemed to be having trouble using the PCA, per the pain
service was started on a Duragesic patch of 100mcg q 72 hrs. She
may also use the Dilaudid PCA as an adjunct to that. She seemed
to be pretty sedated and having confusion. The patch and PCA
were stopped and she was ordered for Toradol. Toradol controlled
her pain.

Resp: She remained on the Ventilator overnight in the SICU. She
was extubated the next day at 1300. She was initially
tachypneic, and with asthma at baseline. We were able to
successfully wean her off the O2 and she had no respiratory
issues.

Neuro: She was weepy and very anxious and confused with visual
hallucinations and at times argumentative.. She received Ativan
and was frequently reoriented. She received Haldol x 2 the night
of [**4-4**] with good effect.

Vaccines: she received Vaccines x 3 on POD 3.
