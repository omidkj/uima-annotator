Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 46 y/o male with sCHF with EF 20%, DM2, asthma,
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] from [**Date range (1) 68456**] for CHF exacerbation,
who presents with fatigue and malaise over the last few days.
During the patient's prior admission, he was aggressively
diuresed, and sent out on a higher lasix (100 mg [**Hospital1 **]). After
discharge, he followed-up with his PCP and Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**], and
his dose was ultimately decreased to 60 mg PO BID. He was
believed to be dry, based on a low sodium level and low blood
pressure. He has held his lasix over the last two days per the
instructions of his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the past few days, he reports URI
symptoms, dizziness/weakness, and fatigue. Pt also developed
diarrhea x 3-4 days, with about four episodes per day. Pt also
notes he felt "cloudy" a couple of days ago but this went away.
He denies chest pain and shortness.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.7 P 100 BP 102/76 R 16 O2 sat
97% 3L NC. Blood pressure decreased to SBPs 80s when pt stood up
to go to the bathroom. He was bolused 1L NS with increase in SBP
to the 90s. EKG unchanged with precordial q waves. Guaiac
negative. Pt was found to have a lactate 3.5, mild leukocytosis
11.8.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient's VS were 96.1, 93, 110/74,
22, 99% 2L. He reports fatigue. He states that his legs are
significantly less swollen than prior to his last hospital stay.
Denies CP, SOB, orthopnea, and PND.
.
Review of sytems:

DISCHARGE LABS:

CXR [**2134-1-31**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked globular cardiac enlargement concerning for
pericardial effusion. Correlation with echocardiogram is
advised. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left with right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis though
cannot exclude pneumonia.
.
RUQ U/S [**2134-2-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal appearance of the liver and biliary tree.
2. Elevated LFTs in the setting of ascites, pleural fluid, and
known CHF, likely reflects congestive hepatopathy. This is also
supported by bidirectional pulsatile portal venous flow.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**2134-2-3**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 15 %). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is a very small pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severely dilated
biventricular cardiomyopathy with global biventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
.
RHC [**2134-2-4**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodyanmics revealed markedly elevated right and
left heart filling pressures (mean RA 31mmHg and mean PCW
33mmHg). There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. The
SVR was in the normal range on after load reduction
(lisinopril). The PVR was elevated at 229 dynes/sec/cm-5. The
cardiac index was markedly reduced (1.2 l/min/m2). There were
exagerated V-waves on both the RA and PCW tracings consistent
with atrioventricular valve regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction.
2. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
3. Elevtaed left and right heart filling pressures.
.
TTE [**2134-2-6**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-2-3**], the
severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is slightly
reduced. The left ventricular cavity size is smaller. The heart
rate is faster.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 46 y/o male with sCHF with EF 20%, DM2, asthma,
hypothyroidism, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] from [**Date range (1) 68456**] for CHF
exacerbation, who presents with fatigue, malaise; found to have
hyponatremia initially attributed to hypovolemia exacerbated by
poor forward flow from severe CHF and congestive hepatopathy.
.
#. Acute on Chronic SCHF exacerbation: Etiology of systolic
heart failure is unclear. Echo report from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] [**1-15**]
showed moderate atrial dilation, mild ventricular dilation,
severe left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate-severe mitral
regurg, and moderate tricuspid regurg. Repeat Echo [**2-3**] showed EF
10-15%, severely dilated biventricular cardiomyopathy with
global biventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate to severe
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Given pt's failure to
recover Na appropriately with IVF repletion and worsening EF in
the setting of volume repletion and congestive hepatopathy (see
below) cardiol
