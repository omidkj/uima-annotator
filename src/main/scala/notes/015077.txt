Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory insufficiency.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MICU monitoring

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o, Russian-speaking only, male with a PMH of
interstitial lung disease, Alzhemier's dementia, PUD, who
presents from the NH with hypoxia. He was found to be in his
room earlier today, appearing pale with O2 sats from 74-84 on
2LNC. He is normally on O2 2-4L NC at the NH [**1-25**] to his ILD. He
was brought into the ED for further evaluation.
Per his grandchildren, the pt has not been well for the past 3
days - not eating or drinking, looking pale and weaker than
usual. He was recently started on Levaquin for PNA on [**2159-1-12**].
Family denies pt having a cough, fevers, chest pain, or any
other symptoms although pt is unreliable in giving ROS.
At his baseline, he is not very communicative and is confused
most of the times, per his grandchildren. Pt has become
increasingly more confused and combative over the last few days,
refusing medications and food.
Unable to assess ROS as patient not responding to questions.
.
On admission, pt started on vancomycin and levaquin. This was
changed to vanco, ceftriaxone, azithro and flaygl today as pt
had increasing hypoxia and increasing opacity on R lung on CXR
from early this AM. MICU called to evaluate for persistent O2
sat in mid 80s on 100% NRB. Antibiotics then changed to Vanco,
Zosyn, Azithro for coverage of MDR pseudomonas. He was tx'd to
the MICU for worsening hypoxia.

IMAGING:

Admit CXR ([**1-14**]):
IMPRESSION:
Limited by rotation. Probably unchanged appearance of peripheral
reticular pattern predominantly in the lower lobes. No pneumonia
or CHF. New right- sided lower rib fractures.

Bilateral LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis.
.
Chest CT ([**1-16**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Fractures of the 9th and 10th ribs on the right,
nondisplaced.
3. Bilateral posterior atelectasis and pleural effusions.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
5. Ulcerated plaques in the descending aorta.
6. Possible right adrenal adenoma.
.
Follow Up CXR ([**1-19**]): IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the right
lung base. Otherwise, no significant change from prior study.
.
CXR [**2159-1-19**]
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the right lung base. Otherwise,
no significant change from prior study.
.
CXR [**2159-1-23**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with CHF.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2159-1-28**]
There is mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure superimposed
on underlying emphysema, which is associated with cardiomegaly
and moderate-sized pleural effusion. There are continued
opacities in both lower lobes indicating atelectasis versus
aspiration pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax is identified.
Again, note is made of tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
.
CXR [**2159-1-29**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
.
CXR [**2159-1-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild improvement of pleural effusion on the right.
2. Bibasilar consolidations which may reflect atelectasis or
pneumonia, especially on the left.
3. Radiological evidence of mild congestive heart failure.
.
CXR [**2159-2-4**]
FINDINGS: Bilateral effusions are much more prominent on the
current study. Positioning differences could contribute. Appears
to be more prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature
and decompensation of fluid status seems likely. Bibasilar
atelectatic changes are noted, greater than that seen
previously. Upper lungs are clear of consolidations.
IMPRESSION:
Worsened fluid status versus prior study.
.
CXR [**2159-2-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Partial improvement in congestive heart failure.
2. Unchanged moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
3. Persistent right basilar atelectasis. Superimposed aspiration
cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2159-2-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions,
increased effusion on the right in the interval. A superimposed
aspiration cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2159-2-10**]
Heart size cannot be accurately evaluated, but there is probably
some cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions with
possible underlying pulmonary edema, essentially unchanged since
the prior film of [**2159-2-10**]. Tip of PICC line overlies mid
SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2159-2-13**]
FINDINGS: A left-sided PICC is in unchanged position with tip in
the SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-to-large in size,
appear stable. There is improvement in underlying pulmonary
edema and stable bibasilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian-speaking man with history of
interstitial lung disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and peptic
ulcer disease, who presented from his nursing home with hypoxia.
 Per his family for about 3days prior to admission he was less
interactive than usual and was not taking food.  He seemed weak
and on the day of admission did not even raise his head up when
his daughter came to visit. She called this to the attention of
the NH, who noted the pt was hypoxic to 74-84% on 2LNC, and
started him on Levaquin on [**1-12**] for possible RLL pneumonia.  Per
family, no cough, fever, SOB, or CP.  He was pale appearing.
.
At baseline the pt used O2 2-4L for his interstitial lung
disease. He was minimally interactive, did not speak very much
even in Russian, and his overall health had  had been declining
over the last year. Prior to that time he used to try to run out
of his nursing home and build barricades to keep workers out.
He was a slow walker with assist.  He was, however, strong, and
had been combative requiring restraints in the ICU, and per his
granddaughter he [**Name2 (NI) **] her the day prior to admission. He was noted
to have been reluctant to eat for the last year, only taking
food when fed by his family, and occasionally refusing to eat.
.
On admission, the patient was started on vancomycin and
continued on levofloxacin for pneumonia.  His chest x-rays
gradually evolved to a picture consistent with RLL and LLL
opacities, likely pneumonia.  The pt was treated with
ceftriaxone, azithromycin and Flagyl, b
