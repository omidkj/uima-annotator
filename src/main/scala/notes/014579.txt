History of Present Illness:
History is limited as pt is not able to communicate with us on
arrival. Mrs. [**Known lastname 99445**] is a [**Age over 90 **]F w/ sign PMH for a.fib, dementia,
frequent UTIs was found slumped in chair by aide at home.
Unclear time frame of events as her aide did not accompany her
to the ED. On EMS arrival they found the pt breathing
spontaneously and minimally responsive able to follow simple
commands. She was not able to answer questions at that time. At
baseline she is known to have dementia, but is usually able to
have a conversation with intermittent confusion.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 104.2 ??????F(Rectal), Pulse: 73, RR:
22, BP: 100/54, Rhythm: Sinus Arrythmia (w/ frequent PACs),
O2Sat: 98, O2Flow: 4lnc. She was noted to have food in her
mouth. Her labs were notable for WBC 15.6 q/ 86.5%PMNs, Cr of
1.2, lactate 2.0 and a grossly purulent UA. A CXR was obtained
which showed a RLL consolidation. She was given 3L IVF while
still becoming hypotensive. A central line was placed and
norepinephrine was started. She was given Vanc/Cefepime in the
ED.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt was not responding to questions,
off O2 and sating in the low 90s on RA. She was requiring
Norepinephrine to maintain her BP in low 100s.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-3-17**] 4:36 PM
No definite acute disease aside from patchy basilar opacities
suggestive of minor atelectasis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2193-3-17**] 4:38 PM
No evidence of acute intracranial process; age-related atrophic
change and chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Focus of
chronic mastoid inflammation on the right.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2193-3-17**] 7:08 PM
AP chest compared to [**3-17**] at 4:29 p.m.:
Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the mid
SVC. No
pneumothorax, mediastinal widening. A small, likely right
pleural effusion is unchanged since preceding line placement.
Opacification at the left lung base is new, probably due to
atelectasis, which is much milder but increased at the right
base as well.

CXR [**3-19**]-
Right internal jugular line is at the level of mid SVC. Heart
size and
mediastinum appear unchanged. There is unchanged left lower lobe

consolidation, that might reflect atelectasis, but pneumonia
cannot be
excluded. Mild vascular engorgement is noted and bilateral
pleural effusion is most likely present.

CXR [**3-20**]- The right IJ catheter has been removed. There are low
lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pulmonary
vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not
well visualized. There is no confluent opacification. A pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 99445**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ significant hx of CAD, dementia and
multiple UTIs in the past presents to the ED with leukocytosis,
fever to 104 and altered mental status consistent with severe
sepsis.

# Septic Shock- She met this definition on arrival with
leukocytosis, febrile to 104 with altered mental status, acute
kidney injury and requiring pressors to maintain a perfusion
pressure. She had an overwhelmingly positive U/A on admission.
Prior urine cultures showed pan sensitive E.coli sensitive to
Ceftriaxone. She also was initially covered for community
acquired pneumonia with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin
as initally a respiratory source could not be ruled out,
however, with repeat CXRs and lack of respiratory symptoms, this
seem less likely so azithromycin was discontinued. She was given
IVF boluses for hypotension and was able to be weaned off
pressor support within hours of admission to the ICU. Her mental
status also improved quickly. By the next morning she was awake
and alert back to her baseline mental status.
    [**12-12**] blood cultures positive for GPCs in clusters, however
this was presumed to be a contaminant, and vancomycin was also
discontinued.
