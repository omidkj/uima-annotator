Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pressure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 10680**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] due to
hypotension after she developed chest pressure in the ED. She
describes being under a lot of stress as she came to the ED with
husband who was in a traumatic traffic accident after having a
stroke. She describes this her chest pressure as a band across
the chest below her left breast and into her back. Upon further
history she endorses URI symptoms and similar chest pressure
dating back 7-14 days. She says that pressure is unrelated to
activity, but is accompanied by some shortness of breath. She
denies relationship to food. She also endorses having
occassional dark stool 1x/week. She had an episode of non-bloody
emesis in the ER. Her EKGs in the ED did not show any ischemic
changes and her CK was normal, however her trop was elevated to
0.45. She was hypotensive with SBPs in the 70's to 80's. She was
given 4 L IVF and started on zosyn, flagyl, and clindamycin. A
central line was placed and she was also started on neo. A CT
torso and abdominal US showed gallbladder wall edema and
pericholecystic fluid. Surgery was consulted and they did not
feel it was acute cholecystitis. Patient was started on Zosyn,
Flagyl, Clindamycin. This morning because of the persistently
elevated troponin and TWI in V4-V6, patient was sent to cath
lab. Catheterization demonstrated normal LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA
coronary arteries as well as moderate elevation of R/L heart
filling pressures. Echo demonstrated apical hypokinesis with
severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] leaflet. CO 3.55, CI 2.12. Patient was
transferred to CCU without intervention. Patient endorses
continued chest pressure.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, abdominal pain. She denies recent fevers. Last
hospitalization 10 years ago.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.

.
ECHO [**2151-1-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall,
septum, apex, and mid to distal inferior and inferolateral
walls. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There appears to be partial
mitral leaflet [**Month/Day/Year **] of the posterior leaflet. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Extensive regional
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or extensive
cardiomyopathy. Possible posterior leaflet partial mitral
leaflet [**Month/Day/Year **] with an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no
evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD,
LCx, and
RCA were all patent.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 16 mmHg and an LVEDP of 25 mmHg.
There was
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of
44 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2. Systemic blood
pressures were normal.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis on left heart
pullback.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Mildly distended gallbladder, with a large amount of wall
edema and/or
pericholecystic fluid as well as stranding within the porta
hepatis.
Correlation with right upper quadrant symptoms, LFT levels, and
lipase/amylase
is suggested. If clinically indicated, this can be further
evaluated with a
right upper quadrant ultrasound.
3. Patchy opacities throughout the lungs, with interlobular
septal thickening
and thickening of the bronchovascular interstitium, likely
reflective of
pulmonary edema.
