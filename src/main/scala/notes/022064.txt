History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 year old male with a history of dermatomyositis who
is currently on steroids, MTX, recently recieved rituximab
([**Month (only) 958**]), and who recently underwent 1 week of treatment for H.
pylori, who was recently admitted after being found to have a
hct of 14 on routine labs (prior: 33 two months prior). He is
being admitted after being found to have guaiac positive stool
at rehab facility so he is being admitted for further work-up.
.
Patient was recently admitted in [**5-/2179**] with anemia, which was
thought to be due to medications (MTX, rituxan). He had an EGD
in [**3-/2179**], which showed mild gastritis and a scope in [**9-6**]
diverticulosis of sigmoid colon. He has had occasional dark
stool in recent weeks but denies any BRPBR, nausea, vomiting, or
abdominal pain. Also denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
dyspnea on exertion, cough or any other respiratory symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T- 96.3, HR- 81, BP- 107/56, RR- 16,
SaO2- 98% on RA. Stool was found to be guaiac positive. NG
lavage was negative. Hct stable from previous admission. The
patient was seen by GI who recommended EGD in the morning. He
had central line placed. CXR checked for confirmation but
incidentally showed collapse of left lobe. CT scan showed
secretions/debris in the left main stem that seemed to have
caused the collapse of the left lung. Patient denied any
respiratory symptoms and was satting well.
.
On the floor, the patient feels well. He denies any current N/V,
abd pain, diarrhea, melena, BRBPR, fatigue, SOB, dizziness or
CP.

Brief Hospital Course:
47M with dermatomyositis (on steroids, MTX, rituximab) who was
found to have a anemia and thrombocytopenia, L lung collapse,
and new anasarca.
.
This patient was initially admitted for anemia and possible GI
bleed. Incidentally, the patient was found to have a complete
left lung collapse, despite having not being hypoxic.
Bronchoscopy x 2 was completed to attempt to re-expand the lung,
however no mucus plug was found. Eventually, with several
respiratory maneuvers, his lung started to re-expand. While he
was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], it was noticed that the patient had anemia and
thrombocytopenia was concerning for a TTP like picture. His
anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted despite aggressive
transfusion measures. Plasmapheresis was attempted to treat the
TTP-like picture. However anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted.
While in the ICU patient also developed anasarca from severe
nephrosis which thought to be [**3-2**] TTP or acute exacerbation of
dermatomyositis along with severe malnutrition. Patient was
started TPN for nutrition as he did not tolerate tube feeds.
Patient also developed as result of malnutrition and nephrosis,
severe scrotal and penile edema requiring foley placement.
Patient was called out to the floor when he was stable and when
he no longer needed ICU care. On the floor patient became
hypotensive and was sent back to the ICU. In the ICU patient was
intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be [**3-2**]
to extreme muscle weakness from his dermatomyositis. While
intubated, patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response. Patient was rate controlled. EKG's
were noticed to be low voltage. In the setting of a hypotension,
an ECHO was completed showing a pericardial effusion with early
tamponade physiology. A pericardiocentesis was completed and a
drain placed to help drain the fluid. Serosanginous fluid
continued drain from the pericardial drain. Patient became
increasingly hypotensive with
