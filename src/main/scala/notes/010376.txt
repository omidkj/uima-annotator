Chief Complaint:
presyncope and anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with breast and lung CA on chemo, last dose within the
past week, who presents with orthostatic symptoms in the setting
of 12 point drop in HCT to 14 and BRBPR. Pt had been having
orthostatic presycope for over a month, becoming dizzy and weak
when getting up from bed with resolution when lying down. She
has continued to take her antihypertensives though advised not
to by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is currently being treated for both SCLC and breast
carcinoma. She has required transfusion in the past, receiving 1
unit [**Unit Number **] weeks prior during her cycle of chemotherapy.
.
In oncologist's office on day of admission, had orthostatic
presyncope. BP 77/56, HR 116. Her CBC revealed HCT of 14, down
from 26 two weeks prior. In addition, her platelet count was 37.
There was no evidence of hemolysis and anemia was felt to be
chemotherapy induced.
.
Over the past 2 weeks, her stools have been getting
progressively darker. She has a been having problems with
constipation in the setting of opiate analgesics. Her last stool
was two days prior to admission. She reports it being black and
hard. She has not had any diarrhea or BRBPR. Additionally, she
received PO contrast yesterday for CT. After her CT, she vomited
contrast, and there was no blood seen.
.
Today, her oncologist advised her to go to the ED after the
abnormal HCT [**Location (un) 1131**]. In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4 P122
BP89/34 R18 O298% sat. She was found to have BRBPR on rectal
exam, but not passing any stool. NG lavage showed no blood but
no bile either. She was given protonix IV and 1 unit PRBCs (O+),
1 unit plasma (AB+), and 2 units of platelets (B+ and O+). The
pt is [**Name (NI) **] and has Anti-D antibody. She was also seen by GI in the
ED.
.
On the floor, the patient was feeling slightly better and
reporting no new symptoms. She was transfused with 4 units of
crossmatched O- blood and continued on protonix.
.

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
-- [**4-/2153**] CT with evidence of metastatic disease with multiple
right pleural metastases and moderate-to-large right pleural
effusion; solitary lung metastases, multiple liver metastases,
right adrenal metastases, and several pancreatic metastases.
-- [**2153-5-4**] Biopsy of pleural implants was performed and showed
tumor that displayed a high mitotic rate, necrosis and
involvement of skeletal muscle.  Immunohistochemical studies
showed positive staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin,
TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin. An ER stain was negative.

These findings support the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
The patient's prior breast resection was also reviewed
(S05-[**Numeric Identifier **], slide G), displaying a tumor with low grade
morphologic features.Based on the above mentioned findings, the
patient has evidence of extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
The cells of origin are neuroendocrine cells within the lung
parenchyma, and this is a very aggressive neoplasm.
-- [**2153-5-11**] received cycle 1 of carboplatin 5 AUC D1 and
etoposide 80 mg/m2 D1, D2, D3 of a 21-28 day cycle. Her course
was complicated by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
-- Additionally, the patient has a history of breat CA.  ER/PR
positive, HER-2/neu negative, stage T1b, N0, M0, infiltrating
right breast carcinoma. She is s/p right partial mastectomy,
XRT, and (continued)arimidex therapy
-- cycle 3 Carboplatin/Etoposide [**2153-7-10**]
-- cycle 4 Carboplatin/Etoposide [**2153-8-14**], transfused 1U PRBC

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo female with breast and lung cancer on active treatment, who
presented with orthostatic symptoms in the setting of 12 point
drop in HCT to 14 and BRBPR noted on rectal exam.

# BRBPR:  The patient had no history of passing blood per
rectum, but was noted to have bright red blood on rectal exam in
ED. An NG lavage was negative. The patient was initially
admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.  She
received a total of 4 units PRBC (1 in ED), 2 units platelets,
and 1 unit plasma (all in ED), with rise in HCT to 33.4 from a
nadir of 13.7. Platelets rose from 37 to 152, and were >200 at
time of discharge.  She was started on IV PPI therapy.  It was
thought that h
