Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of single chamber pacemaker (ventricular)

History of Present Illness:
88 yo M with a history of paroxysmal a fib, CHF, ASD, goiter,
PVD, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic GIB on warfarin and recently
started on atenolol, admitted with complaints of shortness of
breath found to have profound bradycardia with high degree heart
block.
.
The patient is a poor historian. A recent discharge summary from
an admission starting on [**2148-3-12**] at [**Hospital3 **]
describes symptomatic shortness of breath noted by [**Name Initial (MD) **] home NP.
The patient was treated for worsening anemia (Hct 23 on
admission down from previous baseline of 35 in [**2147-11-13**]) in
the setting of supratherapeutic INR. The patient's hematocrit
improved to 27 and INR to 2.4 after 4 U PRBCs and 2U FFP. EGD
during this hospitalization revealed non-bleeding ulcers in the
stomach and Barrett's esophagus. Colonoscopy was negative. The
patient was also diuresed at that time for likely acute on
chronic CHF exacerbation. His dry weight at discharge was 83kg.
Echo revealed EF>60%. The patient was newly started on atenolol
25mg daily at the time of discharge. ACEi was not started
because of acute on chronic renal failure (Cr of 1.9 up from
previous 1.5 many months prior). Heart rate was 60-80 prior to
discharge. The patient was discharged to rehab.
.
The patient was at rehab for approximately 1 week. At rehab on
the day of admission, the patient was noted to have oxygen
saturations down to 80% on RA with subjective SOB. 4L nc was
applied w/ improvement in sats to 88%. HR was found to be 35-42.

.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] prior to transfer
to [**Location (un) 86**]. In the ED, the patient was persistently bradycardic
to 30-40 with complete heart block vs. high degree AV block on
EKG. The patient was evaluated by electrophysiology consult team
and started on isoproterenol with improvement in HR to 50-60
range. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout with
sbp 100-130 and asymptomatic.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2148-3-18**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 34 with likely atrial
tachycardia with high grade AV block vs. CHB. Also right bundle
branch block. Downgoing T's in V4-V6. No prior for comparison.

[**2148-3-18**] CXR:
Pulmonary edema; the markedly abnormal cardiac silhouette
suggests either underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial
effusion (or both).

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2147-3-20**]): The left atrium is markedly
dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. A secundum type
atrial septal defect is present with right to left shunting.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with bradycardia with high degree heart
block.  Atenolol use in the setting of acute renal failure
likely worsened his bradycardia, but it was felt that his
underlying conduction disorder had worsened and that he would
benefit from placement of a pacemaker.  He was on a dopamine
drip prior to placement of the pacemaker but was weaned off
after the procedure.  A single chamber ventricular pacemaker was
placed on [**2148-3-22**].  He had significant blood losses during the
procedure, requiring transfusion of one unit of PRBC's.  His Hct
remained stable after the transfusion.  Heparin for his AFib was
restarted the morning after the procedure, and coumadin was
restarted 48 hours after pacer placement.  eh was also started
on aspirin 81 mg QD.

On admission, his heart failure had been exacerbated by the
bradycardia, and he had evidence of volume overload with
crackles on lung exam.  He was aggressively diuresed and had
improvement in his volume status.  he was discharged on lasix 40
mg QD, to be further adjusted as an out-patient.

He was admitted with acute on chronic renal failure likely
secondary to hypoperfusion with his bradycardia (Cr 2.0 on
admission; baseline uncertain but pt has history of DM and
vascular disease).  Creatinine improved somewhat with control of
his CHF exacerbation and placement of the pacemaker.  He was
discharged with Cr 1.3.

ISSUES FOR FOLLOW-UP:
(1) Please measure daily weights.  Mr. [**Known lastname 97347**] cardiologist
will make adjustments to his lasix medication according to his
weights.
(2) Please check INR, CBC, and chem-10 on [**2148-3-28**] at the rehab
facility. Please fax
