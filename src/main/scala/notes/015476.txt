Brief Hospital Course:
#Asthma Exacerbation: There was no clear precipitant, although
thinking was likely [**1-4**] erratic inhaler usage adn allergen
exposure. Patient had several exacerbations and admissions
including multiple intubations in the past. CXR was performed
which did not reveal an acute process. He was improved on
nebulizers adn solumedrol. Given severity of disease, patient
was advised to stay and be transferred to floor. However,
patient refused to stay despite our stating the risks of
premature discharge from hospital. He ripped out IV and left
AMA.

# Murmur: Given his history of polysubstance abuse concern does
exist for endocarditis. However, patient was afebrile and has a
previously documented murmur. Blood cultures were drawn, which
were negative as of [**2120-7-28**] but still pending. The day after
admission, murmur was no longer apparent on auscultation,
suggesting high flow state was likely driver.

#Polysubstance abuse: Reported last drug usage 3 days ago,
though the substance was unkown. Somnolent on exam during
arrival to ICU.  Held sedating medications and CIWA protocol was
started. Patient left AMA.

#Antisocial personality disorder: Sedating medications were held
in context of respiratory distress. Patient left AMA.
