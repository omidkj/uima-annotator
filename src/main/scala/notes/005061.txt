RADIOLOGY:
.
CT Head w/o Contrast (12/28/8):
IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneous left frontal extra-axial mass
lesion, with
coarse peripheral calcification, and mild-moderate surrounding
edema and mass effect, most consistent with a meningioma.
.
MRI Brain w Contrast (12/29/8):
CONCLUSION: Left temporal, frontal, and parietal meningioma with

calcification, cyst formation, mass effect, and edema.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast (1/9/9):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology after recent biopsy including
no
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged heterogeneous left frontotemporoparietal
extra-axial mass which has radiologic appearance of meningioma.
3. Post-surgical changes within the right frontotemporal region.

.
CT Head w/o Contrast (1/18/9):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged heterogeneous left frontoparietal temporal
extra-axial mass with radiologic appearance of a meningioma.
3. Resolving post-surgical changes in the right frontotemporal
region.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, however,
there is a new, small, left frontal subdural hematoma adjacent
to the floor of the
anterior fossa and along the anterior falx. This measures
approximately 5mm thick at most, and there is no mass effect.
.
CT Head w/o Contrast (2/1/9):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged heterogeneous left frontoparietal temporal
extra-axial mass which is consistent with the reported diagnosis
of invasive meningioma. MR HEad can be considered for better
assessment of tumor extent, mass effect and any small foci of
infarction.
3. Stable postoperative changes of right frontoparietal region.
.
CT A/P (12/31/9):
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal areas of left renal cortical hypodensity suggestive of
pyelonephritis vs. infarcts, with additional areas of bilateral
renal cortical irregularity suggestive of scarring from previous
infection or infarct. Apparently thick-walled bladder is
nonspecific in the setting of bladder underdistension.
2. Tiny hypodense hepatic lesion too small to characterize.
3. Left upper pole hypodense renal lesion most likely
representing a caliceal diverticulum or cyst, although
incompletely characterized. This could be further evaluated with
ultrasound or MRI.
.
RUE U/S (1/17/9):
IMPRESSION: Acute thrombus along the PICC, extending from the
mid basilic
veins proximally into the axillary and subclavian veins.
Thrombus is only
partially occlusive in the right subclavian vein. Small amount
of thrombus
extends into the right internal jugular vein at its junction
with the
subclavian vein.
.
PATHOLOGY (1/9/9):
DIAGNOSIS:
Atypical meningioma, WHO grade II (see note).
Note:  Meningothelial tumor with severe cytologic atypia,
prominent nucleoli, architectural disarray, high N/C ratio, and
focal tumor necrosis.
Note:  The immunohistochemical stains for EMA is positive while
cytokeratin AE1/3 is negative.  The MIB-1 reveals a low
proliferation index of approximately 1%.
.
EEG (2/2/9):
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: There was intermittent focal slowing seen in the
left
posterior quadrant with occasional sharp features. The sharp
features
were more prevalent during drowsiness.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background activity was disorganized and
relatively
slow reaching a maximum of 8 Hz on the right, but was slower
than that
most of the time. No evident posterior rhythm was seen on the
left.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: There were no normal sleep patterns seen in this
recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal portable EEG recording due to
left
posterior quadrant slowing with sharp features suggestive of
subcortical
and maybe cortical dysfunction in this area and to the
relatively slow
background suggestive of a mild encephalopathy or excessive
drowsiness.
