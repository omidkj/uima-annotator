Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Adhesive Tape

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypotension, hypoxia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT-guided drainage of left gluteal abscess ([**2137-11-15**]).


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4636**] is a 72 y/o woman with PMH notable for paraplegia
[**1-5**] anterior spinal artery infarct, indwelling suprapubic
catheter with frequent UTIs admitted with altered mental status
and hypoxia.  Per nursing facility notes, the patient was noted
to be unresponsive to voice commands but responsive to tactile
stimuli.  Vitals at the time were BP 100/50, HR 100, RR 20, O2
80% on RA which increased to 97% on 6 L NC.  Reportedly, she is
alert & oriented X 3 at her baseline.  Of note, she is currently
on nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for a UTI (? culture result)
which she started on [**2137-10-29**] for a planned 10 day course.  She
apparently also complained of nausea and may have vomited so
lactulose was held today.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T 102.1, HR 100, BP
132/56, RR 24, 97% on 15 L via nasal cannula.  Blood pressure
trended down to 80s systolic.  She was originally on peripheral
dopamine for BP improvement but as this was not effective, it
was changed to peripheral levophed with subsequent improvement
in blood pressures to 120s systolic.  Blood and urine cultures
were sent.  She was treated with PR tylenol, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV X 1, vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, and 1 g ceftriaxone X 1.  She
received a total of 6 L NS in the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denies any pain.  She is
alert and speaking a few words at a time though they are
difficult to interpret.  She specifically denies any shortness
of breath or any abdominal pain.

Studies
.
Chest x-ray ([**2137-11-6**])
There is bilateral atelectasis. There is no evidence of focal
consolidation that would be indicative of pneumonia.  There is
no evidence of congestive heart failure. The mediastinal and
cardiac contours are stable. There is again evidence of
post-surgical changes. There is no pleural effusion and no
evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
stable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2137-11-9**])
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-9-12**],
the findings are similar.
.
CT head without contrast ([**2137-11-9**])
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Fluid in the right maxillary sinus, which may indicate acute
sinusitis.
.
MR pelvis ([**2137-11-10**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Large sacral/coccygeal decubitus ulcer extending up to the
inferior
sacrum. Abnormal signal involves both sides of the inferior
sacrum, likely
from a combination of osteomyelitis. Te possibility of a
superimposed
nondisplaced left sacral alar insufficiency fracture cannot be
excluded.
2. 2.6- cm rim-enhancing high T2 structure in the left gluteal
soft tissues lateral to and apparently communicating with the
ulcer tract -- ? abcess collection vs packing material in recess
of ulcer. Please see comment above.
3. Stable appearance of the ulcer tracts extending up to the
ischial
tuberosities bilaterally with abnormal signal and enhancement
about the
posterior aspect of the ischial tuberosities, consistent with
osteomyelitis.
4. Old left intertrochanteric fracture only partially imaged on
today's
study.
5. Prominent sacral Tarlov's cysts.
6. Suprapubic catheter seen approaching the bladder; it is
difficult on the images performed today to determine if the
balloon and tip are in fact within the bladder lumen. Clinical
correlation is therefore requested -- is this tube draining
urine?.
7. Distended
