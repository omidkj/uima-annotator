Allergies:
Indomethacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, obtundation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Balloon valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
85 y.o. Male with a past medical history of medically-managed
CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2179**], CVA, severe aortic stenosis seen on
cath [**7-22**]  presenting to the ED with marked respiratory
distress.  Per ED report and EMS sheet they were called for
someone in respiratory distress..  When EMS arrived on scene he
was noted to be in profound respiratory distress but was able to
talk to the paramedics. His BP was noted to be in the 220s and
he became obtunded enroute to the ED. He was intubated
emergently in the field and given nitropaste for his
hypertension.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's initial VS were noted to be HR 65, BP 133/62, RR
30, Sat 97%. His CXR showed ET and NG tubes positioned
appropriately. Diffuse pulmonary opacities raise concern for
pulmonary edema though a superimposed pneumonia cannot be
entirely excluded. Initial ABG was noted to be show
resp/metabolic acidosis. pH 6.84, pCO2 105, pO2 170, HCO3 20,
lactate 7.4. He was given propofol for intubation, IV Nitro gtt
as well as Furosemide 20mg x 1.  His vent was changed to FiO2
100%, Rate 30, TV 450, PEEP 10 with a resulting pH of 7.08, pCO2
59, pO2 141, HCO3 19. Repeat lactate trended down to 6.6.  His
BP then dropped to SBPs in the 70s, sedation switched to
fent/versed, and patient started on dopamine gtt given severe
AS.  Nitropaste was taken off and patient bolused 500 cc NS.
His CBC was notable for a leukocytosis 12.5, Hct 35.1. CT Head
showed no acute process.  ABG prior to transfer showed pH 7.29
pCO2 42 pO2 105 HCO3 21 with lactate now 1.1.
.
Of note, he was apparently scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10121**] in the AM
for AVR for his history of Aortic stenosis.

ECHO [**2201-1-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO [**2201-1-10**]:
Technically suboptimal study.
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2201-1-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Decreased bilateral pulmonary edema with resultant
right greater than left small pleural effusions and bibasilar
opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.
.
VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY [**2201-1-15**]:
IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
85 y.o. Male with a past medical history of medically-managed
CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2179**], CVA, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
severe/critical aortic stenosis presenting with hypertensive
emergency, respiratory distress s/p intubation, pulmonary edema.
Course complicated by delirium, and swallowing difficulty
post-intubation, requiring open j-tube.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#. Aortic stenosis: Patient with critical-severe aortic stenosis
noted in [**Month (only) 216**].  On admission, patient was started on and
required additional pressure support with neo.  He went into
AFib with RVR, started on amiodarone gtt, then taken off when he
spontaneously converted to sinus brady.  He continued to be
dependent on pressors, and balloon valvuloplasty was done with a
goal to bridge to valve replacement once acute status improves.
He improved and was able to come off pressors and was eventually
extubated. He was evaluated by cardiac surgery, who felt he did
not require AVR at this time. ACEI was held initially given
hypotension. Plan for this to be restarted, but given BP
well-controlled without, this was not restarted during this
admission. His home Imdur was held given preload dependence.
.
# CAD: Pt has history of CAD with prior cath in [**7-/2200**] showing
2 vessel disease, he was managed medically. On aspirin, plavix;
held beta blocker initially, isosorbide while on pressors.
Plavix was discontinued on admission, as it was not thought to
be clinically indicated and pt had recent GIB. He was continued
on ASA 325mg daily. Imdur continued to be dc'd given critical AS
as above. He was started on captopril on HD 5. Captopril was
uptitrated, and then switched to Lisinopril 40mg daily
initially. However, after pt made npo as discussed below, this
was held, and not restarted at discharge. This may need to be
readdressed as an outpt.
He was started on IV metoprolol briefly given agitation and need
for more tight BP management. This was switched to po metoprolol
to continue on discharge.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated in the field for
altered mental status.  Respiratory distress likely secondary to
flash pulmonary edema.  Evetually able to be extubated once
clinical status improved. He had intermittent hypoxia, thought
to be related to flash pulmonary edema when pt became
hypertensive with agitation.
