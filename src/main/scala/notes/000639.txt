Pertinent Results:
[**2154-4-24**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve is abnormal. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Coronary sinus catheter, pulmonary vent
and venous access cannulae positioned under TEE guidance
POST CPB: 1. Bioprosthetic valve in mitralposition. Well seated
and stable. Good leaflet excursion. Trace valvular MR. 2.
Unchanged left and right ventricular function with inotropic
support. 3. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2154-4-24**] where
the patient underwent minimally invasive Mitral Valve
Replacement with a 27mm tissue valve.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.
On POD 1 the patient did have a seizure and neurology was
consulted.  Dilantin was started.  The patient likely had a CVA
per neurology.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He developed
atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was started.  He did become
drowsy after a dose of Ativan and required BIPAP at night. He
made further progress and was transferred to the telemetry floor
for further recovery on POD 4.  Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. Repeat brain MRI showed No evidence of
acute infarct, moderate-to-severe atrophy and small vessel
disease.
By the time of discharge on POD 9, the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **] Health Care
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
