History of Present Illness:
76 M with hx of multiple sclerosis, AFIB, old anterior MI,
recent UTI/C diff, hx of cervical neck fracture after MVA now
s/p failed cervical laminectomies admitted on [**8-14**] for graft
revision transferred to the ICU on POD #2 for hypoxic resp
failure. Per medical chart, pt was hit by a car on [**2132-6-12**]
causing fractures of his cervical spine and left tib/fib. he was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 67108**] and underwent an external
fixation of his left ankle along with the following proceudes
for his right C5-C6 facet fx and left C6 lamina fx:
Posterior cervical laminectomies C3-C7.
Posterior cervical lateral mass fusion C3-C7 with autograft.
Anterior cervical diskectomy C6-C7.
Anterior cervical instrumentation C6-C7.
Anterior cervical arthrodesis C6-C7 with allograft.
Pt was discharged to rehab and then to nursing home. On [**8-14**], he
was seen in neurosurgery clinic and found to have graft
extrusion on c-spine CT. He was readmitted for revision of his
graft. He went to the OR on [**8-15**] and then again on [**8-18**] for
revision of the graft. He was doing well post-op, easily
extubated each time. However on [**8-19**], pt was hypoxic from CHF,
was somewhat responsive to lasix but was admitted to the ICU on
[**8-20**] for BiPAP in the setting of CHF. He was diuresed and weaned
off the NIPPV and sent to the floor on [**8-22**] for further
management. He was continued on Cipro for E.Coli UTI along with
PO Vanco for c.dif colitis. On [**8-26**], he developed subjective sob
with a cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respiratory pattern. CHF showed improved
sob, CT head wnl. He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for
presumed asp pna. Later that day he developed fever to 105,
hypotension to BP 88/P and mild hypoxia to 94% on 2L NC with
concern for sepsis; he was given 500cc NS bolus, blood results
returned showing GN bacteremia. Antibiotics were continued as it
was felt that he had not yet failed, given that he had been on
less than 12 hours on levo/flagyl. The next day his fever and
intermittent BP drops continued and he was transferred to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU he responded to fluid boluses, never needing
vasopressors. He was switched to meropenem until results
returned with E. coli sensitive to ceftazidime in blood and
pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazizdime in uriune. He finished the
course of ceftazidime. On [**2132-8-29**] enterococcus grew in his urine
and was started on a 14 day course of Linezolid - currently on
day [**1-22**] of linezolid.  Additionally on [**8-29**] he complained of r
shoulder pain. Shoulder xray showed no acute changes.
Additionaly issues in ICU included delerium when given ativan.

Reason: SWELLING RT ARM EVAL FOR DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with ms, cad, af here with gib and bacteremia
now with swollen rue (has r picc)
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O DVT
STUDY: Unilateral upper extremity veins.

INDICATION: Swollen right upper extremity.

FINDINGS: The right subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic
veins are all patent and compressible. Doppler examination shows
the above vessels to have normal flow and augmentation. The left
subclavian vein is also visualized and shows normal flow and
compressibility. No views of the internal jugular veins were
obtained secondary to the patient's cervical collar.

IMPRESSION: Limited examination of the upper extremity from
subclavian to brachial veins shows no evidence of DVT.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
conscious sedation. The patient was placed in the left lateral
decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through
the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the
cecum was reached. Careful visualization of the colon was
performed as the colonoscope was withdrawn. The colonoscope was
retroflexed within the rectum. The procedure was not difficult.
