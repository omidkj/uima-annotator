Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 year old male with past medical history of
hyperlipidemia and pulmonary embolism who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath.

Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] from [**2179-6-20**]
to [**2179-6-22**] after presenting with bradycardia from his nursing
home. At that time he endorsed back pain, some wheezing, and
dizziness. he was evaluated by pulmonary, and it was felt he
likely had an upper respiratory tract infection. He received
antibiotics (unknown which--discharge summary reports they were
"broadened" when patient was febrile); he was eventually
discharged on azithromycin.

He returned to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED today due to continued
respiratory symptoms and a few days of small-volume hemoptysis.
CT scan chest today was remarkable for a cavitary left lung
lesion. There is a question of TB as etiology since patient did
report a positive PPD test when he was 12 and was never placed
on prophylaxis.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: T 97.8 P 66 BP 130/71
R 18 O2 sat- 92% on 5L.  Patient received dose of vanc and zosyn
in the ED.  Seen by IP in the ED- will be available if needed.
Thoracics was also consulted in the ED.  Given increased oxygen
requirement and possible need for bronchoscopy, patient was
admitted to the MICU team.

On the floor, patient was doing well.  Denied any shortness of
breath, chest pain, dizziness.  He did have a productive cough-
no blood seen in sputum.  Patient denies recent travel history,
sick contacts, night sweats.  He does report intentional weight
loss via diet and exercise.

Studies:

OSH: CT Chest ([**7-3**])- 1. NEW BILATERAL LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA
COMPARED TO [**2179-6-21**] WITH LARGE CAVITARY LESION VERSUS
LOCULATED HYDROPNEUMOTHORAX WITH AIR FLUID LEVEL EXTENDING
OBLIQUELY ALONG THE COURSE OF THE MAJOR FISSURE ON THE LEFT. NO
EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS; A DIMINUTIVE VESSEL WITHIN THE
AREA OF PNEUMONIA [**Month (only) **] REFLECT BASAL CONSTRUCTION OR COMPRESSION.
BIBASILAR BRONCHIECTASIS WITH AREAS OF MUCUS PLUGGING, APPEARING
NEW FROM THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION.  2. PULMONARY ARTERY
ENLARGEMENT CONSISTENT WITH PULMONARY ARTERY HYPERTENSION.
AORTIC AND CORONARY ARTERY VASCULAR CALCIFICATIONS CONSISTENT
WITH ATHEROMATOUS DISEASE.
.
EKG [**7-3**]: Sinus rhythm. Probable anterior wall myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Diffuse T wave flattening which
is non-specific. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**7-5**]: No substantial opacification in the lungs is left
lower lobe with volume loss indicates this is largely
atelectasis. A smaller concurrent pneumonia could be present
there and in a small region of opacification projecting inferior
to the minor fissure on the right. Small left pleural effusion
is probably present, increased since the earlier study. Upper
lungs clear. Heart size normal.

CT chest [**2179-7-6**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Air collection
with small amount of fluid paralleling the left major fissure
just superior to the left lower lobe consolidation could be a
loculated hydropneumothorax. There is no evident pneumothorax in
the left apices or on the right side.  Coronary calcifications.
Hiatal hernia.  Evidence of granulomatous infection in the liver
and spleen.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old male with h/o HL, HTN, and PE who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath and was admitted to the MICU
[**2179-7-3**] for a cavitary lung lesion and hypoxia, transferred to
the floor [**2179-7-6**].
.
#. Cavitary pneumonia:  Patient admitted to the MICU for
increased oxygen requirement and possibility of urgent
bronchoscopy.  He remained on oxygen throughout his stay in the
ICU.  He did have a few episodes of desaturation that each
resolved with nebs and chest PT.  He continued to have a
productive cough with some blood streaking in his sputum.  He
was initially on vanc/zosyn but was eventually switched to
unasyn for improved anaerobic coverage for his likely aspiration
PNA.  He was kept in respiratory isolation until he was ruled
out for TB.  He denied fevers, chills, weight loss
(unintentional) and night sweats.  He underwent repeat CT chest
on [**2179-7-6**].  On [**7-8**], IV unasyn was discontinued and he was
switched to PO augmentin. Patient is to complete a four week
course of augmentin.  A swallow eval was done with no acute
concerns but do recommend diet with reflux precautions and
possibly outpatient f/u for further assessment.  Nebs were
stopped [**7-8**] and oxygen was weaned. Patient was maintaining SpO2
> 94% with 3 L NC. Patient was discharged home with supplemental
oxygen that should be weaned over the following month. Recommend
follow up chest x-ray in [**6-22**] weeks to ensure resolution.
.
#. CAD: Continued his home statin.  Aspirin was initially held
due to recent hemoptysis but restarted at discharge.
