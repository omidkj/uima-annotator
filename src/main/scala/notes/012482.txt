History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 y/o man with h/o CLL, CABG, and mitral valve
replacement who presents with weakness and SOB for 3 days. He
lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility and was being visited by
his son thought he looked very out of breath and weak. He
insisted that he see his doctor, who noted the pt to be
tachypnic to 36 and tachycardic to 107, and sent pt to the ED
for evaluation. Mr [**Known lastname 6115**] complained of occasional cough that

chills, abdominal pain, black/bloody stools, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, dysuria, lower extremity edema, and calf pain. No sick
contacts. Pt lives in [**Location 8411**] building.
.
In ED he presented with a temp of 100.1 and a sat of 99 on a NR

levofloxacin for RUL pneumonia confirmed by CXR.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2177-9-17**]: CXR
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Extensive opacity of the
right upper lobe is consistent with pneumonia. Otherwise the
lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of
the left CP angle could be pleural thickening of chronic small
pleural effusion. The cardiac size is normal. Mediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. Patient is post median
sternotomy and CABG.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia.
.
[**2177-9-18**]: CXR
FINDINGS: An AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph. Air
space consolidation involving the right upper lobe, densest
peripherally not significantly different compared to yesterday's
study. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is also
unchanged. Taking into account head position, slight leftward
tracheal deviation below the thoracic inlet is unchanged as far
back as the patient's first study from [**2176-7-17**].
CONCLUSION: No significant interval radiographic change in right
upper lobe pneumonia.
.
[**2177-9-19**]: CXR
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are slightly diminished. There is
relatively stable right upper lobe consolidation consistent with
lobar pneumonia. Post-surgical changes consistent with prior
median sternotomy and CABG are stable. Otherwise, no significant
interval change.
IMPRESSION: Within differences of inspiratory effort, the right
upper lobe lobar pneumonia is stable. Minimal bibasilar
atelectasis is seen.
.
[**2177-9-20**]: CXR
Compared with one day earlier and allowing for differences in
technique, no significant change is detected.
.
Again seen is dense consolidation of the right upper lobe, most
pronounced laterally, with relative sparing of the medial aspect
of the apex. The patient is status post sternotomy, with
borderline cardiomegaly. Again seen is pleural thickening along
left mid and lower chest walls. No CHF. No gross right effusion.
.
[**2177-9-22**]: CXR
FINDINGS: Since prior examination, there has been no significant
interval change. Again noted, extensive right upper lobe opacity
with air bronchograms. Sternotomy wires and surgical clips
unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax. No evidence of CHF or
pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right upper lobe pneumonia, without
significant interval changes. No evidence of CHF or pulmonary
edema.
.
[**2177-9-22**]: CT Chest
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia, including right upper lobe
consolidation and early right lower lobe consolidation. Left
basilar opacity may represent atelectasis or another focus of
consolidation. Giving areas of sparing in the left upper and
right middle lobe, ARDS is felt unlikely.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86 yo male with hx of CLL, CABG/MVR who presented
with urine legionella Ag positive PNA and new onset AF.
.
1. Hypoxia: The patient was initially admitted 3 days of SOB,
tachypnea, productive cough, and tachycardia. In the ED, CXR
showed RUL consolidation. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and
initially treated with levofloxacin, ceftazidime, and
vancomycin. On hospital day #2, the patient was noted to have an
increasing O2 requirement (satting low 80s on 10L NC) and an ABG
ABG 7.47/33/63 on 95% fm.  He was transferred to the MICU and
did well, with progressing decrease in O2 requirement, and urine
Legionella antigen was found positive.  He was switched to only
levofloxacin (14 day course) for treatment.  He initially
responded well to the treatment, and was transferred to the
medicine team on the floors.
.
While on the floor, the patient began to develop an increased O2
requirement.  The etiology of his increased requirement was
thought to be multifactorial: anemia secondary to CLL, RUL and
RLL legionella PNA, and mild CHF (further discussion of problems
below).  On repeat CXR, the patient was found to have multifocal
PNA, spreading to RLL as well.  Pulmonology consult was called
who recognized the "textbook" course of Legionella -- worsening
upon initial treatment but with subsequent improvement.
.
The patient also developed symptoms of mild CHF, most likely
secondary to his decreased EF (last checked in [**2176**] was 40-45%)
and volume overload.  The patient responded well to furosemide.
Upon discharge, the patient was satting 97% on RA and had no
symptoms of shortness of breath. His lung exam findings had
considerably improved with crackles limited to the bases of the
lun
