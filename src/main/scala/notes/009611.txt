History of Present Illness:
63yo woman with PMH significant for MVR (on coumadin), CAD,
CHF, trigeminal neuralgia, AAA, COPD, L eye enucleation, GIB, is

transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital for management of
intracranial hemorrhage. She presented to the OSH on Monday with

a left-sided headache and chest pain. The headache was thought
to
be secondary to her trigeminal neuralgia and she was treated
with
narcotic analgesics. BP 171/76. She was ruled out for MI by
cardiac enzymes. The day prior to transfer, she was somnolent,
which was thought to be due to the analgesics. That night her BP

rose to the 190s and her HR to the 110s. The next morning she
was
obtunded. HCT showed a large left temporal hemorrhage extending
into the L ventricle and through much of the left ventricular
system. Her [**Hospital3 263**] was 2.7. She was intubated and hyperventilated.
Her BP was lowered with nitro initially, then was stable on
propofol after intubation. She was given 10mg vitamin K IV and 4

units cryoglobulin at the OSH, with an additional 2 units FFP on

transfer. She was sent by [**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 18**] SICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted directly to the SICU, on arrival she had a poor
exam was unresponsive but moving all extremeties she had a
repeat CT/CTA which showed a large intraventricular hemorrhage
involving most of the left ventricle, with source not entirely
clear, perhaps left thalamus or corpus callosum. The left
temporal and occipital horns are considerably expanded with
edema and hemorrhage. Right lateral ventricle not dilated at
this time. CT shows no large aneurysm on preliminary review
prior to availability of reconstructions.  Her bP was kept less
than 140, she was loaded on Dilantin and had a platelet
transfusion given her [**Month/Day/Year **] history.  Her coumadin was reversed
and cardiology was consulted to manage cardiac disease in
setting of being not be able to anticoagulated.

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] had a long discussion with the family and offered
surgery to possibly evacuate the clot or also place an external
ventriculostomy drain.  The patients family stated given  her
lengthy medical problems would not want to live with a possible
brain injury they made her DNR/DNI followed by the next day
making her CMO.
She passed away on [**2148-11-3**].
