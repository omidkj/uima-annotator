Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac cath with PCI stenting to LAD

History of Present Illness:
87 yo female with PMH of HTN, breast ca presented to OSH with 2
day history of SOB. Pt states that 2 days prior to admission,
she experienced SOB while watching TV lasting for ~30 minutes
associated with chest tightness which resolved spontaneously.
She denies any N/V/palpitations/diaphoresis. On day of
presentation to OSH woke up feeling bad and had another episode
of SOB which increased on walking. At OSH, ECG showed anterior Q
waves (new from [**2195**]), RBBB. CK peak of 150, CKMB 5.3, index
3.5, Tn 0.04. BNP 1420. BUN/Cr 35/1.5. Hct 34.
.
At the OSH, pt was sent to the CCU where she was ruled out for
MI, treated for CHF with diuresis. Given the new Q waves on ECG
and negative cardiac enzymes, pt likely had an MI sometime in
the weeks preceding admission. Pt was found to have intermittent
episodes of bradycardia secondary to Mobitz type 2. She had one
episode of diaphoresis, hypotension, bradycardia, likely
secondary to heart block and was transiently on dopamine. An
echo was performed which showed EF 25-30%; anterior, septal,
apical akinesis; mild-mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 29817**] was
performed which found LAD stenosis of 90-95%, RCA lesion 80-85%,
LVEDF 20-28mmHg. Temporary pacing wire placed. Pt transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for interventional cath.

[**2197-12-12**] CXR portable:
AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a temporay pacer wire,
whose distal marker is in the right ventricle. There is a
proximal radiopaque marker in the region of the tricuspid valve.

The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. There are calcifications seen
at the aortic arch. There is a small right-sided pleural
effusion, and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature
consistent with mild CHF. In the left upper lung zone, there is
an ill-defined opacity, for which a follow up PA and lateral
chest radiograph is recommended when the patient is stable for
further evaluation of this finding.
.
IMPRESSION: 1) Temporary pacer wire tip in the right ventricle,
although there is a more proximal marker in the region of the
tricuspid valve.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Ill-defined opacity in the left upper lobe for which a PA and
lateral chest radiograph study is recommended prior to patient
discharge.
.
[**2197-12-12**] CXR PA/Lat:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post DDD pacemaker placement,
with two leads, one terminating in the right atrium, and the
other terminating in the right ventricle. No evidence of
pneumothorax is noted. The heart is normal in size. The
medistinal and hilar contours are unchanged compared to the
previous study. Again, note is made of slightly increased
pulmonary vasculature, with pleural effusion, representing CHF.
The effusion is slightly increased compared to the previous
study. Again, note is made of left upper lobe nodular opacity,
as mentioned on the previous study, as well as possible small
nodular opacities in the right lower lobe. This may represent
calcified granulomas in this patient with calcified right
paratracheal nodes. However, comparison with more distant prior
studies, as well as clinical correlation is recommended to
exclude other etiology.
.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory positioning of the DDD pacemaker leads;
no evidence of pneumothorax. Mild CHF with increased effusion.
Continued bilateral nodular opacities, most prominent in the
left upper lobe, with calcified lymph nodes, which may represent
calcified granulomas. However, comparison with more distant
prior studies, as well as clinical correlation and follow up are
recommended to exclude other etiology.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt was admitted from outside hospital s/p recent
completed anterior MI. Taken to cath on HD1. Selective left
circulation angiography with limited views demonstrated a 99%
proximal LAD lesion which was successfully stented with a cypher
stent. Pt was started on Plavix and continued on ASA and ACE.
Beta blocker was held in setting of conduction abnormality.
After pacer placement, beta blocker was restarted. Pt was
medically managed with titration of BB and ACE. Pt remained
chest pain free and hemodynamically stable throughout
hospitalization.
.
2. Rhythm: Pt was admitted with a temporary pacing wire in
place. On evening of HD1, pt had several episodes of 2:1 AV node
block secondary to Mobitz type 2 second degree block with stable
vital and no symptoms. Pt became confused overnight and pulled
out her temporary pacing wire. External pacing pad was placed
and pacing machine was kept at bedside, but did not have to be
utilized. On HD2, dual chamber pacemaker was placed by EP.
Implantation of AICD in this pt with CAD and EF<30% was
considered. However, since VT was not induced with EP study, it
was decided not to place and AICD. Pt was given vancomycin x
48hours. She was kept on bedrest with an arm sling. CXR was
performed after the procedure, which showed the pacer leads in
place.
.
3. Pump: Pt has EF of 25-30%. On admission, pt appeared to be
breathing comfortably. CXR post-pacer placement showed mild CHF
with increased effusion. On HD2, gentle diuresis with IV lasix
was given. On HD3, IV lasix dosing was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing
and further diuresis was obtained. Pt did not have any
respiratory symptoms and maintained good O2 saturation
throughout hospitalization.
.
4. HTN: During hospitalization, BP was well-controlled on ACE
and BB with BP range of 104-150 systolic.
.
5. Anemia: Hct on admission was 27.9 decreased from 34 at
outside hospital. There was no obvious source of bleed. Pt's hct
remained stable around 28-29. She did not receive any blood
transfusions.
.
