History of Present Illness:
70 y/o man with PMH significant for Crohn's disease and chronic
TPN complicated by multiple line infections admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
on [**4-1**] with probable sepsis thought to be due to line
infection. In pertinent recent history, pt has had multiple
recent line infections with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis, VRE, and
Klebsiella pneumoniae. His last hospitalization was from
[**Date range (1) 40090**] with Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Citrobacter in his
urine and Klebsiella in blood. At that time, he was treated with
linezolid/ambisome/ertapenem and discharged on ceftaz. Pt
stopped the ceftaz on [**3-26**].
.
Pt returned to the ED on [**4-1**] with, fever, cough, and chills.
In the ED, the pt was initially hypertensive in the 200s with a
temperature of 102. He was tachypnic in the 40s. Pt then
developed rigors and his SBP dropped into the 60s. His lactate
returned elevated at 5.6. Pt received 3 liters of IV fluid and
his lactate decreased to 2.8. Pt was started on levophed for BP
support. ID was consulted and the pt received meropenem,
ambisome, and linezolid. Pt mentated well throughout this entire
time. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt was successfuly weaned off of the levophed
overnight. He received D5W with 3 amps of bicarb. Blood cultures
from his L groin line and peripherally from the left forearm
grew gram negative rods. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test had appropriate bump of
approximately 9 points. Pt was continued on meropenem but
ambisome and linezolid were discontinued per the ID consult. At
this time, ID and IR working together to determine what will
need to be done regarding access. Plan was made to get imaging
of possible subclavian and IJ sites tomorrow and then will
determine where to place new line. Plan to treat through
existing line until new access site obtained.  He will be
transfer to the floor for further care at this time.

10. Recent ID related admissions:
- [**1-4**] to [**1-17**]: Femoral line in place since [**12-13**] grew C
parapsilosis. Pt was treated with IV vanc/ceftaz/caspofungin for
12 days then changed to ambisome.
- [**1-29**] to [**2-19**]: Pt in ICU due to hypotension, acidemia, and
hypoxia. Required dopamine. Developed acute on chronic renal
failure. Cultures grew klebsiella and VRE. CT showed dilated CBD
at 1 cm, bilateral pleural effusions, question of diffuse
varices. ERCP was done which showed a dilated CBG but no stone,
mass or stricture. Pt was treated with ambisome, zyvox, and
artapenem. He had a new line placed on [**2-14**].
- [**2-27**] to [**3-8**]: Admitted with tenderness and erythema at the
Hickman site. Urine and blood cultures grew klebsiella and
pseudomonas. Pt was treated with zyvox, ertapenem, and ambisome.
Hickman line was removed. Line was then replaced on [**3-6**]. Pt
was discharged on ceftaz as above.

PSH:
1.  multiple bowel resections as above, has R end ileostomy,
mucous fistula, now closed
2.  cholecystectomy [**2-26**] gallstones

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**4-1**])- Normal mediastinal contours. Ill defined opacity
overlying the right hilum not seen in lateral film and most
probably due to technique. Lungs are hyperinflated with
flattening of the diaphragsm consistent with emmphysematous
changes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly
which may be related to pleural thickening or small pleural
effusion.
.
Liver US ([**4-2**])- Liver of normal echogenicity with no
intrahepatic ductal dilation. Common bile duct measure 4 mm in
diameter proximally and up to 6-8 mm in its mid portion. No
ascites. Main portal vein is patent and its flow is hepatopetal.
.
CT abdomen and pelvis ([**4-2**])- Lungs demonstrate emphysematous
changes with bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions. In the left lobe of the liver, there is a 1 cm focus
of low attenuation consistent with a simple cyst. Small amount
of fluid surrounding the liver and in the right paracolic
gutter. Pt is s/p cholecystectomy and right nephrectomy. There
is compensatory hypertrophy of the left kidney. There is a 3.6
cm simple cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney. Fluid
surrounding the loops extending into the pelvis. There is fluid
in the pelvis surrounding loops of bowel. No free air in the
pelvis.

MRI Chest ([**2149-4-3**])- Gadolinium enhanced MR [**First Name (Titles) 36062**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]s patency of the right internal jugular vein
proximally, but within the distal neck, this vessel becomes
diminutive and is not traceable. Similarly, the distal aspect of
the SVC (the portion emptying into the right atrium) is well
visualized, but more proximally, this is not seen. There is a
prominent azygos vein and collateral network. The azygos vein
measures 12-13 mm in diameter. No axillary or subclavian vein is
evident on either side. The left internal jugular vein is
similarly very small. A diffuse network of superficial
collateral vessels is noted bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis - Pt was initially placed on MUST protocol for sepsis
when he spiked fever, had high lactate, and hypotension.  He was
put on Levophed transiently, which was able to be weaned over
the course of the first night.  Pt was bolused further with D5W
with 3amps bicarb as had an underlying metabolic acidosis.  Pt
was pan-cultured, and within 24 hours, blood cultures from L
tunneled [**Doctor Last Name **] x2 grew GNR, as did a L forearm blood culture.
Pt was initially started on meropenem, ambisome, and linezolid,
given past candidemias and infections with Klebsiella, as well
as VRE colonization.  His tunneled cath was left in place, as IV
access was a [**Last Name 16423**] problem ([**Name (NI) **] placed, but pt could not get
another central line due to massive central venous thrombosis
and occlusion), and peripheral IVs could not be placed by IV RNs
in the setting of active infection.  Per ID recommendation,
antibiotics were narrowed to meropenem only.  He remained
hemodynamically stable since he was transferred to the floor.
MRA/MRV of the chest was done to assess any patent veins that
could potentially be accessed.  Unfortunately, all of the
central veins were occluded and the venous drainage seem to be
supplied by extensive collaterals.  After reviewing this
