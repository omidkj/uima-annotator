ERCP with stent placed in common bile duct


History of Present Illness:
78yo M with Parkinson's disease, AF on warfarin, and ? sleep
disorder, sent into the ED by PCP for concern that patient is
failing at home.  He reports worsening of his Parkinson's
symptoms over the last month, including rigidity, instability,
more frequent falls, and memory difficulties.  Denies difficulty
speaking or swallowing, or new weakness in extremities.  He
administers his own medications, and his wife and PCP are
concerned that he is no longer able to do so accurately.  He has
had 2 falls over the last 2 weeks, both with no head injury and
no LOC, resulting from balance difficulties while walking.  He
has also had increasing dyspnea on exertion recently, over last
2-4 weeks, with associated worsening lower extremity edema.
.
He currently feels well.  He has some mild hip pain which he has
had since his fall earlier this week.  He denies SOB at rest, he
has not been walking around in the ED so is unable to assess
DOE.  Denies CP, headache, N/V, diarrhea.

There is a small pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 78 year old man with Parkinson's disease, Atrial
Fibrillation on anticoagulation (coumadin), with recent
worsening in Parkinson's symptoms suspected due to improper
administration of his own meds, and recent dyspnea on exersion.
.
# Parkinson's disease:  He was maintained on his outpatient
Sinemet and Mirapex.  His presentation included worsening
rigidity and gait difficulties resulting in falls.  His PCP and
wife were suspicious that he is no longer able to administer his
own medications accurately.  A Neurology consult was obtained to
comment on the possible etiologies of his gait difficulties, and
whether they could be explained by medication nonadherence.
They felt his gait difficulties were likely multifactorial, with
Parkinson's disease, cervical myelopathy, and possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] body
dementia contributing, as well as improper administration of his
parkinson's medications.  He has a history of significant
worsening of his symptoms with nonadherence to medications and
his cervical collar.  Therefore he was maintained on his
outpatient parkinson's medications and discharged on these
medications.  He was discharged to rehab for improved
administration of these med
