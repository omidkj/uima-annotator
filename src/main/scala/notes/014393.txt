CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old gentleman
with a history of cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, severe
right sided heart failure with severe pulmonary hypertension
and a recent admission here in [**2106-12-23**] for CHF and
pulmonary edema, and again in [**2107-1-23**] for sepsis and
hypotension.  His echocardiogram revealed severe pulmonary
hypertension and right-sided heart failure as well as
mild-to-moderate effusions.  He was sent home 2-3 weeks prior
to admission on low-dose metoprolol and lisinopril for CHF.

He had been doing relatively well for the initial 2-3 days,
but had to discontinue lisinopril and metoprolol for
persistent hypotension.  His clinical condition continued to
deteriorate with more weakness, more anorexia, and worsening
hypotension.  He was started on midodrine for hypotension,
but without any improvement.  He was not able to tolerate his
regular hemodialysis scheduled yesterday due to hypotension.

While in the Emergency Room, his bedside echocardiogram
revealed moderate effusions, but otherwise he remained
afebrile with persistent hypotension.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever or chills.  No cough, chronic
chest pressure.  No worsening of shortness of breath, feeling
weak, but no dizziness or lightheadedness.  He complained of
anorexia, but no nausea or vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No
headache.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End-stage renal disease secondary to reflux disease.
2. Cirrhosis of unknown etiology.
3. CHF.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
5. Right sided heart failure with severe pulmonary
hypertension.
6. Adrenal insufficiency.
7. Pericardial effusion.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Midodrine 2.5 mg q.[**3-29**]. prn.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Renagel.
6. Nephrocaps.
7. Colace.
8. Metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d.
9. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.  Metoprolol and lisinopril had

heart rate 100, respirations 99% on room air.  General:  He
is a cachectic man, elderly looking than his stated age.
Head and neck exams:  Increased JVP up to the jaw.
Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm, [**2-26**] holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds at base halfway up,
no egophony.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities:
1+ pitting edema.  Neurologic:  No flaps.

LABORATORY WORK ON ADMISSION:  White count of 9.8,
differential of 89% neutrophils, 2% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 3%
monocytes, hematocrit of 37.9, platelets 201.  Coags:  PT
13.1, PTT 32, INR of 1.1.  Chem-7:  Sodium 135, potassium
4.4, chloride 95, bicarb 30, BUN 38, creatinine 5.5, glucose
86.

Chest x-ray showed increased left pleural effusion with left
lower lobe collapse or consolidation.  There is a small right
pleural effusion present as well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was initially admitted to MICU for
his complete medical history and persistent hypotension.
However, given his continuing deterioration and poor
prognosis, the patient and his family decided not to go for
aggressive management.  He was made CMO, and he was
transferred out to the floor and passed away the next day.
