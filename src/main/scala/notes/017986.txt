History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with chief complaint of SOB. She has
metastatic [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] cancer to the lungs, with near occlusion of
RUL, also with hx sarcoid. She has had progressive dyspnea since
[**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) 1096**], attributed to worsening disease. She has been
off chemotherapy since [**Month (only) **], and is essentially receiving
symptom control at this point with no further plans for chemo.
She has been on multiple medications to control her worsening
SOB, including steroids, multiple inhalers, and opioids. On
Prednisone which she tapered from 15 to 10 mg daily on Monday.
She called her oncologist today with gradually worsening dyspnea
for the past two days. Notes significant breathlessness when
getting from bed to commode, as well as breathlessness with
speech. Baseline nonproductive cough; no recent change. No noted
wheezing. No chest pain. No fever though does note sweats. No GI
or urinary symptoms. No recent sinus symptoms. No sick contacts.
Using 5LPM O2 in daytime and 3.5L at night. Baseline sats in low
90s on 5L with drops to 70s-80s with minimal exertion. Also of
note, patient and husband discussing hospice care and has
appointment for official enrollment in hospice tomorrow.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99.3 105 141/87 20 100% on NRB.
Patient was given solumedrol 125 mg x1, ipratropium/albuterol
nebs, and levofloxacin 750 mg. ABG was drawn on ventimask with
7.46/48/68, so placed back onto NRB and plan for MICU admission.
Her oncologist also saw her in the ED where it was discussed
that she is full code and would be intubatable to allow time for
treatments to potentially work, but if not able to be
successfully liberated from ventilator would want tube removed
(no trach).

Oncologic history:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4469**] is a 61-year-old woman with a history of stage II
[**Known lastname 499**] cancer S/P lower anterior resection of the sigmoid and
rectum with a primary anastomosis in [**10/2113**] who did not receive
any adjuvant chemotherapy and was diagnosed with metastatic
cancer to the lungs in [**4-20**]. She underwent resection of left
upper lobe lesion in [**5-21**] which showed adenocarcinoma extending
to the resection margin consistent with known colonic primary.
All lymph nodes tested from left and right were negative. A left
chest Port was placed at the time of the mediastinoscopy and
biopsy/resection. She was started on FOLFOX/Avastin/Erbitux
(protocol 05-449) on [**2115-7-16**] and did very well but came off
protocol on [**2116-3-9**] for stable disease and to get a break from
chemotherapy. In [**2116-4-14**], a follow-up CT torso revealed
progression of R cavitary lesion, new L pulmonary nodule and
increased in mediastinal LAD. CT torso [**11-21**] revealed
progressive lung nodules and increased LAD. FOLFOX/Avastin
chemotherapy was started on [**2117-1-26**]. She had 2 doses held for
neutropenia, and then had an allergic reaction to oxaliplatin on
[**2117-2-23**]. She started FOLFIRI/Avastin on [**2117-3-9**]. Regimen was
dose-reduced starting C2 for mucositis. Scans in [**5-23**] showed
progression of disease with CEA trending up. Erbitux was added
[**5-23**], and Avastin was stopped after C4. Due to mucositis,
5FU/leucovorin was stopped [**2117-7-6**] (last dose 7/8). Most
recently on Irinotecan with Cetuximab.


Social History:
She does not smoke or drink. She is happily married.


Family History:
Mother had sarcoidosis. However, she indicates that there had
been some murmurs in her family that her mother had actually
been adopted. She reports maternal grandfather with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer
in his late 70s; however, again as mentioned above, it is not
clear to the patient that this was her biologic grandfather.


Physical Exam:
99.3 101 113/62 high 20s RR, 100% on NRB
General: Alert, oriented, tachypneic.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI, MMM, oropharynx clear
without evidence of thrush or lesions.
Neck: supple, JVD not appreciated, no LAD.
Lungs: Marked inspiratory and expiratory crackles, occasional
rhonchi at bases, some decrease at apices, prolonged expiratory
phase.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**1-21**] SM at LUSB.
Abdomen: Audible bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, non-distended,
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no
organomegaly
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, 1+ pitting edema,
significant venous stasis and sarcoid changes of anterior shins.

Neuro: CN II-XII intact, strength 5/5 in UEs and LEs.

CXR
IMPRESSION: Overall mild increase in opactiy with more confluent
opacity seen in bilateral lower lobes, may represent progression
of diffuse pulmonary metastases, although infectious process can
not be excluded. Complete right upper lobe opacification and
left lower lobe confluent opacities. Given this background,
acute infection cannot be excluded


Brief Hospital Course:
62F with metastatic [**Month/Day/Year 499**] cancer and sarcoidosis with very
extensive pulmonary mets, initiating hospice care, now admitted
to MICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia requiring NRB.
While she understands the terminal nature of her disease, she
expressed desire to evaluate this acute decompensation for any
possible reversible causes and treat if possible. The
decompensation occured in the setting of tapering steroids. Her
steroids were increased, she was treated for CAP with
levofloxacin and will complete a 5 day course and her nebulized
medication regimen was optimized for symptomatic control.
