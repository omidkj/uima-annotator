Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43 year old male with alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency and emphysema on 3 L home oxygen, diabetes mellitus,
osteoporosis, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and HCV
infection who has required intubation several times in the past
for COPD exacerbation.  He presented to the ED today with
several days of worsening SOB, particularly with exertion and an
increased oxygen requirement of 5 L from his usual baseline of 3
L.  He reports coughing more often than usual, and his cough has
been more productive, with dark green sputum, which is not
typical for him.  He has also felt increasingly fatigued over
the last several days.  He has not noticed any fever or chills,
but has had some occasional diaphoresis.  He is not aware of any
recent sick contact.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.8, BP 124/76, HR 138, RR 32,
SpO2 93% on 5L NC.  He triggered on arrival to the ED for his
tachycardia and tachypnea.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 125
bpm.  CXR showed severe emphysema but no superimposed
infiltrate.  Labs were notable for Na 112, glucose 556, WBC 12.2
with 75.4% neutrophils, lactate 1.6, and anion gap 6.  UA showed
glucose 1000 and ketones 40.  He was given Solumedrol,
Azithromycin, and nebulizer treatments for his apparent COPD
exacerbation.  He was given Insulin 10 units IV with a decrease
to FBG 388.  He also received normal saline 1 L bolus and an
additional 1L over several hours while in the ED, with
improvement of his tachycardia.  He was admitted to the ICU for
management of his COPD exacerbation, hyperglycemia, and
hyponatremia.  Prior to transfer, his VS were afebrile, HR 98,
BP 125/59, RR 20, and SpO2 94% on 5L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he appeared chronically ill but was not
in acute distress.  He felt that he was breathing more
comfortably, and was on 3L NC.  He continued to have a
productive cough.  His chronic pain was at baseline and improved
with his home pain medication regimen.  He denied any other
specific complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 43 year old male with A1A deficiency, emphysema
on 3 L home oxygen, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency,
chronic pain, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and HCV infection
who presented with a COPD exacerbation, hyperglycemia, and
hyponatremia.
.
# COPD Exacerbation/possible pna: His respiratory symptoms were
consistent with COPD exacerbation and acute bronchitis without
initial evidence of pneumonia on imaging or labs.  He responded
well to initial treatment with nebulizers, steroids, and
azithromycin.  In the ICU, he was kept on his home Advair, given
Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs.  He was transitioned to
Prednisone 60 mg PO daily (increased from current home dose of
20 mg).  His initial azithromycin was changed to Levofloxacin on
[**2116-7-24**] when sputum gram stain showed mixed flora, with
predominant GNRs which grew pseudomonas thought to be secondary
to colonization as he clinically did not have a pneumonia.
Patient was discharged with a prednisone taper and levaquin x 4
days complete on [**7-31**].  He will f/u with pulmonary at
[**Hospital1 756**]&women where he gets his chronic care.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Most likely secondary to underlying diabetes,
exacerbated by systemic stress of infection and  treatment with
steroids.  He presented with glucose>500 and was treated with
insulin in the ED.  His glucose had decreased to 347 on arrival
to the ICU.  Initial UA showed ketones but no anion gap.  In the
ICU, he was transiently treated with an insulin drip, after
which his SSI and Lantus doses were adjusted, with the advice of
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult.  He was discharged on lantus 12 qam, 20 qpm
and will f/u with the [**Last Name (un) **] center on [**8-4**].

# Hyponatremia: The patient was found to have Na 112 on
presentation to the ED, and received a total of 2 L normal
saline prior to reaching the ICU.  Initial labs in the ICU
showed Na 132, which was confirmed on repeat.  Given the rapid
rise in sodium over a short period of time, the level of 112 was
thought to be spurious.  The patient had no mental status
changes.  His sodium levels remained stable throughout the rest
of his ICU stay.

# Hypothyroidism:  He was continued on his home Levothyroxine
150 mcg PO daily
.
# Chronic Pain: He has chronic pain from prior compression
fractures related to osteoporosis and is on a regimen of
Methadone, Oxycodone, and Gabapentin.  He was continued on his
home pain regimen with holding parameters

# Adrenal insufficiency: The patient was continued on higher
dose prednisone.

#Depression: The patient was continued on his outpatient
regiment.
