Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension: Resolved with IV hydration. Given the patient's
history, was likely due to overmedication with [**Last Name (un) 11823**] with
sublingual nitroglycerin. BP was normal on the floor and
gradually metoprolol and [**Last Name (un) **] were introduced at lower doses,
with good response. Isordil was not started given the recent
hypotensive episode. This can be restarted in clinic if the
patient can tolerate it.

No further chest pain occured in the hospital and no cardiac
enzyme changes or ECG changes were noted.

A work-up for infection related sepsis was also done - except
for UTI no clear source of infection found. Blood cultures were
negative at discharge.

# Coronary artery disease: ASA, statin, sotalol were continued.
Beta blocker was restarted. [**Last Name (un) **] was started a a once daily dose.
I called Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], patient's PCP and cardiologist - he also
mentioned that the patient was supposed to be on metoprolol 25mg
[**Hospital1 **] but was not taking it at home. He also recommended, that
given the [**Doctor First Name **] cardiac enzymes and unchanged ECG, he will
prusue further CAD work-up in his clinic after discharge.

# A.fib: she was initially tachycardic but with re-initiation of
mediction, was rate controlled. Sotalol was continued.

# INR was supratherapeutic on admission - though no acute
bleeding was noted with hct remaining stable. INR decreased to
1.8 with withholding warfarin. warfarin was reinitiated on
[**2153-11-22**] (4/week dose) . she was advised to see her PCP Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] to get another INR checked.
.
# CHF. was euvolemic on exam, no rales or edema. Meds as above.

# UTI - was treated with ciprofloxacin and she should complete a
3-day course. (total)

# Abnormal CT chest: tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in CT [**10-5**].  [**10-8**]
AFB stain negative. TB culture (no growth x1 month to date). she
missed the pulmonary clinic appointment. This was rescheduled
and the patient is advised to keep her appointment. The final
culture read may be followed up in primary care  clinic.

# DM - given her CHF (relative contraindication for metformin),
metformin was stopped and he patient was transitioned to
glipizide. No hypoglycemic episodes were noted.

# COPD - on inhalers. Good o2 sat (>95%)on ambulation.

She was evaluated by physical therapy. No rehab recommended. She
has a walker at home.
# Communication: Daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16829**]. All of the above
medication changes and the occurances in the hospital were
conveyed to her daughter, [**Name (NI) 8982**].
