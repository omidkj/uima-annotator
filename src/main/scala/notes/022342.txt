History of Present Illness:
86 y/o man with CAD, MVR, admitted from OSH with continuous
seizure-like activity following hip fracture repair.
.
Had repair of hip fracture @ OSH and post op was noted to have
several tonic-clonic like movements.  They are described in an
unsedated neurologist exam as "intermittent spells with hooting
or grunting associated with eyes driven to the left, and a
flexion jerk to the left. There is no sustained motor activity.
He has diminished responsivity...come out a few seconds later,
answer [**2-18**] questions but not reliably, and go back and do it
again"
.
He was loaded with dilantin, phosphenytoin, and transfered to
the ICU. 0.5mg IV lorazepam dropped his blood pressure to high
80s  systolic and did not relieve the abnormal motor activity.
.
Post-op labs prior to transfer @ OSH also notable for anemia and
mild acute renal failure.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Sputum: Multiple positive for MRSA (first [**12-11**], last was a BAL
on [**12-25**])
Blood: [**12-27**]: 1/4 bottles Coag Negative Staph
R Hip Hematoma: [**12-17**]: Coag negative Staph rare growth
R Hip Synovial Fluid: [**12-23**]: No growth
Bile Culture: [**12-25**]: mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types)
CSF: [**12-18**]:  No Growth
.
RADIOLOGY:
CT HEAD [**12-6**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarct.
.
MRI Brain [**12-6**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or abnormal
enhancement. Mild-to- moderate brain atrophy.
.
EEG [**12-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is a likely normal portable EEG in
the briefly waking as well as sleeping states. No clearly focal,
lateralized, or
epileptiform features were evident.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**12-8**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive right thigh/hip hematoma as above.

2. Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall thickening. Clinical
correlation with respect to possible cholecystitis is
recommended.

3. Cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and interstitial
septal thickening suggestive of pulmonary edema.

4. Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta.

5. Mild-to-moderate dilatation of the main as well as right and
left pulmonary arteries.

6. Multiple hypodense liver lesions, likely representing cysts.

7. Pancreatic atrophy with numerous pancreatic calcifications
suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.
.
R Lower Extremity U/S: [**12-8**]: RIGHT EXTREMITY NON-VASCULAR
ULTRASOUND: There is a small amount of fluid anterior to the
proximal femur. The largest dimension measures 2.8 x 1.3 x 3.2
cm.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**12-17**]: IMPRESSION:
1. New bilateral retroperitoneal hematoma involving the psoas
and iliacus muscles.
2. Interval placement of cholecystostomy tube, with decompressed
gallbladder. No abnormal intra-abdominal collections identified.
3. Interval increase in bilateral subsegmental atelectasis with
persistent left pleural effusion. Superimposed infection cannot
be entirely excluded.
4. Multiple hypodense lesions are again seen within the liver,
the smallest of which also too small to characterize by CT.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 year old man with CAD, CHF, MVR, s/p recent
elective hip repair, who was transfered from OSH for question of
continued seizure-like activity post-operatively.
.
# Seizure like activity and Mental Status:
Patient did not have any further seizure like activity during
his stay at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was initailly on valproate, and was then
loaded with phenytoin, per neurology recommendations. Neurology
consulted and assisted with management during his stay.
An EEG was completed on [**2121-12-7**] which was interpreted as likely
normal, without any evidence of seizure activity.
- Phenytoin was continued and eventually tapered down per
neurology recommendations.
- A lumbar puncture was completed to ensure patient did not have
an infection or any other abnormalities, which was within normal
limits.
- Patient's mental status continued to improve, at time of
discharge he was following commands and moving all extremities.
It was felt his mental status was altered after his hip repair
and during his stay due to delerium from his prolonged stay and
infections.
- Patient will receive Phenytoin 100 mg daily for 3 more days,
then can be stopped per neurology recommendations
.
# Fever: Patient had fevers during his stay, for which
