Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
syncopal episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacer setting adjustment


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy(EF 10-15%),
NYHA class III heart failure s/p BiV ICD placement, PAF s/p
ablation, severe asthma, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2146-5-9**] on milrinone for decompensated heart failure,
transferred from the ED of [**Hospital1 1774**] for VT/VF requiring multiple
ICD shocks.

She reports a few day history of severe generalized weakness and
nausea. She had one episode of syncope, which was witnessed by
her husband while she was sitting in bed. She went to an OSH and
was found to have polymorphic VT requiring ICD shocks. She was
tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because her cardiac issues are managed here.

Of note, on arrival she was off milrinone and had a 2:1 AV block
at a rate of 60 beats per minute with QTc 555ms.

On systems review, patient has had nausea, loose stools that
were green today, containing mucous. No fever, headache, head
injury, chest pain, SOB. No abdomional pain. Otherwise systems
review normal.

She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]. She
received cardiac resynchronization therapy in [**2141**] which
resulted in a transient marked improvement in her functional
status. However, during the past year or so, there has been a
progressive and severe decline in her functional status,
accompanied by the development of significant mitral
regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid
regurgitation. She was hospitalized from [**5-2**] through [**5-9**],
during which time milrinone IV therapy was initiated.The patient
was noted to have a considerable clinical response with
considerable improvement in functional capacity going from
having difficulty just speaking and holding up her head in bed
to being able to walk around her home where she lives on a [**Doctor Last Name **]
and participated most if not all of her activities of daily
living.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe nonischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 10% s/p BiVICD
placment
2. Severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. PAF status post ablation.
4. Severe asthma.
5. Old compression fractions of T8 and T10.
6. Venous stasis disease.
7. Anxiety, depression.
8. Restless legs syndrome.
9. Recent septic bursitis of the right knee.

Social History:
The patient used to work as a jeweler and makes jewelry. She
lives with her husband. Remote smoking history, quit over 40
years ago, occasional ETOH and no illicit drug use


Family History:
Father may have had a heart attack, but died from a blood clot
to the brain. Mother had diabetes and cirrhosis. Son with
[**Name2 (NI) 14595**]-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Imaging:
Chest x-ray [**5-24**]
Comparison is made with prior study [**5-16**].
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pacemaker leads
are in standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
There are low lung volumes.  There has been interval worsening
of moderate
pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities.  Bibasilar opacities
could be due to a combination of atelectasis and small pleural
effusions, larger on the left side, though superimposed
pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. Asymmetric opacity at the
periphery of the right upper lobe, is also worrisome for
pneumonia.
.
Echocardiogram [**2146-5-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(quantitative biplane LVEF= 20 % ) secondary to severe global
hypokinesis with the basal infero-lateral and antero-lateral
segments contracting best. A left ventricular mass/thrombus
cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased

left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal

with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic

regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study dated [**2146-5-2**] (images reviewed),

LVEF has improved slightly, mainly due to more vigorous
contraction of the basal lateral segments. Other findings are
similar.
.
[**5-3**] Cardiac Catherization:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed modereately elevated
right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 24mmHg
and LVEDP of 29mmHg. There was severely elevated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure at rest of 78mmHg. At rest there was
severely depressed cardiac index of 1.39L/min/m2. Patient was
infused with Milrinone, first bolused with 50mcg/kg over 3
minutes then 0.375mcg/kg/min over 15 minutes. With milrinone
infusion there was a significant improvement in cardiac index
from 1.39 to 2.22L/min/m2. There was a significant reduction in
PASP from 78 to 58mmHg.
.
Echo [**2146-5-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= [**10-17**] %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue D
