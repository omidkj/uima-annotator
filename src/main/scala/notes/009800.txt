Echo [**12-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) with global hypokinesis and akinesis
of the antero-septum, anterior wall and apex. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. A
bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. This may be paravalvular and/or eccentric. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-10**], the
technical quality of th study has improved. The LVEF is similar.
Aortic regurgitation is now detected (was probably present on
prior study but difficult to assess).
.
.
CTA CHEST [**2180-12-4**]:
A heterogeneous lobualated left thyroid lobe is enlarged to 3.7
x 2.6 cm.

The pulmonary arteries are patent to the subsegmental level. The
aorta and
great vessels show extensive atherosclerosis . Several
borderline enlarged
mediastinal nodes include a right paratracheal and an AP window
node.
Extensive coronary artery calcification as well as post CABG.
Cardiomegaly is moderate. There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral effusions are moderate with left relaxation
atelectasis and right atelectasis versus consolidation noted.

The imaged upper abdomen including the liver and spleen appear
unremarkable except to note a 3 mm gallstone without evidence of
cholecystitis.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified.
Bilateral healed and healing rib fractures are noted.
A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus to terminate in
the upper
stomach and may be advanced further.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
3. Large lobulated left thyroid. Recommend correlation with
ultrasound.
4. Right lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit from
the referring hospital. He continued to be mechanically
ventilated. His hypoglycemia resolved. He had 3 days of
spontaneous breathing trials in which he was unable to come of
the vent. His hypoxia was thought secondary to decompensated
CHF. He was therefore  diuresed with a lasix drip and with the
help of phenylephrine infusion and showed improvement in blood
pressure such that phenylephrine was able to be weaned off
easily. He continued to have thick secretions from his ETT tube
and was covered with vancomycin and zosyn for healthcare
associated pneumonia, but with suspicion for aspiration during
his initial event. He was extubated on hospital day five without
complication. The patient was transferred to the general
medicine floor on hospital day six.  His oxygenation continued
to improve.  He completed a seven day course of antibiotics for
his pneumonia.
.
# Hypoglycemia: The patient is a diabetic, type II.  The
patient's hypoglycemic episode occurred on regimen of Lantus 20
units qHS, metformin, and an insulin sliding scale.  This
regimen was likely too aggressive for this patient.  His wife
reported that the patient was not eating much at the nursing
home because he did not like the food.  This change in food
intake may have contributed to his episode of hypoglycemia.  The
patient's HbA1c is 5.8.  We recommend that the patient follow
the following an insulin sliding scale and that you consider
transitioning patient to an oral regimen.
.
# Coronary artery disease/heart failure: Patient is s/p recent
CABG/[**Month/Day/Year 1291**] [**9-15**] with bioprosthetic valve.  The patient does not
require anti-coagulation for his bioprosthetic valve.  We
recommend that the patient continue to take aspirin, pravastatin
and his lasix at 20 mg PO BID.  We switched the patient's
beta-blocker to metopr
