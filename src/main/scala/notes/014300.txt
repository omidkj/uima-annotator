Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis with drain placement


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 y/o female with PMHx lung cancer (unknown
type) stage IIIB, prior PE, bilateral DVT with IVC filter who
presents to the CCU s/p pericardiocentesis with pericardial
drain placement.
  The patient was in her usual state of health until [**9-1**], when
she woke up feeling "lousy."  She felt fatigued, had several
episodes of NB/NB vomiting with crampy abdominal pain with some
diarrhea.  She also noted dyspnea on exertion.  This progressed
to dyspnea even at rest.  On the morning of [**9-3**], she went to her
PCP's office who then sent her to the ED.  At [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she
had a CT A/P with contrast.  The read there was suggestive of
saddle pulmonary embolus and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were  Temp:98.7 HR:124 BP:124/68
Resp:20 O(2)Sat:98.  The patient's CT scan was reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**]
radiologists who did not agree with the diagnosis of PE as they
felt that the pulmonary arteries were very poorly opacified.
They also noted a large pericardial effusion.  Interventional
Cardiology performed a bedside echo which seemed to raise the
possibility of tamponade.  The patient then started to become
hypotensive, with pressures dropping to the 80s and 90s.  IC
decided to take the patient to the cath lab for a percutaneous
pericardiocentesis.  The patient received one unit of FFP in the
ED prior to procedure.
.
In the cath lab, the patient had ~600cc of fluid drained with a
pericardial drain placed.  She was transferred to the CCU in
stable condition.

Currently, she complains of [**9-4**] pleuritic chest pain that
worsens with deep breaths and movement.  It is improved with
leaning forward.  She received morphine 2mg IV which lowered the
pain to a [**2142-4-30**].

Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o female with PMHx lung cancer stage IIIB, bilateral DVTs
with PE while therapeutic on coumadin, IVC filter who presents
to the CCU s/p pericardiocentesis and placement of pericardial
drain.  Currently hemodynamically stable.

# Tamponade - Patient underwent pericardiocentesis with
pericardial drain placement after which she was hemodynamically
stable, although complaining of some positional chest pain which
was treated with morphine and indomethacin.  Drain was pulled on
[**9-5**].  Pericardial fluid showed metastatic adenocarcinoma; we
contact[**Name (NI) **] outpatient oncologist and they plan to f/u as an
outpatient and discuss treatment options at that time.  Of note,
pericardial fluid cx from [**9-3**] [**1-27**] showed GPC in clusters, but
pt was afebrile with nl WBC; likely due to contamination.  ECHO
on [**9-6**] demonstrated: "small amount of pericardial fluid
adjacent to the right atrium. There is still some residual
echogenic material near the apex of the right ventricle. The
inter-ventricular septum has a "bounce". This is often seen
immediately after pericardiocentesis and usually resolves."
Reaccumulation of fluid was not enough to justify window and the
decision was made to have a repeat echo 1 week after discharge.
Pt was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.
She remained hemodynamically stable with minimal chest pain
controlled with indomethacin, with plan to follow up as
outpatient with PCP and oncology.
.
# Coagulopathy - Elevated INR on admission.  Was on 5mg coumadin
5 days a week, 2.5 2 days a week.  Likely this was too high and
cause her INR to increase. Received 1 unit FFP in ED.  Per
records from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Date range (1) 87450**]: pt had progression of
thrombus on therapeutic coumadin and lovenox so ivc filter was
placed; CT [**2141-5-31**] showed numerous PE on therapeutic INR so their
new target was INR [**3-29**].  Coumadin was restarted on [**9-4**] with
goal INR 3.
