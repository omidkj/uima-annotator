Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
84F with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion x4
(last was <1 week ago), diastolic heart failure (EF >55% via
echo in [**2134**]) admitted to the CCU for management of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate earlier last week. She
was recently discharged on [**6-12**] and is s/p cardio-version on
[**6-11**]. Pt noted HR in 120's at home starting at 2pm today.
Describes fatigue, dizziness, weakness and SOB. Pt also states
she had "indigestion" and tried tums, without relief, discomfort
now resolved. Pt. was instructed by cardiologist to take an
extra dose of nadolol 10mg, no effect noted by pt. Pt was
refusing medication until Cardiologist called. She denies
N/V/D/F/C, SOB. ROS is positive for wt loss in context of upping
dose of furosemide.
.
On last hospitalization, team had extensive discussion with
patient regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation with
coumadin, pradexa, or lovenox. After lengthy discussion patient
expressed reluctance to start any new medications and refused
Coumadin due to bleed in the past and apprehension regarding
monitoring of Coumadin.
.
ED Course: In the ED, initial VS 96.8 150 108/53 16 100%. She
was initially triggered for tachycardia to 150s. EKG: rAF no
ischemia. CXR: no acute process. ED resident called [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31130**], who told Metoprolol was fine to give and
the pt received Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, alprazolam x1 with no
improvement. ED resident then d/w cardiology, who recommended
amiodarone load and heparin gtt. Exam notable for heart rate to
120-150, hypotension 80/40. Labs notable for proBNP: 2521 INR:
1.3. The pt underwent CXR as well. EKG was afib in 150's with no
ST changes. VS on transfer were: BP 93/46, HR 130's, Pox 99 on
2L, RR 20's.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
[**2138-6-14**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 140-160,
left axis wnl (-[**11-1**]*), normal intervals, rate dependent ST
depressions V4-V6 as well minimal depressions in II, III, AVF
which are not seen in previous tracing in sinus rythm.

[**2138-6-14**] CXR: Cardiomegaly with mild volume overload.

[**2138-6-18**] TEE: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20

There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in left
atrium, left atrial appendage, right atrium, or right atrial
appendage. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Aortic atheromatous disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31125**] is a 84 yo female with history of PAF s/p
cardioversion x4, diastolic heart failure presenting with chest
discomfort admitted to the CCU for evaluation and mgmt of Atrial
Fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate. No clear
precipitator to reversion to irregular rate. Patient denies any
history of insensible loss (decreased PO intake, n/v/d/fever).
Patient denies infectious trigger - no fever, chills, or
localizing complaints of infection (cough, n/v/d, dysuria). On
admission, patient was afebrile, WBC wnl, CXR without
infiltrate. Though patient does have h/o CHF does not appear in
florid HF as precipitant to AF on this admission. TSH on last
admission wnl. Patient is currently asymptomatic. She was loaded
with amiodarone and started on a heparin drip. She was continued
on her nadolol at her home dose. After discussion with the
patient and her daughter, she was started on dabigatran and
heparin gtt and aspirin was d/c-ed. Note that this medicine
increases INR and PTT but these labs are not reliable indicators
of anticoagulation status and should not be followed. She was
amio loaded and continued on 200mg [**Hospital1 **] and will need 4 more days
of twice daily dosing, then decrease to 200 mg daily therafter.
She was scheduled for TEE cardioversion which she underwent on
[**6-18**] with subsequent return to sinus rhythm. She will continue on
amiodarone and dabigatran as an outpatient. Naldolol has been
d/c'ed. Please note that dabigitran is contraindicated with
creat
