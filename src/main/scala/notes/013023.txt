Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck ache/Headache, Left arm numbness/weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
SUBOCCIPITAL CRANIECTOMY FOR DECOMPRESSION [**2111-5-22**]


History of Present Illness:
 24yo no significant PMH, presented to OSH ED for 3days body
aches/neck pain, fever and cough and was dxed as flu symptoms.
While still in ED, he coughed and immediately lost conciousness
and fell on the flr to his head. He resumed consiousness in
about
a min, accompanied by both arm pain and number. No weakness.
Right arm pain/numbness had subsided, but left arm persisted. No
severe HA, does c/o neck stiffness. He had MRI which showed
Chiari malformation/herniation and C2 to T1/2 syrinx, therefore
he was txfed to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further eval/treatment.

Pertinent Results:
MRI c-spine [**2111-5-26**]
Post-surgical changes status post posterior fossa decompression
( C1 laminectomy) and suboccipital cranioplasty are evident with
a posterior fluid collection extending down to approximately the
C2/3 level following csf signal characteristics and could
represent a pseudomeningogele. A smaller, more complex fluid
collection extends from C2 through approximately C5 posteriorly
and likely represents post op hematoma or seroma. Susceptibility
artifact within the surgical bed likely represents post-
surgical air collections. The more superior fluid collection
measures approximately 5.5 x 2.0 x 4.5 cm.
A syrinx is again noted extending from C2 to approximately C6/7
and appears decreased in size measuring 6.2 x 3.3 mm today
compared to 6.9 x 4.3 mm on [**2111-5-15**] at the C3 level.
Evaluation of post-contrast images reveals anterior and
posterior cervical leptomeningeal enhancement which is likely
postsurgical. Inferior herniation of the cerebellar tonsils
appears unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Status post posterior fossa decompression and
suboccipital cranioplasty for a Chiari malformation with slight
decrease in size of cervical syrinx. Fluid collection in the
surgical bed may represent a post-surgical pseudomeningocele
with a smaller more complex collection extending down to C5
which likely represents a combination of hematoma/seroma.
Cervical leptomeningeal enhancement is likely postsurgical.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
24 year old man with Chiari malformation/ cervical and thoracic
syringomyelia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
MRI w/ and w/o Gado of brain, cranio-cervical junction, Cervical
and thoracic spine
EXAM: MRI brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with Chiari malformation and
cervicothoracic syringomyelia.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired. There are no
prior similar examinations for comparison.

FINDINGS: At the craniocervical junction, the cerebellar tonsils
are seen to be approximately 2.1 cm below the level of foramen
magnum. The tonsils are deformed and flattened. There is
narrowing of the CSF pathways as seen at the foramen magnum with
obliteration of the CSF space anterior to the cervicomedullary
junction. There is mild platybasia visualized with a small
posterior fossa. Mildly retroflex odontoid process is also
visualized. The findings are indicative of Chiari I
malformation. In addition, there is a linear area of decreased
signal on T1 images seen in the upper cervical spinal cord
indicating syringohydromyelia.

The ventricles are normal in size without midline shift, mass
effect, or hydrocephalus. There are no focal signal
abnormalities in the brain or acute infarct seen.

IMPRESSION: Chiari I malformation with narrowing of the CSF
pathways at the foramen magnum and syrinx in the visualized
upper cervical spinal cord. No evidence of hydrocephalus or
other significant intracranial abnormalities.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
24 year old man with creatinine of 1.5 (no baseline) preop for
suboccipital craniotomy Wed for Chiarri malformation repair.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for intrinsic renal disease or hydronephrosis
EXAMINATION: Renal ultrasound.

INDICATION: Rising creatinine. Rule out renal disease or
hydronephrosis.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.7 cm in maximum length
with normal renal cortical thickness. No evidence of any
obstruction. No mass lesions identified. The left kidney
measures 11.2 cm in maximum length with normal renal cortical
thickness. No evidence of any hydronephrosis. No mass lesions
identified. The bladder is almost empty.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
