Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with NG tube

PICC line ([**10-2**])

History of Present Illness:
79F w h/o DM, CAD and ESRD on HD presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2113-9-28**]
after a fall. The patient was in her usual state of health until
the morning of [**9-28**] when she fell as she was about to go down
the stairs in her house.  The pt reported feeling dizzy and
falling on her side.  She lost consciousness and was woken up by
her sister who called the hospital.  There was no CP/SOB,
palpitation. No loss of continence or confusion.
.
Vitals in the ED were T 96.7 BP 210/82 HR 50 RR18 99%RA.  Head
CT showed 8mm subdural hematoma in right parietal lobe and
likely a small R frontal parenchymal hemorrhage.  No cervical
trauma.  Pt was seen by neurosurgery and sent to floor for
further conservative management and hemodialysis.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
CT head non-con ([**9-28**]): In the extra-axial space overlying the
right lateral parietal cortex, there is a hyperdense focus
measuring 8 mm in thickness, corresponding to an acute subdural
hemorrhage. In the superior right frontal cortex is a 4-mm focus
of hyperdensity, which likely reflects an acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. There are no other foci of hemorrhage. There is no
edema or midline shift associated with either focus of
hemorrhage. There is no evidence of infarction. The ventricles
and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related involution.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemia. The basilar cisterns are patent
and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is preserved. Soft tissues
are unremarkable without scalp hematoma. There is no fracture.
Paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening of the nasal
cavity and left maxillary sinus, and there is soft tissue
density material nearly filling the right maxillary sinus. The
mastoid air cells are well aerated. The maxillary sinus walls
are diffusely thickened and increased in density. this may be a
consequence of chronic inflammation, but given his history of
renal failure, this may also reflect renal osteodystrophy.
.
IMPRESSION: 1. Acute right subdural hematoma overlying the right
lateral parietal cortex measuring 8 mm.
2. 4-mm focus of hyperdensity in the right superior frontal
cortex, likely indicating parenchymal hemorrhage. 3. No fracture
or scalp hematoma.
.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2113-9-29**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal routine EEG due to the slow background with
occasional suppressive bursts. These findings suggest a
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes. Hypoxia is another
possible explanation. Nevertheless, there were no areas of
prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure
focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform features.
.
.
CT-HEAD [**2113-9-30**]
FINDINGS: There has been no interval change in right
parieto-occipital
subdural hematoma, again measuring 7 mm at its deepest, and
again extending around the occipital cortex posteriorly. The
intraparenchymal focus of bleeding in the right frontal cortex
is unchanged. There are no new areas of bleeding. There is no
shift of normally midline structures or herniation. Ventricles
and sulci are again prominent, consistent with age-related
involution. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
consistent withchronic small vessel ischemia. Basilar cisterns
and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation are patent, and there is no
evidence of infarction. There is no fracture. The paranasal
sinuses again demonstrate mucosal thickening in the maxillary
sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in right parieto-occipital
subdural hematoma and right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage, and no midline shift or herniation
.
MRI AND MRA OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST
DATED [**2113-9-30**].
FINDINGS: The study is compared with the recent NECT of the
head, dated
[**2113-9-29**]; there is no previous MR examination on record. The
known extensive, but relatively thin acute subdural hematoma
overlying the right cerebral convexity and tentorium is,
overall, unchanged, with a similar degree of mass effect and
slight flattening of the subjacent gyri. There is no significant
shift of the normally-midline structures or evidence of
herniation. There are scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage,
particularly in right frontal sulci and right frontovertex, as
on the serial CTs; no true hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion is
identified.  There is multifocal confluent and punctate FLAIR-
hyperintensity in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular,
as well as central pontine white matter, representing chronic
microvascular infarction, related to the patient's numerous
chronic medical illnesses. However, apart from the
susceptibility artifact originating from the extra-axial
hemorrhage, there is no evidence of restricted diffusion to
indicate acute infarction. There is also no white matter
abnormality to specifically suggest the presence of posterior
reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The major intracranial
vascular flow-voids, including those of the dural venous
sinuses, are preserved (see MRA, below). Incidentally noted are
mild-moderate chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal
sinuses with bilateral maxillary mucus- retention cysts.
.
There is normal flow-related enhancement in the included
intracranial portions of both internal carotid and proximal
middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with normal symmetric
arborization of MCA branches and no flow-limiting stenosis.
There is normal flow-related enhancement in distal vertebral
arteries with dominant left and hypoplastic right vessel, as
well as the basilar artery, which is markedly tortuous, and
bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries,
with no flow-limiting stenosis. Anterior and left posterior
communicating vessels are demonstrated, and there is no aneurysm
larger than 3 mm in diameter.
.
The axial 2D time-of-flight sequence is somewhat limited;
however, there is normal flow-signal in bilateral common and
proximal internal and external carotid arteries, which are
grossly normal in caliber and contour, with no flow-limiting
stenosis. There is normal flow- signal in the cervical vertebral
arteries with markedly dominant left and hypoplastic right
vessel, as on the cranial MRA, w
