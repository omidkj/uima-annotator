History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11924**] is a 66 yo female with h/o HCV cirrhosis, DM2, CAD
s/p recent [**Known lastname **] who was dc'd from [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-15**] and now presents
from NH with hypotension and ? hct drop. Pt denies any fevers,
chills, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath,
dysuria or cough. She states she was woken up at the nursing
facility and told that she needed to come in. Per ER report this
was due to low SBP. Per patient care referral from, she was
being admitted for hct of 24 (last hct on [**5-15**] was 25.9).
.
Upon arrival to the ER her VS were: T 97.4 HR 84 BP 62/24 and O2
sat 97%. She was A&O x3, and SBPs ranged in the 70s-80. She was
treated with 3 L IVF and vancomycin and zosyn to cover for
sepsis. A RIJ was placed and she was started on levophed with
improvement in SBPs to low 100s.
.
In the ICU her only complaint was that she was tired. She was
started on levophed and was started on Ceftriaxone for SBP
treatment. She was followed by the liver service. 4/5 days of
her treatment course was completed. She was found to have acute
renal failure which was thought to be due to hypotension and
ATN. She received albumin for the renal failure and had flash
pulmonary edema on [**5-19**] which was treated with diuretics.
.
ROS: Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria, anorexia or
decreased PO intake.
States she has diarrhea all the time d/t lactulose. Also states
she fell yesterday after losing her balance, but did not have
dizziness or chest pain at the time.

4. [**Date Range **] in [**5-6**]: EKG c/w anteroseptal MI with new ST elevations
in V2-3. Elevated troponins but not cath candidate. Echo
confirmed anteroseptal WMA and pt was medicallly managed.
5. diastolic CHF
6. CKD

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2188-5-17**]
Right IJ central venous catheter has been pulled back, tip now
situated in the lower portion of the SVC. There is no
pneumothorax. Appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged,
with findings most consistent with mild CHF and small bilateral
pleural effusions, and pulmonary vascular congestion.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2188-5-17**]
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
61 182 82 446/447 47 -22 33
Sinus rhythm. Borderline low QRS voltage. Delayed R wave
progression with
late precordial QRS transition. Non-specific precordial
lead/anterior T wave abnormalities. Findings are non-specific
but clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2188-5-6**] precordial lead
T wave changes appear slightly more prominent.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2188-5-19**]
Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
increased airspace opacity involving both lungs. There are
persistent bilateral pleural effusions. Right internal jugular
central venous catheter is again seen with its tip in the SVC.
No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Trachea
is midline.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2188-5-21**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrial volume is
increased. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal
anterior septum and anterior wall.. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-5-5**], the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher.
The other findings are similar.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2188-5-20**]
FINDINGS: Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no lower
extremity DVT bilaterally.
.
[**2188-5-22**] - EGD report
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Granularity and erythema of the mucosa were noted in
the stomach body. These findings are compatible with mild portal
hypertensive gastropathy.
 Protruding Lesions A few small gastric nodules were seen in the
fundus.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other
findings: No evidence of varices.
Impression: Granularity and erythema in the stomach body
compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy
Nodules in the fundus
No evidence of varices.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo female with h/o HCV cirrhosis, DM2, CAD s/p recent [**Year (4 digits) **]
admitted to MICU for hypotension which was thought to be due to
SBP/fluid depletion. Hypotension resolved w/empiric SBP
treatment and IVFs/albumin. She was then transferred to the
floor in stable condition but with persistent oxygen requirement
after having had episode of flash pulmonary edema 2 days prior.

.
# Hypotension:  Pt's baseline SBP are in the 90s given her
underlying ESLD. Pt required levophed in the MICU and is now
stable off levophed. T
