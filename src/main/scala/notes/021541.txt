Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3963**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 year old male with a PMH signfiicant for CLL, BPH,
Cholelithiasis, hematuria, UTI, PUD, and prior upper extremity
DVT who presents with tachycardia.

Notably, patient has a month-long admission from [**2183-10-28**] -
[**2183-11-29**] for new diagnosis CLL. Patient received both
chemotherapy and radiation during his stay, complicated only by
nausea. He also underwent chest tube placement by interventional
pulmonology which drained fluid consistent with a chylothorax.

The patient was in clinic for a routine follow-up for his CLL
when he was noted to have a heart rate in the 200s and a BP
80/55. An EKG showed SVT; a PIV was palced, and the patient was
given 6 mg adenosine, which reversed the patient into a sinus
rhythm in the 100s. The patient does not have known cardiac or
conduction system disease and was referred to the ED for further
evaluation.

In the ED initial vital signs were 99.5 110 98/55 18 97%. The
patient denied having any chest pain, sob, pleuretic pain. He
says his BP normally is 100s/60s. He has noted that he has been
very nauseaus and vomiting, but attirbutes this to his
chemo/radiation regimen; he did note that his vomitus was very
dark. He denies any personal or family history of clots save for
the one that was discovred around his PICC line during his
admission. He also says that he believes he has gotten all of
his doses of Lovenox, which he was discharged on. A CTA was
performed which showed pulmonary embolism. A CT head was
negative for any mass. Patient was noted to be intermittently
hypotensive inot the 80s with response to fluid bolus. Heparin
gtt was started. Most recent vitals from ED were HR 90, BP
100/58, O2 99% RA. Patient was given 1.5 L IVF in the ED, and
has 3 PIVs (20, 22,and 18 G).

Studies:

Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. Right axis deviation.
Right
bundle-branch block. Low voltage in the limb leads. Compared to
the previous racing of [**2183-10-27**] there is probably no significant
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with a pmh significant for a newly diagnosed
CLL in [**10/2183**], DVT, and found to have PE admitted for
supraventricular tachycardia, PE, and dehydration.

# Dehydration: Likely in the setting of post-treatment nausea
and vomiting. He has had emesis and nausea and been unable to
take good PO at home. It generally occurs at night time, without
a clear etiology. He had a scan of his head which was negative
for any acute process. He was transiently hypotensive with SBPs
in the 80s, with good response to fluid boluses. He had nausea
controlled with compazine in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and on the floor. He was
able to take good PO and had a good appettite and intake by the
time of discharge. He was discharged with anti-emetics to be
taken QHS for nausea.

# PE: He had a CTA on admission to the ED with SVT, and was
found to have a PE. He recently had an upper extremity DVT
diagnosed during his past admission.  He did not have a CTA
after diagnosis of DVT and he had near resolution of his DVT on
discharge. He was discharged home on lovenox 1.5mg/kg daily due
to inability to give himself injections. While admitted he was
monitored in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on a heparin drip and was then converted
to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]. It was not felt that he was a lovenox failure,
and rather the SVT was likely secondary to the significant
dehydration on top of a chronic PE.  We attempted to have him
discharged on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] 1mg/kg dosing, however he did not have
the visual acuity or dexterity to give himself injections. He
also did not have anyone at home to give him an injection. We
investigated the possibility of fundaparinux, however it was
contraindicated in him because of his weight (under 50kg). We
decided to have him discharged on lovenox 1.5mg/kg dosing with
assistance from VNA. He was discharged with follow-up on Monday
[**2183-12-8**], on 7-[**Hospital Ward Name **].

# SVT: Likely in the setting of dehydration from emesis and poor
PO intake. PE may have been a contributing factor. He was 200
BPM and asymptomatic.  He broke with adenosine 6mg x1 in clinic,
prior to being sent to the ED.  During the rest of the admission
he was in sinus rhythm with normal rate or slight tachycardia
(100-105).

# Transfer of care: He was discharged home with VNA for lovenox
injections. He was also discharged with anti-emetics for nausea
QHS. He was set-up with a clinic appointment in 7 [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2183-12-8**].
