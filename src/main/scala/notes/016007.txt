lung bases with prolonged expiration, crackles on inspiration,
and expiratory wheezes. Labs notable for WBC 14.4, neut 78%, 7%
bands. CXR showed increased lung volumes, and increased
atelectasis. The patient was started on non-invasive
ventillation, with marked improvement in his respiratory status.
He was given vancomycin 1 gm IV, cefepime 1gm IV, hydrocortisone
100 mg IV, and combivent nebs. On transfer to the floor, vital

Imaging:
[**9-14**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous bibasilar opacities are
suggestive of atypical CHF or viral pneumonia.

[**9-14**] LENIs: Negative

[**9-14**] KUB Pending


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with COPD, CHF (EF 30%), Afib, adrenal insufficiency,
presenting with dyspnea, hypoxia, bandemia.
.
#COPD: CXR without infiltrate, although patient had leukocytosis
and bandemia. LENIs were negative so no further work up for PE
was completed given low suspicion. He was treated for a COPD
exacerbation. Stage IV COPD. Last PFTs from [**2195-7-9**] showed FVC
56% of predicted, FEV1 29% of predicted, FEV1/FVC 52% of
predicted. He was treated with 100mg IV Q8hrs hydrocortisone
(dosed for adrenal insufficiency), ipratropium, Advair,
albuterol/ipratropium nebs and doxycycline(avoided macrolides
and fluoroquinolones due to risk of QTc prolongation with
concurrent amiodarone use and evidence of marked ectopy at
baseline) . He wore BiPAP occasionally and slept well overnight
on NC saturating in mid 90s. He clinically improved and was
transferred to the medical floor. His steroids were tappered to
50MG PO b.i.d by discharge and he was instructed on longterm
home taper.
.
#Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 30% by echo [**2194-7-2**]. He
remained euvolemic and was restarted on his home dose of Lasix
upon transfer to the medical floor.

#Bandemia: Unclear infectious source. Patient presented with
pulmonary symptoms, but CXR not impressive for pneumonia. U/A
negative. Cultures sent but were pending upon discharge.
.
#Adrenal insufficiency: Thought to be secondary to chronic
inhaled corticosteroid use. His IV steroids for COPD
exacerbation were dosed for adrenal insufficiency/stress dosed.
He was gradually tapered per endocrine recommendations.

#Afib: Currently in sinus with frequent ectopy. INR
subtherapeutic. He was continued on digoxin, amiodarone and
started on heparin gtt

#Ventricular ectopy: Hemodynamically stable. Has ICD. No signs
of ischemia on EKG. Lytes were closely monitored and repleted.
