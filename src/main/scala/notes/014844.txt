Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2121-7-30**] with weakness and SOB.  She
r/o for an MI and cardiac surgery was consulted.  Her creatinine
was elevated to 2.2 and she was evaluated by renal.  Cardiac
surgery was consulted and after she was cleared by renal, she
underwent CABGx3(LIMA->LAD, SVG->Ramus and RCA) on [**2121-8-4**].  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition on Neo and Propofol.  She was extubated on
POD#1 and had her CTs d/c'd on POD#2.  During her postop course
she was followed by the renal service and her creatinine
remained in the 2 range.
On POD#2 she had intermittent confusion and required Haldol.
She was transferred to the floor and her mental status returned
to baseline on POD#4.  Her wires were d/c'd on POD#3 and she
went into AF that PM.  She was loaded with Amio and remained in
AF.  She was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin and
discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#7.
