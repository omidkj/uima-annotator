History of Present Illness:
67 year-old male with history of hypertension, obesity, and GERD
admitted following stress ECHO today for cardiac
catheterization.  Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] first started noticing chest pain
last [**Month (only) 359**], which he describes as epigastric, lower sternal
pain that was worse when he was laying down at night.  Patient
was initially treated for GERD and underwent EGD showing mild
gastritis.  His symptoms did not improve despite increasing
doses of PPI and recently adding ranitidine.  Over the past two
weeks the quality of the pain has changed in that it is slightly
worse and occurs more with exertion.  At work, he has had to
stop with his activity when the pain comes on and it takes up to
20 minutes for the pain to improve.
.
Today he was initially scheduled for a stress ECHO.  He had an
EKG with new anterior Q waves from his prior EKG in 2/[**2180**].  He
had a resting ECHO that showed anterior, anteroseptal, and
apical akinesis.  Instead of stress ECHO the patient underwent
stress MIBI to assess for viability.  Pt exercised 5:00 of [**Doctor First Name **]
protocol, stopping for fatigue and SOB. Peak HR 100 and target
HR not achieved (had taken atenolol this AM). In leads V3-V4, ST
elevation became more prounced and R wave developed in V3.
Patient had hypotensive BP response to exercise with blood
pressure dropping from 140/70 to 96/68.  He also had chest
discomfort in recovery. Following the stress he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
On cardiac catheterization patient was found to have severe
proximal LAD lesion, severe mid-RCA, mild left circumflex. On
arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable, in no acute
distress. Referred for CABG.

Pertinent Results:
Echo
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex. The
anterolateral wall contracts reasonably well. The rest of the
walls are severely hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on milrinone and norepinephrine
infusions. Left ventricular function appears mildly improved
(LVEF 30-35%). The apex remains akinetic. The anterolateral wall
is hyperdynamic. The rest of the walls are now mildly
hypokinetic. Right ventricular function is unchanged. There is
trace mitral regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
aorta is intact post-decannulation.

[**2181-8-15**]: CARDIAC CATH: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel disease. The LMCA had a
diffuse 40% stenosis. The LAD had a 90% diffuse stenosis of the
entire proximal segment. The LCx had a 30% proximal stenosis and
a 70% stenosis in a lower pole branch of a large branching OM1.
The mid RCA had a 95% stenosis with competitive flow in PDA from
collateral from left coronary. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel
coronary artery disease with severe proximal LAD disease. 2. If
LAD territory viable, would recommend CABG

EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, no significant change compared to
the tracing done on [**2181-8-15**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital after abnormal stress for
cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe
coronary artery diseae and he was referred for surgical
evaluation.  He underwent preoperative workup and of note
echocardiogram revealed decreased left ventricular function.  On
[**8-17**] he was brought to the operating room for coronary artery
bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for further details.
 He remained intubated overnight, require milirone and levophed
for hemodynamic support.  Early am on post operative day one he
self extubated, and remained extubated with no evidence of
injury.  He was progressively weaned off inotropic support and
pressors.  He continued to progress and was started on
betablockers and diuretics.  Physical therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility.  He was changed to toprol XL and started
on ace inhibitor due to systolic heart failure.  On post
operative day six he was ready for discharge home with services.
