History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 102892**] is a 50 year old male with ESRD [**12-20**] Alport's
disease and two failed renal x-plants on HD who presented to the
ED complaining of itching. In discussion with the renal fellow,
the patient has been agitated and complaining of pruritis at his
dialysis appointments for the last week, and was unable to be
dialyzed today secondary to agitation. He left dialysis and came
to the ED today. He reported in the ED that he has been
non-compliant with phos-lo for the last week. He cannot respond
to questions secondary to agitation.
.
In the ED his vitals were 97.1, 65, BP 213/119, 20, 98% RA. An
EKG revealed peaked T waves and a K was 6.2. He was given
kayexalate, insulin and D50, however FS fell to 44. He was given
3 more amps of D50 with normalization of his FS. He was highly
aggitated in the ED, and received 2 mg ativan without much
effect. He subsquently received 2.5 mg IV Haldol, then another
5, in addition to another 1 mg ativan, as he had become
progressively more agitated. By the time he had arrived in the
MICU he had received 7.5 mg Haldol, 3 mg ativan. He had to be
placed in 4 point leather restraints.
.
He was given hydralazine a total of 45 mg IV without much
response, although it was noted that his blood pressure dropped
to 170s systolic when calm and sleeping.
.
On arrival in the MICU he was given 10 mg IV haldol, 2 mg Ativan
for extreme agitation.


Past Medical History:
1) Alport's syndrome, ESRD s/p 2 failed renal txplants, on HD
2) R testicular mass
3) Dilated CM with recovery of function, etiology likely HTN vs.

myocarditis. Last echo [**3-22**]: Conclusions:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF> 55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. The right upper pulmonary flow velocity was 80 cm/sec, the
right lower PV flow velocity was 80 cm/sec , and the left upper
PV flow velocity was 60-80 cm/sec. The left lower PV was not
seen.
4) CHF
5) HTN
6) SVT s/p ablation [**3-22**]
7) Cataracts/laser surgery
8) Seizures (? metabolic)
9) Fractured knee s/p MVA

year-old son. Previously working with computers.

age)
Father: CAD and a CABG at age 60 - he later died of lung cancer
(was a smoker).

Physical Exam:
PE: 204/109, HR 146, RR 24, 98% RA
Gen: Muscular african american male, rapidly shifting from
extreme agitation and thrashing to somnolence and snoring.
Appearing in acute distress at times, almost scared, pleading
for help.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae.

The remainder of exam could not be performed secondary to

CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with mild/moderate fluid overload.
2. Mild opacification of right mid lung zone, possibly
represents early pneumonia. Recommend repeat imaging following
diuresis and clinical correlation.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 year old male with ESRD secondary to Alport's Syndrome,
s/p 2 failed transplants, chronically on prednisone, presenting
with pruritis over the course of the last week, culminating in
acute agitation.

1) Delirium/agitation: The patient initially presented to the ER
with a chief complain of pruritis, during his ER admission he
was agitated likely due to his intense pruritis, ativan was
administered with paradoxical worsening of his agitation
additional doses of ativan and then haldol were given, which
contributed to his delirius and agitated state. Ultimately,
secondary to intratable agitation he was sedated and intubated.
Multiple studies were ordered to determine the etiology of his
delirium, his toxicology screen was negative for illicit drugs.
He also had a history of seizure activity, and the rapid cycling
of the agitation and somnolence was suspicious of status
epilepticus and an EEG was conducted and is still pending on
dischareg.  A head ct was unrevealing with no bleed or acute
changes.  Infectious etiologies were considered, the patient had
no clinical signs of infection. He remained afebrile with normal
WBC, cultures were negative for growth. A RPR was pending on
discharge.  The patient was hypoglycemic while in the ED, but
agitation persisted after glucose correction.  He was extubated
and transferred out of the MICU and continued on dialysis and he
quickly normalized to his baseline mental state, awake alert and
orientated.  The etiology of his delerium and agitation was
thought to be associated with his end stage renal disease, as
improvement was noted with dialysis.

.
2) Pruritis: The pruritis may have been secondary to uremia,
although BUN was close to baseline.  His pruritis was controlled
with sarna lotion and benadryl.  Infectious etiologies were
considered as he did have eosinophil elevation, and the patient
was being treated on steroids, a strongyloides Ab was sent out
is still pending.  He continued with dialysis and his pruritis
improved, on discharge he had no complaints of itching.

.
3) HTN: Patient was not hypertension during admission. His
antihypertensives were initially held, but he became
hypertensive during his admission and was restarted on his
outpatient regiment of metoprolol and lisinopril with good
control of pressures.

.
4) Hypoglycemia: Secondary to insulin in ED with impaired renal
clearance in ESRD. His sugars quickly were normalized with D50
and remained in good control throughout his admission.

.
6) ESRD s/p transplant: He was scheduled for his routine
dialysis while inpatient, and also aluminum hydroxide while the
patient was NPO, eventually he was started on renagel with
increasing dosage when he tolerated PO intake and discharged
with renagel.  He was also continued on his home regiment of
prednisone

.
8) FEN: He was initially NPO with normal electrolytes except for
potassium and phosphate, he was restarted on a low phosphate
diet without difficulty.
.
9) Code: Full.
