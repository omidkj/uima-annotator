[**2162-4-12**] [**2162-4-12**] [**2162-4-14**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7001**]/mrr??????

DIAGNOSIS:

Left atrial mass:

Consistent with atrial myxoma with fresh hemorrhage and focal
associated fibrosis of subjacent atrial wall.

Clinical:  Atrial myxoma.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's
name, "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85786**]", the medical record number and "atrial
mass." It consists of a fragment of white fibrous tissue overall
measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm. Emulating from the center of the
tissue is a red raised fragment of gelatinous tissue measuring
1.0 x 0.6 cm raised 1.0 cm above the surface of the specimen. On
cut section the mass is red and hemorrhagic within the center.
The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes A-B.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85786**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation which included a
neurology evaluation. It was felt the risk of hemorrhagic
conversion  of his left parietal cortical infarct was relatively
low risk, and he was cleared for surgery. On [**4-12**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed removal of left atrial mass. For surgical
details, please see operative note. Given inpatient stay was
greater than 24 hours prior to operation, he was given
Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotic coverage. Following
surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. His CVICU course was uneventful, and
he transferred to the telemetry floor on postoperative day one.
He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight.Went into rapid A
fib and was loaded with amiodarone. No coumadin per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol. Cleared for
discharge to home with VNA on POD #5 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
