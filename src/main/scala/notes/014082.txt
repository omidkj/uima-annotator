CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right thigh hematoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female a
bioprosthetic mitral valve for rheumatic heart disease, with
known chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated.  The
patient traumatized her right thigh two days prior to
admission and noted a small, bruised area which has increased
in size and was associated with increasing pain.

The patient was evaluated in the Emergency Room.  She
received if and p.o. Morphine sulfate for pain control with
episode of hypertension.  Hematocrit was 31.9 and dropped to
the 26.0.  Her thigh hematoma continues to increase and the
thigh is tense with bloody bullae.  The patient received four
units of FFP, five mg of Vitamin K and two liters of
intravenous fluid.

The patient was transferred to the vascular service for
continued care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatic heart disease; status post
mitral valve times three; last valve was in [**2109**]. History of
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25 to 30%,
in [**2117-11-10**].  P-MIBI on the [**2120-1-12**]
showed an ejection fraction of 69%.  Hypertension.
Hypercholesterolemia.  Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled.
Femoral-femoral bypass in [**2114**].

ALLERGIES:
Penicillin.
Inderal. (Manifestations unknown.)

MEDICATIONS:
Coumadin 6 mg h.s.
Indivasc 7.5 mg twice a day.
Atenolol 50 mg q. day.
Lasix 80 mg q. day.
Potassium chloride.
Aspirin.
Lipitor 10 mg q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in [**Location 26931**] with her
grandson.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  96.8; 108/89; 65; 18;
100% on two liters.  General:  Appearance is pleasant, white
female, sleepy and in no acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS,
NOSE AND THROAT:  Unremarkable.  Neck examination is without
carotid bruits, lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Chest examination shows diminished breath sounds on the right
base with an irregular tachycardia and a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur heard at the right lower sternal border.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable with bowel sounds
present.  The right thigh is large, firm hematoma with bloody
four cm bullae with a 1+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulse with
no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory work in the Emergency Room
included hematocrit of 32 which dropped to 26 and then to 24,
requiring transfusion and reversal.  BUN 31; creatinine 1.2.
Potassium of 4.3.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with no acute
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained n.p.o.  She was seen
by the vascular service.  Recommendations were that she would
require a hematoma evacuation.  The patient desaturated
secondary to volume overload. Blood gases were 7.23, 77, 80
and 34. Prior to intubation, chest x-ray showed elevated
right hemi-diaphragm but no congestive heart failure.  She
also was started on Neo-Synephrine to maintain her systolic
blood pressure. She was transferred to the unit.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7563**] was made aware of the patient's admission and
clinical status and they followed her during the
perioperative period.  On [**2120-2-9**], the patient underwent
incision and drainage and evacuation of hematoma of the right
thigh.  She tolerated the procedure well. [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drains times two were placed. We drained more than a liter of
hematoma fluid.  She was transferred back to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for continued care.

Postoperative day number one, she remained intubated.  There
were no overnight events.  Low grade temperature of 100.2.
Cardiac output was 2.9; PAP of 58; M-31 CEP 14.  Blood gases
were 7.43, 40, 99, 27 and 1.

Hematocrit stabilized to 28.8.  BUN of 34; creatinine of 1.5.
INR was 1.7 with a PTT of 34.5.

The patient's Dopamine was weaned and continued with
diuresis.  Her respiratory support was SIMV to C-Pap for
anticipating extubation.  The patient remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Cardiology felt that the
patient's atrial fibrillation was well controlled and that
she was maximized on her medical therapy.  The patient was
extubated on postoperative day number two.  Wound was
described as indurated.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain had minimal
drainage.  Heparin drip was initiated without bolus to
maintain a goal PTT of 60 to 80.  Antibiotics were
discontinued.  Dressings were Silvadene, Adaptic, Kerlix, Ace
to the leg twice a day.

The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for continued monitoring and care.  The patient
continued to do well. Her diet was advanced as tolerated.
Her platelet count was monitored because of thrombocytopenia
which stabilized at 79,000.  Swan was discontinued on
postoperative day number four. Her Coumadin was reinstituted
with a goal INR of three and she was transferred to the
regular nursing floor.

Cefazolin was begun for erythematous changes of the thigh.

Physical therapy began to work with the patient.  Cefazolin
will be continued and the two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were
removed.  The patient was seen by physical therapy who felt
that she would require rehabilitation placement, prior to
returning to home.

Postoperative day number five, the Foley was discontinued.
The patient had no difficulty voiding post removal.  Case
management was requested to begin rehabilitation screening
and the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were removed.  The remaining
hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient could be
discharged from the vascular surgery standpoint when
cardiology was satisfied with her INR.  Goal INR was 3.0 to
3.5.  She should continue Keflex 500 mg for a total of seven
days post discharge and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3124**] in one
weeks time.
