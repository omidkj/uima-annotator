Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stents to the right
coronary artery and proximal ramus artery.


History of Present Illness:
 This is an 88 year old creole speaking male nursing home
resident with a PMH significant for HTN, and DM who presented
with symptoms of dyspnea and abdominal pain radiating to the
neck.  He was tranferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED for management
of STEMI and is s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 to RCA and [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to Ramus with 3VD on
cath (Lcx, ramus and RCA, right dominant).
.
The patient reported severe "gas pain" radiating to the neck on
the night of [**2-2**] at his nursing facility and presented
with sudden onset dyspnea this morning prompting transfer to
[**Hospital3 **].  He has never experienced this sensation
before.  At [**Hospital1 **], initial saturations were in the low 80s and
a CXR demonstrated cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and
infiltrates. Labs were significant for elevated BNP (555) and
troponin I (2.2). EKG demonstrated ST elevation in III, AVF with
reciprocal depression lateral leads.  He was given ASA, lasix
and started on a nitro gtt prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of STEMI.
.
Upon transfer, he was chest pain free, initial vitals 97.5 96
122/70 20 100% NRB.  EKG demonstrated ST elevation noted III,
AVF with reciprocal depression lateral leads initially felt to
be < 1mm. Troponin t 1.05.  He was guaiac neg. Heparin gtt
started. He was transferred to the cath lab.
.
Catheterization demonstrated right dominant system with diffuse
disease in the mid - distal RCA with 90% stenosis followed by
ectactic segments and a subtotal versus recanalized total
occlusion and faint distal filling.  Three [**Hospital1 **] were deployed to
the RCA. Left heart cath was significant for proximal occlusion
of the ramus with no effective antegrade perfusion.  A single
[**Hospital1 **] was deployed.  The left circumfelx was notable for diffuse
plaquing throughout 30-70%.
.
Integrellin, aspirin and plavix were started after the procedure
and he was transferred to the CCU in stable condition for
further monitoring. He was chest pain free on arrival to the
floor. V/S were 92 116/66 18 and 95 on 5L NC.
.
On review of systems, he denied abdominal pain, fevers. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
CATH [**2184-2-3**]: final
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coornary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension
3. Elevated PCW consistent with at least moderate Left
ventricular
diastolic heart failure.
4. Severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
5. Successful deployment of three bare metal stents in mid and
distal AV
groove RCA (likely a more chronic subtotal vs. recanalized total

occlusion).
6. Successful deployment of one bare metal stent in proximal
ramus
intermedius (likely the culprit lesion for the inferior STEMI).
7. Right femoral artery atherosclerosis.
.
CXR [**2184-2-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate pulmonary edema.
2. Bilateral moderate pleural effusion.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.

TTE [**2184-2-4**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20-25 %) with extensive akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated left ventricle
with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis of all
remaining segments.
