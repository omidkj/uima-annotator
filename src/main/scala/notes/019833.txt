PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Generally, the patient
appears exhausted but is not in acute distress.  Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular
rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are significant
for a right lower extremity with dry gangrene of the third
toe, adjacent erythematous change of the second and fourth
toes.  Tender to palpation, especially over the plantar
surface.  There is significant malodor, but no obvious
purulent discharge.  Palpable right posterior tibial.  The
left foot looks relatively healthy, with a palpable left
posterior tibial and graft pulses.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC 10.9/38.0/404.  Chemistry
133/5.9/86/34/49/6.6/211.  Lactate is 2.0.

RADIOLOGY ON ADMISSION:  Right foot x-ray demonstrates no
obvious osteomyelitis or subcutaneous air in the right foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for antibiotics to
treat his right foot cellulitis.  He was evaluated for
potential amputation, and also given hemodialysis.  On
[**2161-1-29**], the patient was brought to the operating room and
had a right third toe ray amputation and debridement
performed.  For details of this, please see the previously
dictated operative note.  Subsequent to this, the patient had
a fairly [**Male First Name (un) 3928**] postoperative course complicated by what was
thought to be torsades [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 29185**].  Cardiology was
consulted, and they felt that the offending factor was likely
the large dose of methadone that he was one, which can
lengthen the QT interval.  The patient was transferred to the
intensive care unit for close monitoring.  Cardiology
consultation service was obtained.  The torsades which was
encountered perioperatively required direct cardioversion.
Subsequent to this, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was prolonged
primarily due to volume overload requiring hemodialysis, as
well as infectious disease workup.  The patient had had high
fevers and was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
Flagyl under the guidance of the infectious disease consult
service.  Ultimately the patient had no significant blood
cultures.  He did, however, have wound swab which upon
initial presentation grew out coag negative staph as well as
E. coli.  Repeat foot swab on [**2161-2-11**] demonstrated C. albicans
as well as coag negative staph.  The patient had no
significant blood cultures.  Though he had some fever issues
and was followed by the infectious disease consult service,
ultimately the workup demonstrated no obvious source within
the foot.  Ultimately, the patient was discharged home,
having been afebrile for 48 hours and with a normal white
count.  The patient also had a history of dry gangrene and
necrosis of his fingertips, for which the plastic surgery
service was consulted.  They felt there was no need to do
emergent surgery.
