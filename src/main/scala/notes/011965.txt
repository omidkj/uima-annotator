History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo M with history of atrial fibrillation on
warfarin and hyperlipidemia who presents with altered mental
status.  Patient has had sinus congestion and drainage for the
past 4-5 days and saw his PCP for this who prescribed
azithromycin and decongestant.  He started these medications
yesterday and developed a severe headache on the night of
admission with temperature of 100.7.  He was confused so his
wife brought him to [**Location (un) **] Cope Hospital.
.
In the ER there, he continued to be confused and had CT of his
head which showed opacificiation of his sphenoid sinus with
concern for epidural abscess vs subdural empyema.  No LP was
performed given this concern but he was given vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 P 86 BP 118/79 R 16 O2 sat
93% RA. Patient's CT was reviewed by neurosurgery here who felt
there was no CNS extension of the sinus opacification.  Patient
was alerted and oriented to person only.  He withdraws to pain
but does not follow commands.  Neurology reviewed the film with
her CT with radiology and agrees there does not appear to be any
signs of empyema or abscess.  Ampicillin 1g was given for
listeria meningitis coverage and patient also received 10mg IV
Zyprexa for agitation.  LP was recommended by deferred given INR
of 3.0.  Patient was transferred to the MICU with vitals of 78,
120/84, 19, 99% RA.
.
In the ICU, patient is not answering questions or following
commands.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2135-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
No active pulmonary disease.
.
SKULL X-RAY [**2135-5-7**]:
Two views of the skull, two views of the neck and two views of
the abdomen are submitted for report. Positioningis suboptimal
and there is motion artifact on the view of the upper abdomen.
There is metal in the patient's teeth consistent with dental
work. Sternotomy wires are present in the upper chest and there
are surgical clips in the vertebral quadrant. There is no other
metallic foreign body.
.
MRI HEAD [**2135-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large meningocele involving bilateral sphenoid and left
posterior ethmoid
sinuses.

2. Pus completely opacifying the inferior sphenoid sinuses,
including the
left pterygoid recess, as well as the right frontal and
maxillary sinuses.  Fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
These findings are consistent with acute sinusitis.

3. Small focus of dural thickening and enhancement in the medial
left middle cranial fossa, along the sphenoid sinus, without
evidence of a drainable fluid collection.

4. Diffuse leptomeningitis.

5. Ventriculitis with pus in the ventricles.

6. Foci of high T2 signal in the supratentorial white matter,
without
contrast enhancement, most likely representing chronic
microvascular infarcts, given the patient's age and history of
coronary artery disease. Small chronic microhemorrhage in the
right frontal cortex, which could be hypertensive or related to
amyloid angiopathy.

7. Unremarkable head MRA. Please note that MRA has a poor
sensitivity for
mycotic aneurysms as they tend to affect the distal vasculature.


8. Unremarkable head MRV. Please note that MRV does not detect
cavernous
sinus thrombosis.
.
CTAP [**2135-5-7**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe airspace disease.
2. Extensive atherosclerosis.
3. No evidence of abscess, as questioned.
