Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy
RIJ

History of Present Illness:
69 YO m h/o CAD s/p MI and stent, mechanical [**First Name3 (LF) 1291**] x 2, VT s/p ICD
placement and multiple GIBs who presents following an episode of
shortness of breath, diaphoresis and dizziness at home. The
patient was in his usual state of health until three weeks ago
at which time he noticed inreasing shortness of breath with
exertion (at baseline he can walk to the mailbox and back and
recently he has had pain with limited movement around his
house). Over the past four days he has noted increasing anginal
episodes for which he has used nitroglycerin 5 times. He has
also noticed black colored stools over the past four days. On
the morning of presentation he was preparing food and he became
lightheaded, diaphoretic and short of breath and felt as if he
would pass out but did not lose consciousness or fall down.
During this episode he did not experience any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Recently he denies any
fevers or chills. He denies any episodes of ICD firing. He
denies hematochezia, hematemasis or BRBPR.
.
In the ED the patient was chest pain free. He was found to have
a hematocrit of 23.7, a troponin of 0.06, was guaiac positive
with a negative NG lavage. EKG revealed a ventricularly paced
rhythm at 68 bpm. He received aspirin 325 mg, protonix IV and 2
units PRBCs. He underwent central line placement secondary to
poor IV access and coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR
.
Transferred to MICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of
CAD s/p MI and stenting, mechanical [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] x 2, VT s/p ICD
placement and GIB who presents with GIB and found to have
duodenitis.
.
1. GIB: The patient was admitted with a GI bleed in the setting
of a supratherapeutic INR.  On the night of admission he
received FFP to reverse his anticoagulation.  On hospital day 2
he underwent upper endoscopy which failed to reveal a discrete
bleeding source but showed mild duodenitis. He required a total
of 5 units PRBC over the course of three days before his
hematocrit stabilized.   Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated on
admission and peaked at a troponin of 0.11 and in the setting of
blood loss and reduced renal function this was thought to be
most likely secondary to demand ischemia.  On admission the
patient was also noted to have an elevated creatinine kinase
which continued to rise on hospital days 2 and 3 out of
proportion to his elevation in cardiac enzymes.  It was decided
to stop the patient's statin and upon doing so his CKs
immediately began to trend down.  The patient's Coumadin and
aspirin were restarted on hospital day 5 for anticoagulation in
the setting of a mechanical aortic valve.
.
2. Anemia: Patient was guaiac positive with dark brown stool in
the ED with a negative gastric lavage.  Patient has a history of
ileal AVM diagnosed in [**2156**] after experiencing a similar episode
of bleeding. His baseline hematocrit is 30-32 but was 38 on
[**2158-10-20**].  He had a negative colonoscopy in [**2156**] and a normal
EGD in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.  Possible etiologies include rebleeding
AVM vs. duodenal ulcer. Lower GI etiologies less likely given
lack of BRBPR.  Patient received FFP and blood transfusions.
Patient's INR was 4.2 on admission and Coumadin was held. Upper
endoscopy showed duodenitis.  He was treated with transfusions
plus Lasix to limit volume overload, PPI [**Hospital1 **], serial HCT checks.
 Coumadin and aspirin were restarted on HD 5 for anticoagulation
in the setting of a mechanical valve.
.
3. Chest Pain: Patient has had increasing anginal episodes over
the past week relieved with nitroglycerine.  Most likely
secondary to decreased hematocrit causing demand ischemia.
Troponin was 0.06 on admission and peaked at 0.11.  EKG
unrevealing secondary to paced ventricular rhythm.  Treated with
BB, statin, Imdur, NTG.  Aspirin was initially held until
patient stabilized.  Elevated creatinine kinase which continued
to rise on hospital days 2 and 3 out of proportion to his
elevation in cardiac enzymes.  It was decided to stop the
patient's statin and upon doing so his CKs immediately began to
trend down.
.
4. Mechanical AV: Reluctant to fully reverse his anticoagulation
secondary to his mechanical valve.  Coumadin was held and his
INR trended down slowly. The patient's Coumadin and aspirin were
restarted on hospital day 5 for anticoagulation in the setting
of a mechanical aortic valve.  Antibiotics given for prophylaxis
for EGD.
.
5. Elevated Creatinine: Baseline creatinine is 1.5-1.6.  On
admission was slightly elevated at 2.0 likely secondary to blood
loss.  At the time of discharge creatinine was at baseline.
.
6. Hypertension: Stable
- Continue Imdur, Metoprolol
.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Lipitor, Lopid.  On admission the patient was
also noted to have an elevated creatinine kinase which continued
to rise on hospital days 2 and 3 out of proportion to his
elevation in cardiac enzymes.  It was decided to stop the
patient's statin and upon doing so his CKs immediately began to
trend down.
.
8. Hypothyroidism
- Continue Levoxyl
