Pertinent Results:
[**2127-5-13**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an
akinetic mid to distal anterior,and anteroseptal wall and
akinetic LV apical aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Right ventricular systolic function remains normal. There is a
slight improvement in LV function in the walls that had normal
function pre-bypass. Pre-existing RWMA's persist. No flow by
color Doppler is seen across the interatrial septum. Injection
of agitated saline contrast, at rest, with Valsalva and release
demonstrated no flow across the septum. The remaining study is
unchanged from prebypass.

[**2127-5-13**] Carotid Ultrasound


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89279**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-5-12**] via
transfer from [**Hospital 487**] [**Hospital 89280**] Hospital for surgical management
of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound. On
[**2127-5-13**], he was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and closure of a
patent foramen ovale. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He was slowly weaned from his
inotropes over the next two days. Beta blockade, aspirin and a
statin were resumed. On [**2127-5-16**], Mr. [**Known lastname 89279**] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Lisinopril was started
given his history of a myocardial infarction and ejection
fraction of 35%. He continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on [**2127-5-18**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient. He was discharged on 10 days of lasix and his volume
status will be re-evaluated as an outpatient. He was not on
lasix prior to surgery.
