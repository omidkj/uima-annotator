HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman
with a known history of coronary artery disease who underwent
a coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**2152**], had been
doing well with history of worsening mitral regurgitation and
dyspnea on exertion.  Patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation in [**4-/2164**] for which he underwent subsequent
cardioversion, and patient had an echocardiogram done in
[**5-/2164**] which showed moderate mitral stenosis and mitral
regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization in [**5-/2164**] showed
native three-vessel coronary artery disease with three patent
bypass grafts, globally hyperkinetic left ventricle with an
ejection fraction of 42 percent, 2 plus mitral regurgitation,
mild aortic insufficiency.  Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for redo sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease.

Status post CABG in [**2152**].

Mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation.

History of atrial fibrillation.

Asthma.

COPD.

Rheumatic heart disease.

Status post myocardial infarction in [**2152**].

Status post right inguinal hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to Codeine, which he reports
gives him GI upset.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Zocor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
2. Cardizem 240 mg p.o. q. day.
3. Advair inhaler one puff twice a day.
4. Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Combivent p.r.n.

As part of the patient's preoperative workup patient was
noted to have an abnormal chest x-ray.  Patient underwent an
evaluation for this by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1092**] Surgery.  Workup
was subsequently negative for any evidence of malignancy and
patient's surgery was rescheduled.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  Patient was admitted on [**2164-7-30**] and
taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a redo
sternotomy, a mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm mosaic
porcine valve, and a MAVE procedure.  Patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on 0.5 mcg/kg per minute
Amiodarone as well as propofol.

Upon leaving the Operating Room patient was noted to have a
fair amount of chest tube output.  Patient's coagulation
factors were repleted.  Patient was treated with blood
products.  However, patient continued to have large amount of
chest tube output.  Within a few hours postoperatively
patient was noted to have a decreasing blood pressure in
spite of increasing pressor requirements as well as
increasing filling pressures.  Echocardiogram was performed
at the bedside which showed a pericardial effusion.

Patient was taken back to the Operating Room for evacuation
of moderate amount of clot with improvement in the blood
pressure and decrease in the filling pressures.  Patient was
returned to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on
low-dose epinephrine.  Patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day number one.
Patient was noted postoperatively to have significant air
leak from all of his chest tubes.  This did not cause him any
respiratory compromise.  Patient's epinephrine was weaned off
and patient was started on diuretics with good response.
Upon extubation patient was noted to have moderate amount of
wheezing and shortness of breath which responded to chest
physiotherapy as well as diuretic.

Over the next day patient continued to receive diuresis and
chest physiotherapy, and patient was determined to be stable
and transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to a regular
part of the hospital on postoperative day number two.
Patient continued to have significant air leaks in his chest
tubes.  Patient began working with Physical Therapy.
Patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day
number four.  The next several days patient's chest tubes
were removed one at a time.  The patient continued to have
air leak in the remaining chest tubes.  By postoperative day
number the patient had one remaining chest tube with
continued air leak on water seal.  Recommendation was to
clamp the chest tube and reevaluate for evidence of
pneumothorax.  This was done, clamped overnight, and in the
morning there was no evidence of pneumothorax.  The chest
tube was removed without incident.

Patient had been evaluated by the Electrophysiology service
preoperatively for his atrial fibrillation.  Postoperatively
patient had not had any atrial fibrillation, but it was
recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to continue patient on 200 mg
a day of Amiodarone for one month as well as anticoagulate
with Coumadin for one month, at which time he would be
reevaluated for discontinuation of the therapy and determine
success of the MAVE procedure.

By postoperative day number 10 patient was able to ambulate
500 feet with Physical Therapy and climb one flight of
stairs.  However, patient was noted to desaturate with oxygen
saturations in the mid 80s upon ambulation, and it was
discussed with the Cardiac Surgery team and it was decided
that patient would be discharged to home with oxygen as
needed by the patient during ambulation with the thought that
the patient would be able to be weaned to off over the next
several days.  So, by postoperative day number 11 patient was
cleared for discharge with plans to discharge the patient on
postoperative day number 12.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  T-max 98.4 F, pulse 76, sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 108/50, respiratory rate 16, room air oxygen
saturation 95 percent at rest with oxygen saturation in the
high 80s with ambulation on room air and high 90s on 2 liters
nasal cannula with ambulation.  Patient's weight on
[**2164-8-10**] is 78.6 kg; preoperatively patient was 77 kg.
Neurologically, patient is awake, alert, oriented times
three, nonfocal.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
without rub or murmur.  Respiratory:  Breath sounds are clear
bilaterally, decreased at the left lung base.  GI:  Positive
bowel sounds; soft, nontender, nondistended.  Patient is
tolerating a regular diet and having normal bowel movement.
Extremities:  Left lower extremity has 1 plus edema, right
lower extremity with trace edema.  Sternal incision is clean,
dry, and intact without any erythema or drainage.  The right

resolution of what had been persistent small right apical
pneumothorax, significant decrease and almost resolution of
the subcutaneous air in the patient's neck, a small loculated
right pleural effusion, no pneumothorax on the left, no
evidence of CHF.
