Service:

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for shortness
of breath and presented with lower extremity swelling and
elevated cardiac enzymes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was found to have an
acute myocardial infarction and agreed to go to the Cardiac
Catheterization Suite and was found to have multi-vessel
coronary artery disease and moderate aortic stenosis.  The
patient was referred to the Cardiac Surgery Department.  The
patient was found to have moderate aortic stenosis and
multi-vessel coronary artery disease.  After careful
consideration and given that she had a recent non-Q wave
myocardial infarction, along with the catheterization
findings the patient, after informed consent was obtained,
decided to pursue an operative repair of these problems.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2159-11-28**], where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times one and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] aortic valve, Size No.
19.  Immediately in the perioperative period, the patient was
found to have ST segment changes.  A transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained immediately postoperative which
showed her ventricle to have some apical hypokinesia and
inadequate filling.  The patient then was given volume and
her blood pressure was maintained using alpha agents.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have peak
inspiratory pressures and was believed to have abdominal
compartment syndrome.

She was then taken back to the Operating Room where she
underwent an exploratory laparotomy.  She had her abdomen
opened in the midline and a Shisker silo dressing was applied
and was sewed to the abdominal wall.  She had drainage of
ascites and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.  She was also
given fresh frozen plasma and a unit of packed cells.  She
was also followed using an oxy-Swan.  Her ventilator was
slowly weaned thereafter and on postoperative day three, the
patient had her abdominal wound now closed in the midline,
stapled, and she tolerated that.  On the ventilator, there
was no change in her peak inspiratory pressures.  She was
followed by General Surgery during this hospitalization.

The patient was then extubated which she tolerated.  She
intermittently required Dopamine for heart rate control as
she tended to be bradycardic and Neo-Synephrine was used to
maintain her blood pressure.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and on
postoperative day seven went into atrial fibrillation.  She
was loaded with amiodarone with the orders to change to p.o.
amiodarone which was done, 400 mg p.o. three times a day.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy.  As her blood
pressure increased and Neo-Synephrine was weaned off, she was
started on Lasix.  She was awake and alert.  She required
some endotracheal suctioning.  She had a productive cough.
Her voice was hoarse, but overall her saturations were in the
90s on a face mask with an FIO2 of 0.4%.  She remained
afebrile with a stable hematocrit.

On [**12-6**], postoperative day eight from the exploratory
laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, postoperative
day six from abdominal wall closure, she had several
self-limiting runs of ventricular tachycardia, approximately
six to eight beats long, with minimum decrease in her blood
pressure and shortly thereafter was seen on the evening
rounds after having labs sent off and was noted to have a
decrease in her blood pressure significantly, dropped
approximately 20 pounds, and continued in a ventricular
tachycardia.

When her blood pressure dropped she had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed good right ventricular and left
ventricular filling and then shortly thereafter she went in
to ventricular tachycardia and had a full code performed.
Her chest was then opened, wires were cut, and after having
several episodes of attempts at electro-cardioversion,
externally, she had the internal lead paddles placed and was
attempted internal cardioversion.  She was able to generate a
paced rhythm for a blood pressure of 90/60.  She then had an
idioventricular rhythm and then subsequently became systolic.

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) **]intubated.  She was given epinephrine, bicarbonate,
Atropine, calcium.  She continued to have intermittent
periods of hypotension and she then had a #30 French
intra-aortic balloon pump placed.  She had her sternum
irrigated with two liters of Bacitracin solution and warm
saline and her chest was closed with an Isotac cover after
pacing wires were placed and a chest tube was placed.  Family
was notified.  The Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was present as
well as the chief resident of Cardiac Surgery.

When the family was [**Name (NI) 653**], their decision was patient
comfort measures only and the patient then, within
approximately a hour and a half after the code was finished,
expired at 11:40 p.m. on [**2159-12-6**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Breast cancer 20 years ago status post a mastectomy.
2.  History of bright red blood with a recent colonoscopy and
    a virtual colonoscopy.
3.  History of hypertension.
4.  Hemorrhoids.
5.  History of atrial fibrillation after an myocardial
    infarction with cardioversion to sinus rhythm in [**Month (only) 116**] of
    [**2157**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

CONDITION:      Dead.

DISPOSITION:    Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times one,
    aortic valve replacement.
3.  Abdominal compartment syndrome.
4.  Closure of abdominal compartment after an exploratory
    laparotomy.
5.  Ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest.
