Chief Complaint:
Right femur renal cell cancer lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-9-19**] - Curettage and Bone grafting R femur renal cell cancer
lesion.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] has been treated for renal cell carcinoma in the
femur in the
past. Her original femur fixation was done at an outside
institution and she presented with a nonunion. We did an
exchange nailing of this and she initially had some
improvement in her symptomatology. However, she started to
develop increasing pain and noticeable bone resorption at the
fracture site. She underwent needle biopsy of this area and
it did reveal recurrence of the metastatic renal cell
carcinoma. At the same time though, she was undergoing
treatment for a newly developed thoracic spine lesion and had
unfortunately also recently suffered a myocardial infarction.
However, the femur lesion continued to progress and was
causing significant pain and decrease in her quality of life
as she could no ambulate. Discussed were the risks,
benefits and alternatives of this surgical procedure in
detail and she wished to proceed.

Renal Cell CA s/p nephrectomy and IM nailing right femur, CAD
