CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-6-22**]
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe opacity most consistent with
aspiration. Multifocal pneumonia is also aconsideration.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2106-6-23**]
The left atrial volume is increased. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 15 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis. The basal
inferolateral segment has relatively preserved function.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-2-27**],
overall LV systolic function has worsened. The LV cavity has
enlarged. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have
increased.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-6-25**]
The ET tube tip is high, above the level of the clavicular head
had approximately 9 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line tip is in distal SVC. The NG tube tip passes below
the diaphragm with its tip in the proximal stomach.
The moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as there is no
change in bilateral perihilar and lower lobe opacities which
might be consistent with pulmonary edema also giving the
asymmetric appearance of the right lower lobe. Right lower lobe
pneumonia/aspiration cannot be excluded. Overall findings
progressed since [**2106-6-23**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68M PMH T4 level paraplegia, CAD, CHF EF 15-20%, severe
sacral
decubitus ulcers, history of multiple UTI with chronic
indwelling Foley, PE on coumadin with IVC filter in place p/w
septic shock with likely pulmonary source and s/p PEA arrest.
The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics and with two pressors.  The patient developed
multiorgan dysfunction despite these efforts and the decision
was made with the HCP to change the goals of care to comfort
[**6-25**].
.
He was treated with:
- Morphine 2-4 mg IV Q2H PRN pain
- Ativan 0.5-2 mg PO/IV Q2H PRN pain, agitation
- Scopolamine patch for secretions
.
Pt passed away on [**2106-6-29**].  HCP requested an autopsy.
.
ACCESS: RIJ; was kept in place given desire for autopsy
