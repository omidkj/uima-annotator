Attending:[**Known firstname 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with drug eluting stent to proximal LAD.



History of Present Illness:
61 M with HTN, HL, recently off BB, ACEi and statin due to
constipation, presents with chest pain found to have STEMI.

Pt initially presented to ED for chest pain. Pt had altercation
with son, was choked by son, then developed epigastric chest
pain with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. EMS started high
flow O2, given 324mg ASA, had "normal" EKG and pain resolved on
arrival. Initial vital were 97.3 92 146/94 18 100%. Exam was
unremarkable. Labs were normal except trop of 0.05 (CK flat).
CXR neg. Given EKG with STE, pt received 600mg Plavix, Heparin
and 5mg IV Metoprolol and was taken to cath lab. Cath revealed
chronically occluded RCA c/w old inferior infarct. Proximal LAD
had thrombus and was successfully stented. LCX was small and
diseased and OM was large and patent.

ROS per HPI. Occasional exertional chest symptoms.

wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+

Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION EKG:  ST elevations in V1- V4. q's in II, III, aVF.
Diffuse t-wave flattening. improved post cath.

[**2176-2-28**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: 1. Selective coronary
angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three
vessel disease.  The LMCA had a 40% distal stenosis. The LAD was
occluded at the origin with distal vessels filling via RCA acute
marginal collaterals. The LCx is small with an 80% proximal
disease after a large, high OM without significant disease. The
RCA was occluded after an acute marginal branch which has a 90%
stenosis. The distal RCA fills via LCx collaterals.
2. Successful suction thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
distal LMCA and proximal LAD with a 2.5 x 23mm Promus drug
eluting stent which was postdilated to 3.0mm. Final angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with acute anterior
STEMI.
2. Successful PTCA and drug-eluting stenting of the proximal
LAD.

[**2176-3-1**] CARDIAC ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and
apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2174-11-8**], anteroapical infarct
pattern now seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo M with HTN, HL who presented with STEMI and had a
thrombectomy and DES to prox LAD.

# STEMI:  Pateint presented with acute STEMI in context of home
stressors and discontinuation of his medications.  His door to
baloon time was under 2 hours. Patient sustained some myocardial
damage resulting in an EF 30-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of
the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.  He had
successful cardiac intervention and remained CP free since cath.
 Prior to discharge he was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
 Medication compliance was repeatedly reinforced, given the
self-discontinuation of cardiac medications prior to
presentation.
- He should remain on Plavix for at least one year, and aspirin
for life.
- Uptitrate beta-blocker and ACE as needed.

# Acute Systolic Dysfunction: EF 30-40%.  He had no evidence of
fluid overload on exam.  He had heart failure teaching,
including low Na teaching and daily weights prior to discharge.

# Rhythm: The patient had no significant ectopy or arrythmia on
telemetry.

# Hyperlipidemia: The patient was not taking his meds for fear
of constipation.  The importance of these meds were stressed.
We increased his lipitor to high dose this hospitalization and
discharged on 80 mg simvastatin.

# Constipation: He was given a bowel regimen in house and had
normal bowel movements.  Given his changing bowel habits,
further workup, including colonoscopy, should be considered
after he recovers.  His need for Aspirin and Plavix would take
precedence, however.

# Social stressors: A social worker saw pt prior to discharge.
He felt the family was appropriately concerned and coping well.
His son was in inpt psych so poses no immediate threat. Pt and
wife are aware of services available to them.
