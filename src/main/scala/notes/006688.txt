RENAL ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER [**2119-9-28**]:  Normal grayscale
appearance of the kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Limited Doppler evaluation, but slightly elevated resistive
indices and slight dampening of the systolic upstroke
bilaterally. These findings are nonspecific and may be related
to underlying chronic renal parenchymal disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F with DM, porcine AVR, CAD, CHF (EF 30-35%), Afib (off
coumadin for 8wks), and watermelon stomach and melena.

# GI bleed/Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia: Patient was admitted
for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation of BRBPR and possible
treatment for watermelon stomach with possible argon therapy.
On admission, patient was type and screened and followed with
serial hematocrits.  During bowel prep, patient was noted to
have 3 melanotic stools.  She was hemodynamically stable, but
transferred to the MICU for evaluation, Hcts were stable, and
she returned to the floor on [**9-27**] with a midline for access
with plan for EGD/colonoscopy the following morning.  Magnesium
citrate bowel prep was incomplete and EGD/colonoscopy was
postponed for another day.  For the third bowel preparation,
go-lytly was used due to concern for use of Magnesium Citrate in
setting of acute renal failure (see below).  After finishing
preparation with no noted melena or bleeding, patient
experienced substurnal tightness with possible elevation in
troponin and likely demand ischemia (see below).  Due to this,
GI postponed the procedure until [**10-2**].  Following another
go-lytely prep, EGD showed gastric anteral variceal ectasia
which was treated with argon laser therapy.  Again bowel prep
was incomplete.  Pt refused another attempt at colonoscopy,
understanding the risks of a colonic source of bleeding or
possible malignancy.  Her son was present during her refusal,
and agreed with her decision.

# NSTEMI - On the night of [**2119-9-28**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 28694**]
experienced substernal tightness.  EKG showed possible new ST
depression in precordial leads with possible deepening of ST
depression in V6.  Pain responded to nitroglycerin.  Troponin
was 0.07, however patient had been in acute renal failure.
Statin and beta-blocker were started and patient was transfused
2 units PRBCs to Hct>30.  In setting of known GI bleeding,
aspirin was not given.  Beta-blocker was titrated as tolerated.
Telemetry continued with no events.
.
# Acute renal failure - On hospital day 3, creatinine increased.
 Labs also indicated a metabolic alkalosis.  Urine electrolytes
indicated FENA 0.39%.  Renal function improved with IV fluids.
Alkalosis most likely secondary to volume contraction and also
improved with fluids. Renal function was monitored closely
during rest of admission and creatinine returned to baseline of
0.8.
.
# Diabetes mellitus, type I: Complicated by peripheral
neuropathy and gastroparesis. Patient takes 16U NPH and 4U
Humalin at breakfast with gentle sliding scale when BG > 250.
2Units of NPH were added as a nighttime dose.  Glucose monitored
daily and sliding scale altered accordingly.  She had no
hypoglycemic episodes.  Blood sugars tended to run high.  She
requires further management of her diabetes which is a chronic
issue.  Defer to outpt setting or to rehab as it is not an acute
issue.  Pt and family are concerned about possibility of
hypoglyemcemia given h/o brittle diabetes.
.
# Systolic CHF: Per most recent Echo in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-35%. Patient
was euvolemic on admission.  In setting of GI bleed, lasix was
held.  After transfusion of 2 units PRBCs, patient experienced
shortness of breath consistent with pulmonary edema.  Patient
recieved 2 administrations of Lasix IV with appropriate diuresis
and resolution of dyspnea.  Her symptoms resolved, upon
stabilization of GI bleed, lasix was restarted.
.
# Afib: Currently rate controlled on metoprolol. Currently off
anticoaguation during past 8 weeks for GIB.  Patient was
monitored on telemetry during admission and rate controlled with
a beta blocker.
.
# HTN: Cozaar, metoprolol, Imdur and lasix held on admission in
setting of GI bleed.  Patient became hypertensive after
transfusion with 2 units packed red blood cells.  Mrs.
[**Known lastname 28694**] was given metoprolol then lasix overnight with
improvement in blood pressure.  When hematocrit had stabilized,
losartan and lasix were restarted.  Imdur and amlodipine were
held given transient episodes of bradycardia increased dose of
metropolol.
.
# Porcine AVR: stable; does not require anticoagulation for this
indication.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG [**2095**], PCI.  Continued
