Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male with a six to seven week history of exertional chest
pressure relieved by rest.  The patient has had no previous
history of coronary artery disease, nor any angina.  He does
not see a doctor on a regular basis.  He has no associated
nausea or vomiting.  Pain reoccurred on [**2149-12-15**], and
daughter called 911.  The patient was sent to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital and started on Nitroglycerin, Morphine Sulfate,
Aggrastat and given 300 mg of Plavix.  The patient was then
transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergent catheterization after a positive stress
test.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Nephrolithiasis.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Potassium Citrate.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

Coronary catheterization shows an ejection fraction of 35%,
wedge pressure of 23, left ventricular end diastolic pressure
31 to 40, 40% left main, 80% left anterior descending, 80%
obtuse marginal, left to right collaterals.

Pertinent laboratories include a CK MB of 69 and troponin in
the 15 range.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any chest pain or
pressure, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, no edema.
No history of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular
accident.  No dysphasia.  No claudication.  No
gastrointestinal bleeding.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile and vital
signs are stable.  He is awake, alert and oriented times
three.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  He is neurologically intact grossly.  His
heart is regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Breath sounds are clear bilaterally.  The
abdomen is flat, soft, nontender, nondistended, with audible
bowel sounds.  The patient had a palpable left femoral pulse,
bilateral popliteals, bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses and bilateral radial pulses.  He had an
intra-aortic balloon pump in his right femoral artery.
Carotids had no bruits.  Lower extremities showed no
varicosities.  He was without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient spent the next two days on the
CCU service receiving medical management as well as all his
preoperative testing.  On [**2149-12-19**], the patient was taken to
the Operating Room where a coronary artery bypass graft was
performed with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus and saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal.

Postoperatively, the patient was a number of drips including
Neo-Synephrine, Milrinone and Amiodarone for intraoperative
atrial fibrillation.  While in the unit, the patient had a
number of episodes of atrial fibrillation which were poorly
tolerated hemodynamically.  For that reason, the patient was
cardioverted a number of times.  A postoperative
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed showing a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.  The patient was
heparinized for his atrial fibrillation.  He was also placed
on Plavix due to poor bypass targets.

Over the course of his stay in the unit, the patient's
pressors were slowly weaned.  His intra-aortic balloon pump
and chest tubes were removed at the appropriate time.  The
pacing wires were removed at appropriate time.  He was
started on beta blockade when it was felt that he would
tolerate it.  He was also diuresed using Lasix and placed on
Captopril for afterload control.

Electrophysiology was consulted and was extensively included
in the care of the patient, in particular, his atrial
fibrillation.  After his initial Intensive Care Unit stay,
the patient no longer had any hemodynamic compromise from his
atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day six, the patient fell getting out of bed
as he was unstable on his feet and confused.  After the fall,
he did not have any sequelae.  He did not hit his head.  He
did not have any change of mental status as a result of the
fall.  The patient was, however, closely monitored for any
neurological changes.  When the time was right, the patient
was sent to the floor.  He was given contact with physical
therapy and case management.

It was initially the plan to send the patient to a
rehabilitation facility, however, the length of time that it
took to get the patient therapeutic on Coumadin and off his
Heparin, as well as a newly developing cellulitis at his vein
donor site, lengthened the patient's stay in the hospital,
allowing him to become more independent from a physical
standpoint.

As noted, the patient did develop erythema of his donor site.
He was initially started on Kefzol with little improvement in
the developing cellulitis.  After a couple days of treatment
with Kefzol, the patient had Clindamycin added to his
antibiotic regimen which did cause a decrease in erythema and
improvement in his cellulitis.  It is now [**2150-1-3**], and the
patient is being discharged home in good condition.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He is being sent home with a
number of medications including:
1.  Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. twice a day times ten days.
2.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q6hours for ten days.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily for seven days.
4.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. three times a day.
8.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
10. Colace 100 mg p.o. once daily.

He is not being sent home at this time with a prescription
for Coumadin as his INR is at the higher end of therapeutic
in the past couple days of dosing.  It is the opinion that
his INR will continue to increase higher than we wish.  For
that reason, the patient was instructed and I have spoken
with the patient's wife over the telephone this evening to
reiterate the patient is to contact the cardiothoracic team
on [**Name (NI) 766**] morning regarding organizing blood draws and
receiving a prescription for further Coumadin treatment. She
was also informed regarding the importance of receiving a
primary care physician for the patient.  The patient will
return to the hospital on Thursday as well for wound check.
