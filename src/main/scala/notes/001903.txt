Brief Hospital Course:
- [**6-15**]: She was initially admitted to the floor and then
transferred to ICU for respiratory distress on the floor. NGT
placed for abdominal distension. A-line placed. In the AM pt's
respiratory status worsened (RR 30s, O2 sats 80s, cyanotic,
white out R lung), and she was intubated. BAL performed.
[**Name (NI) 96158**] pt was hypotensive, and was unable to be weaned
off of neo. She seemed to be in septic shock - placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics, a CVL was placed, and volume resuscitated
continued. Her trops were elevated, thought to be due to cardiac
stress.
- [**6-16**]: CT chest with significant consolidation, collapse,
moderate effusions; bedside echo by intensivist showed global
hypokinesis with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, ef~10-15%;
bronch showed frothy secretions, CXR improved after bronch
- [**6-17**]: Lopressor started for intermittent tachycardia (SVT vs.
afib). Lasix drip continued. TF started. Aspirin and statin
started per cards. Cipro dc'ed, vanco/cefepime continued.
- [**6-18**]: Continued Lasix GTT and TFs during the day. Patient
self-extubated at [**2054**]. Maintained O2sats on 50% venti mask for
1.5 hours but ultimately developed increasing WOB (grunting) and
mild cyanosis so was re-intubated. Significant glottic edema was
noted at time of re-intubation (likely [**3-6**] self-extubation w.
inflated cuff). Required levophed for a few hours after
intubation, but now weaned off. Lasix drip is being held due ot
hypotension. Attempted replacement of arterial line
unsuccessfully.
- [**6-19**]: Right sided thoracic pig tail placed: drained about
800cc serosanguinous fluid
- [**6-20**]: pigtail pulled. Attempt to wean unsuccessful
- [**6-21**]: Lasix gtt restarted at low dose with albumin. Free water
flushes increased via NGT for hypernatremia. Propofol restarted
for agitation. Tolerated CPAP 5/5 throughout day and did well
with SBT in afternoon - extubated. Required BiPAP, also
carvedilol and digoxin for afterload reduction.
- [**6-22**]: Increased free water flushes. Stable respiratory status
w. shovel mask. Dc'ed lasix GTT for rising BUN/Cr. Gave albumin
25g x1.
- [**6-23**]: Increased free water to 300mL q4hr for hypernatermia;
family meeting held with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15426**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2816**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Family updated to prognosis and goals of care addressed.  She
was made DNI.
- [**6-24**]: In the morning she was desaturating despite 100%
facemask with low MV on BIPAP. Family contact[**Name (NI) **] and made patient
[**Name (NI) 3225**].  Patient put on versed for comfort as well as a scopalamine
patch and expired later that morning.
