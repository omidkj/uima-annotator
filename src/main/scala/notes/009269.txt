INDICATION: 75-year-old with aortic stenosis, aortic
insufficiency and
coronary artery disease, preop examination to assess
calcification of the
aorta.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the chest without IV contrast. Coronal
and
sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

FINDINGS: There is mild centrilobular emphysema. Minimal
atelectatic changes
are seen at the lung bases. There is also mild scarring or
atelectasis
anteriorly in the right lower lobe. There is an 8.5-mm nodule
seen in the
right lower lobe abutting the major fissure near the diaphragm.
Several
smaller 1-3 mm peripheral nodules are seen scattered throughout
the right and
left lung. The bronchi are patent to the segmental level. There
are no
pleural effusions. There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal,
or hilar
lymphadenopathy.

The heart is enlarged. Dense calcification is seen within the
left anterior
descending and circumflex arteries, as well as in the aortic
valve. Dense
atherosclerotic calcification is also seen within the ascending
aorta and
throughout the aortic arch. There is no pericardial effusion.

In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, bilateral
nonobstructing renal
stones are seen. The largest measures 4 mm in the right upper
pole. A single
granuloma is seen within the left lobe of the liver.
Degenerative changes are
seen within the thoracic spine. In addition, a bone Island is
seen within the
T8 vertebral body.

Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings and
demonstrate the
dense aortic arch calcification.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild emphysema.
2. 8.5 mm right lower lobe nodule abutting the major fissure
near the
diaphragm. Three-month followup CT is recommended. Several
smaller sub 5 mm
bilateral peripheral nodules can also be reassessed at that
time.
3. Dense coronary, aortic valve, and aortic arch calcification.
4. Bilateral nephrolithiasis.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted in [**2172-5-6**] to CSRU and seen by the cardiology team.
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgery. Heparin drip was started,
and a nitroglycerin drip was also started . Carotid studies
performed as well as CT scan of chest to evaluate the aorta.This
was shown to be heavily calcified with bilateral pulm. nodules
and renal calculi. Underwent AVR/CABG x3 on [**5-8**]. Transferred to
CSRU in stable condition on insulin, epinephrine, propofol, and
neosynephrine drips. Remained on epinephrine, insulin, and
nitroglycerin drips on POD #1.Extubated, chest tubes were
removed, and gentle diuresis was begun. On POD #2, epinephrine
weaning continued and beta blockade was started. Swan was
removed and he was transferred to the floor on POD #3 to begin
increasing his activity level. He had an episode of A fib on
[**5-13**], and amiodarone and coumadin were started. He converted to
SR and coumadin was discontinued. He will go home on amiodarone
today after 24 hours in SR. Cleared for discharge to home with
VNA services on POD #6. Patient is also to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of the pulmonary nodules.
