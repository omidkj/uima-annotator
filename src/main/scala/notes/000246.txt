History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old man with hx Non-Small Cell Lung CA, DVT,
recent GIB who is transfered from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with dx of PE. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 620**] notes, he was found to be hypoxic with SaO2 50%. CTA
showed multifocal PE's with RV strain on CT. Heparin gtt
started. Bp 96/73 and HR 135. Given recent GIB, decided not to
TPA but transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED: The patient arrived tachpnic, "dusky", BP 118/80. ABG
showed alkalosis and hypoxia: 7.56/28/56. The patient was
intubated and required high amounts of versed for sedation.
Cardiothoracic surgery saw the patient and did not think
embolectomy would be indicated. An echo was performed by
cardiology, with RV strain and dilation but no collapse or HD
compromise.
Vitals on arrival: 96.1 133 118/80 34 abg 87 nrb
Vitals at transfer: Hr 106 BP 90/60 (87/67 - since sedation)

Past Medical History:
1. Non-small cell Lung CA s/p resection in [**2157**]
2. History GIB in [**2162-4-17**]
3. DVT [**2152**], on coumadin for years, dc'ed one month ago
4. Hypertension
5. Low back pain
6. Alcohol abuse
7. History of alcoholic hepatitis

Social History:
He worked as a painting contractor.  He is married, with two
grown children.  His wife works part-time at the [**Name (NI) 4068**].  He
smoked at least a pack per day for about 45 years but was able
to stop smoking albeit with some difficulty and help of a patch
since his diagnosis.  He drinks two to three alcoholic drinks
per night.

Family History:
His father also heavy smoker died at age 53 of lung or head/neck
ca. His mother had a stroke. His one-half sibling died of a
ruptured aneurysm, one died of motor vehicle accident. He thinks
his grandmother may have had ovarian cancer.

Physical Exam:

Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses
b/l.
Lymphatics: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate history without
difficulty.
-cranial nerves: II-XII intact
-motor: normal bulk, strength and tone throughout. No abnormal
movements.
-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action
tremor
-DTRs: 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and 1+
ankle jerks bilaterally. Plantar response was flexor
bilaterally.

ECHO ([**2162-5-16**]):
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

ECHO ([**2162-5-18**]):
The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
interatrial septum is markedly thickened around the fossa ovale
secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy. Compared with the findings
of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-17**], the
interatrial septum and right atrium are better visualized, and
the mass in the right atrium is now seen clearly to be secondary
to lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

LENI ([**2162-5-16**]):
1. Right popliteal DVT extending to the calf veins.
2. Partially occlusive DVT in the left popliteal [**Last Name (LF) 5703**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be
subacute, with extension to the calf veins.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2162-5-22**]):
No evidence for acute hemorrhage or acute transcortical
infarction.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**2162-5-27**]):
1. Diffusely fatty liver markedly limits evaluation for focal
liver lesion although no large liver lesion is identified.
2. Mild splenomegaly to 12.3 cm. No evidence of ascites.

LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-5-31**]):
Partially occlusive DVT in the left popliteal [**Month/Day/Year 5703**], which has
not significantly changed from [**2162-5-16**].

PLAIN FILMS LEFT HIP AND FEMUR ([**2162-6-1**]):
There is severe degenerative change of the lower lumbar spine.
There are mild degenerative changes of the hip joints. No
fracture is identified.
Incidental note is made of a sclerotic lesion in the distal
femur of unclear etiology. Does the patient have a history of
primary malignancy or metastatic disease?

MRI LEFT LEG ([**2162-6-2**]): (wet read):
Preliminary Report !! WET READ !! 18.7 cm hematoma in left
vastus lateralis muscle. While this may reflect trauma and
anticoagulation, an underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded and
follow-up upon resolution (ie 4 months) is recommended.
Bilateral femoral head avascular necrosis. Sclerotic femur
diaphysis lesion atypical for metastasis though should be
followed radiographically.
