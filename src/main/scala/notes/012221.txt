Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o male with Hep C and HCC taken to the OR with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for . Operative findings include patient had a fibrotic
liver but not nodular. This was most likely going to be
consistent with cirrhosis on microscopic examination. He had no
evidence of portal hypertension. He did have dilated perihepatic
lymphatics. He had a relatively small left lobe but this was
felt to be adequate for completion right hepatic lobectomy.
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated only the solitary mass in
the right lobe of the liver.
Initially the patient did very well after surgery. Pain was
managed with an epidural.
By POD 3 the petient was noted to be more somnolent and confused
and was noted to have + asterixis. AST and ALT trended up mildly
but the bilirubin continued to elevate and was as high as 6.9 on
POD 8. He was moved to the intensive care unit due to his liver
decompensation, altered mental status and lab derangements.
The patient was listed on the liver transplant list due to his
decompensation. He was started on Rifaxamin and lactulose. He
was never intubated. He spent 4 days in the SICU and after his
mental status started to improve he was able to be moved back to
the regular surgical floor.
Narcotics were discontinued and ibuprofen was used for pain
management.
His JP output was very high, 2-3 Liters daily of straw colored
ascitic fluid. The fluid was replaced cc/cc and then 1/2 cc/cc.
Attempts were made to have patient with enough PO intake to keep
up, but he was unable to do so and it was determined that he
would go home with fluid boluses, and a PICC line was placed.
His mental status, lab values and overall condition improved
greatly and at the liver intake meeting on [**9-10**] it was
determined he could be removed from the transplant list.
He continued to make daily improvements although he had some
complaints of heartburn which are not new for this patient.
Nutritionally he was advised to use supplements TID
Staples were removed prior to discharge.
Lactulose was discontinued and the rifaxamin dose was cut in
half but he will remain on 200 TID at home for now.
He was ambulating without difficulty, had bowel funtion and was
tolerating diet by day of discharge. The PICC line was placed
and arrangements for outpatient fluid management were made. He
was comfortable with the drain care.
