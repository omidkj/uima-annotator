Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o female with demand ischemia in setting of PAF with RVR
with relief when rate controlled.  She was admitted for ROMI and
rate controlled after receiving lopressor IV and dilt IV.  Of
note she had not been taking PO for up to 2wks prior to admit
[**1-11**] chronic nausea.  Her hospital course was complicated by
hypotension with inappropriate bradycardia symptomatic for
decreased mental status.  Vital signs were otherwise stable.
She was transferred to the CCU for observation, hydration with
up to 6 liters (in the ED and CCU), calcium gluconate, and
dopamine gtt.  She was quickly  weaned from vasopressors and her
BP rose to 100's after 24 hours.  It was felt that her symptoms
were secondary to beta and calcium channel blockade in the
setting of volume depletion.  She spontaneously converted to
normal sinus rhythm and has remained in it since.  She was rate
controlled with increased beta blockade.  She she has relative
AS with LVOT obstruction with age>65 (CHADS2 score 3) and has
PAF and she is highly functional (able to perform PD on self,
very alert and educated) it was suggested that she be
anticoagulated with coumadin.

She underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated minimal
CAD, however LVEDP and PCW were in mid twenties.  Her volume was
controlled with alternating higher dextrose concentration
solutions for her peritoneal dialysis and was net negative
approx 2.5 liters.  Post cath, she became extremely paranoid and
angry stating "you didn't really cath me, i'm in a mental
institution" and was attributed to the percocet she received
while in the CCU.  She has a known psychotic reaction to
oxycontin and percocet.  She developed a small stable hematoma,
however Hct remained stable.  Her anginal symptoms were
attributed to elevated LVEDP in the setting of LVOT obstruction.
 Echo showed evidence of diastolic relaxation dysfuction with
prolonged E wave decel time and LVOT resting peak gradient of
20mmHg.  Her toprol was increased and she was started on low
dose verapamil for treatment of her PAF and LVOT obstruction.
Verapamil was chosen because of its greater effect on blocking
the AV node preferentially to the SA node.  When not in Afib she
had a resting heart rate of 40-60's.  Digoxin and amiodarone
were considered for additional AV blockade, however given her
LVOT, we did not want to give her a positive inotrope and her
severe underlying COPD would make pulmonary amiodarone toxicity
difficult to monitor.  Her blood pressures prevented the
addition of a CCB.

She was noted to have a higher O2 requirement than usual.  She
intermittently uses home O2, however had [**Known firstname **] episode of
desaturation to 66% with tachypnia resolving with O2.  CXR
showed a worsening LLL infiltrate, but no evidence of worsened
CHF or PTX.  EKG and C.E did not suggest and MI.  Given that she
has had no worsening cough, has remained afebrile, wihtout a
white count, and recently completed treatment for a pneumonia
with levaquin, she was not treated with additional antibiotics.
Instead, it was felt that she had mild overload in the setting
of chronic lung disease.

She was discharged home with services for PD, PT, and O2 in
stable condition.  She will need to have INR checks.  She may
benefit from a reminder to not cut her Toprol tablets in half as
she has been doing.
