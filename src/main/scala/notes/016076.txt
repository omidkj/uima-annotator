Shortness of breath and hypoxia

None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 47 year old male with h/o schizophrenia/bipolar
disorder, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and severe complex
sleep disordered who comes in to from Reab facility with
increase in SOB and hypoxia. Pt has been on rehab, [**Location (un) 669**] West
since [**Month (only) 958**] of this year for his OSA since he lived in a group
home and was unable to care for himself. As per nursing staff at
the facility, he has been having increase in SOB and hypoxia for
the last 2 weeks for which he was tx with lasix with some
improvement. He had a recent 3 lbs wt gain in the last few days.
He is also non-complient with his diet and tends to drink "a lot
of soda". He is on lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], however there is no listing
of him having CHF. He denies missing any of his meds. He states
that he had increse in SOB today and his O2sat was 70s% on RA
and EMS was called. He denies having any fever, chills, sweats,
or cough, or LE edema. He sleep with "pillows".  He was then
brought to the ED for further eval.

In the ED, initial VS were: HR 80, 140/90, 25, 88-93% on BIPAP.
proBNP: 2129, WBC was 10.2 (N:74 Band:0 L:10 M:15 E:1
Bas:0),Trop-T: <0.01. UA negative. He had cxray which as per ED
report states continued evidence of left-sided pneumonia as well
as diffuse interstitial edema. He was given vanco, cefepime and
azithromycin for the concern of pneumonia. He also had a CTA
which did not show a PE or other acute lung process. He was then
given 80mg of IV lasix which he responded well with 900cc of
urine output in the ED and 300cc on arrival to the floor.

On arrival to the floor pt appears comfortable was sating at
100% on a non-rebreather. He denies having any complains of pain
or SOB. He states to feel "much better" than before.

As per his [**Hospital1 1501**], he did not have any recent pneumonia, infection
or complains of chest pain. He was planning to see a
cardiologist for concern of CHF.

STUDIES:

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental
level. Note is made of a bovine configuration of the aortic
arch. The thoracic aorta is unremarkable with no evidence of
acute aortic pathology. There is cardiomegaly. The right
ventricle is mildly enlarged which could relate to component of
right heart failure. There is no evidence of pericardial
effusion. There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.

The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the subsegmental level.
There is bibasilar atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions
or pneumothorax. There are no focal consolidations concerning
for pneumonia.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. Note is made of diffuse fatty infiltration of the
liver. Visualized upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
There are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine
as manifested by marginal osteophytic formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Cardiomegaly. Mildly enlarged right ventricle which could
relate to
component of right heart failure.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2134-9-2**] at 10:50:10 AM   FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Normal estimated
pulmonary pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-3-27**],
the findings are similar.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2134-9-2**] 3:21 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
almost unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema. No major
pleural effusions but cardiomegaly and distention of pulmonary
vessels as well as the presence of interstitial thickening. Mild
retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia. No other
relevant changes.
