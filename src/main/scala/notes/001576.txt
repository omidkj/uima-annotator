History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with metastatic invasive lobular breast
cancer on gemcitabine with peripheral neuropathy who presents
with fever and multiple falls.  Patient was admitted to OMED
from [**4-16**] - [**4-17**] for bilateral LE cellulitis.  She was given
Vancomycin and showed improvement and was discharged on Keflex
for 8 days.  She reports comliance with this medication and some
reduction in swelling of her legs but claims that they are still
"hard" (swollen) and red (L > R).  She also reports having
multiple falls, [**3-11**] the day of admission, where she had to crawl
on the ground to get to her phone.  He complains of left ankle
pain; she says she fell on her rear but never hit her head or
lost consciousness.
.
In the ER, initial vitals T 103 102 147/62 18 94% RA.,  She
received Tylenol, Vancomycin, and Cefepime, and admitted for
further evaluation.  She was not aware she had a fever but
reports she has felt "cold" but no rigors.
.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2156**] carcinoma of the right breast treated with excision,
axillary sampling and radiation to breast and axilla. In [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2169**] she was diagnosed with an invasive lobular carcinoma of the

same breast. The tumor was ER,PR + and HER2 negative. On [**8-5**] [**2169**] she underwent a right mastectomy for a greater than 5 cm

tumor. She was therefore staged as T3N?M0.  The nodes were not
evaluable because of prior excision and radiation. She elected
not to have chemotherapy and took Arimidex as adjuvant therapy
beginning in [**2170-8-6**].  Because of a rising CA [**93**]-29 a PET
scan was done on [**2174-5-16**] which revealed: There is focal
abnormal uptake of FDG throughout the spine, bilateral ribs,
bilateral clavicles, left scapula, left humerus, sternum,
bilateral iliac bones. There is also uptake within subcentimeter

left hilar lymph nodes (SUV 4.8), and asymmetrically within the
right lingual tonsil (SUV  4.8). There are bilateral maxillary
retention cysts/polyps, colon diverticulosis, a 5mm right lower
lobe nodule (not FDG avid but may be due to small size), and a
nodular component to a left lower lobe scar. The Arimidex was
discontinued in the hope of seeing a withdrawal response. It did

not occur so on [**2174-7-15**] she was begun on Aromasin with
monthly Faslodex injections.   A PET scan done on [**2176-5-21**]
showed dramatic improvement in osseous metastatic disease and
resolution of FDG avidity and increased sclerosis of the
previously FDG avid skeletal metastases. There was no new
skeletal lesion.  She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**11-30**]-30, [**2176**] because of severe diarrhea. On [**2177-9-2**] she had a PET

scan which showed: 1. Widespread new osseous metastatic disease
throughout ribs, vertebral bodies, scapulae, and several new
lesions in pelvis, all FDG-avid.  2. Stable non-FDG-avid right
lower lobe 7 mm pulmonary nodule. She was treated initially with

Capecitabine to which she was intolerant. She was started on
weekly Taxol in [**2177-12-6**].  On [**2178-10-1**] she had a PET
scan which shows:  1. Mixed response, with overall improvement
in the multi-focal osseous metastasis. A majority of the FDG
avid lesions seen in the prior study, are now non FDG avid.
However a few new FDG avid lesions are present. 2. Stable non
FDG avid right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
