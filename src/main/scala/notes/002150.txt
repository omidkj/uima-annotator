Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5378**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered consciousness, right arm shaking.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is an 80 year-old right-handed gentleman who presented
on [**2155-9-15**] with several hours of decreased responsiveness. Per
the pt's wife, the patient awoke around 6:00 on the morning of
admission and was mumbling, seemed to have trembling of lips. He
sat at the side of the bed and at 6:30 wife asked him to take
his medications and he has not responsive to her. He kept
repeating "chip and chip and chip..." At that time the pt's wife
noted that the pt had trembling of his right arm and he seemed
to be elevating the right arm. He was not responding to her
questions.  His wife thinks that the whole episode lasted
approximately 30 minutes. She became concerned and called EMS.
On their arrival he was unresponsive to stimuli, his SBP was as
high as 220mmHg systolic and fingerstick was 222. His pupils
were noted to be unreactive and he seemed to have a right gaze
preference. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].  En route he developed
tonic-clonic activity of his right upper and lower extremities.
This activity continued upon his arrival to the ED.  He was
subsequently intubated for airway protection.  He was admitted
to the intensive care unit overnight.  He was loaded with
phenytoin.  He was successfully weaned off of sedation and
extubated this morning, the second hospital day.

There is no history of antecedant illness.  He has been
compliant with his medication (keppra) and has not missed any
doses per his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] did admit to alcohol consumption on the
night prior to presentation but not in excess.


Past Medical History:
-HTN
-type 2 diabetes mellitus
-Hyperlipidemia
-coronary artery disease
-hx of L MCA territory stroke, per the pt's wife, he has no
residua in terms of weakness, vision, language as a result of
stroke
-L ICA stenosis 80-99%, pt has refused intervention
-seizure in setting of urosepsis in [**1-25**], had been on dilantin
and then switched to keppra earlier this year due to concern
over medicine noncompliance (phenytoin levels of < 0.6)

Social History:
His a retired laborer who used to work in a shipyard.  He lives
at home with his wife in [**Name (NI) 2268**]. He quit smoking roughly 20
years ago after roughly 40 years of use (1ppd).  He uses alcohol
occasionally, but he does have a history of significant use in
the past.  There is no history of illicit drug use.


Family History:
There are no other family members with seizures.

Neurologic:
-mental status: Lethargic, intermittently fell asleep but easily
arousable to voice. He is able to state his name and birthdate.
He stated that he was in [**Location (un) 86**] but also thought that he was
"home."  He denied being in a hospital.  He did not know the
date and stated that the year was "1880."  He was not able to
register that the year was actually [**2154**], despite multiple
attempts.  Able to name days of week forward, but only got as
far as Friday going backward before he stopped.  Language is
fluent with intact repitition and comprehension.  There were no
paraphasic errors.  Pt. was only able to name both high
frequency objects, and demonstrated perseveration when naming.
Speech was not dysarthric. He intermittently followed commands.
He recognized his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was unable to tell us how many
children he had or their names.  This is not his baseline per
his wife.

-cranial nerves: Pupils irregularly shaped and surgical; were
minimally reactive to light bilaterally.  He attended to all
visual fields bilaterally. EOMI without nystagmus. No facial
droop, facial musculature symmetric. Palate elevates
symmetrically in midline.  5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM
bilaterally. Tongue protrudes in midline.

-motor: Normal bulk throughout. Prominent paratonia in all four
extremities. No adventitious movements noted. No asterixis
noted. No myoclonus noted.
The pt would not participate with formal strength testing.  He
would raise his right arm up but was seemingly unable to raise
his left arm against gravity.  He would grip the examiner's
hands bilaterally.  He would raise both legs and wiggle his toes
bilaterally.

-sensory: Intact to light touch over all four extremities. He
extinguished on the left arm and leg to DSS.

-coordination: pt would not cooperate.

Plantar response was extemsor bilaterally.

Radiologic Data:

CT head: Multiple chronic infarcts (left temporal and right
frontal lobes, as well as the left cerebellar hemisphere)
without definite evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR: Extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (noted on
CT torso in [**2-22**]), mild congestive heart failure.

MRI: Allowing for this limitation, the well-defined wedge-shaped
area of chronic encephalomalacia at the left parietal/occipital
region, with dilatation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle is
stable in appearance since [**2155-2-18**], persistent with chronic
cerebral infarct. No further focal T1 or T2 signal abnormality
within the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brain stem. Ventricular size
and configuration remains stable since [**Month (only) 958**]. No shifting of the
normally midline structures. Basal cisterns are patent. No
evidence of tonsillar herniation on the sagittal images.
The DWI images demonstrate no focal signal abnormality to
suggest new cerebral ischemia.
CONCLUSION:
1. Chronic infarct at the left parietal/occipital region,
probably representing chronic MCA/PCA watershed infarct. This is
stable since [**2155-2-18**].
2. No MR features of acute cerebral infarcts.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Seizure disorder: The pt is an 80 year-old gentleman with a
history of seizures in the setting of urosepsis who presented
after an episode of altered consciousness and right-sided
seizure activity.  This episode is consistent with a complex
partial seizure with a focus in the left frontal lobe.  By
report, it lasted over 30 minutes and therefore is an episode of
complex partial status epilepticus.  The precipitant was unclear
but may be due to medication noncompliance or antecedant alcohol
use.  Keppra was titrated to a dose of 1500mg po bid.  He did
have prolonged confusion and left upper extremity weakness
following the seizure.  Both his mental status and the weakness
returned to baseline per the pt's wife prior to discharge.  He
had no further seizures during the hospital stay.  The pt was
told that by law he should refrain from driving an automobile
for 6 months.  Given his underlying concomitant underlying
dementia, the pt should probably not drive notwithstanding.

2. Multifactorial gait disorder:  Following intubation, the pt
had great difficulty with ambulation which was much worse per
the pt's wife from baseline.  He demonstrated marked instability
in a standing position with almost immediate retropulsion.  An
MRI with DWI was not suggestive for acute stroke as the etiology
behind either the seizure, weakness or the gait disorder.  The
physical therapy service followed the pt.  Over the course of
the hospital stay, the pt's gait improved substantially.  At the
time of discharge, he was able to initiate gait without
