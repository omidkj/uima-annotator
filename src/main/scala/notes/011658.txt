Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is mildly depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are
consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in

focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve is a functional bicuspid valve, with fusion
between the
LCC and the RCC. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aor
