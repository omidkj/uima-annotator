L hip/pelvis XRay: There is an intramedullary rod in the left
femur with a single proximal screw. There is also varus
angulation and deformity seen of the femoral head and neck and
due to difficulty in positioning patient, this area is not fully
evaluated; however, there is likely a fracture involving the
femoral neck on the left side. Dystrophic calcifications are
identified. There are degenerative changes and joint
calcifications involving the right hip. Degenerative changes of
the lower lumbar spine are identified.
.
L femur Xray: 1. As seen earlier today, there is an acute
fracture of the left femoral neck.
2. The spiral fracture of the left femoral shaft is evaluated,
and there is no change in fracture fragment position or hardware
appearance compared to [**2102-4-20**]. There remains some
angulation of the mid aspect of the more proximal to distal
interlocking screws.
.
ECHO [**2102-6-12**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best
excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The right atrium
is moderately  dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to  suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully  excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function
without definite
regional dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension.
.
CT HEAD done on [**2102-6-14**] for acute delirium
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial
infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
Surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable. The imaged
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR ([**2102-6-16**]):
PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Midline
sternotomy wires are again noted. There is volume loss in the
right lung, with apical pleural thickening. Linear atelectasis
versus scar is noted in the right mid lung. Retrocardiac
atelectasis is noted, which appears slightly increased from
prior study. The heart is enlarged. There is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hip fracture: pt had removal of previous hardware and
plating/hemiarthroplasty - involved procedure.  He has been
evaluated by PT and progressed to functional mobility.
.
#Hypotension: after surgery pt had some episodes of hypotension,
likely secondary to blood loss during surgery and agressive
diuresis.  We held his diuretic, gave his blood transfusions and
his blood pressures have been stable in the 90's systolic.
.
#CHF: ECHO revealed LVEF 50%  His lungs always sounded wet on
auscultation. His BP dropped after surgery due to aggressive
diuresis and blood loss. His lasix has been held, with no
evidence of worsening CHF on chest x-ray ([**2102-6-16**]).  He is
maintaining his sats on 2L. He is very sensitive to the lasix as
he drops his pressure. His rate was better controlled after
starting the Amiodarone. This also helped his blood pressure.
.
# CAD: extensive history but stable during this hospitalization.
Continued ASA, beta blocker, statin.
.
# COPD: former smoker, on inhalers at home without home O2
currently.  Has been 80's to low 90's here.  We continued his
nebulizer treatments and albuterol while in the hospital.  We
titrated his O2 as needed, with a goal of O2 sat 90-93%.  He has
been maintaining this O2 on 2L nasal cannula.
.
#Afib: Afib has been stable over this hospitalization. Pt has a
hx of being difficult to convert.  His rate has been well
controlled on amiodarone and metoprolol.
.
# Agitation, delirium: Initially a problem in the immediate
post-surgical period, at which time it was controlled with pain
management and Haloperidol PRN. Behavior however improved
drastically and patient is very cooperative and pleasant without
any intervention.
.
# Blood Loss: Baseline Hct near 28. He has some bleeding in the
p
