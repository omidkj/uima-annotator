History of Present Illness:
CC: CP/SOB
.
HPI: 88 yo M with h/o CAD s/p PTCA to RCA in [**3-16**] now presents
with persistent [**10-21**] CP and SOB. Has had mild chest pain
several times over past two weeks for which he has taken
percocet (prescribed for recent broken medial malleolus) and
antacid. On night before admission he was lying in bed and
experienced onset of more severe chest pain, which he again
treated with percocet. He states that the pain was diffuse
across chest, most intense in the substernal region, non
radiating and more intense in quality than that of previous MI.
On morning of admission he had sudden onset of severe sharp
substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and
nausea while going to his office. The pain and diaphoresis did
not subside and a coworker drove him to the hospital. He did not
have palpitations, syncope, or radiation of pain to the back or
neck. Took 325 ASA at home.
.
In the ED, patient received 3 sublingual nitros with minimal
decrease in pain, lopressor 5mg IV, heparin gtt bolus given and
drip started but stopped due to concern for increased
mediastinum on CXR, morphine 2 mg IV, and anzement 12.5 mg.
Nitro drip started.
Trop were 0.16 and CK 80.
EKG showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V2-V4, LAD and conduction
delay with a LBBB type morphology.
.
In the cath lab, patient had plavix 600 mg, integrillin drip
startedpatient had aortogram which demonstrating no evidence of
disection. He had a right dominant system. His LAD had moderate
diffuse disease, D1 with origin 80% lesion unchanged from
previous. LCx with occlusion proximally: LCx to OM was stented
with two DE Cypher stents. RCA with previous stent was patent.
On arrival to the CCU, patient had oozing from venous line, with
no development of hematoma. He was stable with no complaints.
.
Patient states that he is not very active at baselineHe walks
with a cane due to longstanding neuropathy. Two weeks ago he
stumbled [**2-13**] neuropathy and broke lateral malleolus. He states
that he has DOE on walking [**1-13**] blocks for years. He has no
orthopnea and no chronic leg swelling, he reports.

Prior studies:
XRAY ankle [**2166-8-15**]:
Acute nondisplaced distal lateral malleolar fracture.
.
ECHO [**2165-4-3**]:
Left Ventricle - EF: 55% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5660**] dilated. RA moderately dilated. Mild
symmetric LVH. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.
LV cavity size normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. 1+ AR. The mitral  valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. 1+MR. LV inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
No pericardial effusion.
.
C. CATH [**2165-4-2**]:
1. R dominant system with 1 vessel disease. LMCA clean. LAD
diffusely diseased - mid 30% stenosis. D1 had a long irregular
80% stenosis. LCX diffusely diseased with 30% stenosis. The RCA
was a large dominant vessel with a proximal 80% stenosis and
visible thrombus, There was no R-PDA but a large PL system
without flow limiting stenoses.
2. Limited hemodynamics showed mild to moderate pulmonary
hypertension (PA mean 27 mmHg). The left end right sided filling
pressures were mild to moderately elevated (RVEDP 14 mmHg, LVEDP
22 mmHg). The cardiac output was reduced (CO 3.7 l/min, CI 1.8
l/min/m2). There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
3. Left ventriculography showed an overall preserved systolic LV
function with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The
calculated contrast ejection fraction was 53%. There was no
significant mitral regurgitation angiographically.
4. Successful PTCA/stenting of the proximal RCA with a 3.5x18mm
Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9641**] postdilated with a 4.0mm balloon. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and
TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**7-16**]:
IMPRESSION:  MRI of the brain reveals a mild degree of white
matter change associated with chronic microvascular infarction.
There are no acute cortical infarctions.
.
Cath [**2166-9-1**]:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. No evidence of aortic dissection.
.
CXR [**9-2**]:  Lung volumes are low and mild interstitial edema is
new.  Moderate cardiomegaly, generally enlarged.  Thoracic aorta
are chronic.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**9-1**]:
COMMENTS:
 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with 2
vessel
disease.  The LMCA showed no angiographically apparent stenosis.
 The
LAD showed moderate diffuse disease with serial 30% stenoses.
The LCx
was a short vessel with a large OM1 branch that showed a
proximal 100%
occlusion.  The RCA showed a widely patent proximal stent
without
significant stenosis.
 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately
elevated mean
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 mmHg, with moderately
elevated
pulmonary artery pressures of 55/11, which is consistent with
left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction, although underlying pulmonary

hypertension cannot be excluded.
 3. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated dilated aortic root
and
ascending aorta, both of which measured 4.0 cm in transverse
dimension.
There was no evidence of aortic dissection from the aortic root
to the
iliac bifurcation, although the aorta was noted to be tortuous
with
significant calcification.
 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the OM1 lesion with two 3.5
Cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] dilated with a 4.0 Balloon. The final angiography
showed TIMI
III flow with no angiographically apparent dissection,
embolization or
perforation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. No evidence of aortic dissection.
5. Succes
