Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents with sharp,
unremitting abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 -year-old
male with a past medical history of hypertension,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, anxiety, and diverticulosis.
The patient was in his usual state of health until [**2133-5-3**]
when the patient began to feel a sharp pain in his stomach.
The pain did not remit with over-the-counter medications or
other attempts to improve pain.  Both pain and nausea
increased overnight.  The patient's pain changed from a 5 out
of 10 to a 10 out of 10 scale.  The patient did have some
vomiting over evening.

Since the pain did not remit, the patient was seen at the
Emergency Room at the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
on [**2133-5-4**].  The patient was sent for abdominal CT scan at
that time and began to experience bilateral chest pain and
mild shortness of breath as well as diaphoresis.  The patient
reported that this chest pain was new.  There was no
radiation to jaw or arms, and pain did not increase with
inspiration.  The patient took nitroglycerin and did not feel
any relief in the pain.

Abdominal CT scan did not show any signs of pathology,
colitis, or diverticulitis.  Initial electrocardiogram showed
nonspecific T-wave flattening, but no signs of obvious
ischemia / myocardial infarction.  The patient was admitted
to the Medical service and underwent work up for new onset
pain.  The patient did continue to have bouts of abdominal
and chest pain over the ensuing few days.  The patient's
cardiac enzymes came back negative and ruled out for a
myocardial infarction at that time.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] did have a stress test which showed that he had
global cardiomyopathy, but no focal signs of hypokinesis.
The patient underwent echocardiogram which showed an ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% as well as an ascending aortic
aneurysm approximately 5.0 cm in width.  The aortic root was
noted to be mildly dilated and there was mild aortic
regurgitation.  The patient was scheduled for an outpatient
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2133-5-20**]
which showed a right dominant system with moderate branch
disease, including the left anterior descending and a 40%
occlusion of the left circumflex.  There was an elevated
right and left heart filling pressures and only trace aortic
insufficiency.  There was a significant idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of
25%.  Globally, hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis was noted.
The dilated aortic root and the ascending aorta were also
visualized on the catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
2.  Diverticulosis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Depression.
5.  Anxiety.
6.  Biliary disease.
7.  Angina.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy two years ago.
2.  Total right hip replacement.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Captopril 25 mg po bid,
hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg po q day, Celexa 20 mg q HS, Prozac
15 mg q day, Prilosec 20 mg q day, Xanax 1.0 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ex-smoker and drinker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient presented with a heart
rate of 66 and a blood pressure of 116/80.  The patient was
in no apparent distress, pleasant, and conversant.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three and resting
comfortably.  Head was normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light, and cranial nerves were
intact II through XII.  Neck was supple, nontender, without
jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy, or bruits
appreciated.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with present bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and well profused and there were 2+
pulses throughout.  There was no significant peripheral edema
noted.  Stool was guaiac negative upon examination.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2133-5-26**].  He underwent a resection grafting of an
ascending aortic aneurysm using 28 mm Dacron as well as a
one vessel coronary artery bypass graft from the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in a
stable condition.

Postoperatively the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  The patient was noted to have new onset left hand
tremor at rest and in tension.  Otherwise the patient was
moving all extremities without difficulty.  Mild edematous
changes were seen on the upper and lower extremities.  The
patient was given IV Lasix in order to help diurese at this
point.  The patient was extubated without difficulty and
reported feeling well.

On postoperative day two, the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  Overnight the patient became mildly
confused and was noted to have increased expiratory wheezes.
Respiratory status improved with nebulization treatment and
aggressive pulmonary physiotherapy.  The patient's confusion
continued into the day time and seemed to mildly affect the
patient's ability to ambulate.  The patient was restarted on
his home Xanax dose which was substantial, and the patient
seemed to become less anxious.  The patient was transferred
to the floor at this time where his main issue continued to
be respiratory.

The patient was noted to have significant expiratory wheezes
and complained of shortness of breath and difficulty
breathing.  Chest x-ray noted at the time did not show any
significant pulmonary edema, new pleural effusion, or other
pulmonary changes.  It was felt that the patient was still
probably mildly fluid overloaded, but at the same time
requiring strong bronchodilation.  The patient was therefore
treated with Lasix therapy as well as aggressive q four hour
nebulization treatment with respiratory therapy.

The patient was given incentive spirometry and worked with
Physical Therapy to enhance ambulation.  On postoperative day
four, the patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation.
The patient did not spontaneously reconvert and was therefore
started upon Digoxin, after which the patient spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm.  Digoxin was used secondary to the
patient's low ejection fraction.  Aggressive nebulization
treatment was needed for the patient's persistent respiratory
difficulties.

Pulmonary consultation was obtained on [**2133-6-1**] to assist in
the management of the patient's respiratory problems.
Recommendations were made to optimize the patient's diuresis,
help in afterload reduction, and to give a trial of a brief
steroid taper, starting with prednisone 60 mg [**Hospital1 **].  The
patient's breathing did not appreciably improve upon the
prednisone therapy.  However, the patient did become
increasingly confused and agitated after beginning the
prednisone.  The patient repeatedly climbed out of bed.

The patient had recurrent rapid atrial fibrillation on
[**2133-6-2**] and was switched from Digoxin to Procainamide.  The
patient was noted to reconvert and remained in normal sinus
rhythm on the Procainamide.  The patient continued to require
aggressive pulmonary physiotherapy with notable auditory
wheezes and shortness of breath.

On [**2133-6-4**], the patient was found on the floor after
falling.  Review of telemetry showed occasional premature
atrial contractions, but no other signs of arrhythmia.  The
patient was neurologically intact, otherwise well, except for
a bruise upon the left buttock.

On [**2133-6-5**], a Code Purple (psychiatry code) was called when
the patient attempted to leave the floor via the stairwell.
The patient was quite agitated and disoriented.  The patient
became more calm with IV Haldol sedation and cannot center
events pertaining to forces of leaving the floor
