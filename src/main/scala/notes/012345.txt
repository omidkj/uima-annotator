Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Paraplegia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old male who is undergoing treatment
for multiple abscesses. Specifically, he previously presented to
[**Hospital1 69**] in [**2115-4-4**] and was found
to have a thoracic epidural abscess as well as abscesses in his
chest, empyema. He underwent operative treatment of both of
these collections. Infectious disease consult helps to direct
his care and ultimately he was discharged with intravenous
nafcillin treatment to a rehab center. On [**2115-5-11**], he was
transferred back from his rehab center to [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital with, by report, unilateral leg weakness. An MRI was
performed as an outpatient that morning which demonstrated a
large epidural compressive collection. On evaluation in the
emergency department, the patient exhibited no lower extremity
motor function bilaterally. He exhibited a mid thoracic sensory
level circumferentially. He did not demonstrate any voluntary
sphincter contraction but he did have sacral sensation intact.

MR C/T/L Spine [**2115-5-13**]
1. Spondylodiscitis of the cervical spine at the C4/5 level with
prevertebral and paraspinal phlegmon formation. Since [**4-11**],
there has been formation of a new tiny right ventral epidural
abscess, but without compression of the cord.
2. Post-surgical changes of the thoracic spine as described
above with
extensive circumferential epidural enhancing tissue within the
surgical site which may represent granulation tissue versus
epidural phlegmon. There is a small epidural abscess at the T7
level posteriorly which is compressing the cord.
3. There is subtle T2 hyperintensity in the cord at the surgical
site which may represent edema related to compression due to the
epidural process versus cord ischemia/infarct from
thrombophlebitis.
4. Changes suggestive of right pleural empyema and right lower
lobe
pneumonia.
5. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with no evidence of
spondylodiscitis.
6. There is edema and enhancement of the lumbar posterior
paraspinal muscles which may represent myositis versus
denervation injury.
.
MR C/T/L Spine [**2115-6-6**]
1. Findings consistent with discitis/osteomyelitis at C4-5
level, no evidence of intraspinal abscess.
2. Evaluation of the mid and lower thoracic spine is markedly
compromised by hardware artifact.
3. Complex right pleural collection, better evaluated on recent
chest CT.
.
CT Chest [**2115-5-13**]
1. Extensive discitis/osteomyelitis with severe bony destruction
at the T9-T10 level.
2. T10 vertebral body/pedicle fractures which may be unstable.
3. Complex right hydropneumothorax with multiple foci of gas and
loculations. Small uncomplicated left pleural effusion.
4. Left upper lobe ground-glass opacity. Although this most
likely
represents a benign focus of inflammation, a six- month followup
is
recommended to ensure resolution as more unlikely alternatives
such as BAC
cannot be definitively excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male who previously presented to [**Hospital1 771**] in [**2115-4-4**] and was found to have a
thoracic epidural abscess as well as abscesses in his chest,
along with empyema. He underwent operative treatment of both of
these collections. Infectious disease consult helps to direct
his care and ultimately he was discharged with intravenous
nafcillin treatment to a rehab center.

On [**2115-5-11**], he was transferred back from his rehab center
to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with, by report, unilateral
leg weakness. An MRI was performed as an outpatient that morning
which demonstrated a large epidural compressive collection. On
evaluation in the emergency department, the patient exhibited no
lower extremity motor function bilaterally. He exhibited a mid
thoracic sensory level circumferentially. He did not demonstrate
any voluntary sphincter contraction but he did have sacral
sensation intact.

1. Epidural abscess:
he had epidural abscess compressing his cord centrally and had
emergent revision decompression and abscess removal from T8-12.
After surgery, he underwent further evaluation with MRI scans of
C,T,& L spine as well as chest CT for evaluation of his previous
empyema.  These did note further worsening consolidations in his
C spine as well.  CT showed osteomyelitis at T9-10 as well as
complex right hydropneumothorax with multiple foci of gas and
loculations. Thoracic surgery & infectious disease were
consulted. He was maintained on fluconazole & nafcillin per ID
recommendations. (nafcillin 2gm iv q4 since last admission -
present, fluconazole 400 iv q24 from [**5-18**] - [**6-2**].) Cultures were
monitored. Postoperatively, he did have some return of sensation
in bilateral lower extremities but continued to have complete
paralysis of th
