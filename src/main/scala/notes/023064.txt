IMAGING:

CTA [**10-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

2. Persistent severe emphysema with mild ground-glass opacities
and
interstitial septal thickening involving the posterior right
upper lobe
segment and apical posterior left upper lobe segment abutting
the major
fissures. This is nonspecific and may represent underlying
aspiration
pneumonitis/pneumonia.

3. Near two-year stability to multiple pulmonary nodules which
do not warrant
further followup. Stable mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.

4. Mosaic attenuation of the lung parenchyma likely related to
severe
underlying emphysema as well as air trapping from unchanged
tracheobronchomalacia, most severely involving the bronchus
intermedius.

5. Mild dilatation to the main right and left pulmonary arteries
well as
right atrium/ventricle, which may reflect underlying pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.

ECHO [**10-13**]
IMPRESSION:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated and the free wall may be hypokinetic (not fully
viusalized). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**10-18**]
IMPRESSION:
The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is within normal limits.
There has
been improved aeration at the streaky opacities at the lung
bases. No
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are identified. There are
no
pneumothoraces.

Brief Hospital Course:
65M with COPD exacerbation and acute on chronic hypercarbic
respiratory failure
.
# Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure :
Pt with known severe COPD, pC02>100 on arrival which initially
improved on bipap. Pt was afebrile without leukocytosis.
Precipitating factors may have included CAP, viral URI. Patients
with large A-a gradient on arrival. Lethargy prompted intubation
in the ED after he was given ativan for agitation. He was then
extubated on [**10-12**] to BIPAP. He received IV diuretics, IV steroids
which were transitioned to PO prednisone on [**2161-10-18**] and
completed 5 day course of Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation. He
was initially treated with Ceftriaxone as well for 3 days but
this was discontinued when there was no clear evidence of
pneumonia. He continued to have waxing course requiring long
duration of BIPAP especially at night, frequent nebs, suctioning
as well as morphine IV for agitated respiratory distress. DNI
status was confirmed with pt and family several times. BIPAP was
then weaned over the course of next several days and daily
steroid dose was decreased. On day of discharge, he was sating
in low-mid 90s on 1L NC. He had only required 2 hours of BiPap
the day prior for increased work of breathing which was
