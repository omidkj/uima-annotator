History of Present Illness:
62 yo Man with MMP including severe COPD on chronic high dose
steroids, difficult to control AF, and AS s/p prosthetic valve
replacement, presented with RLE pain. Pt had been in USOH when
10d prior to admission he was arising from a chair, felt a
tugging sensation in his R hip, which over the next day
developed into progressive pain. The pain decreased over two
days, but then he noticed extensive ecchymoses on his RLE. No
fall, no other trauma. No change in medications. Pt stated he
always bruises easily and only takes baby ASA 81 mg twice a week
because of increased bruising if he takes it more often. Pt also
reported increased dyspnea at rest over the past 3 days. Denies
f/c, changed cough, CP, n/v, or other sxs. He did have a chronic
cough productive of thick, often bloody secretions.
.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt had an episode of rapid AF with HR to 130s, associated
with diaphoresis and SOB, which resolved eventually after nebs
and disopyramide were given.

Brief Hospital Course:
ON admission, the assessment was that of a 62 yo Man w/ numerous
medical problems including AS s/p valve replacement, AF, and
severe COPD on high dose steroids now presenting with R hip pain
and dyspnea.

# Hip hematoma/ pain: Pt was thought to be more predisposed to
injury [**3-6**] chronic high dose steroids. A question was raised
whether he had muscular injury/tear or possible AVN of hip also,
but this was ruled out.

# COPD: On admit he appeared to be having flare, with increased
sputum production and increased dyspnea. He was started on
Prednisone 60mg daily and Azithromycin. Additionally he was
given Albuterol, atrovent nebs, [**Month/Day (2) 8895**] and advair. The
patient began having significant respiratory distress on [**12-25**].
An ABG showed pH 7.26, PCO2 89 and PaO2 73. He was transfered to
the ICU and placed on CPAP. He was placed on IV methylprednisone
and continued on Azithromycin as well as nebs.  He improved
quickly in the ICU and was transitioned back to nasal canula
within hours. A CXR on day of admission to the ICU, showed a
unilateral opacification of unclear significance -possibly
artifact- and the radiology read noted only bilateral
interstitial opacities but no focal pneumonia. Repeat CXR did
not show unilateral opacification.  He was transferred to the
floor on [**1-2**] but continued to have severe dyspnea with almost
any activity.  This was improved somewhat by ensuring good
cardiac rate control.  On [**1-5**] pulmonary recommended adding
BIPAP while on the floor - this was begun and the patient
reported this provided some relief.

# Chest discomfort: In [**Name (NI) **] pt had chest tightness and T Wave
inversions on repeat ECG, at similar heart rate to prior ECG.
An acute coronary syndrome was ruled out with enzymes.
.
# AF/MAT: Chronic, managed with diltiazem, dysopyrimide,
digoxin.  Periodically he went into Afib or MAT with RVR.  Given
his COPD and allergy to amiodarone, neither lopressor nor
amiodarone were attempted, but he responded in the ICU to 250cc
fluid bolus, and on the floor he responded to an increase in
digoxin dosing.  His digoxin and diltiazem dosing was adjusted
so as to be optimized.

# Leukocytosis: Persistently high, also with thrombocytosis.
Presumed to be [**3-6**] steroids, and has been at this level since
[**3-/2139**] so no further workup was persued
.
# H/o HIT: Avoided all heparin products
